1
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,480
Who are you?

2
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,920
Where am I?

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,520
Why am I here?

4
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,960
My duty is to guide spirits

5
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
to the afterlife.

6
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,960
The afterlife?

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,240
You’re

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
a Grim Reaper?

9
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,080
You’re not dreaming.

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,680
Stop.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,640
How can a spirit even feel pain?

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,160
No. I’m not dead.

13
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
- You’re dead.
- I’m not.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,640
I’m not dead.

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,400
- You’re dead.
- No.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,520
I’m not dead.

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
Someone! Anyone!

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,880
- Help!
- Stop!

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
Sit down.

20
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
You just died,

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
it’s hard to adjust. I understand.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,560
Here’s the thing, there’s a simple way
to prove you’re really dead.

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,960
How?

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
You just…

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,640
willingly accept it.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
And say

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,120
"I’m ready."

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,240
Go on, try it.

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,600
"I’m ready."

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm rea…

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,520
What if I don’t say it?

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Then you’ll be trapped in this realm.

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,160
And be what people call

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,400
a wandering spirit.

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,240
So if I don’t say it,

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,320
you can’t take me to the afterlife.

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240
Am I right?

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
Actually,

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
if this were a movie,

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,520
I’d be slipping back
into my body right now.

41
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,080
What’s done

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
can never be undone.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,040
No.

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Maybe I can go back.

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,280
If I don’t say it,

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,600
you can’t take me anywhere.

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Humans

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
have a saying,

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,640
"You only shed tears
when death comes to you."

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,840
This is the realm beyond time.

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,160
When one’s time runs out,
they must come here.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,840
That means your time…

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,440
is over.

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,800
My duty is to guide spirits
to the afterlife.

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,640
ONE MONTH AGO

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,840
We can buy it later, dear.
Don’t waste time.

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Alice.

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Don’t run.

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,360
No running in the station. Walk properly.

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,560
Just walk fast.

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,320
In a few days, the car will be fixed.

62
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
And you can review your vocab
in comfort again, okay?

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Here.

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,400
Take this.

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,960
Alice.

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,440
You'd better be number one
in the class on this exam.

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
Because that will give you a better chance
to get into medical school.

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
If…

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
I rank number one,

70
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,520
can I learn to play the keyboard?

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
Yes.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
But if you don’t rank number one,

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,240
forget about music completely
until you pass the medical exams.

74
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
If your father knew you were being lazy

75
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
and careless like this,
he’d be so disappointed.

76
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
- Excuse me, Auntie.
- Have you seen my wallet?

77
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,960
- You just…
- What’s this?

78
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
- You picked it up earlier, I saw you.
- A brown wallet.

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,000
- You picked up my wallet.
- My wallet.

80
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,240
- Can I… can I see?
- Can I check inside?

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,720
- What is it?
- Can I see?

82
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,240
- Maybe you dropped it?
- Please, let me see.

83
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
- Here.
- My wallet.

84
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
- It's not here. Go.
- Can I see?

85
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
- Okay, fine, bye!
- Go away.

86
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
Ugh.

87
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Hey.

88
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
Sorry, excuse me, sir.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,480
This is a priority seat.

90
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,360
Maybe you should let her sit here instead.

91
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
Oh, sorry.

92
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,640
- Please, go ahead. I’m sorry.
- Please, have a seat.

93
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,800
Thank you.

94
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
If you want to be a doctor,
you have to memorize English terms, okay?

95
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,840
It detects smell.

96
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
- Next.
- Optic nerve.

97
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,840
It detects vision.

98
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,800
Next.

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
CERTIFICATE

100
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,640
Okay, we reviewed them all. Now,

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,600
here’s the exercise. The question is

102
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,320
"Where is

103
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
a spinal tap performed?"

104
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,760
Pick one from these options.

105
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,919
We just went over that.

106
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,800
<i>From this night on</i>

107
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,160
<i>There’s only us under the lights</i>

108
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,760
<i>As if time itself has stopped</i>

109
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,040
<i>So I can remember</i>
<i>Your face before it’s gone</i>

110
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,960
<i>Alice. Alice.</i>

111
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Alice.

112
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
- Alice, over here.
- Excuse me.

113
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,480
Sorry for pulling you out,

114
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
but we’re about to be late.

115
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,080
Late?

116
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
You're right.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,320
- Only 15 minutes left.
- Hey, don’t.

118
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
No running on the platform.

119
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,960
Just walk.

120
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,040
- Wait, Alice.
- Hey, Punn. Wait up.

121
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,600
- Hey, Punn. Wait.
- Tuck your shirt in.

122
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
Please don't close the gate yet.

123
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,000
Punn, you snake.

124
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,360
- Ouch.
- Take this.

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,600
You left us to deal with her mom,
the queen boss.

126
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,440
- She almost followed us onto the train.
- Yeah.

127
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,920
- How could you leave us there?
- Wait.

128
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,920
You two…

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,440
- You were--
- Uh, Punn told us to do it.

130
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,600
We didn’t mean to do it.

131
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,000
- Yeah! Punn made us do it. He said so.
- Hey, hey, stop.

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
I’ll buy you snacks, okay?

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,560
Whatever you want, my treat.

134
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,480
- Okay?
- Well…

135
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,720
Hey.

136
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,120
- Time for school assembly.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,880
- What? Wait.
- Let's go or we'll be late.

138
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Hey.

139
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,800
<i>Stop thinking about playing music</i>
<i>until you get into med school.</i>

00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,520
Are you okay?

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,120
I’m fine. Thank you.

144
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,960
Anyway,

145
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,000
thank you. I’ll get going now.

146
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,720
Hey, wanna come see me practice?

147
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,400
In case you don’t wanna go home yet.

148
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,000
It’s okay.

149
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080

- Or I’ll just keep it.
- Punn.

157
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,720
Give it back.

Whoa.

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,360
Want a bite?

161
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,520
Sure.

Nuh-uh.

164
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
Huh?

165
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,000
Please give me that notebook back,
I’ve been looking for it.

166
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,680
Why are you here, Alice?

167
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
Can I return it later?

168
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,400
We’ve got band practice now.

169
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,760
Right, guys?

170
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,040
Yeah.

171
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,040
Just give it back and that’ll be it.

172
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,760
We pay to rent this studio, you know.

173
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
You’re kind of wasting our time here.

174
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
Right?

175
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,480
Yeah.

176
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,960
How about you ask for it back
when we’re done?

177
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,920
Fine, whatever.

178
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,280
Then

179
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
you can sit over there and watch us play,

180
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
on the couch.

181
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,560
You didn’t bring her here
just to watch, right?

182
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,760
She’s the missing piece of our band.

183
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
That important?

184
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,840
We’ll see about that.

185
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,720
- Let’s go, let’s practice.
- Go.

186
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,120
- Everyone, take your spots.
- Come on.

187
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,880
<i>I know it’s risky, but I have to try</i>

188
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,680
<i>I know it’s hard to reach what’s high</i>

189
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,160
<i>Still, I’ll give it</i>

190
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,240
<i>A shot</i>

191
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,360
<i>I know we’re worlds apart</i>

192
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,280
<i>I know you’re far, high above the stars</i>

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,640
<i>Everyone says it’s impossible</i>

194
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,360
<i>But love commands me</i>

195
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,680
<i>To climb up there</i>

196
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,960
<i>Since I was born to meet you</i>

197
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,600
<i>No matter what, I’ll try someday</i>

198
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,520
Can you sing that part again?

199
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,840
Am I bothering you guys?

200
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,320
No, no. One more time, please?

201
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Sing together.

202
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,320
<i>Since I was born to meet you</i>

203
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,520
- Hey.
- Damn.

204
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,760
- That’s it.
- Exactly.

205
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,200
Join our band.

206
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,400
The band is so stiff with all guys.

207
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,760
If we had you, Alice,
the group would be perfect.

208
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,040
But

209
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,680
you saw my mom this morning.

210
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
So you know what she’s like.

211
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,080
She’d never let me join you guys.

212
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Hey, leave!

213
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
Go!

214
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Are you kicking me out?

215
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Uh.

216
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
It was a bug.

217
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,200
It's gone, right?

218
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,119
Yes.

219
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,280
The coffee flavor you like is sold out.

220
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,160
Usually around lunch,
there’s live music here.

221
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,680
Eating now might not be as good
without it.

222
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,680
Hey, Alice, you wanna dance with us?

223
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,280
No way. She’s not the dancing type.
She’s probably off tutoring somewhere.

224
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,080
You're going to study?

225
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,080
Yeah.

226
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm only halfway through.

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Still stuck on that one part.

228
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,360
Yeah.

229
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,960
I’ll finish it at home later.

230
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Let's go.

231
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,920
- One song.
- Just one.

232
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,840
Sure.

233
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
<i>"Khon Tee Took Rak,"</i> the one who's loved.

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,840
Okay.

235
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,280
<i>I want to be the one who's</i>

236
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,400
<i>- Loved</i>
<i>- Loved</i>

237
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,000
<i>I want to be the one</i>

238
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,960
<i>Someone truly understands</i>

239
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,200
<i>To fill the emptiness inside</i>

240
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,480
<i>To bring me love</i>

241
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,120
<i>Please</i>

242
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,760
<i>Let there be someone</i>

243
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,360
<i>Just one</i>

244
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,280
Yeah.

245
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,640
THE THINGS I MUST FACE

246
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,040
THE THINGS I MUST ENDURE

247
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,960
- One more time. One more.
- Again, again.

248
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,720
<i>I want to be the one who’s loved</i>

249
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>I want to be the one</i>
<i>Someone truly understands</i>

250
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,760
<i>To fill the emptiness inside</i>

251
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,880
<i>To bring me love</i>

252
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,640
<i>Please</i>

253
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,680
<i>I want to be the one who’s loved</i>

254
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,080
<i>I want to be the one</i>
<i>Someone truly understands</i>

255
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,640
- <i>To fill the emptiness inside…</i>
- Is that is?

256
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,880
- I don't know.
<i>- Someone to love me</i>

257
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,000
<i>- Please</i>
<i>- Is there anyone?</i>

258
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,400
Be right back.

259
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
Okay.

260
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,360
Why does my throat hurt?

261
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,400
Am I losing my voice?

262
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
"The things I must face."

263
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,840
"The things I must endure."

264
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,040
"The darkness that devours my heart."

265
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,800
Sorry I read it without asking.

266
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,640
But I think if you turned it
into a full song,

267
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,480
it would be amazing.

268
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,200
Our band still needs a songwriter.

269
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,280
If you helped us,

270
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,080
we’d have something really powerful,

271
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,360
really good.

272
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,960
No.

273
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,200
Afraid your mom won’t let you?

274
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,280
My parents want me to be a doctor.

275
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,800
I don’t want to disappoint them.

276
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,040
But why can’t you

277
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,000
excel at both things at the same time,

278
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,840
study and sing?

279
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,280
Do it now, while you’re still in your BBE.

280
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,920
- BBE?
- Yes.

281
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,040
Look.

282
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,480
The time when things still taste good

283
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,640
before they expire.

284
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,760
We never know when life will expire.

285
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,200
If it ends tomorrow,

286
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,720
and you don’t do it today,
that chance is gone forever.

287
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,920
I get what you’re saying, but

288
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,040
my mom won’t allow it.

289
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,200
It’s not like I have that kind of freedom.

290
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,360
Freedom lives in your heart.

291
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,560
No one can decide it for you.

292
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,560
If you really fight for it,

293
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,000
I believe your mom will understand.

294
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
Sounds easy when you say it.

295
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,200
It is that easy.

296
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,240
You’re lucky, Punn.

297
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,440
You’re smart, always in the top ten

298
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,960
without studying.

299
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,160
Your parents are doctors.

300
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,080
Looks like

301
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,920
you don’t even have to try.

302
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,120
Not like me.

303
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,560
I have to fight with everything I’ve got.

304
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,520
In your eyes,

305
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,720
I probably look like someone
who has everything easy, right?

306
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I’m sorry

307
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,120
for interfering in your life
without understanding anything at all.

308
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,560
Here, take it back.

309
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,600
Wait. What I meant was…

310
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,400
Show me your grades.

311
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,320
Now.

312
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,000
And do you realize what time it is?

313
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,520
You’re home late again.

314
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,760
What’s wrong with you?

315
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,320
Give it here.

316
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,440
Hurry up.

317
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,800
See?

318
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,440
This is why I told you not to do music.

319
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,440
Didn’t you promise your father
you’d focus on studying?

320
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,600
Get inside.

321
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,360
We need to talk.

322
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,560
Get inside.

323
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,040
Think carefully about why
you didn’t make it to the top ten?

324
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,080
How many times have I told you
to stop reading these?

325
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,120
FALLEN HEAVEN

326
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,920
It’s a waste of time. Useless.

327
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,440
Three screens, four screens all at once.
No wonder you can’t concentrate.

328
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,880
Listen later. Finish studying first.

329
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,800
Mom.

330
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,800
Can I have my phone, please?

331
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Why?

332
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,040
Since when do you need a phone to study?

333
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
Finish your book first.

334
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,680
LACTASOY

335
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,640
<i>Next station, Saphan Khwai.</i>

336
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
<i>Next station, Saphan Khwai.</i>

337
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,240
Punn, I’m sorry.

338
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,560
I’m sorry

339
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,560
for what I said.

340
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,640
Punn,
I’m sorry for how I spoke to you that day.

PRICE LIST

342
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,920
Punn, I’m really sorry

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,960
for what I said to you.

344
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,280
I’m sorry… So sorry.

345
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,240
Sor… sorry.

346
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm sorry.

347
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
Come to watch us practice?

348
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,880
You’re a bit late.

349
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,680
Hey.

350
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
There’s a concert square at Siam today.

351
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,200
Wanna go?

352
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,440
Come on, let’s go.

353
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
Let's go.

354
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,360
You didn't wait for us.

355
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Look.

356
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,360
This band’s insane.

357
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,480
Not bad.

358
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,280
<i>Don’t be mad at me</i>

359
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,760
<i>Forgive me if I was wrong</i>

360
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,960
<i>Don’t blame me</i>

361
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,920
<i>I just wanted you to understand</i>

362
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
<i>Please tell me what you need</i>

363
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,400
<i>Tell me, I’ll give you everything</i>

364
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
<i>Please tell me</i>

365
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,200
<i>Please tell me</i>

366
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,600
<i>Please tell me</i>

367
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,280
<i>But don’t nag me too much</i>

368
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,560
<i>You’ll drive me crazy</i>
<i>A small thing could turn into a big fight</i>

369
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,680
<i>Maybe sweet talk would sound better?</i>

370
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,320
<i>That’d be cute</i>
<i>But if it’s nagging, I’ll walk away</i>

371
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,080
<i>Don’t nag me too much</i>

372
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,160
<i>You’ll drive me crazy</i>
<i>A small thing could turn into a big fight</i>

373
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,280
<i>Maybe sweet talk would sound better?</i>

374
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,160
<i>That’d be cute</i>
<i>But if it’s nagging, I’ll walk away</i>

375
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,600
Punn’s gone.

376
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Here.

377
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
Look.

378
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,440
My mom will definitely never allow it.

379
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,120
But we really want you in the band.

380
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,440
Punn would be so happy

381
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,120
if you joined our band.

382
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,960
PIANO KEYBOARD

383
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,120
<i>I know it’s risky, but I have to try</i>

384
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,120
<i>I know it’s hard to reach what’s high</i>

385
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,200
<i>Still, I’ll give it a shot</i>

386
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,640
<i>I know we’re worlds apart</i>

387
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,040
<i>I know you’re far, high above the stars</i>

388
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,440
<i>Everyone says</i>

389
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>It’s impossible</i>

390
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,280
<i>But love commands me</i>

391
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,920
<i>To climb up there</i>

392
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,800
<i>Since I was born to meet you</i>

393
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,120
<i>No matter what, I’ll try someday</i>

394
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,480
<i>To love is to risk</i>

395
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,280
<i>I don’t want you to be just a dream</i>

396
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,880
<i>No matter how hard it gets</i>

397
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,440
<i>No matter how struggling it is</i>
<i>It’s worth it</i>

398
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,640
<i>It's better than letting you go</i>

399
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,160
<i>I’ve fallen for you</i>

400
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,840
<i>Because it’s true love</i>
<i>And I hope you don't mind</i>

401
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Rock and Soul.

402
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,080
We’re recruiting new members.

403
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,480
Come sign up.

404
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
Yeah.

405
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,160
- Come on, step right up.
- Alice. Alice.

406
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,640
- Come sign up! Hurry!
- Sign up today and get one free.

407
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,440
Come on, come on, join us.

408
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,360
Hurry, fill out the form.

409
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,360
Auditions are in three days.

410
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,520
- Alice, are you signing up too?
- Sit here. Come on.

411
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
Come on. Uh--

412
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
- Oh?
- She’s not signing up.

413
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,040
If she passes auditions,
we’ll have to practice every day.

414
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,400
That’ll waste time for studying.

415
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,080
If you don’t think you can do it,

416
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,320
then don’t sign up.

417
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,320
Don’t waste our time.

418
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,600
What do we do?

419
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Let's do this.

420
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,120
Easy. Take it back.

421
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
- Don't listen to him.
- Hey.

422
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Fill it in.

423
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,639
I’m Nana. I’m interested in playing bass.

424
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,199
I’m the first applicant, right?

425
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,000
Yes. Write your name down here.
Sit here, come on.

426
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,960
Okay, pen, where’s the pen?

427
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,719
Alright.

428
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,120
- Join Rock and Soul.
- Hurry!

429
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,440
- Open positions here.
- Step right up.

430
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,600
- I'd like to sign up.
- Sure, sure.

431
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,520
- The form. Hey, Bombay, pass me a sheet.
- Come on.

432
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,800
Please give me an application form.

433
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,880
Will playing music waste your time?

434
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll probably expire in three days.

435
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,600
I want to live my best life

436
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,600
in the Best Before End period.

437
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,239
Are you sure?

438
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,920
Well, someone once told me,

439
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,880
whether life is free or not

440
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,440
depends on me, not anyone else.

441
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,080
<i>The last one.</i>

442
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,400
<i>Alice.</i>

443
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,560
<i>But love commands me</i>

444
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,160
<i>To climb up there</i>

445
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,880
<i>Since I was born to meet you</i>

446
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,520
Get down here.

447
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,480
I sent you to study, not to lie to me.

448
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,840
Why are you wasting time
on this ridiculous music stuff?

449
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,800
Mom, please calm down.

450
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,840
Alice didn’t mean to join us.
I was the one who asked her to.

451
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,200
Don’t call me "Mom."
Why are you meddling in her life?

452
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,040
- Well…
- Go home.

453
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,880
- I won't.
- Please calm down.

454
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,640
Stay out of this. You’re the reason

455
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,240
my daughter’s lost her way.
Stay away from her.

456
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,560
- Go home.
- Mom, let me go!

457
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,560
Alice, come back here now. Alice!

458
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,920
Alice!

459
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,760
- What now?
- Dunno.

460
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,080
What a waste of time.

461
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,320
Alice.

462
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,480
Alice.

463
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,640
Alice!

464
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,880
Alice.

465
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,920
Where is she?

466
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,320
Alice.

467
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,400
SWIPE TO UNLOCK

468
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,440
- Have some snacks, dear.
- Stay focused.

469
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,280
Dear.

470
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,320
I told you, no flour or sugar.

471
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,600
Focus on foods rich in omega-three,
like ginkgo.

472
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
Whether our daughter’s future

473
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,160
will be good or bad,
depends on how we take care of her.

474
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,800
I don’t want her to
miss her chance to take the exam.

475
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,600
She won’t get opportunities
like other kids.

476
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>Do you want her to live</i>
<i>a hard life like we did?</i>

477
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,120
SWIPE TO UNLOCK

478
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,240
MOM

479
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,760
<i>Do you know what time is it? Get home now.</i>

480
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,440
If I go home, will you let me play music?

481
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,880
<i>Alice.</i>

482
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,640
Stop wasting time on this nonsense.

483
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,560
Why is it that everything I love,
everything I want to do

484
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,640
never matters to you?

485
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,400
Because I want you to have the bright
future your father planned for you.

486
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,960
<i>Don’t forget</i>

487
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,920
<i>he worked so hard,</i>
<i>saved every baht so you could study.</i>

488
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,000
<i>You’ll get to be a doctor.</i>
<i>Even if he’s not here anymore.</i>

489
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,120
<i>Are you going to throw away everything</i>
<i>he sacrificed for some silly hobby?</i>

490
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,040
Dad did it for himself.

491
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
He forced me to go to medical school

492
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,480
because he couldn’t. He could only
be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

493
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,400
You and Dad pushed your dreams onto me.

494
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,880
And I accepted that.

495
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,000
I just asked
if I could play music along the way,

496
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,880
why couldn't you let me?

497
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,720
I just want to play music
and study at the same time.

498
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,080
Why can’t you just let me?

499
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,840
<i>You can't do it.</i>

500
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I pushed you hard,
but you still couldn’t reach a 3.8 GPA.

501
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,040
<i>If you try to juggle both,</i>
<i>you’ll never get into med school.</i>

502
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Can you please give me a chance?

503
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,560
Just one chance to prove myself.

504
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
Can you give it to me, Mom?

505
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,160
<i>Accept it. It’s impossible.</i>

506
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,560
Stop being foolish. I’m exhausted.

507
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,120
Then maybe,

508
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,640
if you didn’t have me,

509
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,760
you wouldn’t be so tired. Right?

510
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,920
Am I

511
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
really dead?

512
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,360
Your time has ended.

513
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
Accept it, and come with me.

514
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
Can you give me some time?

515
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,280
You said

516
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,600
those whose time has ended must come here.

517
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,960
That means you control the time of life.

518
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,680
Can you give me another chance?

519
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,720
I still want to be a musician.

520
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,760
I still want to pass med school for Mom.

521
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,960
There’s still so much I want to do.

522
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,600
Alice,

523
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,600
don’t resist.

524
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,360
Once time moves forward,

525
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,520
it can never go back.

526
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,120
Accept it.

527
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,080
No.

528
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,840
I won’t accept it.

529
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,240
I have to go back.

530
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,040
I will become a musician.

531
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,600
I will become a doctor.

532
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,760
I’m not ready to leave yet!

533
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,680
<i>From now on,</i>

534
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,520
<i>I won't let anyone take away my hope,</i>

535
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,400
<i>my dreams, or the life I want to live</i>

536
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,040
ever again.

537
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,440
<i>When you refuse to let Alice go,</i>

538
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,120
<i>look what happens to your body</i>
<i>in the living world.</i>

539
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,840
Hey! What are you doing?

540
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,360
Get out!

541
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,400
Your time has already ended.

542
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,600
<i>For Alice to keep living,</i>

543
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,600
<i>a life must be exchanged.</i>
