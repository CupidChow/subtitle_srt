1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,520
Are you ready?

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,920
Always.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,440
Whatever happens, happens.

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,240
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>Bass! No, Bass!</i>

6
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,640
Bass! Bass!

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
Exchange your life for hers,

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,320
<i>so you can take my place on this train.</i>

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,400
- Hey, guys, look at this!
- What is it?

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,960
- What?
- He replied.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,360
Wait, what? Let me see.

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,160
No way, seriously?

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
What is it?

14
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,160
Uh, you're…

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,960
Hi, guys.

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,280
- Hello.
- I've been following you

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,280
on social media.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,040
I really like how you play.

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,920
I'd like to invite your band
to perform at my concert.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,080
Would you be interested?

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, absolutely.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,320
- Of course.
- Are you serious?

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
Yes.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,880
So, what should we prepare?

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,680
Yeah, what do we need to do?

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,520
We're preparing
for a big concert right now.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,320
It'll probably take
about three to four months

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,520
before the real show.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Don't worry.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,040
You've got time. Can I get your number?

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,800
- You go.
- Take mine.

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,000
- Alright.
- Here you go.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,360
"I've got the concert date confirmed."

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,640
"Please block the rehearsal days
I sent earlier."

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
"The venue and time

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,920
will be confirmed soon."

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
That means we should celebrate!

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
- Let's celebrate!
- Celebrate, hell yeah!

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,480
So, are we going to play Alice's song?

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,120
- Of course.
- What do you say, Alice?

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
Alice?

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,760
Uh.

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,800
- She was just here a minute ago.
- Oh.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,360
Maybe we got too excited?

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,160
I'll go find her.

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,120
Do you know where she went?

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Alice.

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,240
So many things have happened to us, right?

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,480
But I kind of regret

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
that I only just made up with Mom,

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,880
just got real friends,

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
and just got to play music again.

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Guess my time's almost up.

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
That's exactly

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,880
why we should make the most of it, Alice.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
Come on.

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,160
- Where to?
- Just come with me.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,160
Excuse me,
please don't run in the hospital.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,520
- Can you just keep playing?
- Sure.

60
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,040
I think that verse…

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
Mhm.

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Let's try this. Let's say

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
if I do this…

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Mm.

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,080
<i>Even if this is the last time</i>

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,360
<i>Before my dreams all fade away</i>

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,480
<i>Please hold my hand</i>

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,400
<i>Be the one</i>

69
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,880
<i>Who pulls me free</i>

70
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,160
<i>From this nightmare</i>

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,680
<i>I'm trapped inside</i>

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
<i>The things I must face</i>

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,400
<i>The things I must endure</i>

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,680
<i>The darkness that devours my heart</i>

75
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,400
<i>How do I run?</i>

76
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,240
<i>Which way to go when there's no light?</i>

77
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
Hey.

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,040
That actually works.

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
Once I played it, it just clicked.

80
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
Yeah, I felt that too.

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,160
When it was only lyrics,
I couldn't picture it.

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,080
But when you sang,

83
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
wow, it's perfect.

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,040
- Mm.
- So how can I finish writing it?

85
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,040
I think

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
maybe you haven't finished it

87
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,760
because you've been too hard on yourself.

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
Try to relax a bit.

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Once you loosen up,

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,640
- the rest will come naturally.
- Wow.

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,680
That's easy for you to say.

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,400
If it were me, I'd be stuck too.

93
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,600
Maybe you should take Alice out to relax.

94
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
This is already relaxing,
being with you guys.

95
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,920
Look.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
Just take a break for a bit.

97
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,240
If you're stuck,
go walk around Chula Park,

98
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
enjoy the trees and the birds.

99
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,120
Then keep writing there.

100
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,720
We'll wait here for the rest of the song.

101
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,440
You've got two hours to finish it.
That's your deadline.

102
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,560
Well, what are you waiting for?

103
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
- Go.
- Give it to me.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
- Come on.
- Okay.

105
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,400
Let's go, Alice.

106
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,960
Alice, look. The sky's so beautiful.

107
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,120
Yeah, it really is.

108
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
It's nice coming here.

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
I probably won't get to come again.

110
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,400
Every time I walk here,

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll walk here

112
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,160
like you're still with me,

113
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,800
- like you're still right beside me.
- Stop.

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,800
Enough. I can't listen anymore.

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,680
Why? It's true.

116
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Even if we haven't
been together that long,

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,360
it feels like forever, Alice.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
Yeah.

119
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,640
It really does.

120
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,800
For me,

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,920
no matter what happens,

122
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,240
I'll always feel the same about you.

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
Feel what?

124
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,679
Feel…

125
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,240
love.

126
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,480
Alice.

127
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh wow, you could write it now?

128
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
Hm.

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,280
But I didn't bring my guitar.
Should I go back and get it?

130
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,240
No need.

131
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,840
It's almost done. But…

132
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,120
I can't figure out the last verse.

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,520
The last verse?

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,360
I got it.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,520
- You got it?
- Mm.

136
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
- What is it?
- Don't peek.

137
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,880
- I can't look?
- No.

138
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
Give it to me.

139
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,320
Done.

140
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
- I…
- Stop.

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,680
- No peeking. Close it.
- Okay, okay.

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Hm?

143
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
Oh.

144
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,400
Hey, it's been over two hours.

145
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
- Oh yeah…
- Shall we head back?

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Mm.

147
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Punn.

148
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,120
- Yeah?
- Well…

149
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
I just wanted to say

150
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,760
thank you for everything.

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,520
Thanks for always supporting me,
for always caring.

152
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
It's okay, Alice.

153
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,680
I should be the one thanking you.

154
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,360
Thank you for letting me find happiness

155
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,040
in doing all this for you.

156
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Mm.

157
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go.

158
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,920
<i>Even if this is the last time</i>

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,280
<i>Before my dreams all fade away</i>

160
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,880
<i>Please hold my hand</i>

161
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,840
<i>Be the one to pull me through</i>

162
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,280
<i>On this final journey</i>

163
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,960
<i>So those dreams won't fade away</i>

164
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,560
<i>Hold my hand tight</i>

165
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,720
<i>Until we reach our dream</i>
<i>Until we finally make it there</i>

166
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,800
<i>Until we're out of this nightmare</i>

167
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,960
- That's fire.
- Whoa.

168
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
- So fire.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
Alright, everyone.

170
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,080
Let me name this song.

171
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,920
I'll name it…

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Wow.

173
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,040
It's the last nightmare.

174
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,280
From now on,
there'll only be good dreams, Alice.

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,080
So cheesy. Oh my god.

176
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey.

177
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
Hey, that means we finally
have our own official band song.

178
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,520
Let's go!

179
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Alice.

180
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
I was looking for you.

181
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,200
Hey, we're going out to eat.

182
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
Mm.

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh…

184
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,440
Are you okay?

185
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,320
Yeah, I'm fine.

186
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
You guys go ahead.

187
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
I think I'll go see my mom.

188
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,000
There's not much time left.

189
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,280
Then come back

190
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,680
when you're done, okay?

191
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,400
Mm.

192
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,400
Go ahead.

193
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,360
Mom, what's wrong?

194
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,880
Why are you lying here?

195
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,760
Mom. Mom.

196
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,480
Alice?

197
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Alice.

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,480
Alice.

199
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,720
Alice.

200
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,560
Alice.

201
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,600
Come stay home sometime, okay, sweetie?

202
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,600
<i>Even if this is the last time</i>

203
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,120
<i>Before my dreams all fade away</i>

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,360
<i>Please hold my hand</i>

205
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,920
<i>Be the one who pulls me free</i>

206
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,120
<i>From this nightmare</i>

207
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
<i>I'm trapped inside</i>

208
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,280
Hey, Punn.

209
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,680
Is Alice here yet?

210
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Yeah.

211
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,720
Hey, Alice.

212
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
Hey. Hello.

213
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,080
How are you?

214
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,520
Today's the last day, isn't it?

215
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,960
<i>Even if this is the last time</i>

216
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,320
<i>Before my dreams all fade away</i>

217
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,040
<i>Please hold my hand</i>

218
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>Be the one to pull me through</i>

219
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>On this final journey</i>

220
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,720
<i>So those dreams won't fade away</i>

221
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,960
Alice!

222
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,840
Alice's gone.

223
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,440
Alice.

224
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,920
How is she doing?

225
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,720
Her condition's worsening.

226
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,920
She's been declining rapidly.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,680
The hospital already called her mother.

228
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,080
She should be on her way.

229
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Has there been no improvement at all?

230
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Please excuse me.

231
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,280
Alice.

232
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,040
I thought you'd come back.

233
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,200
Where did you go, Alice?

234
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,440
Are you really not coming back this time?

235
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
Why did he make that offer?

236
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,240
Why?

237
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
Where would she go?

238
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,040
Alice.

239
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
Alice, are you there?

240
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Alice.

241
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
Can you hear me?

242
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,160
Alice.

243
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,800
Punn.

244
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,800
Aren't you eating?

245
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,880
Eat up.

246
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
Yeah.

247
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,440
Um, and…

248
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,160
Good evening, ma'am.

249
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Hello.

250
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,880
Thank you for visiting Alice so often.

251
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,000
It's no problem.

252
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,800
Actually,

253
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,000
I feel so guilty.

254
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,520
I never imagined
I'd have so little time with her.

255
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,080
If I had another chance,

256
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,560
I'd be the best mother I could be.

257
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,080
I'd listen more.

258
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,400
I'd try harder to understand her.

259
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,080
I'd care more about her feelings.

260
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,040
But before this…

261
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,440
I was a terrible mother.

262
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,560
I only ever thought about myself.

263
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,440
I forced her to do
what she didn't want to.

264
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,120
And I didn't even know
if she really wanted to be a doctor.

265
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,160
It broke my heart.

266
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,280
I'm so sorry, my girl.

267
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,560
Ma'am.

268
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
Not sure if you'll believe me,

269
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,400
but I had a chance to see Alice.

270
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
What do you mean?

271
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,040
Alice told me

272
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,600
she knows how much you love her.

273
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,760
If she could come back,

274
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,040
she'd do everything for you.

275
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,720
Whatever you wanted,
she said she'd give her very best.

276
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,760
Excuse me.

277
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,800
Ma'am.

278
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,760
Her vitals are dropping fast.

279
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,760
She…

280
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,360
might not make it through tonight.

281
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,160
You can stay with her tonight.

282
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,600
I'll have the doctor
check on her again soon.

283
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,280
Excuse me.

284
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,520
Please stay with me, dear.

285
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,480
Fight for me.

286
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,600
Punn.

287
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,000
You can be alone with her.

288
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Please excuse me.

289
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,360
You broke our promise, didn't you?

290
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,440
You lied to me?

291
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,520
<i>If I ever get another chance to come back,</i>

292
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,160
<i>I'll tell you later.</i>

293
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,520
SCALA SHARK FIN

294
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,880
<i>Thank you for everything, Punn.</i>

295
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,360
<i>Because you said you loved me,</i>

296
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,840
<i>I finished the song right away.</i>

297
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,200
Hey, anyone texted Punn yet?

298
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,600
He's not here yet.

299
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,960
I texted him. I told him, "See you soon."

300
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,640
Are you crazy, Bombay? You know
Punn's never the irresponsible type.

301
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,880
- Mm.
- Yeah, I know, but this is different.

302
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,520
This is about the heart.

303
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,640
Huh?

304
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,160
- Oh, please.
- The heart? What are you talking about?

305
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,760
Hey.

306
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Punn.

307
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,000
I thought you--

308
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,400
thought you'd be the first one here.

309
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,320
We've been waiting.

310
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,480
- Yes.
- Mm.

311
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,720
Last night, I was so excited,
I couldn't even sleep.

312
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Let's go. Are you ready?

313
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,920
- Hell yeah.
- Ready.

314
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,440
- Can we do a cheer before we go on?
- A cheer?

315
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,840
- Of course, it's our big stage.
- Yeah, yeah.

316
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,960
- Come on.
- Alright.

317
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,880
Follow my lead.

318
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
- Mm.
- Say it.

319
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,640
One more.

320
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,760
Let's go!

321
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,880
- Come on, everyone.
- Go.

322
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
- Go.
- Let's go.

323
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,120
Nurse.

324
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,040
Yes?

325
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,280
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
The monitor…

327
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,640
Doctor.

328
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,040
Alice…

329
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,000
Alice, sweetie. Alice.

330
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,440
Alice.

331
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,640
I'm so sorry. She's gone.

332
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,360
We'll give you some time alone with her.

333
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,400
- Doctor…
- I'm sorry.

334
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,480
It's 9:13 p.m.

335
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,760
Yes.

336
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,760
Why, dear?

337
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,640
Thank you…

338
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Alice?

339
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,840
Alice.

340
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,160
You're awake.

341
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,520
Nurse!

342
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,280
She's awake!

343
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,160
Excuse me. Sorry.

344
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,400
<i>The things I must face</i>

345
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
<i>The things I must endure</i>

346
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,440
<i>The darkness that devours my heart</i>

347
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,160
<i>How do I run?</i>

348
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,000
<i>Which way to go when there's no light?</i>

349
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,000
<i>Please let me in</i>

350
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,040
<i>Into your heart</i>

351
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,560
<i>So I can find that darkness inside</i>

352
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,720
<i>And I'll lead you out</i>

353
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,120
<i>Even if this is the last time</i>

354
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,840
<i>Before my dreams all fade away</i>

355
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,640
<i>Please hold my hand</i>

356
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,480
<i>Be the one</i>

357
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,880
<i>Who pulls me free</i>

358
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,520
<i>From this nightmare I'm trapped inside</i>

359
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,440
<i>As long as you're here with me</i>

360
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,280
<i>Every single second</i>

361
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,240
<i>Leads me closer to the dream I've drawn</i>

362
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,840
<i>I'll keep moving on</i>

363
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,400
<i>Even if this is the last time</i>

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,680
<i>On this final journey</i>

374
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,640
<i>So those dreams won't fade away</i>

375
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,640
<i>Hold my hand tight</i>

376
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,680
<i>Until we reach our dream</i>

377
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
<i>Until we finally make it there</i>

378
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,680
<i>Until we're out of this nightmare</i>

379
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,720
FIGHTING

380
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
I remember you liked this flavor.
Here, take it.

381
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
You eat it.

382
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,680
Choo-choo!

383
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,520
Who likes this flavor?

384
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,880
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

385
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Clink!

386
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,440
Hey, guys, look at this!
Our video on my channel.

387
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,040
The views are insane.

388
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,080
Wow.

389
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,320
Check the comments. "The guitarist
is so handsome, drop his link!"

390
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,120
Hey, you have no idea.

391
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,480
It's the drummer, that's why it blew up.

392
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,480
- No way, no way.
- Guys, stop arguing.

393
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,320
- It's because of me.
- Oh.

394
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,560
- Nonsense.
- Hey, big news! Big news!

395
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,720
What now?

396
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,000
We've just been contacted

397
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,680
- by a record label.
- What?!

398
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,240
- Let me see.
- What does it say?

399
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,760
Wow, is it that easy?

400
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,280
Hey, not that easy.

401
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Do you know how hard
we worked on that song?

402
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,280
We deserve a break at last.

403
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,840
- Yes.
- So,

404
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,560
where should we celebrate?!

405
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,320
Wait, wait.

406
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Chill.

407
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,560
Don't forget
we have the TGAT exam tomorrow.

408
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,120
Oh, please.

409
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,240
Screw the exam. We're artists now.

410
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,360
Oh.

411
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,560
Hey, anything bugging you?

412
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,440
No.

413
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,120
Nothing.

414
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,920
Snacks.

415
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
- I brought snacks.
- You really know me.

416
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,600
- Hey.
- Yeah!

417
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,720
<i>We're all working so hard these days.</i>

418
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,560
<i>And I'm not giving up either.</i>

419
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,360
<i>To get here,</i>

420
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,360
<i>I've cried so many tears.</i>

421
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,040
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>I'll live my life to the fullest,</i>

422
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,200
<i>for Mom, for myself,</i>

423
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
<i>and for the people I love.</i>

424
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,200
How is it?

425
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,720
Did you get in?

426
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,680
Chula Med School, Mom!

427
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
Oh my god, my baby. You're the best!

428
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
You're amazing.

429
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,160
You're the best.

430
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Here.

431
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,600
I have to record this.

432
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,640
Wow.

433
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Mom,

434
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
I got into Chula Med School.

435
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,640
<i>Oh, I'm so happy for you, son.</i>

436
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,040
<i>You're incredible. I'm so proud of you.</i>

437
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
I love you, Mom.

438
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,000
Please tell Dad I love him too.

439
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,560
<i>Of course, sweetheart.</i>

440
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,400
<i>But why tell me all of a sudden?</i>

441
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,600
Because I do love you.
I just wanted to say it.

442
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,800
That's all.

443
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,639
- Mom.
- Hm?

444
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll study hard.

445
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,040
I'll do my very best.

446
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,159
And I'll be a good mom,

447
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,560
under my good daughter's guidance.

448
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,639
Mom, that's a bit over the top.

449
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,239
Sweetheart, do whatever you want to do.

450
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,199
If you want to play music,
or do anything else,

451
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,199
you can do anything

452
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
that makes you happy.

453
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,560
Thank you.

454
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Come on, let's sleep.

455
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,320
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

456
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,280
Okay, now

457
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,719
let me tell you
the schedule first, everyone.

458
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
- Say it.
- So,

459
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,040
we're starting our tour soon.

460
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,240
- Damn.
- Alright?

461
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,760
- A tour?
- And, it'll start next month.

462
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,480
We'll begin with a school tour,

463
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,920
- going around different schools.
- Mm.

464
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,040
It'll take about two days a week,

465
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,520
so I wanted to ask Nana
if you can take leave from school.

466
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,480
I'm not sure.

467
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,040
I just went back to high school,
I'm still adjusting.

468
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,080
All my friends my age
are already in college.

469
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,440
Come on, hang in there.

470
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,520
You don't get your school days back
once they're gone.

471
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,040
Yeah, but…

472
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,360
just take leave. Or drop out.

473
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,120
- Hey.
- No.

474
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,840
Whoa.

475
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,360
- Just kidding.
- Then talk to your teacher first.

476
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,320
See if you can take a break.

477
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,920
If not, we'll figure out the schedule.

478
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,240
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mm.

479
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,560
- Oh yeah, one more thing.
- What?

480
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,160
From today on, I'd like

481
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
to appoint Alice as the new band leader.

482
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,480
- Hm?
- Huh?

483
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
Are you serious?

484
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,360
For real?

485
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,880
You can't. Why?

486
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,640
Well, you have great leadership skills.

487
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,160
You also wrote the band's first song,

488
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,760
and it became a big hit.

489
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,240
So, I'm officially handing
the title of Rock & Soul's leader

490
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,560
to you.

491
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
- Uh--
- Hey.

492
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
- No objections, everyone.
- Huh?

493
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,800
Fine, but only for one year.

494
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Next year, you have to take it back.

495
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,200
Uh, can I lead us next year? Please?

496
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,240
Please, I volunteer.

497
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,720
- You'll crash the band.
- Yeah.

498
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,640
What, you don't trust me?

499
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
I…

500
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,240
I can't promise.

501
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,600
Let's see how it goes first.

502
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,800
Let's continue.

503
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,040
- Alright.
- Okay.

504
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,640
So, starting next month, during the tour,

505
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,440
well, first of all,
make sure everyone's on time.

506
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
- What's up, Punn? You okay?
- What's wrong?

507
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,640
Maybe too much talking, he's sleepy.

508
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,480
- Are you alright?
- I…

509
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,240
- What?
- I think I'm just a bit tired.

510
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,200
Hm?

511
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Huh?

512
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,760
Let me take a nap.

513
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
- He's old.
- Yeah.

514
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,520
Yeah, go nap.

515
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,960
- Deep sleep.
- No waking up.

516
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,360
No running away.

517
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Whoa.

518
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,440
Get some rest.
When we're done, I'll wake you up.

519
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,960
I already gave you a chance.

520
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,560
But you chose your own path.

521
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,200
Now you must face the consequences.

522
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,560
Hm, no…

523
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,640
There must be a way to fix this.
What can I do?

524
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Fix it?

525
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Do you think getting a second chance
is that easy?

526
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,560
I don't mean it like that, but…

527
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,280
I couldn't let Alice die.

528
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,440
Haven't you ever wanted
to protect someone you love?

529
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,640
- You--
- Enough!

530
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,160
Who do you think you are

531
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,240
to talk about me like that?

532
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,600
What if I agree to trade?

533
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,680
You once told me

534
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,360
that if I trade my life

535
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,760
and become a reaper instead of you,

536
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,280
Alice will live. Right?

537
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Are you sure

538
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,040
you want to make that decision?

539
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I'm sure.

540
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,520
If it means Alice gets to live,

541
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,960
I'll do anything.

542
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,240
But…

543
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,080
can I ask one last thing?

544
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,000
What is it?

545
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Let me perform
one last concert with Alice.

546
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
Let me sing the song she wrote.

547
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,480
Can I?

548
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,840
Promise.

549
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
Promise.

550
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,000
- Wake up. It's done.
- What's wrong with him?

551
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,920
Hey, go look at Punn.
He's sleeping like a log.

552
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,120
- Punn.
