00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>From this night on</i>

2
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,240
<i>There’s only us under the lights</i>

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,240
<i>As if time itself has stopped</i>

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,920
<i>So I can remember</i>
<i>Your face before it's gone</i>

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,599
I want to live my best life

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,720
in the Best Before End period.

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
If you didn't have me,

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,600
you wouldn't be so tired. Right?

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,520
<i>I will become a musician.</i>
<i>I will become a doctor.</i>

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm not ready to leave yet!

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,280
PUSH

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,400
Please come in.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
This way.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
Where are you, Alice?

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
When will you come back?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
You have to come back.

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
I’m not ready to leave yet!

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Excuse me.

20
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,120
Excuse me.

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,880
Excuse me, can you see me?

22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Hello.

23
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you going with us?

24
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Alice, get on!

25
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,320
Where did you get the motorcycle from?

26
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
I borrowed it.

27
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,960
What? I don't believe you.

28
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,640
I really borrowed it.

29
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
It's from the smoothie shop at Siam.
I borrow it all the time.

30
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,120
I already texted them.
They'll come pick it up later.

31
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,240
Wait, hold on.

32
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Hm?

33
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
How can you even see me?

34
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,960
I'm glad I found you, Alice.

35
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
I thought I'd never see you again.

36
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>Three years ago,</i>
<i>I went to visit relatives upcountry.</i>

37
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,640
<i>One day I went out</i>
<i>for a bike ride near the house.</i>

38
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
<i>And then…</i>

39
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,360
Hey!

40
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,080
<i>How are you feeling? You're awake?</i>

41
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,040
Let me check your condition.

42
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,760
Take a deep breath.

43
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,880
Exhale.

44
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, good.

45
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,360
Yes.

46
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Please rest for now.

47
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,040
I'll come check again around noon.

48
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,560
MALE PATIENT WARD

49
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
Are you okay, sir?

50
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,200
I'll call the nurse for you.

51
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Come with me.

52
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,640
- Let go! Let go! Help!
- Come with me.

53
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,960
- Come with me.
- No! I won't go!

54
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,840
You're coming with me.

55
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,120
- Help! Help!
- Sir, calm down.

56
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,760
Please calm down.

57
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,800
It's okay, sir. Take it easy.

58
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,400
It's nothing, calm down.

59
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,560
Please calm down.

60
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,800
It's nothing.

61
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,280
Calm down. There's nothing wrong.

62
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
Please calm down.

63
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,520
<i>Since that car accident,</i>
<i>I've been able to see spirits.</i>

64
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,400
<i>They come to me all the time, to talk,</i>
<i>to tell me something,</i>

65
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,960
<i>to ask for help.</i>

66
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,640
No wonder

67
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,400
I always saw you talking to yourself.

68
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,600
Well, what do you need me to do?

69
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Where should I find it?

70
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,400
Can you remember your house?
If you can, try going back there.

71
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,160
Or maybe go to a temple.

72
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay, I'll dedicate merit for you.

73
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,320
Pizza? Okay, I'll send you pizza, okay?

74
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,520
Stop following me already. Go.

75
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,360
And who told you to come find me?

76
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,760
To give you pizza?

77
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
Oh, that guy, right?

78
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,360
Whoa, come on.

79
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
I'll take you home, okay?

80
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
But promise me
you won't tell anyone about this.

81
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,800
It'll get complicated.

82
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,320
Understand? Come on, let's go.

83
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,720
Thanks, Auntie.

84
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Here.

85
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,000
A green soda. You wanted it, right?

86
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,360
Drink as much as you want.

87
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,600
Then stop following me everywhere,

88
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
You follow me everywhere. It's awkward.

89
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's go our separate ways.

90
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
If you're going to reincarnate, do it.

91
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400
At first, I thought

92
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,080
you were bonkers

93
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,440
Well…

94
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,560
that's why I pretend

95
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,400
to be on the phone.

96
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,080
I wear this earbud, but actually,

97
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,920
I'm talking to ghosts.

98
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Hey, I'm not a ghost. I'm just…

99
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,120
I know, Alice. You're not dead yet.

100
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,600
I visit you every day at the hospital.

101
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,960
Come on.

102
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,080
Don't worry too much.

103
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,840
There has to be a way for you to
get back to your body somehow.

104
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,840
I don't think there's a way anymore.

105
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,040
Because I just ran away from him.

106
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
Who?

107
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,880
There's no way.

108
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,800
Your time has already ended.

109
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
Hey, what are you doing?

110
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,800
Who are you? Why are you saying that?

111
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
I don't need to tell you who I am.

112
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,320
When your time comes, we'll meet again.

113
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
Don't you remember me?

114
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,240
Huh?

115
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Hey, let go!

116
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
You let go.

117
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,960
If you don't, we'll all go together.

118
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
We've met before.

119
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,840
Don't you remember?

120
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,640
No? Fine.

121
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,600
Welcome, both of you,

122
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,440
to this special train. Once it departs,

123
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,760
it can never return.

124
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
Actually,

125
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,760
you really shouldn't
have followed her here.

126
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,200
Do you know

127
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
when you refuse to let Alice go,

128
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,680
what happens to your body
in the living world?

129
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,200
Has Punn arrived yet?

130
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,440
How was he when it happened?

131
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,840
- Not yet? Okay, I'll check.
- I don't know either.

132
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,080
He was just standing there
talking on the phone,

133
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,480
then suddenly collapsed.
Maybe heatstroke, I'm not sure.

134
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,680
Punn. Punn!

135
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,600
Hey.

136
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,840
What's wrong with my friend?

137
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
Hold on. Please calm down.

138
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
- Your friend…
- Punn.

139
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,800
The girl who reported it said
he just suddenly fainted.

140
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
Let us take your friend
to the doctor first.

141
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,640
- Punn.
- One, two, three.

142
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,520
- Can I go with you, please?
- Yes, come with us.

143
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Punn!

144
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,640
Hey, what's wrong? Wake up.

145
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,120
Punn. Punn.

146
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,120
Is Punn going to die?

147
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
Maybe.

148
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,160
Hey.

149
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
What are you doing?

150
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,120
Calm down,

151
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,160
young man.

152
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,880
I warning you.

153
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,000
If you stay in the afterlife too long,

154
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,440
you might not be able to return.

155
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,400
Then let's go back now. Come on, Alice.

156
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm not ready to leave yet.

157
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,040
That trick won't work again.

158
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,040
It only works once.

159
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,720
You finally came.

160
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,720
I've been waiting for hours.

161
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,480
If you hadn't shown up in 15 minutes,
I was gonna go home.

162
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,040
Where's Punn anyway?

163
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
Punn…

164
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
I…

165
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,920
Hey, wait.

166
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,640
He…

167
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Hey.

168
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,080
Calm down, man. If you keep stuttering,

169
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,760
I can't understand you.

170
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Punn…

171
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,920
Hey, calm down, bro.

172
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
Take it easy, okay?

173
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Stop crying, please. Stop crying.

174
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
Just tell me what happened.

175
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,200
Take a deep breath.

176
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
The doctor said Punn's in a coma.

177
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,920
I don't know…

178
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,360
They said his body
isn't responding anymore.

179
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,760
You mean

180
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,880
Punn's dead?

181
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,920
I don't know. He…

182
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey, calm down. Calm down!

183
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't believe you.
Take me there right now.

184
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
Calm down.

185
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,599
If you once gave me another chance,

186
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,640
can't you give Alice one too?

187
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,800
What to do?

188
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,359
My duty is quite complicated.

189
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,800
When a mortal's time has run out,

190
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,160
I cannot simply spare a life

191
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,640
or allow someone
to remain in the living world.

192
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,160
Please.

193
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,000
There's still so much I want to do.

194
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
I don't want to die yet.

195
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,680
The song I wrote isn't even finished.

196
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,200
I haven't released it.

197
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,760
I want to sing, play music,

198
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,880
and live a life with the person I love.

199
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,560
I'm begging you too.

200
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,240
Please, give us one more chance.

201
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,520
We'll trade it for anything.

202
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,520
I once saved someone's life.

203
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
So why

204
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,320
can't I have the chance to live mine?

205
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,400
Because you saved someone else.

206
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
Now you're here in their place.

207
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,880
Then what about me?

208
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
Why didn't you take me back then?

209
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,640
Because at that time,

210
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,040
someone else
sacrificed their life for you to stay.

211
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,320
Hey, I told you I'm driving,
I can't talk right now.

212
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,880
I'll call you back, I'm going to pick up
my kid and my husband.

213
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>Please don't hang up.</i>

214
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,840
<i>I'm calling to inform you that your</i>
<i>husband and your child have passed away.</i>

215
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,520
<i>You can claim the bodies at… Hello?</i>

216
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
Hey!

217
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,480
See?

218
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,560
You're shocked, aren't you?

219
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,600
But that's not even the end of the story.

220
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,640
That woman

221
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,720
didn't know her husband and her kid

222
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
weren't actually on that bus.

223
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,840
The kid had a stomachache,

224
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,680
so the father took him to the restroom.

225
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,640
But when they came out,
the bus had already left.

226
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,360
What a tragic story.

227
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,920
Back then,

228
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,000
she willingly traded her life because

229
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
she couldn't go on living

230
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,680
without her beloved family.

231
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,840
Now you see?

232
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,520
Do you understand yet?

233
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,960
Then that means…

234
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,960
for Alice to keep living,

235
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,080
a life must be exchanged.

236
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,800
That's right.

237
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
So whose life will it be?

238
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,120
- Yours?
- No.

239
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,760
I won't allow it.

240
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,560
- How can I live if you--
- I'll do it.

241
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,920
No, I won't let you.

242
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,560
- Take me instead.
- Enough.

243
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,720
Alright then.

244
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,680
I'll give you both a mission.

245
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,280
And if you complete it,

246
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
you'll get your life back.

247
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,760
Do we have a deal?

248
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,480
Do we?

249
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Hey, wait.

250
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
What kind of mission? Tell us first.

251
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,200
Let's see

252
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,600
how it'll turn out.

253
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,720
- Punn, are you okay?
- Yes.

254
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,800
Wait, did that car just pass through us?

255
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,280
Are we both spirits now?

256
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,840
Yeah, looks like it.

257
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,800
Jinny. Jinny.

258
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
Jinny. Jinny!

259
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Jinny. Jinny.

260
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Hold on. Why are we here?

261
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,840
Shouldn't you have gone back to your body?

262
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,440
Exactly.

263
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,520
Are you okay?

264
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,720
I have to be.

265
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
There's still too much I want to do.

266
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,920
From now on,

267
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,560
I won't let anyone take away
my hope, my dreams,

268
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,120
or the life I want to live ever again.

269
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,600
Let's go check on you.

270
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,400
I don't want to waste any more time.

271
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
Let's go.

272
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
MALE PATIENT WARD

273
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Found me.

274
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,680
Hey! What are you doing?

275
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,200
Get out!

276
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,520
I said get out!

277
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,440
What should we do now?

278
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,280
Let's try this.

279
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,440
Do you feel anything?

280
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,720
Nothing. Why?

281
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,360
So what now?

282
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,520
If you keep fooling around,
you'll run out of time.

283
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm not fooling around.

284
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,240
I just don't know
how to get back into my body.

285
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,640
And what did you mean

286
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
by run out of time? What was that?

287
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,160
If you don't get back into your body soon,
something else will.

288
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,760
What about my body?

289
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,680
You mean someone else could possess it?

290
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,360
Right?

291
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,240
Yes.

292
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,080
But don't worry.

293
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,240
I'll keep a special eye on you two.

294
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
Because you both

295
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,360
still have to complete my mission first.

296
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,200
So how do I get back into my body?

297
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,720
All you have to do is just stand still.

298
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,440
Alice.

299
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,240
I'm awake, right?

300
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,720
Yeah, Punn. You did it.

301
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
Don't celebrate yet.

302
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,080
Don't forget
you still have a task to complete.

303
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,120
So what do we do now?

304
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,320
What you have to do now is

305
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
go home.

306
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,000
Your time is up.

307
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,680
Uh, excuse me, these flowers…

308
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,920
Oh, those are mine.
I dropped them off this morning.

309
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,840
I see

310
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,720
They're beautiful.

311
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,440
I brought these for you.

312
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,320
Do you like them?

313
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,280
Yeah.

314
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,080
Thank you.

315
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,840
Let me carry them for you.

316
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Let's go, Alice.

317
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Yeah.

318
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
Where?

319
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,480
- The counter?
- Yeah, go ask.

320
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,040
Uh.

321
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,400
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

322
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm here to visit a patient named

323
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,240
Punn Suparerk,
the one the rescue team brought earlier.

324
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,160
- Punn Suparerk?
- Yes.

325
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,320
- Okay, let me check for you.
- Sure, thanks.

326
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
Punn…

327
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,000
Su, S and U.

328
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,640
- Yes.
- S?

329
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
- And P.
- Yes.

330
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,560
Then A…

331
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,080
- A…
- Who are you here to see?

332
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,480
- Hey!
- Hey, Punn!

333
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,240
Hey, Punn!

334
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,600
Excuse me,
loud noises are not allowed here.

335
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,800
Sorry.

336
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,240
- Come here.
- What?

337
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Let's talk.

338
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,120
Weren't you in a coma?

339
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,840
I was. But if I told you,
you'd think I was crazy.

340
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Damn, I'm just glad you're okay.

341
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,440
Yeah, you know what?

342
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,320
Bombay was crying his eyes out
like you were dead or something.

343
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
- I was really freaking out.
- Whoa.

344
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,680
It's good you're fine now.

345
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,320
Guess even the Grim Reaper
couldn't take him down.

346
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Come here. Give me a hug.

347
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,240
- My best friend.
- Okay.

348
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,680
Thank you.

349
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,800
- Oh?
- Enough teasing.

350
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,240
Alice.

351
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,800
Alice woke up?

352
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
Come on, tell us.

353
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,680
She really woke up, didn't she?

354
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,480
Hey.

355
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,760
You actually believed him? He's joking.

356
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,120
How was I supposed to know?

357
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,040
I really thought she woke up for real.

358
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,720
So, who's that bouquet for?

359
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
I came to visit Alice this morning,

360
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,800
but the nurse wouldn't let me bring it in,

361
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,200
so I had to carry it back out.

362
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,760
So how's Alice doing?

363
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,040
She's okay.

364
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,800
I mean, she's just lying there.

365
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,480
Looks like she's just sleeping.

366
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,560
But she only drowned,
how did it turn into a coma?

367
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,320
Dude, haven't you ever watched the news?

368
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,440
Sometimes, just a few minutes
without oxygen

369
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,040
and the brain dies.
The blood can't reach it in time.

370
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,640
When the brain dies,
that basically means death, doesn't it?

371
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,400
No, no, no.

372
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,520
Sometimes the spirit
just goes wandering for a while.

373
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,120
It's not back in the body yet, that's all.

374
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,600
Once the spirit comes back,
she'll wake up again.

375
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,960
And if it's done wandering,
can it really come back?

376
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,560
Hey, I was just asking.

377
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,240
Honestly, I believe in science
more than all that.

378
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,840
But still…

379
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,400
I just worry that

380
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
if the brain's dead,

381
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,600
and the body's unresponsive like that…

382
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,440
Well…

383
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,240
How long will she have
to be in a vegetative state?

384
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
It sucks.

385
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,600
We only just met her.

386
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,160
It's such a shame.

387
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,880
I mean, I really wanted
a female member in the band too.

388
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,400
Hey, it's fine.

389
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,760
Alice will wake up soon.

390
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Trust me, just wait a little.

391
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,720
But still,

392
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,440
right now,

393
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,560
we still need new members.

394
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,640
We've gotta keep auditioning new members.

395
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,640
Honestly,
I don't want to audition anymore.

396
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
I'll wait for Alice.

397
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,040
<i>I just want to know</i>

398
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,560
<i>If the way we miss each other</i>
<i>Feels the same</i>

399
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,640
<i>Tell me, has your heart changed?</i>

400
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,360
<i>I'm not imagining it, right?</i>

401
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,240
<i>The longing I sent to you</i>

402
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,720
<i>Never reached you at all</i>

403
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,160
I think that's enough for today.

404
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,200
Look at you.

405
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,880
You don't look good, man.

406
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,640
You shouldn't have come to practice.

407
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,880
Didn't you

408
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,720
just get out of the hospital?
If you're not feeling okay, just say so.

409
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,200
I'm fine, really.

410
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,200
Totally fine.

411
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,600
It's not that.

412
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
It's like you've got no soul in you today.

413
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,440
Normally, you're not like this.

414
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,440
I get it, you just got discharged.

415
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,920
I think you should go home and rest.

416
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,800
Let's pack up.

417
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Alright.

418
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,560
Maybe I just have a lot on my mind lately.

419
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,200
I get it.

420
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,240
Alright, I'm heading out first.

421
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,480
- Okay, see you.
- See you.

422
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,040
- Take care of this for me.
- Okay.

423
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
Let's go.

424
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,040
But I don't know where to go.

425
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,960
I don't wanna go home and see my mom.

426
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,040
Then just come with me.

427
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,719
Come on.

428
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,239
Who's Punn talking to?

429
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,280
Forget it. He's been talking
to himself forever, hasn't he?

430
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,560
Yeah, but he's never done it
in the studio before.

431
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,639
So how am I supposed to
practice alone like this?

432
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,480
Ugh, whatever.
If you can't see it, it's not there.

433
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,000
Does it get boring being a ghost?

434
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
Hey.

435
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,200
Who's a ghost? Stop saying that.

436
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm a spirit. But I just realized

437
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,560
I'm really just a wandering spirit.

438
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
A lost spirit.

439
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,800
No place to go,

440
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,520
no idea what to do.

441
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,480
Who said that?
We've got a mission to complete.

442
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
You're right.

443
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,760
A mission.

444
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,440
- You live alone?
- Yes.

445
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,680
But not really.
My parents work out of town.

446
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,360
Aren't they worried about you?

447
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,200
Worried? Come on.

448
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,200
I'm 17 already. I'm a grown man.
I can take care of myself.

449
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,840
I have self-defense skills and all.
Wanna see?

450
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,960
Left hook! Bam! Bam! Bam!

451
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,480
Anyone messes with me? Bam, bam, bam!

452
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,560
See? You're smiling.

453
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,640
Well,

454
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,000
my parents usually visit every weekend.

455
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,720
Or when they don't,

456
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
there are cameras all around the house.

457
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
They can check on me anytime.

458
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,960
But lately, I told them

459
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,400
they don't have to come
since I've got band practice with friends.

460
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,720
So what, if you bring a girl home

461
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
or throw a party, they'll see everything?

462
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,120
Well…

463
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,440
Not really. If the girl's a ghost,

464
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,880
they can't see her anyway.

465
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
You're calling me a ghost again.

466
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,640
Don't you get lonely living by yourself?

467
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,880
Not really.

468
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,520
I guess I'm used to it.

469
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
When I'm free,
I play guitar or practice singing.

470
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
No time to be lonely.

471
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,280
By the time my head hits the pillow,
I'm out. Day's over.

472
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
That's what loneliness is, you know.

473
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,600
Maybe I was lonely before.

474
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,320
But now I'm not
because someone's here with me.

475
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,840
Are you hungry?

476
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,720
No.

477
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,160
But honestly,

478
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,240
it's kind of strange.

479
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,400
This floating feeling.

480
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,840
No hunger, no sleepiness.

481
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,080
Part of me thinks

482
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,000
being a wandering spirit isn't so bad.

483
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,760
I get to do crazy things

484
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,560
I could never do as a human.

485
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,440
And

486
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,080
I feel like

487
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,120
it makes me stronger

488
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
and gives me more freedom.

489
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,320
Being a ghost is kinda good.

490
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,480
No need to go home.

491
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,280
Do you miss your mom?

492
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,120
I think about her

493
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,680
but I don't miss her.

494
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,240
Honestly, I'm still mad at her

495
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,360
for ruining my audition.

496
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,120
But I think I'll go check on her tomorrow.

497
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,200
But tonight,

498
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,360
just stay here.

499
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,360
Mm.

500
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Anyway,

501
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,240
what exactly is our mission?

502
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,640
He never told us. And we don't
even know how much time we have.

503
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,600
This is stressful. What do we do?

504
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,680
Punn.

505
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,400
If it's stressing you out that much,

506
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,400
maybe we don't need to
follow what that guy said.

507
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,240
No, Alice.

508
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,840
I won't let you die.

509
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,880
Even though we don't know
what we have to do yet,

510
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,400
I'll use this chance

511
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
to bring you back to life.

512
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,960
Thank you, Punn.

513
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,320
I want to live again too.

514
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,960
Being alive

515
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,880
really is precious.

516
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,080
Don't worry, Alice.

517
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,840
I promise I'll never leave you.

518
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,640
I'll do everything, anything,

519
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,600
to bring you back to life again.

520
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Mm.

521
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,720
But we still don't know what to do next.

522
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,640
Next time we see him, we'll have to ask.

523
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,720
If we ever see him again.

524
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,960
Hey, Alice.

525
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,480
Remember that person
we saw get hit by a car?

526
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,360
Of course. There was blood everywhere.

527
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,720
Why did we end up

528
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,680
on that street when we came back?

529
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
<i>Could that be…</i>

530
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,920
<i>our mission?</i>

531
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,080
But then what?

532
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,520
We still don't know what to do.

533
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,960
Jinny.

534
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,040
This girl's interesting.
She's got attitude.

535
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,280
Yeah, attitude, sure.

536
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,120
But is she any good?

537
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,400
You brats. Get lost!

538
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,120
I just wanted to ask about you and Wut.

539
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,520
Hey! You don't understand! Just go!

540
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Hey, that's too much.

541
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
- Hey.
- Ah.

542
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,480
<i>If I wake up,</i>

543
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,680
<i>I'll do everything you say, Mom.</i>

544
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,040
Jinny.

545
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,040
