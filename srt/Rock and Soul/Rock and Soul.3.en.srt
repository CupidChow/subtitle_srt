1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,280
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>I'll keep a special eye on you two.</i>

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
Because you both

4
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,480
still have to complete my mission first.

5
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,640
<i>Why did we end up</i>

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,680
on that street when we came back?

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,440
<i>Could that be our mission?</i>

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,480
We still don't know what to do.

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
Jinny.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,680
Alice!

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,600
Alice!

12
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,360
Punn, are you alright?

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,840
You stayed here all night?

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
Of course.

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,080
You're the one who asked me to.

16
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
You forgot already?

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
No, I didn't forget.

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Why didn't you sleep on the bed?

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Don't be silly.

20
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,880
How could we sleep on the same bed?

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,400
Sure we could.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,520
I wouldn't do anything.

23
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,639
A ghost and a human can't do that anyway.

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,320
That's not what I meant.

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Forget it.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,200
Anyway,

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,880
you called my name when you woke up.
What's wrong?

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,400
It was a nightmare.

29
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,880
I'll tell you later.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Why?

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,520
I should go brush my teeth first.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Wow, worried about bad breath?

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
I can't even smell anything.

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
Whoa.

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,760
That's amazing.

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Of course. I live alone.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Two eggs?

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,800
Who said two?

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,480
Four.

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
For me?

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Smells good, right?

43
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,120
Maybe. I'm guessing.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,080
You act like
you can really smell or taste things.

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,440
You know I can't eat.
Why'd you even make it?

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,960
I didn't wanna eat alone.

47
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,720
When people
make offerings to their ancestors,

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,920
the spirits can't really eat either,
right?

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,880
I don't know if it's the same

50
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,839
between spirits of the dead

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,600
and spirits that left their bodies

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
but are still alive in this world.

53
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,520
That's fascinating.

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,120
But I think it's probably different.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,440
Otherwise, why would people
keep offering food to the dead?

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,840
I think

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
maybe ghosts and dead spirits

58
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,760
can eat in a spiritual way, like you do.

59
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,400
So when someone gives them something,

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
it's like a reminder that
they still matter, that they still exist,

61
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,080
even in the afterlife.

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Don't you think?

63
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,960
Maybe.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,360
Then… can I have it?

65
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Sure.

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm spiritually full now.

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,160
Spiritually full?

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,560
- Punn, your phone.
- Oh, right.

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,760
Hang on.

70
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, what's up?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
<i>I'm saying we need to audition</i>
<i>a new member to replace Alice.</i>

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,960
<i>We've got a competition coming up.</i>
<i>If we wait for her to wake up,</i>

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,120
<i>we'll already be in college by then.</i>

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,880
That's harsh.
Can you be a little more considerate?

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
How would she feel if she heard that?

76
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,240
<i>She can't hear me. She's in a coma.</i>

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,680
Alright, fine. I'll come talk in person.
Where are you guys?

78
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm gonna go out for a bit.
You can stay here, Alice.

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,120
You don't have to wait for me.

80
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,800
Go chase your dreams with your friends.

81
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,640
I'll catch up later.

82
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,280
No, Alice.

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,760
Don't make me feel guilty.

84
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,760
I don't wanna be a burden to you guys.

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,040
Don't make me feel more upset.

86
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,600
I already feel embarrassed enough

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
by my mom ruining the audition that day.

88
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Punn.

89
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
Please.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Wow.

91
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
I knew it. They're always in such a rush,

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,920
but they're never on time. Always late.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
They'll show up soon, probably.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,160
Alice.

95
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,240
What's he doing here?
Why's he following us?

96
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,600
Fine, I won't follow you.
I'll take you back right now.

97
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,880
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh, no…

98
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
I mean

99
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,160
did you come to tell us something?

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
That sounds much better.

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,560
I came to warn you

102
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
not to waste time on nonsense

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,240
and forget that your mission
is tied to your lives.

104
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
But we still don't even know

105
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
what this mission is.

106
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
How are we supposed to know what to do?

107
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,680
It's been so obvious.
You still don't see it?

108
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,960
If we knew, we'd have done it by now, sir.

109
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
Alright.

110
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,000
Then listen carefully.

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,720
I'll say it once more.

112
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,080
Your mission is

113
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,039
to release the trapped spirit

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,159
of that man who was hit by the car.

115
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,840
Release the trapped spirit?

116
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
But how do we release him?

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Right.

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,840
That man dies over and over there

119
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,080
and makes us see it repeatedly.

120
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,360
How are we supposed to help him?

121
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,040
And…

122
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
who are you, anyway?

123
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,720
Why do you have so much power?

124
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,360
I have no reason to tell you that.

125
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,560
Then your name.

126
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
Just your name.

127
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,800
You don't have a name, do you?

128
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,080
Then I'll give you one.

129
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,880
I don't like knowing someone
and not being able to call them by name.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,880
From now on, I'll call you…

131
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,680
"Karn." Alright?

132
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,640
Why'd you pick such a cool name?

133
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,160
Well, he's always talking about time.

134
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,680
Call me whatever you wish.

135
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
I don't care.

136
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
- Hey!
- Whoa.

137
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,760
What the hell? You scared me.

138
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,400
Man, what a scaredy-cat.

139
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
Did you see his face?

140
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,520
What are we playing today?

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,680
I vote

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,560
for something upbeat,
with a killer drum solo.

143
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,400
- Wow.
- What?

144
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
That way we'll get girls screaming.

145
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Well.

146
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,840
Save your energy for breathing.

147
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
I think

148
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,600
we play a love song this time.

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,080
No way. Rock.

150
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,720
No. I say love.

151
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,520
No. No practice then.

152
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
- What?
- Wait.

153
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,200
Wait, are you serious?

154
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,840
- Yes.
- Oh?

155
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,760
What's wrong?

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,080
I came all this way. What a waste of time.

157
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,280
Yeah, and you're costing me
the studio fees too.

158
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,080
I booked this studio for you.

159
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,560
So what's it gonna be? Practice or not?

160
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,960
If not, I'm giving this slot away.

161
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,480
Then,

162
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,440
no practice.

163
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,200
- What?
- I'm going to Siam.

164
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,560
- Let's go.
- Huh?

165
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
He's like that at the studio too?

166
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
Yeah, seriously.

167
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,120
Should we go after him to Siam?

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,840
Or are you staying here alone?

169
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
No way. Let's go, hurry up.

170
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,920
- Look over there.
- What the hell? Hurry up.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Jeez.

172
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,240
Oh.

173
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
- Punn.
- Hm?

174
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
There he is. Over there.

175
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,040
We found him. What now?
Should we just go talk to him?

176
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
Jinny. Jinny. Jinny!

177
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,800
Jinny. Jinny!

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
He's acting strange. Do you think

179
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
he can't see us?

180
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
If he can't see humans,

181
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,680
maybe he can see spirits.

182
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
Then maybe he can see you, Alice.

183
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,600
Let's test it.

184
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
Hey.

185
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,880
Weren't we supposed to
talk to Punn about the audition?

186
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
Why are we here instead?

187
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, true.

188
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
We got caught up talking
about rehearsal plans.

189
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,080
- That's your fault.
- Come on. Let's talk later.

190
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,320
There's two of us anyway,
he'll have to listen.

191
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,160
- Two?
- Yes.

192
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,840
But he's the band leader.
Doesn't he get the final say?

193
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Wrong, bro.

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,080
It's 2025, equality, man.
Every vote counts.

195
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,280
A good band leader listens to his team.

196
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,480
Then why even have a leader at all?

197
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,880
Have you ever heard of democracy?

198
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,480
Hey, where's Punn? Have you seen him?

199
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,720
Didn't he come with us?

200
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
What now?

201
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,880
Should we go find him?

202
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,200
Yeah, where the hell did he go?

203
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Excuse me.

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
What?

205
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,560
Are you okay?

206
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,840
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a headache.

207
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
Thanks.

208
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,920
Wait, who are you looking for?

209
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,480
Maybe we can help.

210
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,520
My girlfriend.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
There.

212
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
Wait.

213
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Listen to me.
I can help you find your girlfriend.

214
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,400
Really? You know her?

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,880
You brats. Get lost!

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Jinny!

217
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,040
Wait.

218
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
I can help you find your girlfriend.

219
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,120
Did I make a mistake
auditioning for this band?

220
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,560
Everyone's insane.

221
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,600
Hey.

222
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,640
What's wrong with you, Punn?

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,680
This is life and death. Just listen to me!

224
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,920
Quit being crazy already!

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,840
Hey, stay out of it! I'm busy!

226
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,720
Busy with what, man?

227
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,920
I've been watching you
talk to yourself for ages.

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
You see ghosts now?

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Ridiculous.

230
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,360
Oh.

231
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,880
I think you're losing it.

232
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,880
Did you forget we were
supposed to talk about the audition?

233
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,560
And you come to Siam instead?

234
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,520
You just came here
to stand around and be weird?

235
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,840
Punn.

236
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,200
You need to come to terms with Alice.

237
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,880
Is it making you this messed up?

238
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,000
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

239
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Hey!

240
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,640
You don't understand! Just go!

241
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Hey, that's too much.

242
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
- Hey.
- Ah.

243
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,200
Punn, calm down.

244
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,760
Don't fight. Let's just go first.

245
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,240
BREEZE

246
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,720
Turns out removing that stain is a breeze.

247
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,520
<i>Punn.</i>

248
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
Please, calm down.

249
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,240
Punn.

250
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,680
Calm down.

251
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,720
At least now we know
we can communicate with him.

252
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,480
Okay?

253
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,680
Mm.

254
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
Mm-hmm.

255
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,480
And about his story, we can start by

256
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,320
checking accident reports in the news.

257
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay.

258
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,440
Let's do that.

259
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,200
And,

260
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,920
meanwhile, I think you should

261
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,200
keep auditioning new members.

262
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,800
Your dream is to get the band on stage.

263
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't forget that dream.

264
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
But I think

265
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,840
you're more important right now.

266
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,360
Thanks.

267
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,960
But now, this matters more.

268
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,680
Hey.

269
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,560
PUNN: I'M SORRY, GUYS.
I'VE BEEN STRESSED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

270
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,480
Read it.

271
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,200
- Mm.
- "I'm sorry, guys."

272
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,960
"I've been stressed about a lot of things.
Let's audition for a new member."

273
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
"Let's make the dream happen
before we expire."

274
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,960
He apologized.

275
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,359
You think we should forgive him?

276
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
He did push you.

277
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,240
I already forgive him.

278
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,599
Alright then, I'll reply.

279
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,920
BOMBAY: I KNEW IT, MAN. OKAY.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Made you look bad, huh?

281
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,040
I like that.

282
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,560
Punn.

283
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
Hm?

284
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,480
I think this girl's interesting.

285
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,280
NANA
CUTE FACE, FIERCE BASS

286
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
She's got attitude.

287
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,720
Yeah, attitude, sure.

288
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,480
But is she any good?

289
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
Oh, come on, rock star.

290
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Eh?

291
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,040
I'm Nana. I'm interested in playing bass.

292
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,960
<i>I recognized her.</i>

293
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,720
She's the one
who came for our first audition.

294
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,480
But it got canceled because…

295
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
Of my mom.

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,680
Yeah. But I think she's interesting.

297
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
She's got this determined smile.

298
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,880
Mm.

299
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,960
Oh, I remember now. That's her.

300
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,840
I think she looks familiar.

301
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,640
I think I saw her
watching a concert at Siam today.

302
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,120
Really?

303
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,720
Should we?

304
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,000
Try calling her in.
If she can play, we'll let her join.

305
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,560
- Let's try.
- Yeah.

306
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,720
And she's cute too.

307
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,680
- Oh?
- Oh?

308
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,520
Oh?

309
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,920
No, I meant she looks cute.
She fits the band's image.

310
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,920
- Sure, sure.
- Right.

311
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,920
So, the guy was following his girlfriend
when he got hit by a car.

312
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,960
What about the driver?

313
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,520
Still looking for that information.

314
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,920
He's been dead a long time now.

315
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,400
Maybe he has some unfinished business.

316
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
That's why he's still trapped.

317
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,480
We don't know who the driver is.

318
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,520
MAN STRUCK AND KILLED AFTER DASHING
ACROSS ROAD, DRIVER FLEES SCENE

319
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,680
Found it.

320
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,520
Completely vanished.

321
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,520
No follow-ups, no news.

322
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
Don't you want to go home?

323
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
Didn't you say you were going today?

324
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,360
HOSPITAL MEDICAL AFFAIRS UNIT

325
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,640
I do want to go back.

326
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
But I think

327
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,440
I'll visit myself
at the hospital tomorrow.

328
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,480
Punn, will you come with me?

329
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,680
I don't want to go alone yet.

330
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,240
Of course.

331
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,800
Hey, today…

332
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Hey, that's too much.

333
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
- Hey.
- Ah.

334
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,720
Nothing.

335
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,160
So, what now? I'm ready to play.

336
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,000
Go ahead.

337
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,040
<i>I want to be the one who's loved</i>

338
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,400
<i>I want to be the one</i>
<i>Someone truly understands</i>

339
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,080
<i>To fill the emptiness inside</i>

340
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,360
<i>To bring me love</i>

341
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,280
<i>Is there anyone?</i>

342
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,720
It's time to wipe down the patient now.

343
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,200
Nurse,

344
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,440
- I'll do it myself.
- Sure.

345
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,520
<i>Your fever will go down soon, my dear.</i>

346
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,200
<i>Sleep tight, my sweet girl.</i>

347
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,640
Mom…

348
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,320
I finally understand how much you love me.

350
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
If I wake up…

351
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
I promise

352
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,440
I'll do everything you say.

353
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,040
Please wake up, sweetie.

354
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,240
Can you hear me, Alice?

355
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,360
I love you so much.

356
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,880
And I promise,

357
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,320
if you wake up,

358
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,440
I'll let you do whatever you want.

359
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,240
Anything you wish.

360
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm sorry, sweetie.

361
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm sorry for everything.

362
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,920
I just wanted you to be happy,

363
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,080
to have a good life.

364
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,280
Please wake up soon, Alice.

365
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,840
Can you hear me?

366
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,160
I love you, Mom.

367
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,480
How did you know I was here?

368
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,600
How did you follow me?

369
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,920
Who said I followed you here?

370
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,760
I just like walking around here.

371
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,320
Really?

372
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,840
Yes.

373
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,280
Hey, Alice, I'm happy for you.

374
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,400
About what?

375
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
You and your mom.

376
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm glad you made up.

377
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,920
I've been acting like a child,

378
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
so stubborn,

379
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,320
and I forgot that

380
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,840
the person who cared for me the most

381
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,800
and loved me the most was Mom.

382
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,080
Honestly, both of you were stubborn.

383
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,440
But it's good that, in the end,

384
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,600
you understand each other again.

385
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
Hey, Alice, if you wake up,

386
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,040
will you follow your own dream,

387
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,280
or your mom's?

388
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,240
I want Mom to be happy.

389
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
But I also

390
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
want to be happy

391
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,560
doing what I love.

392
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,280
I think

393
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,480
let's not worry about that yet.

394
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,120
There's still time to think.

395
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,520
Anyway,

396
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,000
congrats about Nana.

397
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,640
She's officially in the band.

398
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,760
She's talented too.

399
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,680
Hey,

400
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,520
are you upset that I let her join?

401
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,320
No, I just…

402
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,960
I mean

403
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm genuinely happy for you.

404
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
Earlier, when I left, it was because

405
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,840
I was going to visit myself.

406
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,640
Nana's really good.

407
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,200
A little cheeky,

408
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,960
but she fits right in.

409
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,600
Yeah, she's great.

410
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,600
Mm.

411
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm really happy for you guys.

412
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Honestly,

413
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,080
she might even be better than me.

414
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Hey,

415
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
no.

416
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,400
You and Nana play different instruments.

417
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,280
When you come back,

418
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,000
you'll play keyboard again.

419
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,640
Then our band will be so, so perfect.

420
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,560
Oh, we keep talking about a new member.

421
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
I forget

422
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,440
we have to register for the showcase.

423
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,560
Okay.

424
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
<i>Hey, they replied!</i>

425
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,800
- Huh?
- Huh?

426
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,800
Let me see.

427
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,120
Hey.

428
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,120
When are we playing? Show me.

429
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
Next Friday.

430
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,240
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

431
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,240
- Woohoo!
- Come on!

432
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,640
Let's play "Poison."

433
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,480
Hey, don't step on the sheet.

434
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,120
- What?
- Don't step on it.

435
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,480
- Okay.
- Hey, sorry.

436
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,480
Hey, found it.

437
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,160
The woman Wut was following,
her name is Jinny.

438
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,040
So how do we find her?

439
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,000
Here. Let's see her posts on social media.

440
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,520
Okay, I'll screenshot

441
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
every post on her account.

442
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,240
<i>My heart still misses you the same</i>

443
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,040
<i>No one could ever take your place</i>

444
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,880
<i>At all</i>

445
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,400
<i>If we met again someday, I'd ask</i>

446
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,720
<i>Do you still remember me?</i>

447
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,520
<i>- Would you smile at me again?</i>
- Hey.

448
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,440
What the hell?

449
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,920
Sorry, I zoned out a bit.

450
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,160
It was not a bit.
You've been off many times.

451
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,320
You played wrong notes, missed cues.
What's wrong with you…

452
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
man?

453
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,520
Hey, come on.

454
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,160
I think we're all tired today.

455
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,920
You hungry? Let's grab something to eat.

456
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,160
Yeah, let's take a break. I'm starving.

457
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
- Let's go.
- Let's take a break and eat.

458
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
Punn.

459
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,160
What should we eat? Help me decide.

460
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
Order whatever. I'll be right back.

461
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,160
Pizza, pizza.

462
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah, he'll eat it. Pizza it is.

463
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,640
Ready?

464
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,560
Sure.

465
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,320
- Let's dig in.
- Let's eat.

466
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,240
Go. One slice each for now, okay?

467
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,440
Mm.

468
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,840
Hm?

469
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,120
You want some?

470
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,360
Smells good?

471
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Hey, I've got something to ask.

472
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,880
Do any of you know

473
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,520
this woman?

474
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,680
I'm looking for her.

475
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Wait.

476
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,000
She looks familiar.

477
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,400
But I can't remember from where.

478
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,440
The hell?

479
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,920
Familiar but can't remember?

480
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,360
Scroll through her old posts yet?
Maybe there's some clues,

481
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,120
- places or friends.
- Let's see.

482
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
Why do I feel like

483
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,720
all these places she posts about
look just like around Siam Square? Look.

484
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,360
Yeah, you're right.

485
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,920
Did you DM her yet?

486
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,440
I tried,
but she didn't read or reply at all.

487
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,320
By the way,

488
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,760
why are you trying to find her?

489
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,640
Trying to flirt?

490
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,800
You crazy?

491
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,480
- Nice one.
- She's much older than me.

492
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,920
- Wow.
- Well.

493
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,320
So what? Lots of younger guys

494
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,520
like older women these days.

495
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,480
- That's not it.
- Aw, baby Punn.

496
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,640
- Is this your type?
- No.

497
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,400
I remember now.

498
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,000
I know Je Kiew.

499
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,920
She's a spirit medium

500
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,120
near the Chao Mae Tubtim Shrine.

501
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,560
She's super accurate with fortune telling,

502
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,400
and she can sense spirits.

503
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,840
I have her number. Wanna call her?

504
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,400
Maybe she can help us find that woman.

505
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah, let's do it.

506
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Sure.

507
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,679
Hello, Je.

508
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,440
I've told my friends a lot

509
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,960
about how you have a sixth sense.

510
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,719
You know everything.

511
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,040
See all, know all.

512
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,880
Hey! I'm not Akinator.

513
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,280
If you've got a question, spit it out.

514
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,440
- Okay, so…
- Yeah?

515
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,400
My friend here

516
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,080
- is trying to find a woman.
- Hm?

517
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,480
Could you maybe see
where she is in Thailand?

518
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
Alright.

519
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,840
Whoa.

520
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,800
There are five of you here.

521
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,040
- Four, actually, not five.
- Ah!

522
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,560
If I say five, then five it is.

523
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,480
Five.

524
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,720
Come on, let me see what you've got.

525
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,480
- So slow.
- Here.

526
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,240
Hmm.

527
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,480
Can you tell where we can find her?

528
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,480
You see her every day.
You meet her every day.

529
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,680
Just follow the girl and you'll find her.

530
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,680
- Huh?
- Mm.

531
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
- Me?
- Yes.

532
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
- Really?
- Mm.

533
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,680
Well.

534
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,080
You can all go now. I've got more clients.

535
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
Go on. Next one's

536
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,200
- a big tipper.
- Thank you.

537
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,720
- Goodbye. Go.
- See you later.

538
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,640
Now.

539
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,440
Well.

540
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,200
Why aren't you leaving? Everyone else did.

541
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
Wanna fix your bangs? They're uneven?

542
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,360
- You want it?
- There's no one over there.

543
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,720
There is. Now go. Go away.

544
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,400
That's it.

545
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,400
FORTUNE TELLING

546
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
Alright, next.

547
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,600
Do you remember where you met her?

548
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
No idea.

549
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,400
Then how about this.
We'll just follow Nana all day.

550
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,000
Wherever she goes, we'll go too.

551
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,160
If Je Kiew said we'd find her,
sooner or later, we'll find her.

552
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,080
Okay, tomorrow, we'll follow you.

553
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,080
But you've gotta start early.

554
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
I've got a tutoring session
in Siam every morning.

555
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,480
How early?

556
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,880
I barely make it to school on time.
If it's too early, I won't make it.

557
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,520
Same here.

558
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,240
Okay, okay. I'll just go with…

559
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,440
I mean I'll go alone.

560
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,520
What time at Siam?

561
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Whoa.

562
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,000
You're serious.

563
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,680
Alright,

564
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,880
meet at Siam, 6:30 a.m. sharp.

565
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,680
- I'll be asleep.
- Right?

566
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,800
I'd better sleep here.

567
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,280
Just let Punn go by himself.

568
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,640
Hello, welcome. What can I get you?

569
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,440
One hot Americano, please.

570
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,160
- That'll be 100 baht.
- Scan to pay.

571
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,600
You can scan right here.

572
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,640
Here you go.

573
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,560
Thank you.

574
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,000
Hey.

575
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,720
There she is.

576
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
You're right.

577
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,320
Let me just order my coffee first.

578
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
Well,

579
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,320
one more hot Americano, please.

580
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,320
- And for you?
- I'll have

581
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,680
a latte.

582
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,040
Uh, make it two.

583
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,520
That'll be 300 baht.

584
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,920
- You can scan here.
- Okay.

585
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,320
My treat, okay?

586
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,240
- Wow.
- Wow.

587
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,320
- Great.
- Thanks, man.

588
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,160
Finish this one first.

589
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,720
Excuse me, is there something you need?
You keep looking at me.

590
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,280
Uh, well…

591
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,120
I just wanted to ask about you and Wut.

592
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
You knew him?

593
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Yes.

594
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,960
There's nothing left to talk about.

595
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,920
And for the record, he's dead.

596
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,160
That's the reason, though.

597
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,960
He's dead, but he's not at peace.

598
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,200
He keeps dying at the same spot

599
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,880
over and over.

600
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,080
What nonsense is this?

601
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,040
Are you trying to scam me
into paying for some séance?

602
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,600
Leave. I don't want to hear
anything about him again.

603
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,640
He's gone. Let him stay gone.

604
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,680
Please, calm down. I'm not a scammer.

605
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,280
I just feel bad for Wut.
He came to me asking for help to find you.

606
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,800
He still has regrets.

607
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,360
He wants to make up with you.

608
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,240
Would you come with me to see him?

609
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,440
If he really came to you,

610
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,360
prove it.

611
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,200
Show me something,
anything that proves you knew him.

612
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,680
Do you have a photo?

613
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't.

614
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,800
But I know that the day he died,

615
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,280
he was wearing a long-sleeved gray shirt,

616
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
a pair of jeans,

617
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
and on his left wrist,

618
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,240
there's a black watch with a white face.

619
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,960
He died on the street behind Siam.

620
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,800
He was chasing after his girlfriend,
trying to apologize

621
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,040
and he suddenly got hit by a car.

622
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,560
I have to get back to my class. Excuse me.

623
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,240
Okay.

624
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,560
Continue with this.

625
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,880
Do you think she'll come?

626
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
I don't know.
We'll just have to take the risk.

627
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,640
But it's almost time.

628
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,800
Thank you for agreeing to meet Wut.

629
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,440
If you want to make peace with Wut,

630
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,120
call me.

631
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,240
Or tonight, meet me

632
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,120
where the accident happened around 8 p.m.

633
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,960
I'll be waiting.

634
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,640
What do we do now?

635
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,960
Just wait.

636
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,800
Wut, your girlfriend's here.

637
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
He's right there.

638
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Jinny.

639
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

640
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
I made a mistake, okay?
What do you want me to do?

641
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,640
I'm pregnant with someone else's baby,
not yours.

642
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,360
Can you really accept that?

643
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,720
I slept with another man.
I'm carrying his child.

644
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,000
- Stop! Enough!
- Are you happy now?

645
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,440
No, I don't believe you!

646
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,000
How could it be someone else's child?

647
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,840
It's true! Just accept it.

648
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,920
Let's break up.

649
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,120
No. No, I won't.

650
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,280
Hey, listen to me. Stop. Stop.

651
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,720
We're not breaking up.
We'll live together again.

652
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,240
I'll raise the baby myself, okay?

653
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,120
That's impossible.

654
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,720
I can't do this anymore. I'm done talking.

655
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,480
Jinny.

656
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,440
Let go.

657
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,360
Jinny.

658
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,840
That's not true.

659
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,760
That's not true.

660
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,320
That's not true!

661
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,280
Wut, stop.

662
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
Where's Nana gone?

663
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,240
<i>She's skipped practice for days.</i>

664
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,960
If you wanna quit, fine,

665
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,800
but at least tell us why.

666
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,920
Hey,

667
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,080
what the hell? She can't quit now.

668
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,880
The show's in a few days.

669
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,400
Just go home.

670
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,920
I need to take care of my mom.

671
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,720
<i>I saw an old woman</i>

672
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,160
<i>walking slowly in the kitchen.</i>

673
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,160
<i>I think Nana's hiding something.</i>

674
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,760
