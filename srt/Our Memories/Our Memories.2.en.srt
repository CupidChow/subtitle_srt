is it that you're not as smart as her,

173
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,100
or is it that your home environment and conditions aren't as good as hers?

174
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,670
Mom,

175
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,510
it has nothing to do with the family condition.

176
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,270
Then what do you think it's related to?

177
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:18,790
Yan li,

178
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,770
don’t say that.

179
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,340
This exam was particularly difficult,

180
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,200
mainly to gauge the top students.

181
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,150
It's not at the level of the college entrance exam.

182
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,710
And Wenwen also...

183
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,550
Enough,

184
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,680
it's same for everyone.

185
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,780
I have expectations for my daughter.

186
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,910
She must get into a top 985 university.

187
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,190
Jiang Limin,

188
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,670
don't you understand

189
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,190
the principle of "Thousands of soldiers and tens of thousands of horses across a single log bridge"?

190
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,520
This exam doesn't prove anything anyway.

191
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,830
Besides,

192
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,170
my teaching philosophy has always been against the sole emphasis on grades.

193
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,080
Let me ask you,

194
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,970
which aspect of today's society doesn't consider grades

195
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,890
and diplomas?

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,630
If you don't get into university,

197
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,090
can you still become a teacher?

198
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,580
What are you doing here today?

199
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,150
Why are you playing good cop here?

200
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,210
Go eat it yourself.

201
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,790
How did we even get onto the topic of "good cop" and "bad cop"?

202
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,190
It's just nonsensical.

203
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,130
Every wrong question,

204
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,910
you'll copy it ten times,

205
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,510
and

206
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,870
also write a clear summary of at least 1000 words,

207
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,020
explaining

208
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,250
why you got it wrong.

209
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,120
If you can't finish writing tonight, don't expect to sleep.

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
I'll

211
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,830
stay up

212
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,690
with you.

213
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,590
Who's that?

214
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,550
Hello.

215
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,710
Mom.

216
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,390
You're calling to ask about the monthly test score?

217
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,390
Your news is really accurate.

218
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,390
She's improving.

219
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,580
She ranked second in the class.

220
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,720
Mom, can you stop worrying?

221
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,590
I'll personally supervise Wenwen's studies,

222
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,070
so rest assured.

223
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,510
She's definitely

224
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,120
going to a top 985 university.

225
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,040
Alright.

226
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,010
You can rest now.

227
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,750
You all drive me crazy.

228
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,540
I'm done.

229
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,110
What are you staring at?

230
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,840
Are you dumb?

231
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,560
No.

232
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,450
I...

233
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,070
I'm recalling the basketball moves.

234
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,520
Let me show you.

235
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,410
Wei Xing.

236
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,200
Wei Xing.

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,670
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

238
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,470
Are you okay?

239
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,380
I'm fine.

240
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,920
Let me see if it's swollen.

241
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,870
How can it be swollen from just a hitting.

242
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,180
Let me get you some medicine, otherwise...

243
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,910
No need.

244
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,590
Let me see.

245
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,580
So, this is what you call spinning the ball.

246
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,800
Is...

247
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,270
Is it really that scary?

248
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,450
No.

249
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,120
How...

250
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,290
Diqiu,

251
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,790
the power's out.

252
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,720
Dad, Mom.

253
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,280
Nothing.

254
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,990
Nothing.

255
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,360
It's raining.

256
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,670
Mom, it hurts.

257
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,350
I brought you

258
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,190
this candle.

259
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,720
This one.

260
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,310
Mom.

261
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,190
Dad. Dad.

262
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,300
Dad, listen to me.

263
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,820
No need to close the door.

264
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
It's fortunate for your Wang family that

265
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,470
Wei Xing can take a liking to Diqiu.

266
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,350
Come on, can you speak louder?

267
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,950
At least leave me some face.

268
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,710
When Luo Mei was alive,

269
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,280
they were practically promised to each other.

270
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,610
Even Wei didn't object.

271
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,560
That's just a joke.

272
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,050
I don't want to talk to you.

273
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,660
Honey, that's not what I meant.

274
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,300
I mean

275
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,040
I didn't realize it before.

276
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,250
Light the candles.

277
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,610
Yes. Light the candle.

278
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,660
Okay.

279
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,390
Slowly.

280
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,430
Report to Han Sir,

281
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,510
I've discovered that the target male and female.

282
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,420
I don't know what kind of deal they're making.

283
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,900
Are you done nagging?

284
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,810
Don't rush,

285
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,940
report to Sir first.

286
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,520
Report to Chief Shi,

287
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,270
I've found two suspects.

288
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,640
How to deal with them?

289
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,260
Interrogation begins.

290
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,550
Yes, sir.

291
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,590
Wait, but you...

292
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,920
You're the suspect.

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,610
It’s not your turn to speak.

294
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,420
Chief,

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,620
they seem to conduct some secretive transaction

296
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,950
without our knowledge.

297
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,780
Secret transaction?

298
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,060
What kind of secret transaction?

299
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,520
Tell us.

300
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,680
Why are you three here?

301
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,990
My dad isn't home,

302
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,670
so I'm bored being alone.

303
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,530
What about you?

304
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,230
There's a power outage, and the bookstore is closed.

305
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,270
Go back.

306
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,430
I'm studying hard.

307
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,150
You?

308
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,630
Studying?

309
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,230
I just heard

310
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,350
Auntie and Uncle talking about

311
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,790
arranged marriage.

312
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,240
Shut up!

313
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,190
Stay.

314
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,830
Stay!

315
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,550
Stay here.

316
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,690
Wei Xing,

317
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,820
let's sleep together tonight.

318
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,420
Okay.

319
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,190
Diqiu,

320
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,630
let's sleep together tonight.

321
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
Sleep together, Diqiu.

322
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,670
Please let me go.

323
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,070
I only have a single bed.

324
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,080
I can't sleep

325
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,040
lying like this.

326
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,160
There's 'Rainbow Cat and Blue Rabbit: The Seven Heroes' under the bed.

327
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
You guys can read.

328
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,200
Boys are so childish.

329
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,600
You're still reading cartoons in high school.

330
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,530
Let me clarify,

331
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,470
this is called martial arts.

332
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,350
I have to admit,

333
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,870
although it's animated,

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
the story content is still very inspirational.

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,670
Yeah.

336
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,110
A cat can be so handsome.

337
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,350
It inspired my dream to roam the world,

338
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,210
helping the weak and fighting for justice.

339
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,690
No wonder

340
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,250
you've always been so meddlesome since childhood.

341
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,070
But you threw your idol under the bed.

342
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,850
Because this real world

343
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,330
doesn't need a brave hero.

344
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,980
I just had to reluctantly abandon my sword.

345
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,750
Heroes don't necessarily need swords.

346
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,850
You could be a journalist,

347
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,190
uncovering the truth.

348
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,070
Like

349
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,840
Sa from 'Today's Legal Report,'

350
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,170
he's also a kind of hero.

351
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,980
Then I'm going to

352
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,160
'Super Girl,'

353
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,800
become a singing and dancing girl,

354
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,040
release albums,

355
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,850
and act in TV dramas.

356
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,820
As for me,

357
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,020
I haven't decided yet,

358
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,110
but I want to pursue

359
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,040
something related to literature.

360
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,030
I will

361
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,910
follow my dad's plan,

362
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,690
inherit the family business,

363
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,910
and become like the second generation

364
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,070
of Warren Buffett or Bill Gates.

365
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,590
You're the one who loves having a big dream.

366
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,510
Wei Xing,

367
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,850
what about you?

368
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,020
I'll keep it simple.

369
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,310
I want to join a dance troupe

370
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,190
after graduating from college.

371
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,510
Look.

372
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,190
It's still Wei Xing who's the most down-to-earth

373
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,910
among us.

374
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,250
Doesn't Ke be down-to-earth?.

375
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,030
Yeah.

376
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm not bad either.

377
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,150
Gosh.

378
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,300
It's so delicious.

379
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,530
Tingting.

380
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,280
Wei Xing.

381
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,800
Have a roasted sausage.

382
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,630
You two are really enthusiastic fans of Wei Xing.

383
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,110
Ke.

384
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,150
Treat me?

385
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,740
You're so generous.

386
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,430
Take one, Wei Xing.

387
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,650
Chew.

388
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,480
Swallow it.

389
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,360
The sausage isn't for free.

390
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
We have a purpose.

391
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,690
Fine.

392
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,840
Come back to the bookstore with me.

393
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,750
Let's go.

394
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,070
Let's go, Wei Xing.

395
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,800
Wei Xing, go.

396
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,310
Bro,

397
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm counting on you.

398
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,550
Show me your answer of the last question.

399
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,310
Learn it yourself.

400
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,990
Why?

401
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,360
How about you help me with the essay then?

402
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,130
Wang Diqiu,

403
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,490
if you keep doing like this, I won't talk to you anymore.

404
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,090
What garbage male lead

405
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,760
and novels, ruining my youth.

406
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,720
You came here at night

407
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,400
just to rant about a novel?

408
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,390
Why are men so

409
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,860
blind these days?

410
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,150
I, such a beautiful girl, am right in front of them

411
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,000
and they don't know how to appreciate.

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,310
Are you talking about the novel

413
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,270
or Wang Diqiu and others?

414
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,200
Of course I’m talking about novels

415
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,730
and also about Wang Diqiu and others.

416
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,480
I've been dressing up all day,

417
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,220
and they still call me brother.

418
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,190
That's too much.

419
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,350
How about I call them over

420
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,440
and each of them writes

421
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,790
a 500-word short essay

422
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,550
praising you?

423
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,550
What do you think?

424
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,390
Forget it.

425
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,550
Anyway, the male lead in my heart

426
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,830
isn't like them.

427
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,190
Male lead in your heart?

428
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,230
Tingting.

429
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,790
Are you

430
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,830
starting to think about dating?

431
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,430
I haven't had my first love yet.

432
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,300
I also want to experience

433
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,430
the bitterness of love like in novels.

434
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,760
I've never seen someone so masochistic like you.

435
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,620
We're like two extremes.

436
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,730
You're not short of admirers,

437
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,870
you don't even know

438
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,730
how much confidence it gives to be liked by someone.

439
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,430
With so many people liking you,

440
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,490
do you like anyone?

441
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't have time to think about it.

442
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,350
I just want to

443
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,440
focus on dancing

444
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,870
and getting into a university in Beijing.

445
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,920
You only think about studying,

446
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,780
while I'm thinking about dating.

447
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,770
People are really different.

448
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,690
I don't know what I'll do in the future.

449
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,110
It's okay.

450
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,230
It doesn't matter if you can't figure it out.

451
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,870
We can learn together first.

452
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,600
Let's start by memorizing this Chinese text.

453
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,270
What are you writing?

454
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,630
Today's essay.

455
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,650
Let me see.

456
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,310
You've written it really well.

457
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,920
Why don't you write a novel?

458
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,150
Anyway, I don't have any novels to read

459
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,150
recently.

460
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,670
These are just random writings I do.

461
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,910
Write it.

462
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,350
Please.

463
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,560
Please. Please.

464
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,390
Write it.

465
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,840
Write it down.

466
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,350
All right.

467
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,420
Since you are so pitiful today,

468
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,270
I will

469
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,270
reluctantly

470
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,160
promise you.

471
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,790
Don't try to change the subject.

472
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,390
Let's start memorizing now.

473
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,530
This sesame ball

474
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,700
is really unlucky.

475
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,710
Who are you trying to scare in the middle of the night?

476
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,640
I'll just scare the wits out of you.

477
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,430
Actually, your sesame ball looks pretty good,

478
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,830
it suits your round face.

479
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,710
What?

480
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,400
Why did you choose C for this question?

481
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,190
Well, I thought...

482
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,070
This...

483
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,060
Yes.

484
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,390
This is wrong too.

485
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,830
Wei Xing,

486
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,390
what are you writing?

487
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,720
Nothing.

488
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,830
Just a collection of wrong answers.

489
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,390
Wei Xing, you're writing a collection of wrong answers?

490
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,750
Share it with us.

491
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,290
Let me have a look.

492
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,860
Your notebook is pretty nice.

493
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,990
Share it with us.

494
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,450
Your collection of wrong answers must be very comprehensive.

495
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,430
Actually, Wei Xing's collection of wrong answers...

496
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,270
Wei Xing,

497
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,200
have you finished reading my collection of wrong answers?

498
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,210
You've had it for so long.

499
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,210
Give it back to me.

500
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,240
I've almost finished reading it.

501
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,120
Thank you,

502
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,940
Jiang Wenwen.

503
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,690
So, this collection of wrong answers belongs to Jiang Wenwen.

504
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,380
Forget it.

505
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,980
She won't lend it to me.

506
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,050
I think so.

507
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,010
She's usually so cold.

508
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,470
I don't dare to talk to her.

509
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,980
I've also collected some wrong answers and key questions.

510
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,170
I can lend them to you.

511
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,800
Do you guys need them?

512
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,930
We really need them!

513
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,310
This time we're saved!

514
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,950
Saved!

515
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,530
Even he got this one wrong.

516
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,710
Good afternoon, everyone.

517
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,630
Welcome to Xinghe Literature Column.

518
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,610
I'm today's host,

519
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,670
Guo Ting.

520
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,030
Today, I want to share a book with you

521
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,630
called "Reminiscences of Old Times in the Southern City".

522
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,170
[Aspiring to Serve the Motherland]

523
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,300
Thank you.

524
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,750
Jiang Wenwen

525
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,480
may seem tough,

526
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
but she's actually helped me a lot of times.

527
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,790
Yeah,

528
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,110
she's really nice.

529
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,510
Let's go.

530
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,310
Let's go.

531
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,480
Excuse me,

532
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,480
are you still open for business?

533
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,950
Yes.

534
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,520
What do you need?

535
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,290
I can help you.

536
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,170
It's okay, I can browse on my own.

537
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,250
I just need these two books.

538
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,930
Thirty.

539
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,270
Thank you.

540
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,960
What's Jiawawa up to,

541
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,090
calling the three of us out on weekend?

542
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,670
I heard my uncle suddenly brought a few dresses.

543
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,200
Probably she wanted to show off in front of us.

544
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,150
Then shouldn't she

545
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,610
show off in front of girls?

546
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,120
Wei Xing,

547
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,670
you look so beautiful in this dress.

548
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,230
Yes.

549
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,370
I feel like we can shoot magazines.

550
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,880
Look at me.

551
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,440
Tingting,

552
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,090
what kind of makeup is this?

553
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,950
Why did you make your face look like a monkey's butt?

554
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,510
This is the trendiest makeup of the year.

555
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,430
You redneck!

556
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,930
Then why did you wear two

557
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,260
two identical dresses?

558
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,270
Don't you know sister outfit?

559
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,490
Have you ever thought about something serious?

560
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,620
If you and Wei Xing wear the same dress,

561
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,770
the comparison is quite obvious.

562
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,990
Come in.

563
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,290
Wei Xing, why are you here?

564
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,010
Because

565
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,980
someone was unhappy,

566
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,630
so I came to cheer her up.

567
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,750
Have you finished writing the novel?

568
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,430
Not yet.

569
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,470
I've just written three chapters.

570
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,600
I'll show you first.

571
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,270
You... Don't read it now.

572
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,510
Read after I leave.

573
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,750
It's too awkward to

574
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,510
read it in front of me.

575
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,870
There's nothing to be shy about.

576
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,000
Or I'll take it away.

577
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,960
I don't read now.

578
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,870
Wei Xing,

579
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,310
how about you take this dress?

580
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,310
But isn't this the dress you've been waiting for so long?

581
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,640
I have too many dresses.

582
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,350
And I don't look good in it.

583
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,600
Take it. You look good in it.

584
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,790
Okay.

585
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,540
I'll take it back.

586
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,900
It's okay.

587
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,680
Trigonometric functions are functions.

588
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,210
With quadrant symbols as coordinate annotations.

589
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,540
Function graphs.
