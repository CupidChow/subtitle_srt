Go back to your room.

5

What are you waiting for?

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,390
I've finished my homework.

Can't you review it when you're done?

9

Listen to your mom.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,150
I'll watch a little longer.

Don't burn me.

Don't you trust me?

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,710
It's been more than ten years.
I've never made any mistakes.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,840

17

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,780

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,790
sent me some important work today.

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,270
You got some important work?

22
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,590
You've been an ordinary worker

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,810
in a factory all your life,

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,239
and you're going to soar in your old age?

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,250
Mom,

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,060
how did you fall in love with my dad?

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,670
How could you say that? How rude.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,870
I'm just curious.

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,070
Brat, let me tell you.

30
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,510
You tore our marriage certificate,

31
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,039
I haven't settled the account for you.

32
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,610
Well...

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Tingting was also involved in that.

34
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,510
He ordered it.

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,160
You're the only one who can pretend to be innocent.

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,620
You can't even shut your mouth

Diqiu.

41
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,320
I guess the poem for the final exam

42
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,920
should be Su Shi's lyrics.

43
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,430
You need to memorize it.

44
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,110
I've memorized it all night.

45
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,000
I need to relax before the exam.

46
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,240
Stop staring at me.

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,040
There's a paper on top and
an answer key on the bottom.

48
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,430
The hearing test begins now.

49
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,170
Excuse me, can you tell me how much the shirt is?

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,930
Yes, it's nine fifteen.

51
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,550
The price of the shirt is 9 pounds 15 pence.

52
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,690
So you chose C

53
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,820
and mark it on the test paper.

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,390
Now you have five seconds

55

Jianmin

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,190
had a potluck dinner
at the factory in the evening,

61
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,090
so he won't come back for dinner.

62
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,420

70

Today I'll tell you what business law is.

71
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,340
The so-called business law is

72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,870
when we put goods

73
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,300
in the counters

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,760
and wait for customers to buy them.

75
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,750
Then we won't be able to sell it.

76
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,409
The money in the pocket will be less.

77
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,210
The second trade law is

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,990
just backpacking and delivering.

79
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,290
What is it?

80
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,659
You deliver the goods

81
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,190
to someone else's house.

82
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,230
And?

83
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,760
What should you do？

84
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,960
Promote it to others.

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,690
That's a little bit more money earned,

86
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,060
but it's not enough.

87
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,630
Your income is not doubled.

88
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,480
It's not like the so-called
geometric multiplier.

89
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,860
What is geometric multiplier?

90
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,740
It's when one becomes two, two becomes four,

91
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,390
four to eight, eight to sixteen.

92
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,270
Confess and you'll be lenient.

93
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,430
How was the exam?

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,000
It's very easy, of course.

and x0 is a zero of the function y
equal to f(x) minus ex,

174
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,350
what should be done

175
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,950
with this question odd function?

176
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,590
Wei Xing.

177
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,480
I understand.

178
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,480
In that case,

179
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,930
we can take it in, right?

180
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,670
Like this, right?

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,880
I see.

182
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,340
And is there an intersection

183
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,620
between this zero and this odd function?

184
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,080
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

185
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,250
There is a building on the next street over,

186
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,570
and I went to hand out flyers,

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
and they blew me out hard.

188
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,670
What's going on?

189
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,270
Is it the innermost building?

190
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,780
Yes, what's going on?

191
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,560
I'm telling you

192
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,680
that building has a lot of people coming in and out of it.

193
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,900
So mysterious.

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,110
Nobody asked?

195
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,860
That's just nosy.

196
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,670
You're right.

197
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm going back to take care of the kid.

198
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,660
You two talk. Have some sunflower seeds.

199
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,910
- I’m leaving.
- Take care.

200
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,510
I have to go.

201
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,110
I'll send out leaflets. Bye.

202
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,950
See you.

203
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,550
Okay.

204
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,950
What are you doing?

205
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,140
Make a call.

206
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,430
Hello.

207
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,740
Who is it?

208
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,730
Open the door.

209
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm the landlord.

210
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,030
Keep working.

211
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,290
We're from the neighborhood committee.

212
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,600
Someone said that your personnel are complicated.

213
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,980
They asked us to come and have a look.

214
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,380
We've called the police.

215
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
The police will be here soon.

216
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,450
Don't move!

217
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,450
Don't move!

218
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,580
This...

219
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,630
This guy's still trying to run.

220
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,390
Wang Jianmin.

221
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,290
The bank called us to move out.

222
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,230
I can only ask you

223
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,230
to help clean up.

224
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,770
It's okay, dad.

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,940
I think it's good to mortgage everything.

226
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,070
Then we'll have money to
pay back Uncle Li and the others.

227
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,290
And being debt free is a relief.

228
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,650
If we lose the money,

229
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,780
we can earn it again.

230
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,420
Let's go.

231
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,660
Wang Jianmin.

232
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,070
How dare you!

233
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,630
You...

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,200
You kept your job loss

235
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,290
from me for so long.

236
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,080
Calm down.

237
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,190
I can't. You're driving me crazy.

238
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,110
I really didn't know before.

239
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,630
I'm just a worker.

240
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,250
I didn't know it was possible
to lie on the phone.

241
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,910
You're making excuses, aren't you?

242
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,230
No.

243
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,270
Lower your voice.

244
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,070
I didn't know until I woke up
this morning and saw the flyer.

245
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,750
I was going to call the police,

246
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
but you rushed in.

247
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,500
We've been together for over ten years.

248
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,820
Don't you know

249
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,630
what kind of person I am?

250
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,400
Go.

251
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,190
Don't let the innocent suffer.

252
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,550
Come here.

253
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,030
Did I mention you?

254
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,630
Wang Huanyu.

255
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,550
What about the paper?

256
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,800
What's your class rank?

257
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,060
What's the grade rank?

258
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,280
Hurry up. Don't make mom angry.

259
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,890
What are you waiting for?

260
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,470
Hurry up.

261
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,510
Tell me.

262
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,170
What was the score on the test?

263
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,650
Hurry up.

264
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,200
You're waiting for me to call, aren't you?

265
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,690
Ranked 460th in the grade and fifth from the bottom of the class.

266
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,360
Look at him.

267
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,370
Wang Huan Yu, Wang Jian Min.

268
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,170
Are you two trying to piss me off?

269
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,410
What have I done wrong?

270
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,670
I'm stuck with you two.

271
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,330
You're all

272
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,830
such a pain in the ass.

273
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,160
Shall we go in?

274
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,670
Dad.

275
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,500
We're not going in.

276
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,010
This kind of thing can only be avoided.

277
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,000
Going in will only add to the chaos.

278
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,890
Let's go.

279
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,670
Dad.

280
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,480
Are we going to

281
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,830
sleep on the street tonight?

282
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,410
Can I let you sleep on the street?

283
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,960
Let's go.

284
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,240
Dad.

285
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
Why don't we stay with my mom?

286
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,450
No.

287
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,300
I can't let your mother know about this.

288
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,850
It's good.

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,730
Shuaishuai.

290
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,750
Put your stuff anywhere.

291
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,700
Okay.

292
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,420
I'll make the bed first.

293
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,660
Go to bed early.

294
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,140
Take a shower first.

295
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,260
You have to go to school tomorrow.

296
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,670
Okay.

297
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,710
Dad, look.

298
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
I brought a lot of food

299
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,370
and a hot kettle.

300
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,770
What's wrong, dad?

301
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,280
Shuaishuai.

302
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,190
It's my fault.

303
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
You've never

304
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,000
suffered like this before, right?

305
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,390
That was then, this is now.

306
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,110
And I'm a boy.

307
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,650
I'm not that particular.

308
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,310
A bed to sleep on would be nice.

309
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,120
How about

311
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,320
you stay with your mom?

312
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,880
I thought you

313
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,830
wouldn't let me tell her.

314
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,000
Just tell her I'm on a business trip

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,730
and won't be back for a while.

316
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,110
She doesn't care about me anyway.

317
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,170
Go.

318
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,140
I'm not going.

319
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,650
Shuaishuai.

320
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,450
Be good.

321
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,640
You go over there tonight.

322
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,440
Here, take it.

323
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm not going.

324
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,800
I want to stay with you.

325
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,540
All these years,

326
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,940
you've been busy outside

327
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,600
and you don't have time for me.

328
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,080
I think this place is good anyway.

329
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,850
Consider it as compensation.

330
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,220
Don't try to get rid of me again.

331
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:51,900
OK.

332
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,360
Fine.

333
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,090
Go inside.

334
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,300
Make way.

335
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,740
Tonight,

336
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,790
we'll sleep like this.

337
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,610
Dad,

338
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,960
do you think

339
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,470
this house is gonna leak?

340
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,660
The rent

341
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,360
is not cheap.

342
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,680
♫ I want a window♫

343
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,210
It shouldn't be leaking.

344
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,800
♫to see the sunlight♫

Let's eat

517
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,870
Seafood flavored instant noodles

518
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,000
and pickled radish.

519
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,870
Tomorrow,

520
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,560
let's try the braised pork flavored instant noodles
with pickled radish.

521
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,890
The day after tomorrow,

522
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,480
let's try chicken and mushroom
flavored instant noodles

523
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
with pickled radish.

524
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,450
Radish.

525
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't want to see radish again.

526
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,100
Stop talking.

527
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,300
Use a book to cover the instant noodles.

528
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,750
You're still learning this one.

529
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,410
Change one.

530
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,740
No, I'm not going to study abroad.

531
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,680
What?

532
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,390
After three years of preparation,

533
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,250
you're not going to study abroad?

534
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,920
I has been working for so many years.

535
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,360
There's always a way.

536
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,580
At worst...

537
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,080
At worst,

538
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,730
borrow some more money.

539
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,310
Who would lend it to you when you're bankrupt?

540
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,870
Kid,

541
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,000
Are you looking down on your dad?

542
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,680
I don't.

543
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm just explaining the reality.

544
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,470
Besides,

545
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,590
who says foreign universities are always better?

546
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,520
Many domestic universities are better than abroad.

547
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,880
Li.

548
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,450
What happened to Han?

549
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,410
Don’t lie to me.

550
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,770
You know my temper.

551
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,350
I've thought about it.

552
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,630
I plan to take the college entrance exam

553
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,370
and apply for finance subject.

554
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,810
With your son's IQ,

555
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,130
we'll

556
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
make a comeback.

557
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,310
Dad.

558
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,430
Stop sighing.

559
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,980
Sighing will be even worse.

560
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,450
You're right.

561
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,960
I'm so worried about this.

562
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,540
Han Yanda!

563
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,610
Come out, Han Yanda!

564
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,470
Your mom.

565
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,250
Mom is here.

566
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,010
Don't open the door.

567
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,380
If I don't open the door,
my mom will break the door.

568
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,360
Dad,

569
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,640
there are things you can't hide.

570
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,920
Mom.

571
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,950
Mom, what are you doing?

572
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,670
Go home.

573
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,110
If you have money for the landlord,

574
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,470
why don't you just give me the money?

575
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,330
Let me help you.

576
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
Don't try to flatter me.

577
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,510
If I hadn't called your
Uncle Li and Uncle Lin,

578
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,860
how long were you going to hide it from me?

579
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,790
I'll deal with you when we get home.

580
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,550
Radish with instant noodles.

581
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,990
How could you swallow it?

582
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,350
Han Yanda.

583
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,820
Aren't you going to enter
the catering industry?

584
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,200
Is this how you take care of our son?

585
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,390
I'm just trying to see

586
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,820
how eating more radishes might help.

587
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,770
Why are you standing there?

588
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,030
Do you want me to clean it up alone?

589
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,430
Don't you have work to do?

590
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,640
Can a towel be wrapped
with underwear and socks?

591
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,270
Don't you have any common sense?

592
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,110
You're right.

593
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,760
Put the towel here.

594
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,500
I'll take my own underwear.

595
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,860
I tried.

596
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,750
I can't help it if it doesn't work.

597
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,280
You always say that.

598
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,860
Ask yourself, did you really work hard?

599
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,420
I really hate it when you're like this.

600
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,270
Wei Xing.

601
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,240
Wake up, Diqiu.

602
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,920
Get up.

603
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Get up.

604
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
Brat.

605
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,370
Why are you getting mad at me when your exam is so bad?

606
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,830
Mom,

607
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,180
I need to go out for something.

608
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,440
Where are you going?

609
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,630
The...

610
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,330
Both of them are giving me a hard time.

611
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,540
What are you doing, mom?

612
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,130
Take it.

613
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,510
Don't give it to me.

614
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,970
Take it yourself.

615
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Thank you, mom.

616
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Mom is the best.

617
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,720
Director! Director!

618
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,410
Why are you here again?

619
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,840
Jinzhi.

620
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,970
You're here.

621
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,040
What's wrong? Did you quarrel again?

622
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,890
Wang lost his job.

623
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,600
Bad mood.

624
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,590
Work is work.

625
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,670
Life is life. Keep it separate.

626
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,470
Han and I

627
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,270
got divorced in the first place

628
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,830
when work and life got mixed up.

629
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,310
Why did I fall in love with Wang Jianmin?

630
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,880
How would I know?

631
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,400
But now that I think about it,

632
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,140
how did I fall for Han Yanda?

633
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,410
Coming.

634
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,910
Sister Jin, give me something to eat.

635
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,930
It's cold today. I'll make you a casserole.

636
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,410
OK.

637
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,030
Zhong.

638
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,470
How's it going?

639
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,320
I got fired from the factory.

640
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,520
I'm looking for a job.

641
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,230
The big environment is not good now.

642
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,110
Don't worry.

643
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,370
I shouldn't have paid the benefits.

644
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,410
Spending money for nothing.

645
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,200
What did you say?

646
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,510
What benefits?

647
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,920
Wang Jianmin, you're usually a wimp.

648
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:43,650
What?

649
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,210
Are you here to be a hero?

650
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,550
I didn't.

651
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,580
I just want the money back

652
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,510
and

653
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,210
return their money to them.

654
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,320
Let me ask you.

655
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,600
Did I steal the money from you?

656
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,710
Did you give me this money?

657
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,550
That's it.

658
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,120
It's all voluntary.

659
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,500
No.

660
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,780
It's all voluntary.

661
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,990
No, I didn't.

662
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:06,690
What?

663
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,530
This is your hint.

664
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,840
Who hinted you?

665
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,700
Who hinted you?

666
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,590
Who hinted you?

667
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,120
You hinted that we'd give you money.

668
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,750
This is our hard-earned money.

669
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,550
Wang Jianmin,

670
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,510
don't say it out of conscience.

671
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,440
All these years,

672
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,230
I've never seen you so tough.

673
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,960
I want money.

674
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,440
What money?

675
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,750
What are you doing?

676
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,010
What money do you want?

677
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,130
What are you doing?

678
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,370
Why did you push Wang?

679
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,360
Yes, he pushed me.

680
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,390
I didn't push hard.

681
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,470
You didn't?

682
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,990
He looks fine.

683
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,200
What if there's internal injury?

684
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,510
Yes.

685
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,300
I don't want to talk to you.

686
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,050
I didn't want to talk to you yet.

687
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,030
Hurry up.

688
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,550
Return the money to everyone.

689
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,930
What are you two doing?

690
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,320
Are you rebelling?

691
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,190
You know my temper.

692
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,630
Yes.

693
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,750
If you give me the money today,

694
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,270
I'll take Wang and leave.

695
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,550
If you don't give it to me,

696
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,560
What are you trying to do?

697
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,960
I'll yell here every day.

698
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,140
Yes.

699
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,730
I remember now.

700
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,700
The director must have used

701
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,170
the favor money he took as private money.

702
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,560
Who takes private money?

703
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,190
I need to talk to your wife.

704
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,500
I'll give it to you.

705
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,710
OK?

706
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,639
That's the way it should be.

707
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:14,940
Great!

708
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm not done with you yet.

709
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,909
Don't get close.

710
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,719
How can you change your mind so quickly?

711
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,020
Any questions?

712
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,170
Let me tell you.

713
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,560
We're lucky this time,

714
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,960
but not the next.

715
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,389
Don't be so silly.

716
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
My wife is right.

717
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,900
How dare you ask for the money?

718
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,330
Today is our wedding anniversary.

719
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,639
I want my money back to buy you a gift.

720
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,610
You remember today is
our wedding anniversary?

721
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,670
How could I forget?

722
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,870
I thought you were mad
at me after what I said.

723
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,440
How dare I?

724
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,310
No.

725
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,690
That's not what I meant.

726
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,960
I mean

727
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,830
you are right.

728
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,590
It's for my own good.

729
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,070
If I can't even understand this,

730
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,690
I've been with you all these years for nothing.

731
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,100
That's true.

732
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,560
You went to ask for the money?

733
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,690
Who else could it be

734
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,360
if not me?

735
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,230
Will Wang Jianmin

736
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,100
succeed?

737
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,480
Dad.

738
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,050
Let me pour you some.

739
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,340
What happened between you and Han?

740
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,380
What do you think?

741
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,210
Just pick him up and live with me.

742
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,120
I think there's hope for your remarriage.

743
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,440
What are you talking about?

744
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,080
It's all for our child's sake.

745
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,020
Give Shuaishuai some food.

746
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,260
Let me say something.

747
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,080
Today is Huiqin and Jianmin's wedding anniversary.

748
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,480
Let's raise our glasses.

749
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,460
Thank you.

750
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,710
Come on.

751
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,820
Forever and ever.

752
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,060
Let me say something too.

753
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,930
First of all, I'd like to thank Jinzhi

754
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,180
for preparing this great meal.

755
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,360
And then?

756
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:04,860
Today

757
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,390
is not only our wedding anniversary,

758
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,230
but also the wedding anniversary

759
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,000
of Jinzhi and Han.

760
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,460
What are you doing?

761
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,000
What's that for?

762
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,510
Mom,

763
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,450
you and Aunt Li

764
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,420
get the marriage certificate on the same day?

765
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,930
Yes.

766
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,140
Your mom and I had the blind date

767
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,510
on the same day.

768
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,190
And in the end,

769
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,710
we got the marriage certificate

770
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,790
on the same day.

771
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,090
What are you doing?

772
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,620
Awesome!

773
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,190
Dad.

774
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,950
All right.

775
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,340
All you do is gossip about me.

776
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,100
Come on.

777
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,770
Cheers.

778
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,440
Cheers.

779
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,490
Come on.

780
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,500
Clink with me.

781
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,270
I don't want to.

782
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,250
Where are you going?

783
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,400
Dad, I need to go to the toilet.

784
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,680
What's wrong?

785
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,480
Having trouble with Wei Xing again?
