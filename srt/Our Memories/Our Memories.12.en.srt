I'm here to ask for a pot of hot water.

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,410
I just boiled it.

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,450
Take a pot back.

Thanks to Wei Xing,

14
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,530
That's because...

15
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,770
Diqiu is sensible.

16
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,900

You don't understand.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,050

What?

We had a deal.

Wang,

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,310
Don't always think about my daughter.

You said you made a lot of money.

I'm just being shameless.

Besides,

37

- Well…
- Be happy.

It's just to make the kids happy,

What are you doing?

178
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,080
Learning from the heroine of idol drama,

179
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,010
falling into someone else's arms.

180
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,760
It will be great if there is BGM now...

181
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,550
Forget it.

182
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,450
I can't care too much.

183
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,570
I like you!

184
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,630
Idiot.

185
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,960
For something like a confession,

186
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,560
how can I ask the girl to do it?

187
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,070
Did you lose in the game 'Truth or Dare'?

188
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,530
No.

189
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,350
I really like you. I really...

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,560
Calm down.

191
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,260
Guo Ting.

192
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,480
Shall we play a game?

193
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,090
Okay.

194
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,070
Well...

195
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,530
Close your eyes first.

196
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,390
Then count down to three.

197
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,920
I'll start counting.

198
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,740
One.

199
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,240
Two.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,610
Three.

201
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,910
Han Shuai.

202
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,330
Han Shuai.

203
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
Happy New Year.

204
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,410
Okay, bye.

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,970
Happy New Year.

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,920
You're here.

207
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,270
Happy New Year.

208
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,520
Your house is so clean.

209
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,230
Yeah.

210
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,120
Diqiu.

211
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,050
Tingting.

212
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,030
Get up.

213
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,620
Don't wake them up.

214
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,880
It's holiday. Let them have a nice sleep.

215
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,790
Have a seat.

216
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,550
I brought something for you.

217
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,510
Every time you visit,

218
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,110
you always bring so many things.

219
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't be so polite.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,750
Take it.

221
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,270
Yes, right.

222
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,550
He doesn't come often.

223
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,790
Get up, kids.

224
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,550
How are you doing?

225
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,940
Get up.

226
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,170
- You’re getting younger.
- Yeah.

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,040
You look good.

228
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,940
Yes.

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,390
- Have something to eat.
- Thank you.

230
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,710
This tangerine is so sweet.

231
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,570
Here, take one.

232
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,990
The kids are coming down.

233
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,190
They're coming down.

234
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,980
Look.

235
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,790
This is Tingting.

236
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,510
Greet Aunt Liu.

237
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,580
Happy New Year.

238
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,230
Why is it so high?

239
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,310
Diqiu.

240
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,160
How are your academic results?

241
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,460
Not bad.

242
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,070
Have you done your homework?

243
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

244
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,740
Come on.

245
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,720
Take it.

246
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,330
Take it.

247
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,610
It's not suitable.

248
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,150
Annual

249
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,510
fixed process

250
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,230
is still wonderful.

251
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,990
In my opinion,

252
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,390
this

253
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,470
Zhang Sanfeng's Tai Chi push

254
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,940
is not as good as them

255
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,720
Well,

256
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,200
it’s not lively.

257
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,960
Han Shuai, get up.

258
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,680
No.

259
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,220
Why are you here?

260
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,670
Hurry up.

261
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,920
Tell me.

262
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,360
What happened?

263
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,870
Don't mention it.

264
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,480
All my relatives are here
early in the morning.

265
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,340
Look at my face.

266
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,150
My face is swollen.

267
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,670
It seems

268
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,550
it's good to have less relatives.

269
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,770
I'm more miserable.

270
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,120
After my dad went bankrupt,

271
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,030
all my relatives

272
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,710
look at me like a poor cabbage.

273
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,860
I can't stand this atmosphere.

274
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,970
Look at you.

275
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,760
They're  just being kind.

276
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,870
Anyway,

277
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,830
I will never stay at home
during this winter break.

278
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,620
Do you remember

279
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,560
when the teacher
suggested
forming study groups before the holiday?

280
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,350
Yes.

281
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,150
How about starting tomorrow?

282
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,450
Sure.

283
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,240
I'll team up with Han Shuai.

284
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,750
I'm with Wenwen.

285
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,640
Well,

286
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,780
I’ll team up with Li Jin.

287
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,280
Didn’t we agree not to study with Li Jin?

288
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,810
Ms. Chen arranged it.

289
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,270
I had no choice.

290
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,220
I'm the poor cabbage in the ground.

291
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,850
How about this?

292
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
I'll give Tingting to you.

293
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,820
I can do it alone.

294
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,430
- Come with me.
- No.

295
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,670
Just say it here.

296
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,280
We're friends. There's no secret.

297
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
Fine. I'm not afraid anyway.

298
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,860
Yesterday, I...

299
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,470
Don't tell anyone

300
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
about a girl's thing.

301
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,880
Come out!

302
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,010
Just join my team.

303
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,790
Are you a dog?

304
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,170
I bite bad men.

305
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,160
What are you talking about?

306
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,190
I'm not a bad man.

307
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,630
I've been innocent since I was young

308
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,710
and have never been involved
in casual relationships.

309
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,440
Then why did you run yesterday?

310
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,630
You scared me.

311
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,980
Why? Am I not cute?

312
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,490
Where is Wangwang Snow Cake?

313
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,380
You're cute and nice.

314
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,230
But...

315
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,640
Thank you.

316
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,010
But you're not my type.

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,560
What type do you like?

318
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,950
Well...

319
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,270
Well...

320
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,140
Jingjing,

321
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,060
don't play your phone at home
during the whole winter break.

322
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Can't you teach your sister?

323
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,810
I've been in college for two years.

324
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,610
I've long forgotten
the knowledge of high school.

325
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,110
If so,

326
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,660
teach her some experiences
of the college entrance exam.

327
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,720
Isn't that enough?

328
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,890
Alright.

329
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,660
Wait.

330
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,280
Here.

331
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,650
Good girl.

332
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,210
Go.

333
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,280
Thank you.

334
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,340
Sister.

335
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,660
Do it yourself.

336
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,350
Sister,

337
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,910
I don't know how to solve this question.

338
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,550
Hello, sister.

339
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,030
Happy New Year.

340
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,880
My family is just like that.

341
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm bored to death.

342
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,839
I really want to start school early,

343
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,339
so that I can play with you.

344
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,240
How are you?

345
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,339
OK.

346
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,020
Let me tell you.

347
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,730
Once school starts,

348
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,170
we can go to that place.

349
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,530
Mom, wash your feet.

350
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,150
Come, sit down.

351
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,600
Grandma.

352
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,890
Grandma, have an orange.

353
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,810
Eat it. Be good.

354
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,880
My two daughters wash my feet.

355
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,660
How is the water temperature?

356
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,900
- Is it warm?
- Yes.

357
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,920
That means the folk prescription is good.

358
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:51,880
Soak your feet for a little longer.

359
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,680
Okay.

360
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,060
Sister.

361
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,640
Laishun and I have been away these years.

362
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,890
Thanks for taking care of mom and Tingting.

363
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,830
Thank you.

364
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,050
Look at you.

365
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,020
She's my biological mother.

366
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,040
Tingting is my niece.

367
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,740
I can take care of them every day.

368
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,150
It's my blessing.

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,330
Sister, you're so nice.

370
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,600
Grandma.

371
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,110
Why do you always listen to this song?

372
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,060
I like it.

373
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,700
This is the song
that Grandpa and Grandma fell in love.

374
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,270
- Really?
- Yes.

375
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
Grandpa and Grandma

376
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,730
met while watching the opera.

377
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,210
This is the opera played
on stage at that time.

378
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,670
So romantic.

379
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,960
Why haven't I heard this?

380
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
Grandma, tell me.

381
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,590
Don't listen to them.

382
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,950
Grandma is shy.

383
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,740
She's shy.

384
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,730
What?

385
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,960
- He confessed.
- He confessed.

386
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,630
Don't laugh.

387
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,890
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,090
I didn't have a chance.

389
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,150
Tingting,

390
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,070
You really dare to love and hate.

391
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,990
Yes.

392
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,260
If I were you, I wouldn't dare.

393
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,960
My mom will scold me if she knows.

394
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,130
What about Han Shuai?

395
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,060
How did he react?

396
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,690
He ran away.

397
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,840
I was sent a good guy card.

398
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,400
Why did he do this?

399
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,530
Tingting, how about this?

400
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,750
You get him first,

401
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,970
and then kick him.

402
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,070
That's right.

403
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,390
If one of the two is destined to get hurt,

404
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,570
I don't want that person to be you.

405
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,020
Sisters really stick together
through thick and thin.

406
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,230
I need your help.

407
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,170
What do you need us for?

408
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,010
Tell me.

409
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,380
Form a line.

410
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,660
There are four chairs on the table.

411
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,350
Control the vice president first.

412
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,150
Diqiu, Wenxi,

413
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,850
You put Li Jin in the middle.

414
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,670
As long as I sit next to the earth,

415
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,960
we boys will be in a row.

416
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,800
Then the vice president won't be able to touch Wei Xing.

417
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,930
I don't have to touch Tingting either.

418
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,490
Tomorrow...

419
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,520
Han Shuai will definitely work with Wang and Ke

420
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,480
to obstruct.

421
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,000
I need you to resolve their obstacles

422
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
and make sure I sit next to Han Shuai.

423
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,200
Don’t worry.

424
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,240
Leave it to us.

425
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,840
Okay, got it.

426
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,540
Wenke,

427
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,730
Aren't we a team?

428
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,200
Wenwen, sit over there.

429
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,730
We'll learn the same thing.

430
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,800
There are too many people.

431
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,810
And we can't put down the paper.

432
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,610
Let's sit over there.

433
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,200
Okay?

434
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,340
Let's go.

435
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,850
Wei Xing.

436
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,720
- This is my seat.
- This is my seat.

437
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,430
Wei Xing and I are the team recognized

438
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,590
by Ms. Chen.

439
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,390
Wei Xing carries the responsibility
to tutor me.

440
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,390
Vice President Li,
your grades are good enough.

441
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,850
Go away.

442
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,030
Sit over there.

443
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,680
Let's go.

444
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,100
Sit here.

445
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,370
Hello, Mr. Ye.

446
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
Hello, Miss Chen, right?

447
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,860
Have a seat.

448
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,590
Have a seat.

449
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,750
Come on.

450
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,710
Have a cake.

451
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,540
I know

452
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,880
your situation.

453
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,640
And me,

454
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,710
as you know...

455
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,280
How about this?

456
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,360
Let's...

457
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,810
Let's be together.

458
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,710
I...

459
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,310
Just met.

460
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.

461
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,690
Isn't this too fast?

462
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,380
No.

463
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,030
You're already 30.

464
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,690
It's already too late to give birth.

465
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,280
Let's talk about it for half a year.

466
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,880
Get engaged and get married.

467
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,200
Then try to have a child at 31.

468
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,820
You're saying I'm old.

469
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,430
This is the fact.

470
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,900
I should find someone suitable
and get married

471
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,030
and live my own life.

472
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,510
I'm here today for my mother's sake.

473
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,770
I want to

474
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,040
follow my heart.

475
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,030
Sorry.

476
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
Sorry, Mr. Ye.

477
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,470
I'll continue my life.

478
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Good luck.

479
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Miss Chen.

480
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,590
Good luck.

481
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,680
- Don’t…
- Let go of me.

482
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,190
- We haven’t finished talking.
- Let me go.

483
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,850
Who are you?

484
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,950
When a girl refuses,

485
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,880
a man's hand can't touch her.

486
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,610
Understand?

487
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,750
Let's go.

488
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,030
You're lying.

489
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,830
You have a boyfriend,

490
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,490
but still went on a blind date.

491
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,650
Well...

492
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,940
What are you doing?

493
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,940
There's nothing outside.

494
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,240
There's nothing.

495
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,230
You want to attract my attention

496
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,480
through this clumsy way.

497
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,590
I'm not that kind of person.

498
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,830
That's who you are.

499
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,200
Why do you let me know so many secrets?

500
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

501
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,760
Be careful, it's hot.

502
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,230
Mom.

503
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,980
I know. I'm not picky.

504
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,550
We are not suitable for each other.

505
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,210
Stop nagging me, okay?

506
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,990
If you keep nagging me,

507
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,940
I won't go home.

508
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,560
Bye. I'm hanging up.

509
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,840
What are you looking at?

510
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
That's my temper.

511
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,300
Don't you know at school?

512
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,520
Actually, I don't care
if I can get married or not.

513
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,830
She's always afraid that
I'll be lonely living alone

514
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,840
and can't get married when I'm old.

515
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,930
But I'm living a good life now.

516
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,770
I have students, friends,

517
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,640
and my favorite job.

518
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,890
That's great.

519
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,830
People have their own ideas.

520
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,470
Give them some time to accept it.

521
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,800
I know.

522
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,750
But I'm really

523
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,140
a little annoying.

524
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,680
So much.

525
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,310
Besides, how could I
possibly not get married?

526
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,650
That's right.

527
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,870
I'll marry you if you can't get married.

528
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,710
I know. You didn't mean it.

529
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,870
Ms. Chen.

530
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,030
I'm serious.

531
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,130
I'm telling the truth.

532
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,710
I've liked you since college.

533
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,660
When I was a freshman,

534
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,270
you were the senior
who welcomed the freshmen.

535
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,830
Me?

536
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,780
Yes.

537
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,360
Are you crazy?

538
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,750
Are you crazy?

539
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,650
What's wrong with liking you?

540
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,020
I...

541
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,930
Boss, do you like her?

542
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,590
Look.

543
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,820
He's too shy to say it.

544
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,240
Why did the car parking at our door?

545
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,050
Tingting.

546
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,810
Dad, mom.

547
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,680
Where are you going?

548
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,340
Something happened at the construction site.

549
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,550
We need to hurry back.

550
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,090
You only come back once a year,

551
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,170
and you're leaving so soon?

552
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,510
Tingting, the construction site

553
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,630
has not just happened.

554
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,880
In order to take care of your emotions,

555
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,200
we are here to be with you for several days,

556
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,420
but we can't delay
the construction site anymore.

557
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,950
Please understand us.

558
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,010
Be good, Tingting.

559
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,630
Mom and Dad,

560
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,780
I'll make it up to you in the future.

561
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,010
Be good.

562
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,450
Be good.

563
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,870
Tingting.

564
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,670
Mom and dad are leaving.

565
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,380
You must listen to your aunt at home,

566
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,490
and take good care of grandma.

567
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,870
Listen to your teachers at school.

568
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,050
Understand?

569
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,520
Don't let us worry about you, okay?

570
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,710
Okay?

571
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
My dear daughter.

572
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,160
Alright, honey.

573
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,860
Don't cry. We have to catch the train.

574
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,070
We'll be late.

575
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,590
Hurry up.

576
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,170
Honey, hurry up.

577
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,990
Mom.

578
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,660
We will make it up to you.

579
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,730
It's okay. I'm used to it.

580
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,060
Tingting!

581
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,420
Tingting.

582
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,880
Grandma has a lot of delicious food.

583
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,700
Tingting.

584
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,430
Mom.

585
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,640
I think she's asleep.

586
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,490
Don't worry.

587
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,380
Tingting is a sensible girl.

588
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,530
She can understand
her parents' difficulties.

589
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,750
Let's go back.

590
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,600
There's Diqiu.

591
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,360
Diqiu,

592
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,240
If your sister needs anything,

593
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,550
- Tell me.
- Okay.

594
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,710
I think it's fine.

595
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,650
Let's go, mom.

596
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,170
Who is it?

597
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,370
- Good morning, Chihuahua.
- What are you doing?

598
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,190
We're going out to play.

599
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,570
Everyone is waiting for you. Let's go.

600
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,910
I need to change.

601
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,780
We'll wait for you downstairs.

602
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,260
Okay.

603
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,000
Hurry up.

604
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,770
Hurry up.

605
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,790
By the way, what about this?

606
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,510
Not bad.

607
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
All right.

608
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,910
Mom,

609
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,940
Can I go to the amusement park?

610
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,810
No wonder

611
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,420
you've been working so hard these days.

612
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,020
That's because
you want to came out to have fun.

613
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,380
Just for one day. There's othing.

614
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,880
What do you mean nothing?

615
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,680
You might get wild after one day.

616
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,910
Why do you

617
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,270
always think

618
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,570
so seriously?

619
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,490
What's wrong with just one day?

620
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,480
What do you mean?

621
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,850
If she goes out for one day,

622
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,390
others have been studying
for one more day than her.

623
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,920
Maybe others will pass her.

624
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,400
What can she do?

625
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,420
Enough.

626
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,260
What? Just read your newspaper.

627
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,760
What are you doing here?

628
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,230
You don't care about family matters.

629
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,360
What are you doing here?

630
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,880
You...

631
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,000
are all right,

632
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,580
Go back and make another set.

633
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,470
Mom.

634
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,110
It doesn't matter.

635
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,170
She's different from you.

636
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,300
She'll slack off if you doesn't watch.

637
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,260
Don't go.

638
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,100
No.

639
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,350
Learning should combine work and rest.

640
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,080
It's good for her health
to get some fresh air.

641
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,680
Besides, Wenwen likes writing.

642
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,170
She needs to open her eyes when she writes.

643
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,480
You can't write well in your room all day.

644
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,610
Yes.

645
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,640
Mom.

646
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,130
But come back early after playing.

647
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,760
Don't stay at your classmate's.

648
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,090
- Okay, I know.
- And...

649
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,300
After playing...

650
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,470
What about you?

651
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,430
Write a 500-word article

652
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,930
for what you have seen today.

653
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,720
Leave the composition to me.

654
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,850
Got it, mom.

655
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,310
Okay, go ahead.

656
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,690
Sister,

657
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,310
thank you for helping me just now.

658
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,150
Thank you.

659
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,150
You didn't tell mom about me.

660
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,440
I'll help you this time

661

♫Where should the sun shine♫

662

- Go!
- Okay.

666
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,910
Slowly.

667

669

Tingting, be careful.

670
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,320
Be careful.

671

I'm so tired.

680
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,570
Are you okay?

681
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,480

I'm afraid someone might recognize you.

689
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,560

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,030
You want to take photos, right?

695
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,920
♫There's a kiss of clouds in the sky♫

696
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,830
Look.

697
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,690
Xiao Ke, take a photo for her.

698
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,800
♫I left a lot of traces of you too♫

699
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,610
Don't look back.

700
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,490
Shi Wenke, Wei Xing!

701
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,920
Let's go.

702
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,700
Wang Huanyu and the others are behind us.

703
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,250
- I want that balloon.
- Don’t look back.

704
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,070
There's a strange couple in front.

705
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,070
Why are they walking like crabs?

706
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,850
That's right. It's weird.

707
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,360
Stop talking behind my back.

708
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,030
- I want balloons.
- Let’s go.

709
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,630
- I want balloons.
- Let’s go.

710
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,060
Wenwen is really amazing.

711
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,969
I was the first.

712
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,400
I can't see anything.

713
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,940
I want to eat cotton candy.

714
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,710
Dear passengers, your destination is here.

715
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,989
My mom only gave me this little money.

716
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,070
Save it.

717
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,730
Here.

718
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,790
Thank you.

719
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,790
Tingting, don't eat.

720
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,719
Do a magic trick.

721
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,440
Do you believe

722
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,670
I can make the cotton candy disappear

723
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,070
in one second.

724
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,929
- How?
- Come on.

725
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:38,739
Look.

726
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,550
My cotton candy.
