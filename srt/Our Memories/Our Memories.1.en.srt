often speaks in a scholarly manner without being flashy.

Stingy, stingy!

I'm just teasing you.

I've never seen anyone as stingy as you.

don't hurt yourselves by mistake.

you need to take care of your clothes.

When I was young,

221
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,110
clothes were passed down from older brothers to younger brothers.

222
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,880
Back then,

223
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,460
if we had a new piece of clothing,

224
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,390
it was a big deal.

It's been so many years since we graduated.

It's just a habit from school.

Hello, Ms. Chen.

287
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,750
Every year there's a mobilization for the seniors,

288
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,540
and this time won't be an exception.

It's more important for students to grow happily.

Mr. Yang,

296
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,400
I don't agree with you.

297
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,990
While grades don't represent everything,

298
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,310
they are the key to getting into university.

299
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,510
You're experienced.

300
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,210

what are you doing?

304
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,120
Catching a mosquito.

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
Catching a mosquito?

306
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,430
Where it is? Let me help you catch it.

307
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,910
No.

308
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,470
I don't want a dead mosquito. I want a live one.

309
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,000
Live one?

310
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,480
To start our senior year,

311
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,670
we need to build upon our performance from sophomore year,

312
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,330
striving for breakthroughs time and again.

313
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,670
Here, I want to focus on criticizing Class Four.

314
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,430
Mr. Yang,

315
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,420
take a look at the grades on this chart.

316
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,680
If things continue like this,

317
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,880
none of your students will be able to get into university.

318
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,950
You should learn from Ms. Chen's experiences more.

319
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,030
Morning self-study has already begun.

320

Keep an eye on it.

321
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,310
Ms. Chen.

322
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,720
I didn't express myself comprehensively just now.

323
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,850
I do value grades,

324
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,670
but we should also find joy in learning,

325
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,730
which can enhance our efficiency.

326
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,890
Besides,

327
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,250
appropriate recreational activities

328
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,350
can also cultivate students' adaptability

329
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,310
and sense of responsibility,

330
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,500
which

331
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,320
cannot be learned from books.

332
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,470
It's so ugly.

333
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,740
How is it?

334
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,210
No wonder you want to catch a live mosquito.

335
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,850
-Anything you can think of, I've got it in my collection, -No wonder.

336

and nothing can escape my grasp.

337
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,330
They're quite happy.

338
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,640
Mr. Yang, I'm really looking forward to seeing your class's exam results.

339
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,430
Yi,

340
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,670
it's so ugly.

341
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,270
Yige, take it away.

342
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,830
What are you arguing about?

343
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,690
Zhao Heng.

344
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,790

OC as the x-axis,

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,800
Ms. Lu.

692
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,960
Ms. Lu.

693
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,030
Are you the one who came to see me this morning?

694
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,950
It's me.

695
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,110
Ms. Lu,

696
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,080
please take a look at

697
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,390
the dance video of Wei Xing

698
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,350
in that DV.

699
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,190
She dances really well.

700
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,470
I've said

701
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,970
I only teach five.

702
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,880
This is my teaching principle.

703
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,450
Ms. Lu,

704
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,440
please,

705
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,510
just take a quick look.

706
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,770
Even just for a minute.

707
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,710
Yeah, Ms. Lu.

708
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,360
I promise

709
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,090
I'll discover a new star in the dance world for you.

710
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:05,530
Yes.

711
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,510
You're the teacher,

712
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,310
so you must know

713
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,170
how much effort a dancer

714
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,690
puts into her craft over the years.

715
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,090
Please give her a chance.

716
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,670
You

717
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,650
-all have so much confidence in Wei Xing. -Yes.

718
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,980
Hurry up.

719
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,910
She looks so much like her mother.

720
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,300
Do you know Auntie Luo Mei?

721
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,260
I used to

722
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,470
love going to the theater to watch performances by the Xinghe Dance Troupe.

723
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,600
The leader, Luo Mei,

724
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
was my idol.

725
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,770
I remember that time when Wei Xing had a fever,

726
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,140
and you carried her around to so many places.

727
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,340
Wasn't that when your back problem started?

728
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,360
Yes.

729
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,450
Straight up facts.

730
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Wei Xing.

731
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,830
Good news.

732
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,730
Ms. Lu decided to teach you.

733
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,870
Lu...

734
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,750
Ms. Lu.

735
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,200
The best teacher for art training.

736
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,190
Yes.

737
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,950
This way

738
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,830
you don't have to worry about your art exam anymore.

739
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,350
Thank you.

740
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,420
But

741
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,020
I don't want to take the art exam anymore.

742
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,150
Why?

743
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
Aren't you most passionate about dancing?

744
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,190
If you're worried about tuition,

745
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,110
it's easy.

746
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,700
We can negotiate with Ms. Lu for a lower price.

747
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,910
It's not that simple.

748
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,030
Even if I cover the cost of this training,

749
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,150
there will still be various fees in the future.

750
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,460
Besides,

751
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,100
what can I do after graduating

752
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,570
from dance academy?

753
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,740
I don't want my dad

754
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,600
to continue working so hard.

755
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,950
But Wei Xing,

756
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,720
if you don't dance, won't you be unhappy?

757
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,960
I don't care.

758
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,590
Life

759
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,320
doesn't always have so many happy things anyway.

760
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,740
Wei Xing,

761
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,880
have you ever thought about

762
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,080
talking to Uncle Wei?

763
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,700
You've always been thinking about Uncle Wei,

764
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,550
and he's been thinking about you too.

765
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,710
You've both been considering each other,

766
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,990
but you don't really understand each other's true thoughts.

767
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,050
Although you're the closest family,

768
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,540
I feel like you're

769
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,970
living together as strangers.

770
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,180
Hello?

771
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:09,930
Wei Xing,

772
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,390
your dad is a little drunk.

773
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,550
Come pick him up.

774
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,550
Okay.

775
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,880
Well,

776
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,230
My dad is a little drunk.

777
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,640
I have to pick him up.

778
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,060
I'll go with you.

779
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,930
Didn't you want them to have some father-daughter time?

780
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,130
Don't worry about it.

781
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,950
Wei Xing gave up taking the art exam because of Uncle Wei.

782
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,680
Let Uncle Wei

783
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,350
resolve this issue.

784
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,390
Dad.

785
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,320
Wei Xing is here.

786
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,990
Dad,

787
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,390
are you drunk?

788
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,400
No.

789
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,710
You... Have you eaten?

790
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,870
You're so dull.

791
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,230
Your daughter is concerned about you,

792
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,000
and here you are asking if she's eaten.

793
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,550
You...

794
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,270
Help your dad go home quickly.

795
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,350
Hurry up. Go back.

796
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,350
I'll go back then.

797
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,560
Go.

798
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,830
Watch out.

799
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,390
I'm fine.

800
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:50,790
I'm not drunk.

801
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,620
Take the bag.

802
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,510
Watch out, Dad.

803
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,310
I'm fine. I'm not drunk.

804
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,830
Indeed.

805
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,670
I'm happy.

806
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,650
Dad,

807
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,960
the registration for the school's art examination

808
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,400
is about to start.

809
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,770
Should I sign up?

810
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,080
Yes.

811
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,310
Of course.

812
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,230
I

813
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,630
don't have many hobbies.

814
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,060
When I was young,

815
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,420
I liked watching your mom dance.

816
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,630
Now,

817
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,130
I just like watching you dance.

818
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,380
This is your dream.

819
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,310
You must pursue it.

820
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,920
Xing,

821
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,820
if supporting this family

822
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,240
requires

823
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,240
trading in your dream,

824
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,600
then I'm not considered a good father.

825
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:39,890
By the way,

826
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,390
Here.

827
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,880
Open it

828
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,630
and see if you like it.

829
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,420
Yes.

830
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,970
[Guoliang Store]

831
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,250
Take a look.

832
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,670
Is that okay?

833
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,920
Although the road ahead is unknown,

834
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,190
I'm no longer afraid or confused.

835
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,470
At this moment, I feel immensely happy.

836
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,710
I will keep working hard

837
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,070
with everyone's expectations.
