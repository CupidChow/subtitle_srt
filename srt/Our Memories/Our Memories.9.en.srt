00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,540
Wei Xing is not an outsider.

357
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,800
I can only tell you.

358
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,670
Just me?

359
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,110
OK.

360
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,340
Wei Xing, I have something to do with Han Shuai.

361
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,800
You and Wang go home first.

362
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,330
What do you want to tell me?

363
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,910
You'll know soon.

364
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,460
Let me know a little bit first.

365
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,340
Please.

366
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,140
Wei Xing.

367
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
I have something to tell you.

368
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,340
Wenwen.

369
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,040
When I was on the phone,

370
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,930
you sounded a little upset.

371
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,790
What's wrong?

372
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,680
Nothing.

373
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
It's about my sister.

374
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,100
Your sister?

375
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,820
What's wrong with her?

376
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,220
Mom.

377
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,990
Why are you here?

378
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,970
Aren't you working problems here?

379
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,370
Why are you playing here?

380
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,180
I thought it was hard for you to study here.

381
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,030
I brought you fruits.

382
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
But you two are playing here.

383
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,630
Say something.

384
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,470
I...

385
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,720
What?

386
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,070
Auntie, let me explain.

387
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,550
Explain what?

388
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,830
The good kid who got second in the grade

389
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,260
actually called specifically to lie.

390
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,870
I've come to see that

391
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,750
academic performance has little to do

392
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,070
with character.

393
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,450
Auntie,

394
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,710
I apologize.

395
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,030
Don't blame Wenwen.

396
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,630
Let's go home.

397
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,370
Wenwen.

398
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,990
Hurry up.

399
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,640
What do you want to say?

400
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,790
Tell me.

401
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,940
Just wait.

402
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,960
I'm so worried.

403
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,670
Tell me.

404
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,820
Please, please.

405
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,720
Please tell me. Please.

406
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,180
Well,

407
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,330
close your eyes first.

408
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,060
No way.

409
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,170
Is it this?

410
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,820
Han Shuai,

411
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,220
Wait and see.

412
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,180
Ultraman.

413
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,090
Mom.

414
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,770
Shi Wenke did it to celebrate my birthday.

415
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,030
He meant well.

416
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,020
Didn't you celebrate your birthday?

417
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,620
I think you're just playful.

418
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,870
I couldn't listen to Mr. Chen

419
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,950
to be nice to you.

420
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,990
I should have strictly

421
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,270
according to my original requirements.

422
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,590
I see.

423
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,350
How about this?

424
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,280
We'll talk in the office later.

425
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,120
Okay.

426
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,630
Dad.

427
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,660
By the way,

428
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,620
Shuaishuai.

429
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,590
I'm busy in the company these days.

430
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,450
Leave the money

431
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,520
here.

432
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,410
Take care of yourself these days.

433
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,910
Buy whatever you want.

434
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,200
Dad, wait.

435
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,480
Xu Yuteng's concert will be on sale soon.

436
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,750
I want to take my friends to have fun.

437
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,010
Get me six tickets.

438
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,680
The first row.

439
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,220
OK.

440
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,030
I'll ask them to arrange it in the office.

441
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,090
I'll do it when I have time.

442
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,440
Tingting.

443
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,940
Where is Diqiu?

444
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,460
He went to school so early?

445
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,010
He went to school early in the morning.

446
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,870
Wei Xing is monitoring him every day.

447
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,950
He is very serious.

448
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,410
That's great.

449
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,710
I'm going to school.

450
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,080
Okay.

451
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,070
Goodbye, aunt.

452
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,940
Take care.

453
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,510
Wei Xing.

454
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,380
Wei Xing.

455
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,430
Look.

456
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,270
So many swans.

457
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,380
The cold Siberian winds
have been blowing all season.

458
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,570
The swans

459
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,850
migrate here to spend the winter.

460
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,430
What are you trying to say?

461
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,020
The swans

462
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,200
can overcome all difficulties and come here.

463
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,470
I think

464
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,900
I should learn from them.

465
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,230
No matter in life

466
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,280
or studying,

467
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,490
I should correct my attitude.

468
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,950
Wei Xing, I was wrong.

469
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,020
♫Where's the sun going to shine?♫

470
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,100
I'll study hard from now on.

471
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,680
♫Where should I go?♫

472
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
I won't be absent.

473
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,200
How could you say that?

474
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,380
♫To watch the sunset with you at the beach.♫

475
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,400
That's with the help of Han Shuai
and Shi Wenke, of course.

476
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,860
♫I haven't said it for a long time.♫

477
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,350
Okay.

478
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,750
Then

479
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,360
I'll trust you again.

480
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,060
♫Wind blows the sand around me.♫

481
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,050
Really?

482
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,640
Yes.

483
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,110
♫I want to take you to
the end of the world.♫

484
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,880
Han Shuai and Shi Wenke,
thank you very much.

485
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,650
Of course, I wrote the manuscript myself.

486
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,140
♫Let go of all your worries.♫

487
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,470
No one will believe.

488
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,080
♫You're the only one in my heart.♫

489
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,230
It's true.

490
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,830
I'd be a puppy if I lied to you.

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
I should have brought some food.

492
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,830
♫You're the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen.♫

493
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,240
Give me your hand.

494
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,450
♫And also the right person in my darkest moment.♫

495
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,250
Give me your hand.

496
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,190
♫I love you deeply in my life.♫

497
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,440
You really prepared!

498
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,150
♫I can only be brave and run towards you.♫

499
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,400
Feed it.

500
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,660
♫You're the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen♫

501
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,390
♫Like a bird of love appears at sunset.♫

502
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,560
♫The sky leaves a kiss of clouds.♫

503
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,310
♫I left a lot of traces of you too.♫

504
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,630
Wenwen.

505
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,750
Is Auntie still angry?

506
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,130
It's okay.

507
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,670
It was late that day.

508
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,150
My mom...

509
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,950
She didn't say anything.

510
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,150
Then...

511
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,940
Auntie...

512
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,710
I'm looking for Wei Xing.

513
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,310
Wei Xing.

514
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,360
Wei Xing.

515
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,470
Wei Xing

516
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,210
Guo Ting is looking for you.

517
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,010
Go.

518
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,350
Wenwen.

519
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,280
Bye.

520
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,360
You want to see me?

521
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,070
Why are you so sleepy?

522
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,010
Diqiu also slept in the classroom for a day.

523
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,560
Don't mention it.

524
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,290
I didn't sleep well last night.

525
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,520
You and Diqiu didn't sleep well last night.

526
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,510
Lower your voice.

527
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,880
Come here and talk.

528
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,650
Don't think too much.

529
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,130
I spent the night at the lake

530
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,030
with him watching the swans.

531
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,280
Don't think too much.

532
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,370
Look at the swan.

533
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,240
I'm angry that he didn't study hard.

534
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,110
Don't think too much.

535
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,680
Stop.

536
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,390
What's wrong?

537
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:22,920
Wei Xing.

538
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,760
Let me ask you something.

539
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,790
Go ahead.

540
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,920
I just want to ask...

541
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,110
Is it what I think?

542
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,550
Is it really what I think?

543
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,710
You have no idea how suffocating I am these days.

544
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,610
Lower your voice.

545
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,470
Let me tell you.

546
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,670
No one knows besides you and me.

547
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,470
We can't let anyone else know.

548
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:53,790
I swear

549
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,550
I won't let anyone know.

550
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,150
Otherwise,

551
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,510
I...

552
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,030
If you break your promise,

553
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,150
all the idols you follow will have bad luck,

554
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,400
all the albums you buy will be bootlegs,

555
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,930
and all the novels you read
will be tragedies.

556
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,900
This oath is too cruel.

557
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,950
Swear it now.

558
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,190
OK.

559
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,580
I swear

560
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
I won't let anyone else know.

561
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,820
Or I’ll…

562
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,330
Han Shuai.

563
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,020
I swear too.

564
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,190
Tingting!

565
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,320
I'm innocent!

566
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,720
I didn't ask him to eavesdrop.

567
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm sure of it.

568
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,620
I just happened to pass by.

569
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,310
Wei Xing, don't worry.

570
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,570
I'm much cautious with my words than her.

571
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,730
I will never tell anyone.

572
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,910
What are you talking about?

573
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,640
I won't tell anyone

574
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,280
even if I had to swallow it.

575
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,980
With your mouth,

576
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,300
can you swallow it?

577
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,870
How about a bet?

578
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,040
Anyone who says it will be

579
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,030
another man's servant for a week.

580
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,950
Fine.

581
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,450
- The curse cannot be broken.
- The curse cannot be broken.

582
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,010
Take a bet on me.

583
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,000
You two are really something.

584
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,600
Go back to class.

585
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,760
I won't tell anyone.

586
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,620
Director.

587
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,280
This is Jianmin.

588
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,240
[Substitution List]

589
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,710
Dad, you're home early today.

590
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,550
Mr. Han,

591
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm not urging you.

592
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,140
I have no choice.

593
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,610
You know your sister-in-law.

594
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,430
If I don't get the money back today,

595
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,810
I won't be able to explain.

596
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,410
Yeah.

597
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,760
I lent you money before,

598
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,670
and you said you'd pay it back in a month,

599
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,190
and then a couple months went by,

600
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,400
I can't wait anymore.

601
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,820
I've been

602
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,150
trying to figure out the money.

603
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,560
How about this?

604
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,650
For the sake of our years of friendship,

605
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,210
you

606
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,330
go back first.

607
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,180
My son is going home.

608
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,490
Shuaishuai is back.

609
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,570
We...

610
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,080
We're talking to your dad.

611
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,410
Shuaishuai.

612
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,460
It's okay.

613
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,530
Go back to your room.

614
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,090
Dad.

615
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,320
I heard everything.

616
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,530
Uncle Luo.

617
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,810
Uncle Li. Uncle Lin.

618
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,760
Although I don't know much about business,

619
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,690
my dad has always kept his promise.

620
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,580
So,

621
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,950
I hope

622
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,180
you can trust him one more time.

623
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,400
One month.

624
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,650
Give me one more month.

625
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,880
I'll pay you back

626
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,190
with everything I have.

627
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:42,870
OK?

628
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,790
Fine.

629
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,700
Since

630
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,720
Mr. Han

631
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,990
made such a promise in front of his son.

632
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,130
Trust him one more time.

633
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,730
OK?

634
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:53,610
Sure.

635
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,490
Okay.

636
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,260
Take care.

637
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,400
Dad.

638
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,410
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

639
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,460
I've grown up.

640
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,790
You're still carrying a backpack.

641
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,790
You haven't graduated yet.

642
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,250
How's that for growing up?

643
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,430
You also

644
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,980
went out to work at my age

645
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,680
and met my mom.

646
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,330
I thought I could make it through.

647
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,110
In the past,

648
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,470
I started from scratch with your mother.

649
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,870
We've experienced all kinds of hardships.

650
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,720
It's all about thinking and doing things.

651
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,230
I didn't expect the international situation

652
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,710
has such a great influence on trade.

653
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,750
I lost money soon,

654
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,230
then borrowed

655
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,679
and lost it again.

656
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,510
Again and again.

657
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,239
All the money I earned before is gone.

658
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,600
Dad.

659
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,750
Cheer up.

660
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,350
Don't worry,

661
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,900
there's still a month left.

662
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,500
I believe you.

663
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,210
you can handle it.

664
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,159
Fine.

665
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,969
With your words,

666
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,110
I'm full of energy.

667
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:43,989
By the way,

668
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,659
don't tell your mom

669
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,810
to save her nagging.

670
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Don't worry, dad.

671
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,940
I won't let her worry about us.

672
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,960
Tell you the truth.

673
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,050
I feel much better.

674
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,230
Then I...

675
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,570
make you

676
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,170
a bowl of instant noodles

677
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,590
Okay.

678
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,370
Wait for it.

679
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,150
Director.

680
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,240
Jianmin.

681
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,190
What is it?

682
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,070
I need to go out.

683
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,090
It's about work.

684
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,420
Don't you trust me?

685
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,860
I'm in a hurry to leave.

686
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,670
What about the list?

687
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:45,830
You flipped my desk!

688
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,590
I didn't.

689
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,160
I saw it when I was delivering apples.

690
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,960
Wang Jianmin.

691
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,510
I'm telling you this today.

692
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,920
There's nothing I can do about
the factory redeployment.

693
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,120
You don't have to come to work tomorrow.

694
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,530
You took my money.

695
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,820
What are you talking about?

696
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,420
You can eat whatever you want.

697
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,650
Don't talk nonsense.

698
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm telling the truth.

699
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,820
What truth?

700
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,740
No one else came to ask for it

701
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,290
but you.

702
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,360
