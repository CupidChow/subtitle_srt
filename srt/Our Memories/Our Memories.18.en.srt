It's because of the class separation matter.

92

It's not as exaggerated as that,

93

It's Natsume Yūjin-chō.

Where did you get it? I've been searching for it.

108
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,260
I asked Uncle Shi to save one for me.

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,330
It's really popular and was sold out as soon as it hit the shelves.

110
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,030
Can I borrow it to read in a few days?

111
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,040
Then you better beg me.

what would you do?

137
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,070
Just tell me it's Ting.

138
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,990
There's no outsider here.

139

That's right, it's her.

No.

144

Forget it.

146
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,440
I'll figure it out myself.

147
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,410
I think

148
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,800
women

149
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,610
were born to torment us men.

150
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,070
In plain terms, it's all because of women causing trouble.

151
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,980
Can't you two be a bit more dignified?

152
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,740
As grown men,

153
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,390
it's embarrassing

154
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,929
to sigh over girls every day.

155
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,590
That's because you haven't experienced it yet.

156
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,630
Even if I did,

157
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,900
I wouldn't end up like you two,

158
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,380
sighing like Lin Daiyu.

159
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,220
I, Wang Diqiu, live with just two words:

160

167

Slow down.

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,190
then exams in the afternoon.

175
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,990
I just got a bit of free time now

176
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,710
to call you.

177
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,950
Why didn't you answer?

178
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,880
I was just having dinner with Shi Wenke and Han Shuai.

179
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,910
Well,

180
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,610
did you call me for something urgent?

181
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,540
Nothing urgent,

182
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,170
I just wanted to ask you

183
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,140
if you'll be able to make it back for the concert.

184
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,920
I'll try my best to make it back,

185
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,510
but

186
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,450
there's a gathering with my arts class after the exam,

187
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
so I'm not sure...

188
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,210
Wei Xing, are you ready?

189
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,950
Soon.

190
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,170
Who was that just now?

191
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,510
My dance partner.

192
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,550
We have a duet exam tomorrow,

193
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,500
and we wanted to practice a bit more to get the feel.

194
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,180
Diqiu,

195
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,990
can you hear me?

196
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,650
The signal was a bit weak just now,

197
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,510
That's all.

198
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,900
Carry on with what you were doing.

199
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,890
It's okay.

200
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,840
Well,

201
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,750
see you later.

202
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,630
Year, see you later.

It is easier to climb to heaven

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,860
than take the Sichuan Road.

244
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,730
The mere telling of its perils blanches youthful cheeks.

245
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,390
Peak follows peak, each but a hand's breadth from the sky.

246
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,800
Dead pine trees hang headdown

247

-Can’t you do it after class? -into the chasms.

248
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,380
I'm running out of time.

249
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,240
Torrents and waterfalls outroar over rocks.

250
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,230
Booming like thunder through a thousand caverns.

251
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,570
What takes you, travelers, this long, weary way,

252
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,300
so filled with danger?

253
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,550
Sword Pass is steep and narrow.

254
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,820
One man could hold this pass

255
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,710
against ten thousand.

256
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,600
You can all leave class now,

257
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
you've all felt

258
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,670
the force of Master Libai's writing.

259
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,950
-In the national college entrance exam, this poem... -Mr. Yang.

260
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,030
Mr. Yang.

261
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,370
What do you want?

262
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,620
We

263
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,990
felt that the poem "The Sichuan Road" you just recited

264
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,940
is very compelling.

265
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,020
We would like to hear it again.

266
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,150
It's very touching.

267
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,060
Then let me take two more minutes.

268
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,260
Let me finish.

269
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,780
By day we dread the savage tiger,

270
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,320
by night the serpent.

271
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,430
Sharp-fanged sucker of blood,

272
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,050
who chops men down like stalks of hemp.

273
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,360
The City of Brocade may be a pleasant place,

274
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,020
but it is best to seek you home.

275
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,440
Wenwen.

276
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,050
My mom is here to pick me up.

277
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,990
Stop talking about the concert anymore.

278
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,050
We've already discussed this topic.

279
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,080
I know.

280
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,190
But

281
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,230
this is our last group activity

282
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,550
before graduation.

283
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,810
It would be a pity

284
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
if you don't go.

285
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,600
I'll give you the ticket first.

286
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,150
Mom.

287
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,390
Let's go.

288
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,950
I'm a bit late.

289
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,730
Look.

290
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,620
How do I look with my makeup today?

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,480
Why did you put on such heavy makeup?

292
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,110
Moreover, your skirt is so short,

293
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,140
it's especially cold.

294
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,180
Change it.

295
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,690
Auntie Guo is out buying vegetables again.

296
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,640
Well, go and change.

297
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,500
Do you think this weather suits you wearing a skirt?

298
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,430
How about this?

299
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,560
Boyfriend’s style.

300
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,990
Well, how you look in the suit depends on your appearance.

301
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,920
Go and change it.

302
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,300
My lady.

303
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,500
Don't bother. It's still early.

304
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,910
Besides,

305
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,630
there are so many audience.

306
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,710
Do you really expect Xu Yuteng to notice you?

307
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,710
What do you know?

308
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,630
I'm not dressing up for you guys.

309
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,430
I'm doing it for my own pleasure.

310
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,290
Han Shuai,

311
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,310
You've messed up my hairstyle completely.

312
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,630
I'm speechless. Aren't you cold?

313
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,390
That’s cool.

314
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,360
Let's forget about Han Shuai,

315
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,660
but what's wrong with you, Shi Wenke?

316
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,140
I... You...

317
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,490
Dress up a bit more.

318
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,400
Alright.

319
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,300
I'm probably the most old-fashioned one here.

320
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,690
According to my observation,

321
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,160
none of these banners can compete with ours.

322
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,040
We're definitely going to outshine them.

323
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,670
What does our banner look like?

324
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,930
You'll find out later.

325
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,720
Who told you to show off?

326
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,650
Wearing a skirt.

327
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,880
Here.

328
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,110
No need, I'm not cold.

329
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,110
It won't be good if you catch a cold.

330
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,070
Really no need?

331
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,790
If I'm afraid of the cold, then I wouldn't be his fan.

332
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,510
Fine.

333
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,790
I also want to buy the headband.

334
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,190
I'll take a look over there.

335
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,870
Go. Go.

336
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,270
-I’ll go with her. -Okay.

337
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,310
What about Wenwen?

338
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,710
She still...

339
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,310
Hurry up.

340
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,180
Auntie.

341
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,700
How much are these two?

342
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,240
Girl,

343
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,550
we seem destined at first glance.

344
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,610
Eight yuan for one.

345
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,180
It's so expensive.

346
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,650
Not expensive.

347
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,960
How about four yuan.

348
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,880
Kid,

349
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,810
you're being too stingy.

350
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,380
You're basically asking me to starve

351
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,780
if I sell half that price.

352
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,550
Four yuan for two.

353
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,550
If you don't sell them, we'll leave.

354
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,300
One, two.

355
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
Okay.

356
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,610
I'll sell them to you.

357
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,590
Here.

358
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,740
Are you still angry with me?

359
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Let's play a game.

360
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,840
Let's pause the argument first.

361
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,880
We can continue it after the concert.

362
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,010
I'm not interested.

363
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,040
Just have fun.

364
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,680
You're so excited about the concert,

365
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,540
but it's not good to hold grudges.

366
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,390
Let's treat it

367
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,940
like putting something in storage at the supermarket,

368
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
What do you think?

369
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,810
This is our last collective activity

370
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,220
before graduation.

371
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,700
Alright.

372
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,470
I don't want to suffer anyway.

373
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,630
Agreed.

374
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,520
Hurry up.

375
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm waiting for one more minute.

376
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,040

377
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,490
How much did you pay for them?

378
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,210
Four yuan.

379
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,000
For two.

380
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,830
Ting, you're good at bargaining.

381
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,340
Mainly because he's more skilled.

382
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,470
We didn't even wait for three seconds.

383
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,310
They're quite beautiful.

384

When do we go in?

385
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,300
Ticket checking can start now.

386
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,150
Everyone please line up in order

387
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,650
and avoid crowding.

388
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,090
Stay in line and avoid crowding.

389
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,750
Does anyone have tissue?

390
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,730
I do.

391
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,560
Alright.

392
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,360
Why do you still take a notebook with you?

393
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,990
It's Wenwen's notebook.

394

will you marry me?

Be more assertive.

I was feeling unwell in the stomach,

407

sorry for keeping you waiting.

and your math homework isn't finished yet.

413

What's the point of having this schedule

414

if you're not going to stick to it?

415

If you can't do it, tear it up.

Wait.

What happened to your hands?

418
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,990
They were rubbed by me.

419
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,950
My hands got dirty.

420
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,200
I told you to focus on your studies,

421

why were you doing so many other things?

422

I'm from Class 2, next to Wenwen's class.

Ms. Chen teaches both our class and Wenwen's class.

I found it too stuffy inside, so I came out to get some fresh air.

516
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,510
You guys go in first.

517
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,190
Well,

00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,200
-Bye. -Bye.

Okay, thank you.

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,890
Look at the tickets.

523
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440

Why are you so late?

528
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,680
We almost can't make it.

529
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,070
Next, we'll wait for Wang Diqiu and Wei Xing.

530
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,750
Let's leave the positions to them later.

531
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,470
Okay.

532
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,210
Is that the person you're waiting for?

533
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,180

657
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,370
Okay.

658
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,750
Let's go. We're leaving.

659
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,870

660
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,140
Go.

661
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,900
How about we go around nearby?

662

663
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,180
-I... -I…

664
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,710
How did you do on the exam?

665
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,520
Not bad.

666
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,660
According to the feedback from the examiners,

667
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,430
it went pretty well.

668
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,650
Good.

669
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,720
Congratulations in advance.

670
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,560
It doesn't matter if you didn't do well in the second mock exam.

671
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,620
We still have time.

672
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,530
Let's not talk about this.

673
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,520
Well,

674
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,550
how about your partner,

675
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,730
the male dancer?

676
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,030
How did he do in the exam?

677
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,730
I think

678
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,580
he should have done well too.

679
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,510
Good.

680
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,000
Then you can

681
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,080
get into the dance academy together.

682
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,820
Good.

683
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,730
Let me tell you a joke.

684
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,430
One day, a crab

685
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,970
was walking along, and suddenly,

686
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,190
one of its claws fell off.

687
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,310
So, it went to see the doctor.

688
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,510
Can you guess what it said to the doctor?

689
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,460
What did it say?

690
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,670
Doctor,

691
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:15,920
I lost my claws.

692
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,429
Did you get it?

693
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,290
Didn't you get it?

694
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,520
It's so boring.

695
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,540
So why did you ask me out?

696
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,800
Just to have ice cream?

697
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,050
That's why you're dumb.

698
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,909
We need to give Wei Xing and Diqiu

699
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,139
a chance to be alone.

700
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,360
You're quite considerate towards them.

701
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,820
That's called EQ. You wouldn't understand.

702
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,830
Let me tell you another joke.

703
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,670
One day, Wang

704
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,810
turned into a vegetable

705
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,050
and ended up in the hospital.

706
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,139
Then the doctor told him...

707
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,190
If you have nothing to do,

708
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,190
I’m leaving.

709
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,929
Don't go,

710
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,300
what's wrong with you again?

711
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,940
Do you think the matter between us

712
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,310
is just going to pass

713
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,530
with just a boring time-out game?

714
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,730
Is it necessary?

715
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,300
If you really mind those girls,

716
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,240
I can stop contacting them in the future.

717
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,570
Why is it not necessary?

718
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,420
It's not about those girls.

719
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,180
But if it's not about those girls.

720
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,790
I even comforted you and told you jokes.

721
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,990
What else do you want?

722
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,390
What else do I want?

723
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,200
Where do I stand in your heart?

724
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,070
I'm just someone who sticks to you every day,

725
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,670
someone who annoys you every day.

726
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,530
When I get angry,

727
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,890
I'm just a fool that you can make a joke and pacify me,

728
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,540
right?

729
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,740
I...

730
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,120
Ting.

731
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:29,950
Everyone

732
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,640
has his priorities in his heart.

733
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,230
Your first and second priorities

734
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,250
are your studies and your future.

735
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,910
From studying abroad in the past to being in different classes now,

736
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,240
I'm not even on the list.

737
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,300
You did nothing wrong.

738
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,860
I don't have the right to ask you

739
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,560
to do anything for me.

740
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,770
I'm sorry.

741
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,190
I didn't know

742
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,850
you would mind these things.

743
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,860
Because I'm not even on your list of priorities,

744
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,390
that's why you think I don't care about these things.

745
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,830
Han Shuai,

746
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,650
you take my feelings for granted.

747
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,660
♫Walking on an unknown path♫

748
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,310
♫Facing the pervasive fog♫

749
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,530
♫Towards what they call mistakes♫

♫Freely spending the swirling dance steps♫

752
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,140
♫Lost in the depths of the heart♫
