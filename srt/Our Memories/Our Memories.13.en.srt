00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,710
If I win,

351
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,560
give me your cards.

352
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,750
Do you dare?

353
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,670
Yes.

354
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,800
I won!

355
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,040
Diqiu, we go to the same school.

356
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,390
Leave some for me.

357
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,830
Just admit defeat.

358
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,470
Are you trying to cheat?

359
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,670
Shame on you.

360
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,500
Let’s go.

361
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,950
Han Shuai.

362
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,480
Look at the cards I just won.

363
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,040
What's wrong?

364
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,240
Wei Xing.

365
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,240
Wei Xing.

366
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,970
This devil girl is very cute.

367
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,010
This is for you.

368
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,070
No, I don't need it.

369
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,610
Just take it.

370
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,650
I said no. You're so annoying.

371
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,430
Wei XIng.

372
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,100
Here, take a look.

373
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,280
Grandma.

374
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,710
Your hands are so clumsy.

375
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,820
It's not like this.

376
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,980
Study hard.

377
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,350
I will study hard.

378
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,880
Aunt.

379
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,820
You are back.

380
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,650
Wang Diqiu.

381
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,030
Where did you go?

382
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:06,920
I... I...

383
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,800
I went to play with my classmates.

384
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,890
Listen.

385
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,030
If you dare to spend money

386
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,550
to buy those stupid cards,

387
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,630
I'll throw them away.

388
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,400
I didn't.

389
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,150
Open your hands.

390
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,290
Look.

391
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,170
Nothing is in the pockets either.

392
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,110
I'll spare you this time.

393
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,110
Eat with Grandma.

394
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,780
Okay.

395
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,530
Grandma, you are so nice.

396
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,020
Let me see.

397
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,150
What?

398
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,390
Why is it so scary?

399
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,780
Grandma,

400
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,230
Wei Xing is not happy recently.

401
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,620
He even ignored me.

402
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,810
Wei Xing's Mom

403
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,590
went to the heaven

404
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,230
to be a star.

405
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,510
Will Aunt Luo never come back?

406
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,120
No.

407
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,390
Doesn't Wei Xing miss his Mom?

408
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,620
Of course he does.

409
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,940
Who doesn't?

410
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,130
Back then,

411
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,640
we didn't know what death meant.

412
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,320
We just thought

413
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,400
that person went to the heaven to be a star.

414
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,790
Hello, Dad.

415
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,550
Why aren't you back yet?

416
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,410
Ting, don't worry.

417
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,560
We've got the train tickets.

418
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,840
We'll be right back.

419
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,100
I don't care.

420
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,930
Come back soon.

421
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,040
Grandma is still in the hospital.

422
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,840
Don't live with me if you can't.

423
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,040
No one is forcing you.

424
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,260
Then let's get a divorce.

425
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,140
I'm not afraid.

426
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,070
Fine.

427
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,180
Okay.

428
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,390
We'll go tomorrow.

429
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,490
If you don't come tomorrow,

430
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,440
You're a coward.

431
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,280
Fine.

432
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,300
Your hands are wet.

433
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,420
Grandma.

434
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,330
I accidentally got Wei Xing's hair dirty.

435
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,870
It's okay.

436
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,240
Grandma will clean it up after washing it.

437
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,140
We don't have shampoo at home.

438
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,430
Diqiu.

439
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
Go to the supermarket

440
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,290
and buy shampoo.

441
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,880
Take the money.

442
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,580
Okay.

443
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,770
Move over.

444
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,750
Come on.

445
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,810
Come, sit here.

446
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,820
Sir.

447
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,080
A rubber.

448
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,240
Take it.

449
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,810
Why did you steal?

450
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
You'll go to jail if you're a bad guy.

451
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,740
You'll never see us again.

452
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,920
Do you understand?

453
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,640
I'm asking you.

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,430
What's wrong with being a bad guy?

455
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,910
If I become a bad person,

456
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,220
my parents will come and scold me.

457
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,730
Then they won't quarrel anymore.

458
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,590
Wenke,

459
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,730
I'm going to purchase books.

460
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,130
You

461
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,740
go to Aunt Li's house for lunch,

462
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,210
alright?

463
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,160
Okay.

464
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,850
Good boy.

465
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,930
I'm leaving.

466
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,930
Bye.

467
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,540
Bye.

468
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,810
Wei Xing.

469
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,760
I'll wash your hair brightly soon.

470
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,500
Thank you, Grandma.

471
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,590
Wei Xing.

472
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,980
Let grandma

473
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,670
to tie your hair.

474
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,790
Okay.

475
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,490
Han Shuai.

476
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,890
My eyes.

477
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,340
Why didn't you say anything?

478
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,760
I thought you were dumb.

479
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,170
Diqiu.

480
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,620
Go get a basin of water.

481
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,090
Let's go.

482
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,770
Let's deliver the water.

483
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
What's wrong, Shi Wenke?

484
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,030
Diqiu.

485
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,190
What should I do?

486
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm going to go blind.

487
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,940
Grandma.

488
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,880
Grandma.

489
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,010
Shi Wenke said he's going blind.

490
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,400
What happened?

491
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,590
Don't be afraid.

492
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,030
Let's get you help.

493
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,830
Kid.

494
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,790
Take them on to see if it's clear.

495
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,580
Is it clear?

496
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,990
Yes.

497
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
Shi Wenke doesn't cry anymore.

498
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,560
The stars are so beautiful.

499
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Ting, you know what?

500
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,750
Stars are constellations.

501
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,070
What constellations are there in the sky?

502
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,200
Leo, Libra...

503
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,820
Greek Troup connected bright stars

504
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,980
and imagined them as animals or characters

505
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,220
as fairy tales.

506
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,430
Shi Wenke, you know so many things.

507
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,210
It's written in the books my Dad bought.

508
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,360
So what?

509
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,500
I know things too.

510
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,000
Leo is Elonia.

511
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,460
Libra is purple dragon.

512
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,980
Han Shuai, you read too?

513
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,500
Silly. It's all on the Knights of the Zodiac.

514
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,180
Wei Xing, what are you looking at?

515
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,260
Those stars are so bright.

516
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,870
They are like sunflowers.

517
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,080
I wonder if my Mom lives inside.

518
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,090
They really look like sunflowers.

519
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,820
Right?

520
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,180
I shouldn't have gotten mad at you before, Diqiu.

521
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,470
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,300
It's okay.

523
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,390
Good job. Let's hold hands.

524
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,740
Good job.

525
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,010
Good girl.

526
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,510
-You like stars, right?
-Yeah.

527
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,670
I like them too.

528
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,080
Adults always ignore us

529
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,560
with all kinds of excuses.

530
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,970
Grandma

531
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,010
gave us the most company.

532
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,360
She patiently listens to our ridiculous childish words.

533
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,490
She also tells us ancient fairy tales.

534
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,430
She used her hands covered with calluses

535
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,130
to hold up a carefree childhood for us.

536
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,940
Yes.

537
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,630
They are asleep.

538
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,930
Am I right?

539
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
Shuai must be looking for Diqiu.

540
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,270
During that long time,

541
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,590
Grandma not only took care of us,

542
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,460
but she also took care of

543
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,850
who have grown up.

544
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,570
She made every child feel safe

545
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,390
in heart.

546
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,250
Wei Xing.

547
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,710
Sunflower.

548
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,920
Aunt Luo is on the sunflower constellation.

549
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,970
But I couldn't reach the stars.

550
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,360
So I had to fold one like this to keep you company.

551
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,820
I will always be with you, Wei Xing.

552
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,940
Grandma,

553
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,500
we're going to school.

554
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,370
Me too.

555
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,370
What about you?

556
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,940
Hurry up.

557
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,760
Hurry up.

558
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,620
Bye, Grandma.

559
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,830
Slow down. Slow down.

560
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,380
Why do you always listen to this song?

561
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
It's nice.

562
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,520
This song is the love song of Grandpa and Grandma.

563
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,270
Really?

564
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,070
Grandpa and Grandma

565
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,870
met while watching the opera.

566
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,360
They were playing this pipa on stage.

567
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,160
The doctor said

568
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,910
Grandma is safe for now.

569
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,820
Don't worry.

570
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,070
Ting, the soup is almost ready.

571
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,790
-Do you want to try it?
-Okay.

572
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,470
It smells good.

573
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,650
It's hot.

574
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,670
Smells good.

575
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,770
Do you think Grandma will like it?

576
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,170
She definitely likes it.

577
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,100
That's good.

578
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,220
I think this is good.

579
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,220
Go prepare the ingredients.

580
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,300
A little sugar.

581
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,180
A little salt.

582
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,820
A little MSG. Hurry.

583
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,940
Ke.

584
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,430
How much is a little salt?

585
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,150
This much?

586
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,600
Or this much?

587
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,679
Well,

588
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,850
a little is a little.

589
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,909
A small spoon is also a little.

590
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,179
A straight A student.

591
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,639
Your book is useless. Don't sell it.

592
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,900
You misled the public.

593
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,190
Wei Xing.

594
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,870
How much salt should I put?

595
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,170
This is too much.

596
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,770
You want to make it too salty?

597
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,010
Is it good?

598
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes.

599
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,199
Cream flavor?

600
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,770
Yes.

601
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,630
Dad.

602
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,100
Why did you suddenly want to buy popcorn?

603
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,440
On my way home from work,

604
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
I saw the popcorn stand in the corner

605
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,350
was closing up.

606
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,960
I thought my daughter was tired from studying.

607
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,290
So I bought some for you.

608
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,190
Thank you, Dad.

609
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,850
Eat this.

610
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,310
It's delicious with sugar.

611
00:34:59,310 --> 00:34:59,830
Yes.

612
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,150
Why didn't you do your homework in your room?

613
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,030
Come on.

614
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,870
Try it.

615
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,010
Why should I?

616
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,840
Take it away.

617
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,350
The first mock exam is coming soon.

618
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,990
Don't you know

619
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,390
how important this exam is for senior year?

620
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,400
It doesn't matter for a few minutes.

621
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,860
Let the kid eat something.

622
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,510
What do you mean?

623
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,800
Can't you just take it to your room and read and eat?

624
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,520
Do you have to eat here?

625
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,900
The first mock exam

626
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,180
can reflect the real level of your college entrance examination.

627
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,710
It's almost the same as the real examination.

628
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,510
She is just eating popcorn...

629
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,510
I'm going back to study.

630
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,280
That's right.

631
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,180
Look at Wenwen's attitude.

632
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,710
When you get into one of the top universities,

633
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,630
your mom will buy you a car of popcorn.
