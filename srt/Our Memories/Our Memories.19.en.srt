she has suspended schooling.

138
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,720

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,470
Madam, how could you say that?

171
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,030
Calm down.

172
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,690
What's wrong? What happened?

173
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,250
Tell me.

174
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,140
Wenwen.

175
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,350
Wenwen ran away from home.

176
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,160
I've searched

177
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,780
everywhere she might go,

178
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,130
but I still couldn't find her.

179
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,450
She only left a note on the table.

180
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,740
[I don't want to go. Goodbye.]

181
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,150
Where did she go?

182
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,420
Mr. Jiang,

183
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,840
should we call the police?

184
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
It'll be hard to file a case within 24 hours.

185
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,340
Shi Wenke,

186
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,210
can you think of anything?

187
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,350
QQ.

188
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,030
She used to write down her feelings
on QQ.

189
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,630
There might be clues inside.

190
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,310
Mr. Jiang,

191
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,410
do you know Wenwen QQ's password?

192
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,880
I didn't even know she had an QQ account.

193
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,090
Yan Li, do you know?

194
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,540
The password.

195
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,380
Her birthday？

196
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,230
Anniversary?

197
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,930
No, that's not it.

198
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,180
Let me try yours again.

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
That's not right.

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,450
Madam.

201
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,920
Can I try?

202
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,330
It's not right either.

203
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,480
What is this?

204
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,050
A dinosaur egg.

205
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,110
I became interested in archaeology

206
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,040
because of this little thing.

207
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,830
Mr. Jiang,

208
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,270
when did you give this to Wenwen?

209
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,750
Why do you ask?

210
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,910
Her QQ password

211
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
is probably related to this.

212
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,510
How is that possible?

213
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,760
It's just a random souvenir.

214
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,290
It may not matter to you,

215
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,170
but it's the most precious thing for Wenwen.

216
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,790
Mr. Jiang,

217
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,690
please think about it.

218
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,120
When exactly did you buy it?

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,920
I guess it was in Xi'an that year.

220
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,070
In 1996,

221
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,350
I bought it at the train station
on my way back.

222
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,750
As for the date and time...

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,990
It occurred to me

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,530
that it was Mid-Autumn Festival that day.

225
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,210
My mom invited us to have dinner together.

226
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,910
You were late.

227
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,350
I scolded you so hard.

228
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
September 27th, 1996.

229
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,150
I'm going to the fairy tale land.

230
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,620
What does that mean?

231
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,510
I'm going to the fairy tale land.

232
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,660
Is Wenwen going to...

233
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,060
Don't think too much. Let's see where it is.

234
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,140
This is the bridge we went to yesterday.

235
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,830
[Episode 19 There are no fairy tales in reality]

236
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,870
Wenwen. Wenwen.

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,990
Wenwen!

238
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,730
Wenwen!

239
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,910
Wenwen!

240
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Jiang Wenwen.

241
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:37,990
Mom.

242
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,970
What are you doing here?

243
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,550
Do you know

244
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,210
how worried your dad and I are?

245
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,030
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,990
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

247
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,590
To get some fresh air?

248
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,670
What for?

249
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,340
It's a false alarm.

250
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,140
Let's go home.

251
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,590
Go home?

252
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,500
Let me ask you.

253
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,670
What's the meaning of those messages
on your QQ space?

254
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,930
What do you mean by "goodbye"

255
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,150
and "had enough"?

256
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,630
Are you threatening me?

257
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,300
Is this how you repay me?

258
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,270
Starting tomorrow,
I'll take you to and from school.

259
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,860
I'm your mother. I'm responsible for you.

260
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,210
You are rebellious.
I shouldn't be nice to you.

261
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,390
You must enter into
a key top-tier university.

262
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,950
I can't get into a top-tier university.

263
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,200
l'll never make it.

264
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,410
A celebrity photo?

265
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,070
Do you have time to look at the celebrity photo?

266
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,660
I won't do it again.

268
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Come home with me.

269
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,850
No.

270
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,130
I'm not going home.

271
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,320
Wenwen.

272
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,120
Don't be afraid of me.

273
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,190
Come home with me.

274
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,890
No.

275
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,010
-Come home with me. -I'm not going home.

276
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,540
-Wenwen.
-Don’t come over.

277
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,360
Wenwen.

278
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,880
You must be hungry.

279
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,240
Here.

280
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,570
Have some porridge.

281
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,200
Wenwen.

282
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,860
Wenwen.

283
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,300
Dad's here.

284
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,600
Mr. Xu,

285
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,870
could you do me a favor?

286
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,150
Could you please

287
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,280
talk with my student later?

288
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,360
At least let her calm down.

289
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,910
Thank you.

290
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,730
Mr. Wu,

291
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,910
could you please help me

292
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,970
supervise the night self-learning class?

293
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,100
Of course. Just go and see Wenwen.

294
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,390
Ms. Chen,

295
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,250
how is Wenwen now?

296
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,380
Ms. Chen, let's go together.

297
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,250
Don't worry.

298
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,680
When she gets better,

299
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,040
I'll definitely take you to see her, okay?

300
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
Wenwen's arm,

301
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,900
palm,

302
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
and purlicue.

303
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,990
The scratches on them

304
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,570
are the result
of her long-term psychological stress.

305
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,620
She keeps repeating one move.

306
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,420
And the root cause of her stress is..

307
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,740
me.

308
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,050
Really?

309
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,940
Wenwen is a good student.

310
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,950
She is a good girl.

311
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,160
But you've been pressuring her

312
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,890
to study all day long.

313
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,340
You don't let her go out

314
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,630
and make friends.

315
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,420
Are you satisfied now?

316
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,450
Ms. Chen,

317
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,110
please tell us

318
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,370
what we should do now.

319
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,680
First,

320
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,570
you should let her calm down

321
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,990
and keep her away

322
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,610
from all sources of stress.

323
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,740
Please don't provoke her anymore.

324
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,430
How is that possible?

325
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,740
How could it be me?

326
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,569
What's wrong?

327
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,680
I don't think I'm a good teacher.

328
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,060
I knew her mother was pressuring her,

329
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,589
but I turned a blind eye.

330
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,240
I even thought that as long as she got good grades,

331
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,140
and went to a good university,

332
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,640
it would be easy for her.

333
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,820
Now that she's like this,

334
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,520
I'm one of the culprits.

335
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,580
That's not entirely true.

336
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,410
No one is born to be a qualified teacher.

337
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,640
So we have to work harder

338
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,670
to change the situation,

339
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,180
right?

340
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,490
Don't blame yourself too much.

341
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,580
Look, Wenwen needs you.

342
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,710
Class 1 needs you too.

343
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Strawberry flavor. It smells good.

344
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,090
It won't hurt if you apply it.

345
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,720
Wenwen.

346
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,630
These books

347
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,510
are all from Shi Wenke Bookstore.

348
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,230
They're all new archaeological books.

349
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,650
Sanxingdui Ruins, Mawangdui.

350
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,380
They're the ones you're most interested in.

351
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,230
Yeah, Wenwen.

352
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,690
Let's go karting when we have free time.

353
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,630
The director's not here,

354
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,010
so we don't have to
listen to his long speeches.

355
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,870
I'm not used to him not being here.

356
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,480
We can't mess around even more

357
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,780
when the director's not here.

358
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,430
We have to help students

359
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,520
with this mock college application.

360
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,840
I'm going to the class.

361
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,390
I'll go with you.

362
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,550
Shut your pie hole.

363
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,750
You just had to rub it in, didn't you?

364
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,640
It's my fault. It's my fault.

365
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,020
The college application process

366
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,900
starts now.

367
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,310
Let's follow this guide.

368
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,880
There are six tiers
and you can choose one school per tier.

369
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,150
You'll have a whole week to

370
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,460
to think about it.

371
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,060
You can talk to your parents and teachers.

372
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,630
Every school and major you fill in

373
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,720
will determine your future path in life.

374
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,730
Come to my office if you have any questions.

375
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,370
What should we choose?

376
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,770
Have you read the guide?

377
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,260
I didn't even realize

378
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,460
there were so many colleges to apply to.

379
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,060
It makes me dizzy.

380
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,960
Which one do you choose?

381
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,490
How about I pick one for you?

382
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,000
That's fine.

383
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,950
But your scores are much higher than
the art exam standard.

384
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,080
Are you okay with it?

385
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,540
I should've studied art or music.

386
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Which one do you choose, Du Mingwei?

387
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,910
I plan to join the army after graduation.

388
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,540
You're really surprising, Mingwei.

389
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,310
I always remember

390
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,520
those soldiers who saved me.

391
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,940
I want to be

392
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,860
like them.

393
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,760
Found it.

394
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,590
Which school did you choose?

395
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,350
Show me.

396
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,630
Look at yours.

397
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,730
Why do you want to see mine?

398
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,120
Stingy.

399
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,430
Actually, it wouldn't be bad for me
to apply to a junior college.

400
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,150
Right?

401
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,350
Have you decided which school to go to?

402
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:14,880
Yeah.

403
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,390
I want to aim for
the best literature college.

404
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,920
Then I'll aim for
the best financial college.

405
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,790
Didn't you already fill it out?

406
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,050
What's there to write?

407
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,560
I want to write down

408
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,400
all the colleges
that specialize in archaeology.

409
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,750
It might be useful for Wenwen.

410
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,260
I'll write it down with you.

411
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,690
If Wenwen is recovered,

412
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,150
I'm sure she'll need this information.

413
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,770
Okay.

414
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,210
I'll help too.

415
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,900
Come on.

416
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,280
♫The unfinished dreams♫

417
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,830
♫I'm stubborn♫

418
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,470
♫Can you stay here with me?♫

419
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,030
♫Youth in the ignorant night sky♫

420
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,930
♫Imprints eternity♫

421
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,090
♫You never said goodbye♫

422
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,760
♫The hands that stop waving♫

423
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,380
♫The promise is not enough♫

424
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,040
♫You disappeared at the end of the wind♫

425
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,770
♫Imprinting your smile in my hearts♫

426
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,100
Diqiu,

427
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,490
which school did you choose?

428
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,490
Let me take a look.

429
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,370
I haven't decided yet,

430
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,100
but Yang is helping me out.

431
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,960
Don't worry.

432
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,880
It'll be fine.

433
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,060
I need to use the toilet.

434
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,990
Don't slack off.

435
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,460
Each layer of the forest’s richly dyed.

436
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
The whole stream was emerald green.

437
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,060
Wei Xing.

438
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,990
Come in.

439
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,640
You're working so hard.

440
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,310
Ting.

441
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,880
Let me ask you something.

442
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,590
Do you know

443
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,330
what school Diqiu is going to apply to?

444
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,640
I don't know.

445
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,990
He's been keeping an eye on me lately.

446
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,450
He must have some secrets.

447
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,280
Do you know

448
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,680
what school Han Shuai is going to apply to?

449
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,480
I think it's
Central University of Finance and Economics

450
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,060
That's pretty good.

451
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,120
It’s a school I can’t get into anyway.

452
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,160
What happened between you and Han Shuai?

453
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,790
I don’t know.

454
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,350
It doesn't matter.

455
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,340
Anyway,

456
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,650
I'm working hard for my goal

457
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,510
and get into a good college first.

458
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,300
You've really changed.

459
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,610
I've tried it.

460
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,890
I won't regret it.

461
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,940
What about you?

462
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,440
Are you thinking about your application?

463
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,220
It's okay. You can go anywhere.

464
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,850
Don't feel pressured.

465
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,950
No, mom.

466
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,430
I've thought about the application long ago.

467
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,570
Then why do you seem nervous recently?

468
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,690
Mom,

469
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,430
I want to ask you a question.

470
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,190
Go ahead.

471
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,100
You've been fighting with dad
for so many years.

472
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,230
How come you still haven't separated?

473
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,060
Silly boy.

474
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,300
It's all because of you.

475
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,460
That's just one thing.

476
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,350
Most importantly,

477
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,640
your mom and I

478
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,670
still have feelings for each other.

479
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,400
Is that so?

480
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Honey.

481
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,050
Let me correct you.

482
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,960
Ex-wife. Ex-wife.

483
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,710
Not anytime soon.

484
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,150
What did you say?

485
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm just chatting with your son

486
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,310
about some manly stuff.

487
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,080
Please leave us alone.

488
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
Okay, okay.

489
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,290
You guys talk about your manly stuff.

490
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,010
Let me tell you.

491
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,610
Your dad has some skills now.

492
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,390
He even dares to kick me out.

493
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,310
Alright, mom. Go to bed early.

494
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,050
You too.

495
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,520
Son,

496
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,000
your mom and I

497
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,070
were opposite in temperament.

498
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,100
But your mom knows I care about her,

499
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,400
and I also know she cares about me.

500
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,940
So no matter how much we fight,

501
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,470
even tearing up the marriage certificate,

502
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,510
we both know

503
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,110
we only have each other in our lifetime.

504
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,030
Did you have a fight,

505
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,600
right?

506
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,020
It's okay. Talk to dad.

507
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,000
Dad, why are you always talking nonsense?

508
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,690
You...

509
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,030
Shuai.

510
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,690
City Academy.

511
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,030
Hotel management.

512
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,470
You chose the worst ones.

513
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,430
What do you mean?

514
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,380
Beijing's admission requirements
are too high,

515
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,990
These are all I can apply to.

516
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,390
Why do you have to stay in Beijing?

517
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,590
There are so many cities

518
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,170
and universities across the country.

519
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,830
You should choose a better one
for your first choice

520
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,030
and aim higher.

521
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,980
Besides,

522
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,430
I hope you'll pick a major you really like.

523
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,390
When I graduate from Hotel Management,

524
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,790
I'll be managing my family's homestay.

525
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,750
It's inheriting the family business.

526
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,810
Don't be stubborn.

527
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,590
Do you think

528
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,140
I don't know your true abilities?

529
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
The application is due in a few days.

530
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,460
Take time to think about

531
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,700
what you really like.

532
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,250
Be responsible for your choices.

533
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,880
Go back

534
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,990
and fill it out again.

535
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,540
Take it.

536
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,440
Mr. Yang,

537
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,590
are the schools I chose okay?
Can I get into these schools?

538
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,440
They're suitable for you.

539
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,000
I called you both here

540
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,990
because I found

541
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,710
that both of your choices
of schools and majors

542
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,860
are exactly the same.

543
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,270
I didn't think much about it before.

544
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,000
But after seeing what Guo Ting applied to,

545
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
I really liked her major.

546
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,070
So I searched it online,

547
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,110
and I feel like the score isn't too high.

548
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,380
Han Shuai,

549
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,900
there’s nothing wrong with your application.

550
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,190
It's just that

551
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,760
you're too conservative.

552
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,930
Take this first choice for example,

553
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,110
my expectations for you

554
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,190
and your potential

555
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,820
go beyond that.

556
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,770
Okay, thank you.

557
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,380
Last year's cutoff scores weren't very high,

558
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,540
but with your current grades,

559
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,630
it's still a bit risky.

560
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,910
See? Am I right?

561
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,240
It’s still difficult to just take the entrance exam.

562
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,850
Han Shuai.

563
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,190
Ms. Chen,

564
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,830
I have one more math question
I'd like to ask you.

565
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,710
Go ahead.

566
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,620
I'll write it down first.

567
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,270
Okay.

568
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,880
Since there's still some time
before the national college entrance exam,

569
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,800
you should learn from Guo Ting.

570
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,560
There's still a chance you'll get in
if you work hard.

571
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,490
It's rare

572
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,900
for classmates from the same class

573
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,160
to get into the same college.

574
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,820
The probability is quite low.

575
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,910
Although this is a rare fate,

576
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,680
I hope you can fulfill your wish

577
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,380
and get into the same college.

578
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,580
Go for it.

579
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,290
Keep it up.

580
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,810
Ms. Chen,

581
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,230
I've figured out the question.

582
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,290
I'll go back first.

583
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,120
Okay.

584
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,490
Your turn.

585
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,000
Okay.

586
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,590
Han Shuai.

587
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,860
Han Shuai!

588
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,740
Are you alright?

589
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm fine.

590
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,150
You go first.

591
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,070
Okay.

592
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,220
Han Shuai.

593
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,820
You...

594
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,590
Are you sure you're okay?

595
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,490
Do you know what college Ting applied to?

596
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,960
A school far from
the Central University of Finance and Economics.

597
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,690
Do you know what's wrong with Wei Xing?

598
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,340
I don't know.

599
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,180
You can go back and ask her.

600
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,830
What happened?

601
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,580
She seemed fine at the concert.

602
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,030
Let me tell you.

603
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Women

604
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,340
are not that simple.

605
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,280
I don't know whether they are simple or not,

606
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,680
but one thing is for sure.

607
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,510
If I had a problem with Wei Xing,

608
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,770
I wouldn't let her be unhappy for so long.

609
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Ting is my sister.

610
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,970
I won't allow you to upset her either.

611
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,210
But I have a good idea.

612
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,460
What?

613
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,340
What are you doing?

614
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,730
I'm giving you a chance.

615
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,270
I could've pretended.
Why did you really hit me?

616
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,470
Ting! Ting!

617
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,580
Han Shuai isn't feeling well.

618
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,520
What’s wrong?

619
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,080
I don't know.

620
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,380
He must have eaten something bad.

621
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,880
How about this?

622
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,920
I'll go back and get him some medicine.

623
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,480
You stay here with him for a while, okay?

624
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,810
Make sure to hurry back.

625
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,560
Have a seat there.

626
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,930
It hurts.

627
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,850
The medicine will be here soon.

628
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,200
Wei Xing,

629
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,300
where have you been?

630
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,160
Mr. Wei said you didn't come back.

631
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
What happened to you?

632
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
I went to see Mr. Yang.

633
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,320
I promised him

634
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,940
I'll change my application.

635
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,650
You won't.

636
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,830
Don't be angry.

637
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,640
You knew I'd be angry,

638
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,130
but you still did it.

639
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,200
I thought you've changed.

640

Didn't we agree

645
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,530
