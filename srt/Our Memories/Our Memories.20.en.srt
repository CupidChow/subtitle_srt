I didn't take part in the debate

112
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,850
I didn't study in the library.

113
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,750
I was wasting my time.

114

116

I love Archaeology.

118

But now as I get older,

121

I realize that I'm farther away
from my dream.

122

In order to leave here
and get into a college,

123
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,430
I've given it my all.

Let's go back to school.

Don't worry.

I'm fine now.

Besides,

We can't waste it any more.

174
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,600
stop being so uptight.

175
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,930
Don't be concerned for everyone.

Well.

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

516
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,710
Thank you.

517
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,250
You're welcome.

518
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,270
Bye, Ting.

519
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,570
- Bye, Mingwei.
- Bye.

520
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,630
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

521
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,380
- Are you going home right away?
- Shi Wenke.

522
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,780
- See you before exam.
- See you before exam.

523
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,760
Let me help you.

524
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,970
Thank you.

525
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,060
Although I don't need it anymore,

526
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,130
it's still fun to pinch it.

527
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,980
Still can't help washing your hands?

528
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,870
Do your best. Good luck in the exam.

529
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,560
Yes.

530
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,090
But it's getting better.

531
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,930
That's good.

532
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,760
The alumni record is ready.

533
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,840
Thank you.

534
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,240
I can't bear to part with you, Wei Xing.

535
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
See you after the exam.

536
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,120
Okay. Let's do our best.

537
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,980
See you after the exam. Good luck.

538
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,600
Bye. Bye.

539
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,660
Wang Huanyu.

540
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,350
Sign here.

541
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,830
Vice President,

542
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,430
what's wrong with you again?

543
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,950
I'm leaving school soon.

544
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,990
You have a deep impression of me.

545
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,210
I’ll let you sign one.

546
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,070
- To commemorate it.
- Okay, sure.

547
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,030
I’ll sign it if the vice president says so.

548
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,000
Sign it.

549
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,980
Sign it bigger.

550
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,870
Done.

551
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,880
I want to sign it too.

552
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,950
Not you.

553
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,270
Sign sign sign.

554
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,020
I just want the signatures of Wei Xing and Wenwen.

555
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,040
Ke.

556
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,700
Be gentle.

Put your work away.

597
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,980
Here's the special soup
for the college exam.

598
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,890
This is more disgusting than
pork brain soup.

599
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,410
- Pass it over, kid.
- Pork brain soup.

600
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,470
What's this about?

601
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,600
My mom believes in "like heals like."

602
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,360
Stop talking nonsense.

603
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,470
Here.

604
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,790
Thank you, Ms. Jing.

605
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,220
Wei Xing, Wenwen and I don't need it
for healing our brains.

606
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,030
I've been very smart lately.

607
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,590
Why are you guys passing the soup
back and forth?

608
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,630
Everyone has one.

609
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,070
Drink this

610
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,750
and you'll do well in the exam.

611
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,470
Cheers! Cheers!

612
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,310
Come on.

613
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,060
Well, Han Shuai, you need more.

614
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,170
Right right right.

615
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,450
You're not very smart lately.

616
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,910
Such a good thing.

617
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,270
Save it for Diqiu.

618
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,950
I...

619
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,070
There you go.

620
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,400
Mom.

621
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,930
This...

622
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,790
Take the lead and drink it.

623
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,410
How is it?

624
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,620
Delicious.

625
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,650
It's delicious.

626
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,030
Everyone, try it.

627
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,890
For real. I mean it.

628
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,650
My mom is very good at cooking.

629
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,320
Kids.

630
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,250
Drink the soup.

631
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,730
Drink the soup.

632
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,710
Shuai. Drink it.

633
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,100
Ting, what are you doing?

634
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,960
Have some soup.

635
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,030
Wenwen, Wenwen, drink it.

636
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,550
Drink it, Wei Xing.

637
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,810
Make yourself at home.

638
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:17,820
Is it good?

639
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,469
It's really good.

640
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:20,870
Drink more.

641
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,770
Everyone.

642
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,510
The head of our house

643
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,620
treat us to hotpot today.

644
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,489
Supper.

645
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,310
It's a happy moment.

646
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,270
Absolutely, no problem at all!

647
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,739
Yeah.

648
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,610
Come on.

649
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,630
Cheers, cheers.

650
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,659
Come on, drink it.

651
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,750
What should I do?

652
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,810
The college entrance exam is tomorrow.
I'm so nervous.

653
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,960
You're being anxious before the exam.

654
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,909
Just memorize it according to
Wei Xing's note.

655
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,920
Why is your nose bleeding?
