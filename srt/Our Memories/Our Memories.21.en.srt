Tomorrow is the college entrance exam.
I'm so nervous.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,190
It's the test anxiety that kicks in.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,810
Just memorize the key points
that Wei Xing highlighted.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,530
Why is your nose bleeding?

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,810
You're just too weak, you know?

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,570
It's the consequence
of not exercising enough.

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,960
And you were judging me?

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,150
The older should never judge the younger.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,280
Keep your head up. You'll be fine soon.

11

Looks like...

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm the strongest.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,790
I've been eating fish and meat for three days.

How can I not bleed my nose?

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,640
Enough, stop complaining.

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,670
You won't be fed this well
once the exam is over.

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,470
That's right.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,740
There's not gonna be more food like that
even if you want to.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,030
The more I think about it, the more nervous I get.

20

My heart is beating so fast now.

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,950
Do you think if I can pass the exam?

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,840
No problem.

the Red Cliffs, where Zhou Yu
from the Three Kingdoms won the fame.

rolling up a thousand heaps of snow.

34

The land is picturesque,

35

and nurtured many heroes at the moment.

36
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,280
I think of Zhou Yu of that time,

37
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,430

Well...

-Just a little bit.
-That's enough.

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,070
Yi!

176
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,070
I want to go to Mars.

177
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,850
I almost have all the collections

178
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,810
on earth.

179
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,790
I'm going to join the army.

180
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,520
Be a soldier.

181
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,210
I...

182
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,030
I won't be a vice anymore.

183
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,590
Okay.

184
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,050
Ting, and you?

185
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,870
In the future,

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,230
I am going to be a great director.

187
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,550
Impossible.

188
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,800
It has to be me.

189
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,470
Okay, it's you.

190
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:07,930
Wenwen.

191
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,990
Wenwen.

192
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,110
I want to be an archaeologist,

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,980
and study the world's secrets.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,870
And the secrets of people in ancient times.

195
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,310
I want everyone to know our origin.

196
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,190
Wei Xing.

197
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,430
As for me...

198
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,280
It's simple.

199
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,750
I want to keep dancing on the stage.

200
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,720
I'll be there for you.

201
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,800
-It’s your turn.
-It’s my turn.

202
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,809
I, Wang Diqiu,

203
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,270
want to

204
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,530
be a reporter,

205
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,710
to reveal the truth.

206
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,409
An unlikely hero.

207
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,210
The battery is out.

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,930
Nothing is recorded.

209
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,610
What's going on?

210
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,360
Let's keep eating.

211
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,790
I talked for so long.

212
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,470
Did I step on you?

213
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,100
You...

214
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,480
Don't drink too much if you can't.

215
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,490
Yang Guang, you're dead
if you throw up on me.

216
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,430
Are you feeling better?

217
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,270
No.

218
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm not throwing up.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,660
Yang Guang,

220
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,580
what have you been up to

221
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,700
these days?

222
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,450
Waiting to propose.

223
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,410
You're a man. Stop dragging your feet!

224
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,080
If you want, just propose.

225
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,070
No.

226
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,370
I have to wait for

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,170
an unforgettable moment.

228
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,540
What about the ring?

229
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,560
It's in my heart.

230
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,090
You're fooling me.

231
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,130
Really.

232
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,070
Look.

233
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,550
Everyone else has a ring box,

234
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,650
but I don't.

235
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,580
It's not formal.

236
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,430
Yes, there is a box.

237
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,670
It is in my pocket.

238
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,230
Look.

239
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,780

00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,460
Han Shuai.

345
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
So miserable.

346
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,920
What's wrong with you?

347
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,300
It's not like you.

348
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,450
Why does Ting keep you on a short leash?

349
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,670
It's all because of you.

350
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,270
Me?

351
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,730
I lost my freedom,

352
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,140
in order to hook you up with Wei Xing.

353
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,910
Why?

354
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,490
You think Wei Xing got the novels for nothing?

355
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,730
I made a bet with Ting,

356
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,630
whoever tells the secret first,

357
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,630
has to the other's servant for a day.

358
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,910
Bro.

359
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,440
I am grateful,

360
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,890
for having you.

361
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,630
Don't be cheesy. Give me a hand.

362
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,570
Please help me.

363
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,780
Done!

364
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,160
Coming!

365
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,010
That belongs to Wei Xing.
That belongs to Wei Xing.

366
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,610
Which one?

367
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,160
The one on the right.

368
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,360
Wen, this is yours.

369
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,130
Ting, sit here.

370
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
I want to sit with you.

371
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,520
Alright.

372
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,640
Diqiu.

373
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,130
Work hard. Don't slack off.

374
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,820
Okay.

375
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,550
Shi Wenke, do your best.

376
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,100
OK.

377
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,200
Han Shuai!

378
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,410
Set up the oven.

379
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,990
I want to eat barbecue.

380
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,950
Right on.

381
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,780
Why are you so good at
bossing people around?

382
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,990
We finally get out camping,

383
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,320
they won't be easy on us.

384
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,630
Han Shuai

385
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,890
is so poor today.

386
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,840
You are right. It feels good

387
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,280
bossing people around.

388
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,630
We will check if there's any seafood.

389
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,070
You set up the tent first.

390
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,470
Keep up the good work.

391
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,470
We'll bring you food.

392
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,460
Be careful.

393
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,390
Thank you. Bye.

394
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,990
We work so hard.

395
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,250
But they are having fun.

396
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,840
Have some water.

397
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,600
Let's take a rest.

398
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,570
Take a rest.

399
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,690
Be careful, Ting.

400
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,680
Okay.

401
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,030
Auntie.

402
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,500
Hello, beauty.

403
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,130
What are you holding?

404
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,570
Look, I just caught it.

405
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,100
They are fresh.

406
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,330
The crabs are fresh, too.

407
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,710
Don't worry.

408
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,860
I'm fine.

409
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,850
Wenwen.

410
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,370
Even if we split up,

411
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,350
remember to tell us if anything happens.

412
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,780
Of course.

413
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,960
-Bye, auntie.
-Bye.

414
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,440
Look, I bought the whole bucket.

415
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,750
He peed.

416
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,960
We will never have this kind of fresh food

417
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,670
after we leave.

418
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,800
What's wrong? Already start to miss it
though we still haven't left?

419
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,430
Yes.

420
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,720
After all, we've seen this sea
since our childhood.

421
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,830
Let's promise to come back often.

422
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,820
It's really heavy.

423
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,510
What did you buy?

424
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,760
Big crabs and octopus.

425
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,110
They're fresh. Newly caught.

426
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,870
Right on time. The fire is ready.

427
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,910
Let us grill it.

428
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,900
Take a break over there.

429
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,800
Okay.

430
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,030
Come on, Wei Xing.

431
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,840
Thank you.

432
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,750
Thank you.

433
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,530
Let me help you.

434
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,480
Not bad, Han.

435
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,280
Listen.

436
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,040
I'll put up with you for one day.

437
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,230
Promise me one thing,

438
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,200
and I won't let you be my servant.

439
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,510
What is it?

440
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,380
Well,

441
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,750
do you think if we should

442
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,750
officially be a couple?

443
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,420
Also, can we...

444
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,660
Let's wait until the results are out.

445
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,550
Didn't you say we could do it
after graduation?

446
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,350
Liar.

447
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,880
I'll be shy.

448
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,260
Wait.

449
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
You two together.

450
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,140
Wei Xing, wait!

451
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,050
Are you going to roast it directly?

452
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,750
The fire will go out.

453
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,320
Of course not.

454
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,720
We're going to put them one by one.

455
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,150
This is too cruel.

456
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,619
I see.

457
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,800
They want to

458
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,160
tire the crabs to death first,

459
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,970
and then roast them.

460
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,099
They might as well just kill the crabs.

461
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,130
Wei Xing.

462
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,450
Actually, I'm not very tired.

463
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,560
Let us grill it.

464
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Have a seat.

465
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,310
Take a rest.

466
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:20,970
Take a rest.

467
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,630
Are you really not tired?

468
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,560
Really. Really.

469
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,710
Farewell.

470
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,530
So miserable.

471
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
Well,

472
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,010
they boys who play music

473
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,930
are quite charming.

474
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,950
Just very very very handsome!

475
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,870
I remember one year ago,

476
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,280
Han Shuai and Diqiu

477
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,910
couldn't play guitar at all.

478
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,380
But at Top 10 Singers Competition,

479
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,640
I couldn't tell they were newbies at all.

480
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,970
That's because Wei Xing taught well.

481
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,170
Right.

482
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,790
Should I learn to play instrument too?

483
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,210
You want to attract girls' attention too?

484
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,670
Who do you want to attract?

485
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,160
No.

486
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,550
I was just saying.

487
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,600
-Diqiu.
-Here.

488
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,100
I want to take a walk over there.
Come with me.

489
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,750
Beg me.

490
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,500
Please.

491
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,380
OK.

492
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,030
Han Shuai.

493
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,920
I want to get some fresh air at the reef.

494
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,190
Let's go.

495
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,180
Wenwen.

496
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,390
How about...

497
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
we take a walk too?

498
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,290
Okay.

499
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,350
Wait for me.

500
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,310
Watch out.

501
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,730
What a big wave!

502
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,090
A sea snail?

503
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,710
Did you know?

504
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,870
It is said that if you put
the sea snails close to your ears,

505
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,670
you can hear the sound of the sea.

506
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,480
In ancient times, people believed

507
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,540
that sea snails could record
people's voices.

508
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,210
So if you talk to it,

509
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
the snail can record your voice.

510
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,870
Wenwen, actually the origin
of the sea snails is...

511
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,870
Alright.

512
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,410
Stop explaining.

513
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,070
It's not romantic at all.

514
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,870
Go ahead and try to listen.

515
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,510
Okay.

516
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,580
So?

517
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,990
Did you hear

518
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,990
the sound of the sea?

519
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,230
Wenwen, I...

520
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,180
I almost lost it.

521
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,370
It's you, Wei Xing.

522
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,050
I'm not the moon.

523
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,450
You wrote it yourself.

524
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,310
You are the moon and I am the earth.

525
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,260
Are you going to talk about this forever?

526
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,100
It's written in black and white.

527
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,300
Do you want to deny it?

528
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,370
I regret it.

529
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,310
I shouldn't have written it.

530
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,320
You have no idea.

531
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,680
I was worried about gains and losses.

532
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,580
I couldn't even sleep well.

533
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,430
Why?

534
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,470
My grades were bad,

535
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,250
and you were so excellent.

536
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,650
So many people liked you.

537
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,290
You went to Beijing and went on TV.

538
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,030
You danced so intimately

539
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,430
with that guy in Beijing.

540
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,880
♫I heard that blue whales under the sea♫

541
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,580
♫Love the scenery in the sky♫

542
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,160
That's the point.

543
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,820
You are jealous.

544
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,840
♫Just as I stay sober♫

545
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,150
Yes.

546
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,340
I'm jealous.

547
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,040
♫To wait for your coming and response♫

548
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,150
Then...

549

please make it up to me.

♫You also come closer to me♫

557

558
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,110
Since you invited me sincerely,

559
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,220
♫Your words♫

560

Here's the admission letter.

593
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,050
Dad, I passed!

594
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,530
You passed?

595
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,010
Yes!

596
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,360
Dad, I passed!

597
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,510
You passed!

598
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,670
Please report to school on August 22.

599
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,860
You kissed him.

600
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,600
What's wrong?

601
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,550
To be fair,

602
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,480
I want one, too.

603
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,470
Go away.

604
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,440
Dad, mom.

605
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,840
Now that we are here,

606
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,080
why don't we double the happiness?

607
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,960
What do you mean?

608
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,550
What your son wants is...

609
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,920
he wants us to...

610
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,280
You want to remarry me
without preparing anything?

611
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,230
Forget it.

612
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,320
Dad, mom is stubborn.

613
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,130
Take the initiative.

614
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,280
I understand.

615
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Sister

616
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,240
I passed.

617
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,020
Yes, I major in archaeology.

618
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,820
Really?

619
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,190
Okay, I'll wait for you.

620
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,740
My sister said

621
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,250
she would come back
to hold me a celebration party.

622
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,710
Let's celebrate tonight.

623
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,360
Agreed.

624
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,830
Let me see.

625
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,380
Let me see.

626
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,220
Don't make it dirty.

627
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,700
Hello, what do you need?

628
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,110
-Aunt, uncle.
-Mom

629
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,940
I got in! I got in!

630
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,000
Hurry up!

631
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,340
Hurry up!

632
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,760
We're all in Beijing.

633
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,870
-Look.
-We're all in Beijing.

634
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,080
What are you shouting for?

635
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,520
Dad.

636
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,790
I got in!

637
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,070
How are you able to go to college?

638
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,310
Why not?

639
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,070
It hurts, mom.

640
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,200
I thought none of you would get accepted.

641
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,190
What are you talking about?

642
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,900
How can such an excellent kid fail?

643
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,140
Yes, mom.

644
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,840
I'm just happy.

645
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,120
How about Wei Xing and the others?

646
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,990
They all go to Beijing.

647
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,590
Really?

648
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,600
Really.

649
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,270
Great!

650
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,130
Tell me.

651
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,370
What do you want? Just tell me.

652
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,040
I want braised pork.

653
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,750
-Oh my god.
-What a loser.

654
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,120
Where are you taking me this late?

655
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,800
We're dating.

656
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,020
Dating is just wandering around.

657
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,280
But here...

658
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,900
Didn't we use to hang out here a lot

659
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,260
when we were young?

660
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,640
You even remember that?

661
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,190
It looks familiar.

662
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,480
Do you remember this?

663
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,160
I want to buy you a new one.

664
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,270
Unfortunately,

665
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,280
the shop where we bought the ring

666
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,990
has shut down.

667
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,470
Of course.

668
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,310
We got married in 1989, it's been 20 years.

669
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,540
Sit here.

670
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,410
Put it on me.

671
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,710
I prefer the old one.

672
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,960
Yes madam.

673
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,390
Honey,

674
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,030
is it too small?

675
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,230
When I was young, my hands were
slim and tender.

676
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,620
Now that I'm old,

677
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,310
I have calluses on my hands.
They become thick.

678
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,140
Who said that?

679
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,880
To me,

680
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,110
my wife's hands

681
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,370
are always so fair and tender.

682
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,450
You're so sweet.

683
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
Let's pick a good day

684
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau,

685
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
and set up a few tables to celebrate.

686
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,120
I'll get you a new suit.

687
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,570
Look at you now.

688
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,180
You don't look like a foreign trader owner.

689
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,540
So ugly.

690
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,870
Fine.

691
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,340
I'll listen to you.

692
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,580
What's wrong?

693
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,970
Our son has grown up.

694
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,940
I feel relieved.

695
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,070
Take care, dad.

696
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,080
Okay.

697
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,180
Okay, get in.

698
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,360
-Mom.
-Don’t cry.

699
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,560
Going to college is a happy thing.

700
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,250
Don't cry.

701
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,440
Call me when you arrive.

702
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,060
If you hadn't found my problem in time,

703
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,650
and stayed by my side,

704
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,070
I couldn't have

705
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,070
taken a break from my mom's tyranny.

706
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,640
You mean a lot

707
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,200
to me.

708
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,350
You are my

709
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,320
most most important

710
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,280
friend.

711
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,800
Friend?

712
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,920
Shi Wenke.

713
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,360
I have a gift for you.

714
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,550
This is for you.

715
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,710
What's inside?

716
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,110
A new MP3.

717
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,130
My mom broke the previous one.

718
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,820
It can't be fixed.

719
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,190
Don't forget to open it.

720
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,980
See if you like it.

721
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,440
♫Parallel celestial bodies♫

722
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,760

724

♫Everything will go back to the beginning♫

726
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,230
In ancient times, people believed

727
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,270
that sea snails could record
people's voices.

728
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,830
♫Maybe all illusions♫

729
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,950
So if you talk to it,

730
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,750
the snail can record your voice.

731
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,680
♫Can't hold you tight enough♫

732
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,890
Go ahead and try to listen.

733
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,680
♫It falls in your heart♫

♫We'll be apart when we meet♫

♫Or be dominated by my curiosity♫

743
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,610

May it bring you luck and blessings.

751
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,480
Should you feel sad,

752
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,790
just talk to me.

753
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Don't worry, dad.

754
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,310
I'll take care of myself.

755
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,720
You have a backache.

756
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,420
Don't deliver goods anymore.

757
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,510
Shuai.

758
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,390
You're a man now.

759
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,000
When you get to Beijing with Diqiu,

760
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,660
take care of Wei Xing and Ting.

761
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,390
Got it?

762
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,230
Don't worry.

763
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,220
Tell me when you have no money.

764
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,230
We can't embarrass ourselves
in front of the classmates.

765
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,740
Dad,

766
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,020
I can handle it myself now.

767
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,770
Don't worry.

768
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,860
I trust you.

769
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,190
Don't miss me

770
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,050
when I go away.

771
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,970
Be good when you go to college.

772
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,060
Don't cause any trouble.

773
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,570
Mom, you've been nagging
for the whole summer.

774
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,570
That's enough. They are grown-ups.
Not kids anymore.

775
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,700
Don't let Wei Xing go.

776
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,730
Dad, stop!

777
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,490
We should go.

778
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,530
Take care.

779
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,320
Okay.

780
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,530
Take care of them.

781
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,430
Bye, Mr. Wei.

782
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,970
Goodbye, Mr. Han and Mrs. Jin.

783
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,580
Goodbye, Mr. Han. Bye.

784
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,510
Take care of your sister.

785
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,230
Be careful.

786
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,690
She won't starve to death.

787
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,760
Take care!

788
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,530
What a pity.

789
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,730
The schedule of Shi Wenke
doesn't coincide with ours.

790
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,060
We couldn't go with him.

791
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,110
It's okay.

792
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,690
We can go to Shanghai.

793
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,160
There will be a World Expo next year.

794
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay, let's go to Shanghai together.

795
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,580
Okay, let's go to Xi'an first and then Shanghai.

796
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,080
Okay.

797
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,310
What a full schedule.

798
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,390
Time flies.

799
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,700
And we finally grow out wings.

800
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,190
We can fly freely in the outside world.

801
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,990
But our parents have been watching
behind us,

802
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,890
waiting for us to return.

803
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,990
Times keep moving forward.

804
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,160
We will meet and part.

805
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,340
No matter what the future holds.

806
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,020
As flame of fire when we gather,

807
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,870
as sky full of stars

808
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,910
when we part.

809
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,590
Everyone in every era,

810
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,990
shines so brightly.

811
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,460
The throbbing of youth comes so fast.

812
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,040
It's complicated.

813
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,860
But don't be afraid.

814
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,890
All confusion and uncertainty

815
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,620
will disappear

816
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,310
in their firm decisions.

817
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,090
We always stumble and move forward.

818
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,160
After that,

819
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,520
we become the best versions of ourselves.

820
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,010
We love ourselves more,

821
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,750
and love each other more.

822
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,010
There's always warmth by our side.

823
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,930
Every tacit smile between friends

824
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,310
tells a story of youth.

825
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,830
It's our memories.

826
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,810
Every deep wrinkle of our parents

827
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,740
tells a story of time.

828
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,710
It's a story of children.

829
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,510
The flowers in spring.

830
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,930
The salty sea breeze in summer.

831
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,420
The falling leaves that suddenly turn
yellow in fall.

832
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,510
The bright fireworks in winter.

833
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,909
We experienced these beautiful days
together.

834
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,120
The days are clear and long.

835
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,280
In the future,

836
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,800
there will be our families,

837
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,639
friends,

838
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,230
and us.

839
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,380
We live the life to the fullest.

840
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,710
The future is expected.
