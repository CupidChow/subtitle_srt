00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Diqiu,

178
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,870
don't play such dangerous games in the classroom.

179
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,930
I have an announcement before class.

180
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,960
The school

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,670
has set up night self-learning classes for senior three students.

182
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,580
You'd better hurry up and eat dinner after school.

183
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
We'll meet in the classroom at 7 p.m.

184
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,200
Stop complaining.

185
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,340
You're senior three students.

186
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,590
You know what to do.

187
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,190
Take out your compulsory textbook 4.

188
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,040
Page 36.

189
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,710
Lyrics to Remembering Your Charm (Remembrance of the Tale of the Crimson Cliff).

190
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,860
Lyrics to Remembering Your Charm (Remembrance of the Tale of the Crimson Cliff).

191
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,960
The great gushing Yangtze with piling waves flows towards the east...

192
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,020
It's a good chance.

193
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,660
Away it carries gallant souls of the remote bygone days.

194
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,060
Read aloud!

195
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,830
Stop thinking about the night self-learning classes.

196
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,150
Read the lyrics first.

197
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,070
Focus on the moment.

198
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,950
Try it again.

199
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,340
The great gushing Yangtze with piling waves flows towards the east...

200
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Night self-learning classes.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,980
What do you mean?

202
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
Look at you.

203
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,960
You've frowned lately.

204
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,620
Let's go out and have some fun.

205
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,350
Have some fun?

206
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,510
Here come some fruits.

207
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,540
Here.

208
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,740
Have some.

209
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,360
Mom, the grapes are very sweet.

210
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,360
You are so insensitive.

211
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,290
Just sit here.

212
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,840
Grandma, do you want some kiwi fruits?

213
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,140
No. You should eat some.

214
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,540
Poor kid.

215
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,080
I wonder if the factory

216
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,790
can organize another donation.

217
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,500
If there is another donation,

218
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,650
I'll help the people in the disaster area.

219
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,400
I'll donate my pension later.

220
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,040
OK.

221
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,320
Mom, stop messing around with him.

222
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,250
In the donation the factory organized last time,

223
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,480
the head of the workshop donated 500 yuan.

224
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,980
He, instead, donated 1,000 yuan.

225
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,960
He's stingy.

226
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,290
How generous you are!

227
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,040
Stop.

228
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,690
I'm going to announce something very important.

229
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,070
Starting from tomorrow night,

230
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,670
I won't come back for dinner.

231
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,230
I'm going to night self-learning classes at school.

232
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,990
Really?

233
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,610
It's true.

234
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,700
It's good to hear.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,430
It means our Diqiu

236
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,470
takes the initiative to pursue progress.

237
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,890
-Right? -You do know me well, Grandma.

238
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,710
Don't just have fun behind our backs.

239
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,630
I won't.

240
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,580
He might be up to something.

241
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,640
Diqiu,

242
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,830
will there be any teacher

243
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,790
to keep an eye on you guys?

244
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,050
Of course, my teacher will be there during the classes.

245
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,040
He can answer questions

246
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,300
if we encounter difficulties.

247
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,830
I'm a senior three student.

248
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,190
I used to be naughty.

249
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,210
But now,

250
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,690
it's time to be responsible for myself.

251
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,210
Don't worry.

252
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,110
[Teaching Building]

253
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,390
If you make a loud noise like this,

254
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,460
you might as well go home directly after school.

255
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,620
Seize your time.

256
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,370
You're senior three students.

257
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,730
Guo Ting,

258
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,470
where are Wang Huanyu and his friends?

259
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,470
Well...

260
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,030
Okay, I got it.

261
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,760
Thank you.

262
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,390
Go on with your self-study.

263
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,830
Brothers, feel free to fight one-on-one.

264
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,630
I'm good at sniper rifles.

265
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,840
Be careful.

266
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,500
I can completely defeat you even with one hand.

267
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,430
You two are so arrogant.

268
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,720
Come on.

269
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,160
Someone's destroyed ahead. Kill him with one shot.

270
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm coming.

271
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,620
I didn't expect

272
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,250
this guy to be quite skilled at shooting.

273
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,920
A coincidence.

274
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,690
It must be.

275
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,130
How arrogant he is!

276
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,180
Doesn't he know the best sniper

277
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,670
in the Universe Street?

278
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,240
Awesome.

279
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:23,950
OK.

280
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,350
We won.

281
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,230
[You played well just now. Do you want to fight one-on-one?]

282
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,990
One Meter Sunlight?

283
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,870
Such a non-mainstream name.

284
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,300
Ignore him. Let's continue.

285
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,980
[You were with your team members just now. Let's have another round if you dare.]

286
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,360
He's crossing the line. What should I do?

287
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,310
Defeat him!

288
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,490
[You don't dare to do so?]

289
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,520
Tell me

290
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,390
how you want to compete with me.

291
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,050
[Since you're also a sniper rifle player, how about us sniping at each other?]

292
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,050
[Tell me how you want to compete with me.]

293
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,900
What a coincidence.

294
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,760
[Let's say the one with more kill wins in 5 minutes.]

295
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,690
He's good at it.

296
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,500
Who is he?

297
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,340
Looks like he can see through me.

298
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,070
Interesting.

299
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,520
It's so boring.

300
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,870
Look.

301
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,080
He knows I'm not myself today.

302
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,610
He's afraid. He's a coward.

303
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm not afraid.

304
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,750
Go downstairs.

305
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,630
You're so amazing.

306
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,120
At this critical time,

307
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,790
you even played games in an internet cafe!

308
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,330
Who would have thought

309
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,510
of meeting you here?

310
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,420
You mean you can come here if you don't meet me?

311
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,190
How many times have I told you?

312
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,370
You're senior three students.

313
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,380
You're senior three students.

314
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,900
You should study hard for another year to get into a good university.

315
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,430
Don't you understand?

316
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
Can you play games

317
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,790
to make a living?

318
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,510
Can you play games for your lifetime?

319
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,080
Actually, according to my research,

320
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,740
E-sports is very likely to...

321
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,420
Shut up!

322
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,340
Each of you will hand over a letter of self-criticism to me tomorrow.

323
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,940
Go back to your night self-learning class mow.

324
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,530
Move! Don't you understand?

325
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,300
Yes, sir.

326
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
Yes, sir.

327
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,560
I understand.

328
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,350
Why don't you trust me?

329
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,580
There must be no problem with the goods.

330
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,330
Okay. Okay. Okay.

331
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:25,750
Fine.

332
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,980
Bye for now.

333
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,300
Okay. Okay.

334
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,800
Dad,

335
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,110
have you reached Mom

336
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,070
recently?

337
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,070
Why do you ask?

338
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,980
I'm just asking.

339
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
It's time for animals to reproduce.

340
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
The air in mountains and forests

341
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,470
is filled with hormones...

342
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,750
Dad,

343
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,510
I mean if...

344
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,290
If...

345
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,810
Zhao.

346
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,470
Don't mention it.

347
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,400
Dinner?

348
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,980
Forget it.

349
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,720
We're close friends.

350
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,270
I understand.

351
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:15,810
Is it

352
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,660
the one at the end of the Jiefang West Road, right?

353
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,329
Okay.

354
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,119
Wait for me.

355
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,250
I'll be right there.

356
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,660
Are you going out again?

357
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,810
By the way,

358
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
you take care of your own dinner.

359
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,670
Eat it.

360
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,760
The roasted meat is really tender. Try it.

361
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,410
What's wrong?

362
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,560
Diqiu,

363
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,270
I envy you sometimes.

364
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,110
Do your mom and dad still need a son?

365
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,230
Why don't they adopt me?

366
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,090
I'll be renamed

367
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,970
Wang Shuai.

368
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,180
I think

369
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,370
you just don't know how lucky you are.

370
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,710
I want a dad

371
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,090
who can buy me anything.

372
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,370
It's pointless to be rich.

373
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,190
I'm alone when I come back home every day,

374
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,320
just like an orphan.

375
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,690
My home is instead lively.

376
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,590
There are my mom

377
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,170
and

378
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,910
Guo Ting.

379
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,520
My head is going to explode.

380
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,410
Well,

381
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,040
if my mom has a new boyfriend,

382
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,090
will she ignore me and my dad forever?

383
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,400
What are you thinking?

384
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,860
After all, you are her son.

385
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,250
Besides, we've done so many investigations.

386
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,550
There is no sign of her having a new boyfriend.

387
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,350
In my opinion,

388
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,900
you're too sensitive.

389
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,590
Eat it.

390
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,220
Or Ms. Jin will scold you if it's not eaten up.

391
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,200
Is it reliable?

392
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,230
Absolutely.

393
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,270
The PE class on Wednesday will be turned into a self-learning class.

394
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,790
Our PE classes

395
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,870
are already less than other grades.

396
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,800
It's...

397
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
It's so annoying!

398
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:00,970
No.

399
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,830
We can't allow this to happen.

400
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,040
Do you have any good ideas?

401
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,340
We need to find our teacher and talk to him.

402
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,140
You're right.

403
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,350
For the sake of the interests of the class, I'll absolutely support you!

404
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,220
Yi.

405
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,110
I agree.

406
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You brat.

407
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,750
[Challenge Letter]

408
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,030
Challenge Letter?

409
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,200
It's about their PE classes.

410
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,260
The students in Class 4 have a lot of complaints.

411
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,350
They insist on playing basketball against teachers.

412
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,950
They said we should keep PE classes if they win.

413
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
What do you think?

414
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,370
I think it's rare for them

415
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,930
to have such courage.

416
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,290
Brothers, come on. We should get prepared.

417
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,490
Step up our efforts to practice shooting at the basket

418
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,180
or dribble breakthrough by working in pairs.

419
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,730
Have they accepted the challenge?

420
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,130
I'll take all the credit.

421
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,410
How about this?

422
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,110
By then,

423
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,080
I'll be responsible for ball handling and Han Shuai for scores.

424
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,610
-Zijun, you… -Are we really going to compete with the teachers?

425
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,780
Pull yourselves together.

426
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,400
Weren't you all excited about it

427
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,820
when we were discussing it?

428
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,950
Let me make it clear.

429
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm not a coward.

430
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,200
But we are senior three students.

431
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,910
If we keep going against teachers,

432
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,630
is it...

433
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,300
Zheng Kai, what about you?

434
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,510
I'm not afraid of going against the teachers.

435
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,390
I sprained my leg a few days ago.

436
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,180
I...

437
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,750
I don't want to be a drag on you.

438
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,740
It still hurts.

439
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,850
Yi.

440
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,980
I don't understand.

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,470
It's a hard-to-get opportunity.

442
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,470
But why do you all become deserters?

443
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,330
I thought you were my brothers!

444
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,590
It's just a PE class.

445
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,280
Stop making excuses. Coward.

446
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,190
Who are you calling a coward?

447
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,790
I'm saying you're a coward.

448
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,480
Pardon me?

449
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,370
Shi Wenke,

450
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,790
since you helped us a lot,

451
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,920
will Ms. Chen invite you to her office?

452
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,350
Don't worry.

453
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,540
I have a great academic performance.

454
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,770
I won't get a serious scolding.

455
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,380
But the most important thing now

456
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,410
is that there are only three of us.

457
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,340
It's not enough.

458
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,540
Yeah.

459
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,240
Let's see if we can persuade one or two to join us.

460
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,680
Do you know?

461
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,130
Harden has a serious record of asthma.

462
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,240
But now,

463
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,370
he's the best player in the Pacific Ocean.

464
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,500
He even has the chance to join the Oklahoma City Thunder.

465
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,350
No basketball player doesn't want to play basketball on the court,

466
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,360
as long as

467
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
he really loves basketball.

468
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,490
Stop practicing shooting at the basket.

469
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,300
You should hurry up and practice your collaboration.

470
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,210
Count me in!

471
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,690
What's going on?

472
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,760
Yi was bribed by me.

473
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,720
Zheng Kai was convinced by me.

474
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,150
Great job!

475
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,490
What are you waiting for?

476
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,490
Tell us what to do!

477
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,290
Well,

478
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,570
Zheng Kai, you're tall,

479
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,030
and you take the center.

480
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,630
There must be someone under the basket.

481
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,510
Come on.

482
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,180
Don't worry about anything on the basketball court.

483
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,240
Don't worry, Yang.

484
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,480
We won't let you win.

485
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,550
There are two rounds in this 24 minutes-long game.

486
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,080
The team that scores more

487
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,720
will win.

488
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,550
Are you ready?

489
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,950
Yes.

490
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,470
Seems that our teachers are competitive.

491
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,220
Can Wang's team win?

492
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,480
It's okay.

493
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,440
It's not over yet.

494
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,520
Come on, Diqiu!

495
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,950
Han Shuai, come on!

496
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,490
It's okay.

497
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,310
Well done.

498
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,310
Good job.

499
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,400
Let's work harder.

500
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,100
Here, have some water.

501
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,030
Thank you, Ting.

502
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,200
Okay, Ting.

503
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,720
Diqiu,

504
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,610
fighting.

505
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,140
Wei Xing,

506
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,190
thank you.

507
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,450
We can definitely win.

508
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,550
Although we fell behind,

509
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,250
the gap is not that huge.

510
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,830
Let's seize the time to catch up with them.

511
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,630
We'll win if we take it seriously.

512
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,130
Come on!

513
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,350
Come on. Three.

514
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,670
Two.

515
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,240
One.

516
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,270
Come on!

517
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,840
Go! Go! Go!

518
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,230
