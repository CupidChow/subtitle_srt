00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,880
You're so stupid.

177
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,370
What's the difference?

178
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,290
Wei Xing.

179
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,630
Do you have time for the fan meeting?

180
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,800
I don't know.

181
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,140
During that time

182
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,270
I might be in the art exams.

183
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,400
The fan meeting is the memory of youth.

184
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,420
In 50 years,

185
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,470
you may not remember the present,

186
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,860
but you will remember Xu Yuteng.

187
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,760
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

188
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,560
You're always full of nonsense.

189
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,710
Wait for me!

190
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,950
Look! Look!

191
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,850
Am I pretty?

192
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,660
A concert?

193
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,710
Yes.

194
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,660
Are you blind?

195
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,510
Yes.

196
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
The boy from top ten singers is so cool.

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
Yes, his name is Han Shuai.

198
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
They say he comes from a rich family

199
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
and has good grades.

200
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,210
Just like the male lead in a novel,

201
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,190
I wonder what kind of a girl he'll like.

202
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,850
He doesn't like girls like you anyway.

203
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,930
You don't look

204
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,940
very smart.

205
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,700
Does he like you?

206
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,560
Of course.

207
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,830
I will be the one he likes in the future.

208
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,750
Handsome.

209
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,880
Read it secretly.

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
A love letter?

211
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,770
Just throw it away.

212
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,440
What are you looking at?

213
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,890
I've never seen such an unexpected thing.

214
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,680
Let me see.

215
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,790
Give it back to me.

216
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,570
Let me see.

217
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Let me see.

218
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,670
You bumped into me.

219
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,040
Mr. Han.

220
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,300
The car is downstairs.

221
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,190
Okay.

222
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,110
You go first.

223
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,730
I'll be right there.

224
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,920
What is it?

225
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,520
Do you have something to tell me?

226
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,080
Mr. Han,

227
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,070
Look.

228
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,970
I've been working in the company for years.

229
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,380
I've been working hard.

230
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,700
Our company has become a big company.

231
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,700
I...

232
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,960
That means you also think

233
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
the company can't hold on anymore?

234
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,540
Of course not, Mr. Han.

235
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,480
I believe you will

236
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,660
lead the company through difficulties.

237
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,250
But if there is anything new,

238
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,040
I hope you can tell me sooner

239
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,340
so we can make plans.

240
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,850
Wait for me outside.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,810
Okay, Mr. Han.

242
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,400
By the way, Mr. Han,

243
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
this is from the bank.

244
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,190
I'll wait for you downstairs.

[Notice of Debts Expired]

So?

Are you going to my house tonight?

249
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,730
Not tonight.

250
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,780
I have to draw the blackboard tonight.

00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,660

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,730
Wei Xing is going to his house.

Let's talk outside.

What's wrong? It's not during classtime.

Wei XIng?

261
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,290
You're a senior now.

262
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,340
You should focus on your study.

263

Wei Xing, wait for me.

269
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,080
Mr. Han,

270
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,560
we comprehended all aspects

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,980
and interests for Han.

272
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,790
And we think these American schools

273
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,850
can be considered.

274
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,710
Especially UCSD

275
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,650
and NYU.

276
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,710
Their finances are ranked top in the US.

277
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,030
Actually,

278
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,720
I've learned about it before.

279
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,160
It seems that

280
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,350
some colleges in Japan are good.

281
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,470
With your financial strength,

282
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,970
you don't have to choose the Japanese ones

283
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,350
unless you want him to be closer to home.

284
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,390
What do you think, Han?

285
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,690
He must go to the American schools.

286
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,170
What's good about schools in Japan?

287
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,880
Right, dad?

288
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,360
And our family doesn't lack that much money.

289
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,440
That's also our suggestion.

Give me a few hundred thousand more.

292
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,630
I'll definitely manage the company.

293
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,200
I was so close.

294
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,520
But now,

295
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,890
Shuai is going to study abroad.

296
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,880
And I can’t even support him.

You are too prideful.

Don't be like me.

301

When something happens, you have to say it.

302
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
Lower your head when you should.

303
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,200
We are friends when we are rich.

304
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,160

while the other is a factory technician.

it will not affect you.

It does.

311
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,500
Now,

312
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,040
these things are not easy to sell.

313

The purchase price has increased a lot.

314
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,430
Wang, you are not affected.

315
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,050
Have you heard of an old saying?

316
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,340
A craftsman can't starve in a crisis.

317

but I'm doing technical work.

won't be easily affected.

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,330
I admire you.

00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,040
What is it?

351
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Money.

352
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,520
Money.

353
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,690
Director, you have a sore throat.

354
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,090
Let me get you some water.

355
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,200
Sit down.

356
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,880
Come here.

357
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,250
Jianmin.

358
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,560
Do you know why you can't be promoted

359
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,720
for so many years?

360
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,220
Your brain

361
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,480
is too short-sighted.

362
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,530
I can help you.

363
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:22,750
But...

364
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,910
Don't you think

365
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,760
that we need to pull some strings?

366
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,560
Shouldn't we need money

367
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,930
for that?

368
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,820
You want money?

369
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,240
What are you saying?

370
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
I don't need your money.

371
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,630
I'm helping you.

372
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,430
I'm helping you.

373
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,660
How much is it?

374
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,850
Do as you wish.

375
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,080
I heard that

376
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,390
Wei Xing in our class

377
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,710
is with Diqiu in yours.

378
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,160
Really?

379
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes.

380
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,490
I heard they already live together.

381
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,020
Wang Diqiu said it himself.

382
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,069
Say it.

383
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,440
Wei Xing.

384
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,140
Let's go play basketball.

385
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,400
Why are you alone?

386
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,240
Han Shuai.

387
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,440
He went to that agency

388
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,280
in PE class.

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,740
Ting.

390
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,359
I don't know what she's doing.

391
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,490
Go play basketball.

392
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,030
Go find someone else.

393
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,680
Today,

394
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
I don't want to play basketball.

395
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,160
Stop.

396
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,970
Why are you back so early today?

397
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,240
Well,

398
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,820
there's a power outage today.

399
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,170
All of our factories are closed.

400
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,400
Let me help you.

401
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,330
Is the sun rising from the west?

402
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,360
I work every day.

403
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,780
I can't take care of home.

404
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,880
Today is my day off.

405
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,980
I have to do some chores for my wife,

406
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,690
right?

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,860
Are you hiding something from me?

408
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,040
No.

409
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,000
I heard that

410
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,360
the big environment is not good recently.

411
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Don't worry.

412
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,600
I do technical work in the factory.

413
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm a hit.

414
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,880
I need to cook.

415
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,400
You fold it.

416
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
Handsome, we are all from Class 8.

417
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,550
Can we be QQ friends?

418
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,430
Come on.

419
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,190
We came all the way here for you.

420
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,880
That's right.

421
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,480
Come on.

422
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,540
We are in the same class.

423
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,180
Add me.

424
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,320
Forget it.

425
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,340
Just add me.

426
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,640
I also want to ask you about knowledge.

427
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,970
Add me.

428
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,280
Why not?

429
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,160
Add one.

430
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
Add it.

431
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
Get out of my way.

432
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,170
Add me.

433
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,040
No, no.

434
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,850
Come on.

435
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,560
No.

436
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm sorry.

437
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,540
I'm sorry.

438
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,040
I didn't mean it.

439
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,830
Guo Ting.

440
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,960
I'm sorry.

441
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,460
This is not the first time.

442
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm used to it.

443
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,510
Here.

444
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,670
Help me shake it.

445
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,710
Hurry up.

446
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,600
Okay.

447
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,730
This is the brochure...

448
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,130
For studying in America.

449
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,940
I forgot to take it out in a hurry.

450
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,800
Are you really going to America?

451
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,130
Didn't you know?

452
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,520
But America is too far away.

453
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,760
You should have told me and Wang

454
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,530
if you have officially applied.

455
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,170
I haven't officially applied yet.

456
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,040
I've made up my mind.

457
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,370
I will go to the US's best finance college.

458
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,480
I, Han Shuai,

459
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,760
when I study abroad,

460
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,220
I must go to the best place.

461
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,320
Turn around.

462
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,050
You do it yourself.

463
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,790
Hey.

464
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,030
What happened?

465
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,960
What's wrong?

466
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,440
Did Diqiu make you unhappy again?

467
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,630
If...

468
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,270
I mean if.

469
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,840
If the protagonist of your novel

470
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,970
fell in love with someone impossible,

471
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,100
what should she do?

472
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,430
Why impossible?

473
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,970
There are many reasons.

474
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,910
That's what it's like in dramas.

475
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,600
Parents don't agree.

476
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,310
There is another person.

477
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,520
Also,

478
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
he has to go far away.

479
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,290
Actually, love

480
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,490
is not impossible.

481
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,400
The so-called impossible

482
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,870
is just

483
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,570
making choices

484
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,960
between love

485
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,000
and more important things.

486
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,400
Of course,

487
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
if the ending is that they are

488
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,960
not meant to be together,

489
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,920
I'd rather

490
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,990
they never met each other.

491
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,950
Love is so troublesome.

492
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,000
Well,

493
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,920
Look.

494
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,320
If only we could be care-free

495
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,580
like these birds.

496
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,240
Ting,

497
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,480
besides love,

498
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,410
there are many interesting things in life.

499
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,210
For example?

500
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,270
Look.

501
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,580
The reason birds are happy is because

502
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,960
there's only one thing in their mind.

503
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,920
That is to find today's food.

504
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,200
We are the same.

505
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
When you find

506
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,280
a goal

507
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,120
to work hard for,

508
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,370
happiness becomes simple.

509
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,080
A goal?

510
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
The target.

511
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,890
[Shizai Bookstore]

512
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,010
You're not doing your homework hard

513
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,340
or copying hard.

514
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,850
Comrade Guo Ting,

515
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,380
what are you going to do?

516
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,560
Are you frozen?

517
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,330
Leave me alone.

518
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,500
I'm thinking about life.

519
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,280
Life?

520
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,410
Take it easy.

521
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,530
Be careful not to overheat your brain.

522
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,990
I don't want to talk to you.

523
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,390
Brother.

524
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,910
Oh no.

525
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,560
Are you copying the answers?

526
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,610
I have something to do. I have to go.

527
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,250
Where are you going?

528
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,600
Ting.

529
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,400
Is Ting unhappy?

530
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,120
Who knows?

531
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,960
She didn't talk to methis afternoon.

532
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,320
She must be trapped in some tragic novel

533
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,200
and can't get out.

534
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,130
Leave her alone.

535
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,440
Wei Xing.

536
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,900
I have to go back.

537
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,160
You too.

538
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,460
Goodbye, Ms. Chen. Bye.

539
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,020
Bye.

540
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,680
By the way,

541
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,440
is Wei Xing in school doing the blackboard?

542
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,220
This is a heavy task.

543
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,970
I think it will take a long time.

544
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,260
Look at her. Look at her.

545
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,720
Going home alone?

546
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,280
Wang Diqiu.

547
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,830
Wei Xing.

548
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:21,930
I'm here to pick you up.
