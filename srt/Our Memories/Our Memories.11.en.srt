What are you doing?

3
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,070
I'm looking for inspiration.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,750
Drawing on a book is looking for
inspiration?

Wang Diqiu.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,430
Do you want to learn it or not?

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,390
If you don't, I'll go home.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,860
Sorry, sir.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,830
I'll learn.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,470
Learn.

[Our Memories]

12
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,270
Do you think

13
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,420
Is it a crime to have
poor academic performance?

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,300
Wei Xing is always hanging out

15
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
with that vice president

16
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,790
doesn't really pay attention to me.

17
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,070
Those with bad grades

18
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,550
don't deserve to be friends

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,590
with good grades?

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,829
Wei Xing, she definitely
didn't mean it that way.

21
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,110
If you think so,

22
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,550
I'll have to scold you.

23
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,770
I was just angry.

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,110
I don't understand.

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,600
I've been working so hard,

26
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,670
but my grades are still regressing
instead of improving.

27
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,910
While you're studying,

28
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,579
everyone else is studying too.

29
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,510
They won't wait for you to catch up.

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,870
There's nothing I can do about that.

31
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,090
You see,

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,040
saying that is really frustrating.

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,130
What do you mean?

34
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,829
You are irresponsible for yourself.

35
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,130
Wei Xing said the same thing.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,670
To be honest,

37
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,340
you didn't do your best.

38
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,730
Think about it.

39
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,980
Wei Xing tutors you every day.

40
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,560
Isn't she tired?

41
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,700
She dances, studies,

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,590
and keeps a constant eye on you.

43
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,520
She just hopes
you'll be responsible for yourself,

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,910
and focus on your study.

45
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,960
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,500
Who did you learn that from?

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,190
I have no choice.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
My family went bankrupt.

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,760
When I was young,

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,980
my parents raised me.

51
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,800
But now,

52
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,570
I have to think about their future.

53
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,950
You know what?

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,610
In the past few days,

55
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,930
my dad and I stayed in a small single room.

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,880
I noticed that he had a lot of white hair

57
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
on his head.

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,770
When he moved the luggage,

59
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,829
he didn't have as much strength as me.

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,140
In the past,

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
he would only act like a boss,

62
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,550
but now when he faces problems,
he asks for my thoughts.

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,490
Did you say we've grown up?

64
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,430
Not really.

65
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,160
We can't do anything,

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,880
but the only thing we can do now

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
is to cherish the present,

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,380
and study hard.

69
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,770
Right?

70
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,420
It looks good.

has always maintained.

89

it's important to balance work and leisure.

What time did you finish studying yesterday?

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,460
Around 12. What about you?

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,650
Almost the same.

104
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,290
By the way,

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,760
how did you solve the question of

I can't figure it out.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,210
You have to change the way
to solve that question.

108
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,480
There are just only several math questions.

109
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,410
You can do it all.

Don't mention it.

I don't want to be superior.

She...

131

She went to dance class.

I was wondering
why I haven't seen her lately.

133

Do you think

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,040
I put the wrong time and address
of registration?

135
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,950
I think it's normal.

You're even worse than me.

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,640
No.

142
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,140
Diqiu is no longer the Diqiu.

143

I only have one goal now,

which is

145
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,770
to fight for a hundred days
and sprint for the college entrance exam.

146
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,210
So, Guo Ting,

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,450
if you keep playing around like this,

148
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,580
you won't fit in with us good students.

Diqiu is right.

Tingting, think about it.

152
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,210
It takes a few days to perform and rehearse.

Half of our senior year has already passed.

154
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,370

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:31,290
Okay. It is said that this is the most exciting performance in the history of Xinghe High School.

346
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
At twelve o'clock,
it's New Year's Eve by the beach.

347
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,150
We'll wait for you.

348
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,750
Wenwen.

349
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,450
Have some fruits.

350
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,210
Are you playing computer?

351
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,250
No.

352
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,410
No.

353
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,020
What is this?

354
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,210
The screen is still on.

355
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,410
You did well in the midterm exam, right?

356
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,520
You're confident to go to 985, right?

357
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,040
I said no, no.

358
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,540
Open the door!

359
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,960
You hide in the toilet
whenever something happens.

360
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,920
Open the door.

361
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,190
Enough.

362
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,640
You've been singing all the way. Calm down.

363
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,890
When did you rehearse?

364
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,210
I don't know anything.

365
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,060
Rehearsal?

366
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,670
Do we need to rehearse?

367
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
No.

368
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,870
This dance routine,

369
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,540
didn't we master it easily?

370
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,680
You two are amazing.

371
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,970
Don't believe them.

372
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,710
The three of them
practiced secretly for several days.

373
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,710
They're serious.

374
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,260
Wang, you are the best.

375
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,150
Han Shuai, you are the best.

376
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,230
Although I admit

377
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,550
I am attractive,

378
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
but don't love me.

379
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,120
It won't bear fruit.

380
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,370
Who will love you?

381
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,700
The ones who love you are

382
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,320
Jihuahua.

383
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,600
You, I...

384
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,000
Wait for me.

385
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,960
What's wrong with them?

386
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,530
Wei Xing.

387
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,670
I’ve been working hard recently.

388
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,120
Ask Han Shuai if you don’t believe me.

389
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,090
Who knows how long you can last this time?

390
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,160
I swear.

391
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,650
if I can't hold on,

392
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,410
I'll be hit by a car when I go out.

393
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,690
Don't talk nonsense.

394
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,320
Here.

395
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:38,920
Here.

396
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,380
You know I'm not good at self-control.

397
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,700
Put this here.

398
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,980
I can't go online even if I want to.

399
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,930
How could you think of that?

400
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,520
Since I gave you such a precious thing,

401
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,600
can you promise me a small request?

402
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,010
Go ahead.

403
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,940
Can you stop studying with Li Jin?

404
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,950
I don’t like him.

405
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,800
Don't laugh. Promise me.

406
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,340
Hurry up.

407
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,800
Coming.

408
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,530
Tell me, Wei Xing.

409
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,090
Shi Wenke.

410
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,740
♫Where will the sunshine scatter♫

411
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,440
♫Where should I go♫

412
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,140
♫To watch the sunset with you at the beach♫

413
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,620
♫I've been saying something
I haven't said for a long time♫

414
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,260
Let's go. It's too late.

415
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,820
♫Wind blows the sand around me♫

416
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,870
♫I want to take you to the end of the world♫

417
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,900
♫Let go of all my worries♫

418
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,840
♫I'll only have you in my heart from now on♫

419
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,580
♫You're the most beautiful sunset
I've ever seen♫

420
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,210
♫Like a bird of love appears at sunset♫

421
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,740
Go!

422
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,430
Go

423
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,440
♫There's a kiss of clouds in the sky♫

424
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,510
♫I left a lot of traces of you too♫

425
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,890
It's snowing

426
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,510
Really?

427
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,440
Make a wish on the first snow.

428
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,160
Hurry up.

429
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,160
Why are you so superstitious?

430
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,360
You've watched too many Korean dramas.

431
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,890
What do you know?

432
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,960
The wish you made on the first snow
will come true.

433
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,640
That's right.

434
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,920
They know nothing.

435
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,290
Let's do it.

436
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,560
Ke.

437
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,400
We're talking about making a wish
on the first snow.

438
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,140
Let's do it together.

439
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,570
Okay.

440
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,420
I'll go first.

441
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm Guo Ting.

442
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,260
I hope I can be a director

443
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,710
and become the best director.

444
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,670
Director Guo

445
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,050
will be the best international director
in the future.

446
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,840
Of course.

447
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,510
Next.

448
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,770
Wenwen, you go.

449
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,240
I...

450
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,290
I won't say it.

451
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Say it, Wenwen.

452
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,730
Come on.

453
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,350
Say something, Wenwen.

454
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960
I'll go first.

455
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,870
I...

456
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,080
Shi Wenke,

457
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,060
wants to write the best literature work.

458
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,750
Wenwen, didn't you say that

459
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,100
the wish of the first snow is the easiest.

460
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,900
We can't miss this opportunity.

461
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,520
Come on.

462
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,490
I...

463
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,840
Jiang Wenwen.

464
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,930
My dream is

465
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,130
to become an archaeologist.

466
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,160
Han Shao

467
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,780
wants to enter
the top finance major in China

468
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,460
and make a lot of money.

469
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,890
I...

470
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,240
Wei Xing.

471
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,370
I want to be a great dancer.

472
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,810
Well,

473
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,440
I...

474
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,840
Wang Diqiu.

475
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,760
I must go to a university in Beijing.

476
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,710
Later I found out

477
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,390
that dreams don't come true so easily.

478
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,570
But when you shout out your dream,

479
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,290
you've gained the courage to chase it.

480
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,130
It's New Year.

481
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,710
Time to count down.

482
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,900
Almost there.

483
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,600
Ten.

484
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:27,880
Nine.

485
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,910
Eight.

486
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,040
Seven.

487
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,280
Six.

488
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,260
Five.

489
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,280
Four.

490
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,270
Three.

491
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,270
Two.

492
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,370
One.

493
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Happy New Year,

494
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,100
2009.

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,880
Wei Xing.

496
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,840
I will go to Beijing with you.

497
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,050
Diqiu, you must work hard.

498
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,340
In 2008,

499
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,360
with a flower of fireworks.

500
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,690
I suddenly feel

501
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,930
maybe the most beautiful scenery

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,160
is not the colorful colors

503
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,360
on the sky and the sea.

504
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,720
The most beautiful thing

505
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,930
is always being together.

506
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,040
It's crooked.

507
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,530
You're the one who's crooked. It's pretty.

508
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,640
Do you have OCD?

509
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,430
Your eyes are crooked.

510
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,030
Your eyes are crooked.

511
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,330
This...

512
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,560
It's so straight.

513
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,530
It's just the whole 'Fu"...

514
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,970
It just fell this way.

515
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,210
Where did it fall?

516
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,330
The door is right.

517
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,990
Look at the symmetrical axis.

518
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,580
Your eyes are crooked.

519
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,710
Almost.

520
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,750
Call Wei Xing.

521
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,520
Happy New Year.

522
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,080
- Happy New Year, Uncle Wei.
- Happy New Year.

523
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,050
Wei Xing. Wei Xing.

524
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,920
Wait, Wei Xing. Come on.

525
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,650
Look at this ’Fu'. Does it fall?

526
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,610
Yes.

527
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,920
I told you.

528
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,040
I've been looking at it for a long time.

529
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,760
Your eyes are different from normal people.

530
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,770
We have everything ready.

531
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,570
Go in.

532
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,120
It's not crooked.

533
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,690
Happy New Year, Uncle Shi.

534
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,220
Wait.

535
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Look at this 'Fu'.

536
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,160
Is it crooked?

537
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:02,810
Yes.

538
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,990
Stick it again.

539
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
What a rare guest.

540
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
No.

541
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,440
This is not rare.

542
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,520
We see every day.

543
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
You came at the right time, Han Shuai.

544
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,440
I don’t believe there are no normal people.

545
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,160
See if the 'Fu' is crooked or not.

546
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,690
Yes.

547
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,270
Let’s play cards later.
Happy New Year.

548
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
Why are you so surprised?

549
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,270
Hurry up.

550
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,400
Hurry up.

551
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,180
Dad, what are you playing?

552
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,060
Three K and two J.

553
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,250
We're on the same side.

554
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,810
You two?

555
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Pig teammate.

556
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,530
Han Shuai.

557
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,280
A little three.

558
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,010
Oh no.

559
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,690
Mom, mom.

560
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,530
When will we have New Year's Eve dinner?

561
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,850
Your dad's factory

562
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,570
gave the order sheet

563
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,690
to the staff this year.

564
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,180
We don't have to cook it ourselves.

565
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,510
We'll have the ready-made food this year?

566
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,280
It's getting worse.

567
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,290
Five.

568
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,780
Well,

569
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,040
Why aren't Guo and Huiyao here yet?

570
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,770
They'll be here
before the Spring Festival Gala.

571
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,550
What time?

572
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,770
They should get off now.

573
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Sir,

574
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,850
Are you sure this is the way to
Universe Street?

575
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,590
Yes.

576
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
I think so.

577
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,850
You think so?

578
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,040
Don't you know?

579
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,780
Brother, don't be angry.

580
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
I just came to the city for mobile business.

581
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,580
How about I return the money to you?

582
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,680
Do I look like I'm short of money?

583
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,890
I'm rushing home for the Spring Festival.

584
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,400
and you said to return the money.

585
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,090
All right.

586
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,730
Brother.

587
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,930
Keep your voice down.

588
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,960
What should we do?

589
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,330
I didn't mean it.

590
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,290
Sister.

591
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,290
Jing Jing is back.

592
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,300
Sister.

593
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,750
You're finally back.

594
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,160
I missed you so much.

595
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,010
You must be tired.

596
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,810
Let me do it.

597
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,360
Give it to me.

598
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
I was writing Fu just now.

599
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,280
Your mom said I'm not as good as you.

600
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,680
Come on.

601
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,400
Show me.

602
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,970
I'm a little tired.

603
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,520
I'll go back to my room and rest.

604
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Go have some rest.

605
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,450
Hurry up. You can cook after you finish.

606
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:04,920
Okay.

607
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,910
Sister.

608
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,750
Where do you put your luggage?

609
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,480
Can I put it here?

610
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,720
Sister,

611
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,810
Are you tired?

612
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,650
I'll get you some warm water.

613
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,430
It's okay.

614
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,760
Go on with your work.

615
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,330
Okay.

616
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,040
Call me if you need anything.

617
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,250
I'll go out first.

618
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,480
Call me when dinner is ready.

619
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,650
Close the door.

620
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,310
Okay.

621
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,360
New Year's Eve dinner is coming.

622
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Dishes are ready.

623
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,150
Here, take it away.

624
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,500
Here, baby.

625
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,770
Thank you.

626
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,690
Look, it's so convenient.

627
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,220
Yes.

628
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,050
I knew food delivery

629
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,240
is definitely a big trend in the future.

630
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,650
Every family has a kitchen.

631
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,710
No one will order delivery every day.

632
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,490
Aunt, uncle.

633
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,240
Why aren't my parents here yet?

634
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
The Spring Festival Gala has started.
Why aren't they here yet?

635
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
Wang,

636
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,590
why don't you call him?

637
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,770
We can't eat without everyone here.

638
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,440
Tingting, call your dad.

639
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,760
You're blocking me from watching TV.

640
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,510
You have no discernment.

641
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,580
I can't get through.

642
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,930
Did you call your dad?

643
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,000
Hit your mom!

644
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,770
I'm so mad.

645
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,010
Why is there no signal?

646
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,390
No signal?

647
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
Let me see.

648
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,370
Really?

649
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,900
Brother, are you still leaving?

650
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,610
What kind of crappy place did you go to?

651
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,060
There's no signal at all.

652
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,900
All right, let's go.

653
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,160
[Golf Road]

654
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,660
What's going on?

655
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,430
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

656
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,920
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

657
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,050
How is it, Tingting?

658
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,500
I still can't get through.

659
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,530
Are they not coming back?

660
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,760
No, they should be on their way.

661
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,670
Why don't they call and notice us?

662
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:19,930
Tingting.

663
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,070
We're here if they can't come back.

664
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,310
They always lie.

665
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,880
Tingting!

666
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,050
Look who's here.

667
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,330
Dad, Mum.

668
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,070
You're all here.

669
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,960
Dad, mom.

670
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,420
Tingting.

671
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,330
She's still crazy.

672
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,880
I thought you two wouldn't come back.

673
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,890
What's wrong with you?

674
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,240
I can't get through to you.

675
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,560
Gosh.

676
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,290
It's a long story.

677
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,940
- Get me a shrimp.
- Okay.

678
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,000
- Diqiu.
- Grandma.

679
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,650
It's the year now, right?

680
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,050
Yes.

681
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,480
Thank you, Grandma.

682
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,020
As long as we gather together,

683
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,080
it'll be the strongest annual taste.

684
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,460
Let me propose a toast.

685
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,890
Happy New Year.

686
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,810
Happy New Year.

687
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,120
Today is

688
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,200
our family reunion.

689
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,010
I wish

690
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,060
a happy new year.

691
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,830
Happy New Year.

692
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,900
Happy New Year!

693
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,760
It's so sweet.

694
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,040
Jingjing.

695
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,810
It's rare for us

696
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,530
have a meal together.

697
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,930
Stop playing with your phone.

698
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,590
It's about the student union.

699
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,620
The student union?

700
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,320
Business?

701
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,570
Eat when you're done.

702
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,320
Wenwen.

703
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,050
Yes?

704
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,620
You should learn from your sister.

705
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,890
Look at your sister.

706
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,540
Your sister is attending
a renowned key university in China,

707
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,180
studying the most popular major.

708
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,150
This year,

709
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,110
she became the president
of the student union.

710
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,950
Vice President.

711
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,700
There's no big difference.

712
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,940
Anyway, your sister is excellent.

713
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,050
You must learn from her.

714
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,960
Do you hear me?

715
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,140
Got it, mom.

716
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,170
Pick up the phone.

717
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Here.

718
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,130
Have some meat.

719
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,430
Thank you, mom.

720
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,280
You should work harder now.

721
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,010
When you take the college entrance exam,

722
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,350
you will gain a lot.

723
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,360
At that time, we can relax

724
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,200
and have fun.

725
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,170
Yes, yes.

726
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,090
Phone.

727
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,290
Your mom called.

728
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,090
Hello, mom.

729
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
Here.

730
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,760
What does this northeast dialect mean?

731
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,330
It's good.

732
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,350
This is good.

733
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,570
Having been working for over ten years,

734
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,430
there is still hard work and effort,
isn't there?

735
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,720
They dismissed me
without any reason or explanation.

736
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,250
I...

737
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,710
am not much better.

738
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,080
In the past,

739
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,440
I used to be a small business owner.

740
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,270
But now,

741
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,930
I have to rely on my wife.

742
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,330
Ex-wife.

743
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,470
I have to depend on my ex-wife.

744
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,540
How embarrassing.

745
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,850
The year of 2008

746
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,760
was not a peaceful year.

747
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,230
It's the same.

748
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,340
My small store is just hanging there.

749
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,850
Guo,

750
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,199
is your architecture industry affected?

751
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,090
Of course.

752
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,739
After a year of hard work,

753
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,400
and nothing is left.

754
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,710
But I think

755
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,630
it's not scary to face difficulties.

756
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,550
We have to face them.

757
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,130
We can't give in.

758
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,440
We are men.

759
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:35,790
We should

760
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,850
just do it.

761
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,210
- Yes. Do it.
- That makes sense.

762
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,320
Good luck. Cheers.

763
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,590
Let's get better and better in 2009.

764
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,120
It's getting better. Cheers.
