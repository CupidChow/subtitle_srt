What are they playing?

177
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,950
What do you want?

178
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,600
A mop?

179
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,510
I'm saying what they are playing

180
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,780
is so unpleasant to hear!

181
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,890
You want MSG?

182
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,520
What do you want?

183
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,390
What they're playing

184
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,790
is so unpleasant to hear.

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,890

You did us a favor.

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,430
Why are you here?

192
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,430
Listen.

193
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,160
Don't worry.

194
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,720
I won't pay on credit.

What do you want to eat?

196
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,910
I've memorized the menu.

197

I don't need anything.

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,190
Just a bottle of beer is enough.

199

What are you thinking?

200
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,510
You have no choice but to drink when you have to socialize.

201
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,160
But there's no need for you to drink here.

202
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,580
Since you care so much about me,

203
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,590
it's okay if I don't drink.

204
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,050
You can have a chat with me.

What's wrong with you?

206

Let go of me!

I didn't see anything.

217

And I don't care about what happens between you two.

218
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,390
Sorry, I'm late.

219

It's okay.

Coming, Son!

These are all my son's favorites.

222
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,550
Thank you, Mom.

223
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,550
Don't mention it.

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:16,870
Here.

I'm not hungry.

226
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,030
I like watching you eat.

227
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,270
Have some.

228
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,120
Eat more. These are all your favorites.

229

Aren't you hungry?

230

Well,

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,550
I'll eat with him.

232
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,010
I don't think it's necessary.

233
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,060
It's boring to eat alone.

234
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,330
Am I right, Son?

235
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Come on.

What is this?

It's the Top 10 Singers Competition Entry Form.

243
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm going to hand it to the teacher.

244
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,270
Am I right?

245
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,490
I'm impressed.

246
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,410
Awesome.

Tell me

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,610
why you filled in the entry form.

254
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,270
What?

255
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,270
Stop it. I saw it.

256
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,410
I have solid evidence.

I also have a dream of singing and dancing.

259
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,860
It's normal for me to sign up for it.

260
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,510
But there are so many girls in the class.

261
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,200
Why did you drag me into this?

262
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't care. I want to sing this song.

263
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,920
You should ask Yi and Wang Diqiu.

264
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,530
Fine.

265
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,760
I can do it myself!

Many students in my class signed up for the competition.

Ms. Chen, look. They're positive about it.

Students in the key class don't like to participate in such events.

You can ask Wei Xing to join it.

Wei Xing can't always do something for me.

You have to learn to read the score first.

If you just watch a video like this,

you'll only get more confused.

288

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,670
The bookstore purchased a batch of new books

310
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,000
about the Sanxingdui culture.

311
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,040
It was inconvenient to give it to you at school.

312
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,770
That's why I was following you.

313
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,270
No offense.

Sanxingdui.

It's one of the ten archaeological mysteries.

According to recent research,

317
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,360
it might have something to do

318
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,660
with early Xia culture and Shu culture.

319
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,430
Ms. Chen,

320
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,710
we need one more judge for the Top 10 Singers Competition of the Campus.

321

Will you be free that day?

322
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,350
So many teachers have signed up to be a judge.

323
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,530
I will not be needed.

324
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,190
We just need a professional and impartial judge like you.

325
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,020
Let's have a seat for a while.

326
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,180
Where did you get it from?

327
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,150
It was an accident.

328
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,210
It doesn't matter.

329
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,310
Thank you.

330
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,010
You can also use some.

331
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,710
Okay.

332
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,150
In fact,

333
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,170
archaeologists have high status.

334
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,400
And what they're doing is meaningful.

335
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,350
There's no need

336
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,750
to hide the fact that you like archaeology.

337
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,190
My dad doesn't hide his habit.

338
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,210
He likes reading books.

339
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,620
He wants everyone to fall in love with books.

340
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,350
So,

341
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,630
he opened a bookstore.

342
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,710
Turns out Diqiu who came there frequently

343
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,790
just wanted to copy the answers on exercise books.

344
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,910
My dad was so angry.

345
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,950
Your dad is so nice.

346
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,070
You all understand me,

347
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,510
except them.

348
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,870
In the past,

349
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,780
every time I went to buy archaeological books,

350
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,160
I could only tell them

351
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,450
that I went there for review materials.

352
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,230
Otherwise,

353
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,670
I would have been scolded by my mom just like my sister.

354
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,620
Is your schoolbag the Doraemon's pocket?

355
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,390
Seems that you can show me everything.

356
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,650
What is this this time?

357
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,430
Pinch it.

358
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,490
It's so ugly.

359
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,110
When you feel stressed,

360
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,050
just pinch it.

361
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,700
Okay.

362
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,220
Thank you, Shi Wenke.

363
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,540
Actually,

364
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,750
I can tell that you like archaeology

365
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,740
and singing.

366
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,180
But,

367
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,060
why didn't you join the Top 10 Singers Competition?

368
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,030
It's almost 9:30.

369
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,290
Why isn't she back yet?

370
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,670
In the eyes of my classmates,

371
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,670
I only know how to study.

372
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,150
If they know

373
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,230
I sign up for the competition,

374
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,960
they will laugh at me.

375
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,670
It's not going to happen.

376
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,910
I'll watch you off the stage

377
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,840
and be the first one to applaud you.

378
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,910
But,

379
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,950
it's too late now.

380
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,190
You don't want to miss the wonderful performance

381
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,520
by Jiang Wenwen and Wei Xing of your class.

382
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,190
Who gave it to you?

383
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,050
Actually,

384
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,920
I signed you up

385
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,810
without your permission.

386
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,100
I didn't expect it.

387
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,790
I was worried about it.

388
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,950
To put it nicely,

389
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,870
they care about their academic performance.

390
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,430
To put it bluntly,

391
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,110
they have no sense of collective honor

392
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,380
and they're not motivated.

393
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,440
But grades are not the only criteria.

394
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,530
When I was in college,

395
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,410
I didn't learn about social practice from Math, Physics, and Chemistry.

396
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,270
These subjects never taught me how to pursue girls.

397
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,040
You're so annoying.

398
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,230
I'm serious.

399
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,270
I am serious.

400
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,110
And I don't know

401
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,100
what we are doing.

402
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,050
Maybe we're deviating from our original intention.

403
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,440
Maybe the theory you put forward is right.

404
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,480
You can start with being a judge

405
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
to get to know them.

406
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,930
Think about it.

407
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,960
You're back.

408
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,930
Why are you so late today?

409
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,620
I stayed after the night self-learning class

410
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,090
to do more test papers.

411
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,050
Good girl.

412
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,790
I made you a night snack.

413
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,350
Mom,

414
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,890
I'm not hungry.

415
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,900
You have to eat something even if you're not hungry.

416
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,280
I know what is best for your health.

417
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,000
I made you steamed Chinese egg custard.

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,360
It can help replenish protein

419
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,550
and it's easy to digest.

420
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,410
You have to eat.

421
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,790
Diqiu,

422
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,990
how's it going?

423
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,470
My hands are just like chicken feet.

424
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,260

Guo Ting!

515
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,940
Come on! Guo Ting! Guo Ting! Come on!

516
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,650
[Class 4, Senior 3 will win]

517
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,270
Wenwen,

518
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,140
are you ready?

519
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,310
Wenwen,

520
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,300
what's wrong?

521
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,800
I don't want to perform it.

522
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
But,

523
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,710
it will be our turn soon.

524
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,950
Are you nervous?

525
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,830
It's fine.

526
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,270
I'm with you.

527
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,430
Thank Guo Ting and Han Shuai for their performance.

528
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,100
Next is the singing and dancing performance

529
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,780
by Jiang Wenwen and Wei Xing from Class 1, Senior 3.

530
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,910
Let's welcome them.

531
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,450
Wenwen, let's go.

532
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,980
I don't want to have a try.

533
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,500
Why must I try?

534
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
Can't I do test papers at home?

535
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I want to go home.

536
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,570
I'm not going.

537
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,420
But Wenwen...

538
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,050
Wei Xing,

539
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,180
I'll come with you.

540
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,560
Wenwen,

541
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,070
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,520
I shouldn't have signed you up.

543
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,720
But don't be afraid.

544
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,840
I'm here.

545
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,270
I'll go and perform the show.

546
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,110
Wei Xing,

547
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,760
let's go.

548
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,330
Why did the light suddenly go out?

549
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,610
What happened?

550
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,960
♫See through♫

551
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,540
♫I want to see through the meaning of my pursuit♫

552
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,830
♫But I stay where I am♫

553
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,950
♫Without any trace♫

554
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,710
♫If my toes touch the ground♫

555
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,120
♫I can't get closer to the sky♫

556
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,450
♫I hide the secret of solitude♫

557
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,360
♫In the gap of time♫

558
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,110
♫If♫

559
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,670
♫I've learned to give up♫

560
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,980
♫Until my youth runs out♫

561
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,150
♫How can I face♫

562
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,120
♫The torrential rain I've experienced?♫

563
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,550
♫Listen to my beating heart♫

564
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,290
♫Call my name on stage♫

565
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,210
♫The tide is flowing towards you♫

566
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,630
♫No matter what will happen♫

567
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,270
Hurry up!

568
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,980
Wenwen, you did a great job!

569
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,120
Everyone,

570
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,570
congratulations to Wenwen for winning first place today!

571
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,630
In fact, Wei Xing also has the credit.

572
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,590
Thank you, Wei Xing.

573
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,390
It's nothing.

574
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,760
Everyone was attracted by your singing.

575
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,360
That's right. Stop being modest.

576
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,200
Two people can indeed make a greater impact than individual efforts!

577
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,470
We should go to karaoke together next time.

578
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,590
-Who will treat? -Okay.

579
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,260
As usual,

580
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,030
my treat.

581
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,900
But Han should pay the bill.

582
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,420
I knew you're the stingiest!

583
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,260
No problem.

584
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,640
Is he stingy at ordinary times?

585
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,530
He's so stingy.

586
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,000
He never bought me anything anyway.

587
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,840
I'm so nice to you!

588
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,100
-He even grabbed my braised pork. -What?

589
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,270
Ke, hurry up!

590
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,660
You're back.

591
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,270
Yeah.

592
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,390
Dad, Mom.

593
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm back.

594
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,520
What did you do at night self-learning class?

595
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,650
Wenwen won first place

596
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,190
in the Top 10 Singers Competition tonight.

597
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,820
Good job.

598
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,140
Thank you, Dad.

599
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,980
What's there to be happy about?

600
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,310
I'd be happy

601
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,950
when she ranks first in the class.

602
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,190
It's also an honor.

603
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,740
We need to build an education system that comprehensively fosters the students' all-round

604
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,120
moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic grounding with a hard-working spirit.

605
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,060
Director Jiang,

606
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,940
I would like to ask you

607
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,820
whether such an honor can get extra marks for the national college entrance exam.

608
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,400
Jiang Wenwen is not an art student.

609
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,590
She doesn't take vocal exams.

610
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,720
If she's available,

611
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,020
she'd better do more test papers.

612
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,840
Why are you still standing here?

613
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,210
Go back to your room and do your test papers.

614
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:20,980
Got it.
