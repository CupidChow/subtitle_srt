[Our Memories]

5
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,270
Kid.

6
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,160
Time to eat.

7
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,550
Coming.

8
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,300
Your uncle went to deliver the goods,

9
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,350
So the two of us

10
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,200
just eat something casually at home.

11
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
I hope you don't mind.

12
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,350
It's okay.

13
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
It's good enough.

14
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,470
Come on.

15
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,300
Okay.

16
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,590
Eat some dishes.

17
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,570
By the way, Aunt,

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,560
tomorrow,

19
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,580
I won't be coming back for dinner.

20
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,040
You have so much homework.

21
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,910
Kid,

22
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,820
If something is bothering you,

23
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,010
just tell me.

24
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,720
not to keep it to yourself.

25
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,530
I have nothing to say.

26
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,690
Your teacher told me

27
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,610
you had a fight

28
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,450
with classmates at school.

29
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,590
You need to get along with your classmates.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,730
I'm full.

31
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,329
Mom.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040

33
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,570
Mom!

34
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,450
Mom!

35

38
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,570
Mom!

39
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,600
Mom.

40
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,250
Aunt.

41
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,170
Hello, aunt.

42
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,730
We are Du Mingwei's classmates.

43
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,880
Is he here now?

44
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,830
Tomorrow

45
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,330
is Dad and Mum's 100th day.

46
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,190
I want to find a good place
to send them off.

47
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,900
He went to see his parents off.

48
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,890
Didn't his parents already...

49
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,860
Today is their 100th day.

50
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,080
Mingwei went to send them off.

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,050
Do you know where he is now?

52
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,830
He should be near Silver Beach.

53
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,530
It's cloudy. It's going to rain soon.

54
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm going to take him an umbrella.

55
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's go together.

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,530
- Let’s go together.
- Together.

57
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,590
- OK. OK.
- Let’s go.

58
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,340
Juan, don’t go.

59
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,250
Pay the stall fee for this month.

60
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,680
I'll go find my kid.

61
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,170
I'll give it to you later.

62
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,840
Juan,

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,660
Others have paid all the money.

64
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,050
You're the only one left.

65
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,530
It's okay.

66
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,590
Why don't we go first?

67
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,610
We have an umbrella.

68
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,409
And there are many people.

69
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,250
It shouldn't be hard to find him.

70
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,930
Take care.

71
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,570
Goodbye, auntie.

72
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,680
Be careful. Okay.

73
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,890
Everyone has paid.

74
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,290
Only your family is left.

75
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,480
I know.

76
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,490
Dad.

77
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,450
Mom.

78
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,980
It's time.

79
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,060
I'm here to see you off.

80
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
Take care.

81
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,640
Take good care of yourselves.

82
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
Do you hear me?

83
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,160
Did you hear that?

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,080
Do you hear me?

85
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,170
You two must be good.

86
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,570
Stop arguing over there.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,370
Mom gets angry easily.

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Dad, please give in.

89
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't worry about me.

90
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,409
I'm fine here.

91
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll keep going.

92
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,970
Dad.

93
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Mom.

94
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,150
I really miss you.

95
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,370
You naughty boy.

96
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,490
Let's go.

97
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,450
Go home.

98
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,500
One, two, three, four, five, six.

99
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,020
Why is it Yi?

100
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,480
Tell me.

101
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,730
What should we do?

102
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,970
What?

103
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,320
Horizontal, four North, Right?

104
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,570
OK.

105
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,650
One, two, three, four.

106
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,040
I knew it.

107
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,410
Han Shuai.

108
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,850
Young Master.

109
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,770
Obey me.

110
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,280
I went to the market this morning.

111
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,010
I saw

112
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,960
the oil that fried dough sticks

113
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
is black.

114
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,890
We don't know how many times it fried.

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,930
So we don't eat fried dough sticks anymore.

116
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,730
Steamed buns instead.

117
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,460
Steam is more nutritious than fried.

118
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,200
Wei Xing and Shi Wenke

119
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,090
How do they usually perform?

120
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,330
They...

121
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,330
are good.

122
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,170
Ms. Chen also cares about them.

123
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,010
You...

124
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,820
should get along with them

125
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,840
and ask them

126
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,850
if they have any learning methods

127
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,610
to learn?

128
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,570
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

129
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,600
It's time to go to school.

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,840
Come with me.

131
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,290
What are you doing?

132
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,210
She hasn't finished eating yet.

133
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,880
Eggs.

134
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,090
Thank you, mom.

135
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,410
Recite a few more words on the way.

136
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,250
Got it.

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Han Shuai! Han Shuai!

138
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,650
Play a game with me.

139
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:22,770
No.

140
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm doing my exercises.

141
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,610
Just play.

142
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,160
Please. Please.

143
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,130
Look.

144
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,170
This...

145
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,390
is the back of my hand.

146
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Then what is this?

147
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,090
A chair?

148
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,800
It's the back of my chair.

149
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,090
Then what are you?

150
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,050
What? What?

151
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,680
Me?

152
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,450
I'm your father.

153
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm your mother.

154
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,640
You need to master
at least two kinds of shows.

155
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,510
You are doing

156
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,390
very well.

157
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,890
You all should learn from the Wei Xing.

158
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,780
Yes, teacher.

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,850
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

160
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,250
Alright, class is over.

161
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,310
Goodbye, Wei Xing.

162
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,450
Goodbye, Ms. Lu.

163
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,850
Bye.

164
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,560
Go home and practice. Don't slack off.

165
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,420
Teacher, how did you
practice that move last class?

166
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,080
Guys.

167
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,500
look who this is.

168
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,730
Beauty.

169
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,180
Don't go.

170
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,220
Let me just say one thing to you.

171
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,770
Once

172
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,740
there was a sincere feeling in front of me.

173
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,670
I didn't cherish it.

174
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,630
What's the next line?

175
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,080
You'll regret it when you lose it.

176
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,530
You're so eloquent.

177
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,130
Are you done?

178
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,580

You can leave when I'm done.

Don't go.

Let go!

186
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,110

187

Let go!

188
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,480
Sister.

189
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,320
What's wrong?

190
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,050
Let me see.

191

Don't come over.

192
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,130
If you come any closer,

193
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,010
I'll call for help.

194
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,810
Call someone?

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,330
Is anyone there?

196
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,160
No.

197
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,930
You're bullying her.

198
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,320
Aunt.

199
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
You misunderstood.

200
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,400
You're useless.

201

Are you hurt?

205
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,990
I'm okay.

206
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,570
It's just a scratch.

207
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,840
Thank you, aunt.

208

I can't stand it anymore.

222
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,360
Look.

223
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280

Who did it?

226
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,530
Those hooligans in the dance room

227
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,360
bullied us twice.

228
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
We escaped last time,

229
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,860
and now they bullied Wei Xing.

230
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,670
In front of the dance room.

231
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,250

It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

239

No.

240
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,620
Go teach them a lesson.

241

Ke.

242
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,740
You don't know how to fight.

243
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,810
It's inconvenient to fight with glasses on.

244
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,640
My family was bullied.

245

Come back!

250
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,090
Calm down, you two.

What can you get if you go now?

252
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,980
If you lose, go to the ward, or go to jail.

Have you thought about the consequences?

No.

257

You can't afford a mirror, can you?

265
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,650
How about this?

266
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,650
I'll give you one.

If one is not enough, I'll give you ten.

Beat him.

Wait.

272
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,320
Now you're a coward.

273

What were you doing before?

274
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,730
Call her now.

as a standard to define good and bad life.

357
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,620
It seems that
if one fails the college entrance exam,

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,420
their life is simply over.

359

I think the layout is good,

but the main article is still about
new learning and new expectations,
