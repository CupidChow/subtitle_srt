Magician.

179
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,500
If we don't fight,

180
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,910
it doesn't mean we can let you go.

181
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,710
Don't you look down on our class?

182
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,430
How about this?

183
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,630
let's have a match.

184
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,990
If we win,

185
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,740
let Guo Ting join the Student Union.

186
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,400
Do you dare?

187
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,350
Sure.

188
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,130
Good.

189
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,220
A smart answer.

190
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,960
The ordinary class and the key class

191
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,780
will each send one student to participate.

192
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,300
Shi Wenke will give the question.

193
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,430
Whoever gets 20 points first will win.

194
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,230
OK.

195
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,790
The game begins.

196
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,270
The first question.

197
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,780
How often are World Cup matches

198
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,980
played?

199
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,150
Every four years.

200
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,720
Correct.

201
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,450
Next question.

202
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,350
In which city was the 2000

203
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,670
Summer Olympics held?

204
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,270
Sydney.

205
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,070
Correct.

206
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,770
The third question.

207
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Wang Diqiu,

208
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,750
if you admit defeat now,

209
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,670
we

210
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,430
don’t have to compete anymore.

211
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,750
Li Jin, do you want to be beaten again?

212
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,550
He’s anxious.

213
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,800
Diqiu.

214
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,790
If you're not in good condition, switch.

215
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,390
It's okay.

216
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,650
I can beat him.

217
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,990
Diqiu.

218
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,090
This is no time to be angry.

219
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,860
Wei Xing.

220
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,670
Don't forget

221
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,750
you are from our key class.

222
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,710
Yes.

223
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,140
We are all from Xinghe High School.

224
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,940
Does it matter which class wins?

225
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,030
Ting is one of my best friends.

226
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,620
If you cancel her application form

227
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,670
because of prejudice,

228
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,710
I hope

229
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
their class wins.

230
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,760
Yes.

231
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,450
The premise of the competition is fairness.

232
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,910
There shouldn't be gangs.

233
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,750
I agree.

234
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,650
The three of you

235
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,760
work together.

236
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,910
Yeah.
They worked together.

237
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,950
Class 1 is surrounded by a lot of people.

238
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,870
Go take a look.

239
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,220
They seem to be students from Class 1 and 4.

240
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,990
Well.

241
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
Let me try.

242
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,670
You...

243
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,030
I think these questions are quite simple.

244
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,960
He's the worst in his class.

245
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,850
Did you give up?

246
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,520
You sent the bottom to play.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,720
Because you are too weak.

248
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,670
I'm good enough to beat you.

249
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,870
Stubborn.

250
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,000
All right, be quiet.

251
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,000
The game continues.

252
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,720
Next question.

253
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,420
Which country firstly started

254
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,940
the eight-hour working system?

255
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,670
Yi.

256
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,910
You can't raise the board if you don't know.

257
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,040
Britain.

258
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,430
Correct.

259
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,630
Next question.

260
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,840
The first myth of China...

261
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,090
Classic of Mountains and Seas.

262
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,760
Correct.

263
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,230
Are you serious?

264
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,590
Li Jin, can you do it?

265
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,500
If not, change.

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,840
Are you cheating?

267
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,140
You can afford to lose, can't you?

268
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,270
Who said we cheated?

269
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,430
Li Jin.

270
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,190
Don't question the referee's impartiality.

271
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,790
Next question.

272
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,990
The Whiminster Church in London

273
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,080
is located in...

274
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,260
Do you even know the answer?

275
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,720
Don't give them points for nothing.

276
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,180
The north coast of Thames.

277
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,890
Correct.

278
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,290
I knew it.

279
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,470
You got it wrong.

280
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,600
How can you blame us?

281
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,840
Okay, everyone, be quiet.

282
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,700
Next question.

283
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,960
"The Three Friends of the Winter"are...

284
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,840
Pines, plum blossoms, and bamboos.

285
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,340
Right

286
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,750
Yi.

287
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,270
The first military book of our country...

288
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,440
Sun Zi's Art of War.

289
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,910
The city buried by volcano...

290
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,750
PangBei City.

291
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,530
The first military academy in America...

292
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,510
West military Academy.

293
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,030
Paris.

294
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,500
The Strait of Proud.

295
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,030
Niro River.

296
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,270
CS.

297
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,730
It's... It's...

298
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,330
Ultraman.

299
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,890
OK.

300
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,260
The last question.

301
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,740
How many years did the state of Qin

302
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,810
exist from its birth to its demise?

303
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Why don't you answer this question?

304
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,880
If you can.

305
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,920
Answer it.

306
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,210
I'll answer it.

307
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,120
Go ahead.

308
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,080
14 years.

309
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,110
Correct

310
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,740
Yi.

311
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,740
How many years did Qin State exist?

312
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,550
How did you know?

313
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,030
Yes.

314
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,550
The moon of the Qin Dynasty has said it.

315
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,620
I read it every day in class.

316
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,230
Oh, my God. You don't study at school.

317
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,990
You really know this?

318
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,610
Yi, you are my hero from now on.

319
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,070
How would he know that?

320
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,870
Why can't you?

321
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,870
They shouldn't know those.

322
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,710
The game is over.

323
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,950
Class 4 wins!

324
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,840
As for Ting,

325
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,850
I admit defeat.

326
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,270
Okay.

327
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,910
Let's go.

328
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,870
Let's go back to class.

329
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,670
Yi.

330
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,490
Please.

331
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,550
Bye bye

332
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,710
Yi!

333
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,790
Losing to the ordinary class...

334
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,430
Hero!

335
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,530
How embarrassing.

336
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,570
How can we win?

337
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,590
Even our men betrayed us.

338
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,160
We lost.

339
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,350
I admit defeat.

340
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,370
Don't be so petty.

341
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,720
Also...

342
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,290
Let me say it.

343
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,710
To be honest,

344
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,440
you were really embarrassing today.

345
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,750
It's not because you lost the game.

346
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,550
But when Class 4 worked together

347
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,170
and encourage each other,

348
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,900
you were chirping

349
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,270
and blaming each other,

350
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,600
treating them with prejudice.

351
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,750
Is this the so-called good students?

352
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,670
Wei Xing.

353
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,230
And...

354
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,560
Wang Diqiu is my most important friend.

355
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,290
I hope some of you

356
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,910
don't gossip behind my back.

357
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,960
Please behave yourselves.

358
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,230
Wei Xing.

359
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,300
I didn't expect that the two class

360
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,740
had such deep conflicts.

361
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,690
We didn't realize it. It was our negligence.

362
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,470
I need to report to Director Jiang.

363
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,660
No, no, no.

364
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,370
Let them solve their own problem.

365
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,620
Solve it themselves?

366
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,460
How?

367
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,050
There's already a conflict.

368
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,750
What if there's a fight in the future?

369
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,360
Then it should've happened today.

370
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,860
Right?

371
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,880
Don't worry.

372
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,030
We fight for dignity by ourselves.

373
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,650
Sometimes, teachers

374
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,590
don't need to interfere too much.

375
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,390
Fine.

376
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,850
You're a good person.

377
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm the bad guy.

378
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,600
Alright.

379
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,560
Yang Guang.

380
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,710
Gosh.

381
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,840
Brilliant.

382
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,250
You're in a good mood today.

383
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,540
Yes.

384
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,430
I suddenly found that

385
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,750
cursing

386
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,500
turned out to be a great thing.

387
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,950
Who made you angry?

388
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,870
You.

389
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,310
I...

390
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,540
Just kidding.

391
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,570
Someone annoying.

392
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,830
It's a secret.

393
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,540
If he can make you so angry,

394
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,870
he must be hated the people and gods.

395
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,000
It's unforgivable.

396
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,680
Well said.

397
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,590
I support you.

398
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,440
We Xing.

399
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,070
Are we good?

400
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,710
Yes.

401
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,590
I thought you didn't want to talk to me.

402
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,610
No.

403
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,710
It's just that

404
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,350
I'm just...

405
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm just sensitive.

406
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,240
Stop talking about me.

407
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Let's talk about you.

408
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,990
What

409
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,920
do you plan to do?

410
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,339
I...

411
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,270
What plan?

412
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,069
Half of the first semester has passed.

413
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,010
The midterm exam is over.

414
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,310
But

415
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,619
you still act like you don't care.

416
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,369
You have no self-awareness at all.

417
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,270
Diqiu.

418
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,670
My dream is

419
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,190
to get into Beijing Dance Academy.

420
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,950
I will also work hard for it.

421
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
It's a good thing.

422
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,020
If you can get in, you will become

423
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,230
an international dancer in no time.

424
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,670
What about you?

425
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,490
About dreams,

426
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,690
I haven't decided yet.

427
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,250
But if you really want to go to Beijing,

428
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,600
I'll go to Beijing University with you.

429
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,080
Really?

430
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,750
As for others,

431
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,430
Han Shuai will definitely study abroad.

432
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,430
I will

433
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,960
persuade Ting and Shi Wenke

434
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,420
to go with us together.

435
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,230
Deal.

436
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,310
Deal.

437
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,950
Don't copy the answers again.

438
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,470
No problem.

439
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,050
I won't copy again.

440
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,670
Swear.

441
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,230
You made a mistake.

442
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,530
♫You're a shooting star that travels far to the mortal world♫

443
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,490
Swear

444
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,770
♫You have a pair of gentle eyes that look into the crowd♫

445
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,950
We will

446
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,130
go to Beijing together

447
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,760
♫Fly over♫

448
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,640
We will go to Beijing together.

449

♫the darkness I see clearly♫♫

450
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,160
♫All the noise♫

451
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,210
We will go to Beijing together.

452
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,890
♫Is suddenly gone♫

453
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,310

♫You're a shooting star that travels far to the mortal world♫

455

456
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:03,960
♫Listen♫

457
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,620

♫The smile is so warm♫

460
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Comrade Guo Ting.

461
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,710
You look good.

462
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,660
Good.

463
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,360
Wait.

464
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,270
You're 55 seconds late.

465
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,130
Go stand there.

466
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,890
No.

467
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,520
We're friends.

468
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,480
Please make an exception.

469
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,270
As long as I'm here,

470
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,200
you won't get the back door.

471
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,590
Shi Wenke.

472
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
You're just in time.

473
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,510
Talk to her.

474
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,240
You are also a class committee.

475
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,740
I'm not on duty today.

476
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
I don't care.

477
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,050
Wish you good luck.

478
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,470
Go.

479
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,960
Go.

480
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,140
What did you two

481
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,550
do wrong?

482
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm not wearing my uniform.

483
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,220
I'm not dressed properly.

484
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,980
I really regret it now.

485
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,080
Stand still.

486
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,280
Guo Ting.

487
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,210
You're an adult now.

488
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,350
If this gets out,

489
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,060
then...

490
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,360
You'll never meet a Prince Charming.

491
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,890
Wei Xing.

492
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,250
I won't tell anyone

493
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,030
the secret from the novel

494
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,290
and let someone else know.

495
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,300
What secret?

496
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,190
Why are you here?

497
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,070
No night self-learning classes on Friday.

498
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,190
I'm out for a walk.

499
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,990
What's wrong?

500
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,660
Is there a secret in Wei Xing's novel?

501
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,950
Where can't you go?

502
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,430
Why are you here for a walk?

503
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,960
If you don't tell me,

504
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,500
I'll ask her myself.

505
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,710
No, no, no.

506
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,140
I'll say.

507
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,870
Anyway,

508
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
you can't mention a word.

509
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,200
Yes.

510
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,240
Not a word.

511
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,340
We are the only people knowing,

512
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,490
except for Wei Xing.

513
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,760
If this gets out,

514
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,470
that means someone betrayed us.

515
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,910
Yes.

516
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,540
How about this?

517
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,940
Let's give it a code name.

518
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,740
It's called

519
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,250
Chihuahua.

520
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,310
When one of us is about to spill the beans,

521
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,240
we will shout out

522
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,950
Chihuahua

523
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,150
to remind each other.

524
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,760
Okay.

525
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,030
So annoying.

526
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,860
You promised not to tell anyone.

527
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,370
Why are you here for a walk?

528
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,880
To see you.

529
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,190
Me?

530
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,160
I just want to tell you

531
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,230
no matter where I go,

532
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,350
wherever I am,

533
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,160
or what I do,

534
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,330
I will never forget you.

535
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,050
It's late. I'm going back.

536
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,610
Shuai.

537
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,800
You're still up?

538
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,440
Dad.

539
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,560
Why are you still up?

540
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,980
I'll go to bed soon.

541
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,680
Rest early.

542
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,830
Shuai.

543
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,510
Remember.

544
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,960
I

545
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,480
will give you the best.

546
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,940
What's wrong?

547
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,670
Drunk.

548
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,470
I'm going to bed.

549
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,690
You too.

550
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,670
Stop it already.

551
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,070
Jinzhi.

552
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,710
I promise

553
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,590
I will give you

554
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,070
and Shuai the best.

555
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,760
The final

556
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,160
fight.

557
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,630
What nonsense!

558
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,390
Go, go, go.

559
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,170
Finish it and leave. We're closed.

560
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:54,820
Go.

561
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,940
Take your bag and leave.

562
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,750
After this,

563
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,260
give me the last bottle.

564
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,590
What last bottle?

565
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,430
You wish.

566
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,030
Go away.

567
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,460
Final fight.

568
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,440
Take your bag.

569
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,180
Let's go.

570
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,630
Who's calling?

571
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,120
Shuai.

572
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,370
Mom.

573
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,950
Are you with dad?

574
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,960
My son?

575
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,750
He's here.

576
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,030
I'll talk to him.

577
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,320
He is drunk.

578
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,550
Don't worry.

579
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,610
-Go to sleep.
-Son.

580
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,500
Will dad come back tonight?

581
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,790
Tonight?

582
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,010
Tonight...

583
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,240
No.

584
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,870
Shuai.

585
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,710
Go to sleep.

586
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,990
I'm fine.

587
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,870
I...

588
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,270
I've done something wrong

589
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,230
to know you.

590
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,550
Jinzhi.

591
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,440
You know what?

592
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,890
I just want you

593
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,650
to stay with me for a little longer.

594
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,110
I just want to see you and my son every day.

595
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,090
Then I will feel...

596
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,380
♫I want a window♫

597
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,570
Relieved.

598
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,510
♫ that sunshine goes through♫

599
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,520
♫that I can see the snow in winter♫

600
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,470
♫I want a window♫

601
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,860
♫To see the moon♫

602
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,940
♫Imagine the future♫

603
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,590
♫Why is the night getting longer♫

604
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,680
♫and I'm getting forgetful♫

605
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,050
♫If there is a window of my heart♫

606
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,770
♫I might not be lost♫

607
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,550
♫Listen, he's playing the guitar♫

608
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,770
♫He's still enjoying the wandering poem♫

609
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,260
No way.

610
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,250
I failed.

611
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,140
It's okay.

612
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,150
I'll treat you to a nice dinner tonight

613
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,090
so that you can leave in peace.

614
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,770
Did you pass?

615
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,110
English 109.

616
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,610
I'm going to study abroad.

617
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,470
The money for IELTS is not in vain.

618
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,550
What's wrong with you?

619
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,240
Why are you a traitor?

620
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,390
After playing games with me every day,

621
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,990
did you study behind my back?

622
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,420
Am I that kind of person?

623
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,840
At this moment,

624
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,400
you have to admit one thing.

625
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,070
What is it?

626
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,500
You and Chihuahua are of the same blood.

627
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,070
So,

628
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,530
your IQ may be...

629
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,070
All the immortals bless me.

630
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,270
Please save me.

631
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,100
I must be better than Ting.

632
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,540
What?

633
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,550
You have several higher scores than me.

634
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,790
You're done.

635
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Aunt won't let you go.

636
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
It's okay.

637
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,180
I'll always be your back.

638
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,150
The last one.

639
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,630
Bro.

640
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,900
You're the best.

641
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,810
Of course.

642
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,700
What are you two doing?

643
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,630
Nothing.

644
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,630
Do you know the midterm exam results?

645
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,240
Yes.

646
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,090
Tell your parents about the meeting tonight.

647
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,150
I'll say it again for who was not here.

648
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,670
Don't play any tricks.

649
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,910
Just notify them.

650
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,790
I'll text them one by one to check.

651
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,990
Text?

652
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,360
The results of this midterm exam

653
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
are out.

654
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,150
First place.

655
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,870
Wei Xing.

656
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,180
The second place

657
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,980
Shi Wenke.

658
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,470
No.3, Jiang Wenwen.

659
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,890
The three of them

660
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,830
are also top three in the grade.

661
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,480
After scanning

662
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,990
this test paper,

663
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,230
what troubled me the most is that I have

664
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,710
said many times about the guide numbers

665
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,640
but you still made mistakes on it.

666
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,770
I'm leaving.

667
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,370
Okay.

668
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,210
I'm leaving too.

669
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:48,960
Bye.

670
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,440
Wenwen.

671
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,590
Let me go with you.

672
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,370
Wei Xing.

673
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,480
Ting.

674
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,150
-What?
-Tell me.

675
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,170
Do I treat you well?

676
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,610
Do you?

677
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,190
Sure.

678
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,970
Do me a favor.

679
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,480
Your test paper.

680
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,280
Don't show it

681
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,430
to my mom.

682
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,790
Can you hide this from her?

683
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,840
The only good thing for Yang

684
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,540
is to not announce rankings in class.

685
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,760
Judging from my scores,

686
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,620
she won't know if I did well or not.

687
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,290
Just make it through tonight.

688
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,220
I'm begging you.

689
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,990
Ting.

690
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,470
Is there something on my face?

691
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Why do you keep looking at me?

692
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,390
Chihuahua.

693
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,500
Nothing, nothing.

694
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,630
Very beautiful.

695
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,200
Let's go.

696
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,110
Promise me.

697
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,900
Let me consider it.

698
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,110
I beg you.

699
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,190
You should have done better earlier.

700
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,230
Next time.

701
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,180
Sorry,

702
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,980
the number you dialed is not connected.

703
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,470

704
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,590
Han Shuai.

705
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,010
Wait for me.

706
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,810
Sorry.

707
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,860
the number you dialed is not connected.

708
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,340
Please try again later.

709
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,970
Sorry.

710
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,710
The phone is just a decoration.

711
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,480
Honey,

712
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,560
How am I tonight?

713
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,870
Truth?

714
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,920
Of course.

715
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,820
Truth.

716
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,300
Nice.

717
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,230
Let me see.

718
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,790
You dressed up.

719
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,820
This handbag is so delicate.

720
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,520
Isn't the parents' meeting tonight?

721
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,860
We can't embarrass our child, right?

722
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,660
Yes.

723
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,630
Where is Han?

724
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,070
Why isn’t he here?

725
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,170
Isn't he in charge of Shuai this month?

726
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,680
I don't know where he is.

727
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,030
Business.

728
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,430
Shuai could only call me.

729
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,150
Wei,

730
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,510
tonight,

731
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,330
you have to share your education

732
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,680
experiences with us.

733
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
What's there to share?

734
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,580
Wei Xing does everything on her own.

735
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,040
She is self-disciplined.

736
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,220
If our Diqiu

737
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,150
was half as good as your Wei Xing,

738
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,460
I would be satisfied.

739
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,310
Let's talk on the way.

740
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,630
Let's go.

741
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,560
Let's go.

742
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,950
I can't take it anymore.

743
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,760
I can't take it anymore.

744
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,610
Grandma! Ting!

745
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,160
What’s wrong?
I’ll hide in Han Shuai’s place for a few days.

746
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,190
I can’t stand it.
What’s wrong?

747
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,060
Wang Huanyu!

748
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,910
Mom, nice shot!

749
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,860
Come here!

750
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,030
I'm a fool to go over.

751
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,670
Don't hit him.

752
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,480
I won't.

753
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,380
Just a few words.

754
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,440
-Grandma.
-I won’t.

755
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,120
Ting!

756
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,910
Take care.

757
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,910
Mom, don't worry.

758
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,230
-Mom.
-Come here.

759
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,630
Mom!

760
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,870
I'm a fool to go over.

761
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,000
Mom! Mom!

762
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,010
We agreed not to fight.

763
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,010
We agreed not to fight.

764
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,140
Stop running!

765
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,790
You got such a bad result.

766
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,460
If you don't get beaten up,

767
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,390
how can you face your father and me?

768
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,740
What can I do?

769
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,840
What can you do?

770
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,950
Didn't you take the exam?

771
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,480
Mom, I was wrong.

772
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,150
Wang Diqiu!

773
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,590
Stop!

774
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,370
Dad.

775
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,740
There are eight bottles of shampoo.

776
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,340
Okay.

777
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,750
Wei Xing! Uncle Wei!

778
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,590
Help me! Help me!

779
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,900
Don't embarrass me here.

780
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,580
Auntie.

781
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,500
It's no use hiding behind Wei Xing.

782
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,770
Aunt, calm down.

783
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,040
-Huiqin.
-Calm down.

784
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,190
Calm down.

785
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,230
What happened?

786
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,510
Wei has to do business.

787
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,780
Let's talk at home.

788
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,820
Wei.

789
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,140
When you go to school,

790
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,010
you get applauses.

791
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,430
When I go to school,

792
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,550
I get shame.

793
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,750
Last monthly exam,

794
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,870
he barely gave me a middle-level result.

795
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,430
But this time he got

796
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,150
into the bottom ten.

797
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,200
It dropped so fast.

798
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,800
If you don't get good grades,

799
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,150
you can still improve it.

800
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,330
If you get sick,

801
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,620
it won't be worth it.

802
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,790
Can you say something else?

803
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,270
You always tell me...

804
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,350
Don't be angry.

805
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,310
Give me a solution already!

806
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,570
Look at you.

807
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,550
You can't work

808
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,670
and you can't take care of our son.

809
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,210
What can you do?

810
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,990
Don't worry.

811
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,470
How about this?

812
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,140
From now on,

813
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,230
I'll tutor Diqiu.

814
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,150
I'll do it every day on every course.

815
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,740
I can definitely improve his grades.

816
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,890
That's great.

817
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,790
Wei Xing.

818
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,170
Wei Xing.

819
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,070
Can he do it?

820
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,530
Can he be saved?

821
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,070
Yes, he can.

822
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,290
It's still a long time before the CEE.

823
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,150
Besides,

824
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,770
people create miracles in the last year.

825
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm counting on you.

826
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,790
Don't worry.

827
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,550
I will teach him well.

828
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,800
Your mom looks like a face-changer

829
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,910
in Sichuan opera.

830
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,910
I just want to talk to you

831
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,390
about Wenwen's study.

832
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,720
Wenwen is a good kid.

833
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,760
She has always got good grades.

834
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,190
And the ranking of this exam is very stable.

835
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,270
Stable?

836
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,960
Stability means dropping down.

837
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,950
Isn't she getting far away

838
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,770
from colleges?

839
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,750
So,

840
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,110
I want to ask you

841
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,730
if you have any unique

842
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,480
or better learning methods?

843
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,440
Wenwen's mom.

844
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,410
You are too anxious.

845
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,940
In senior year, being stable

846
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,830
also means being strong.

847
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,420
Besides, this midterm exam

848
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,790
is similar to

849
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,980
the monthly exam paper.

850
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,750
But Wenwen's grades have improved.

851
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,210
It means she has improved.

852
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,490
It's the sensitive period of senior year.

853
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,890
If you talk too much,

854
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,190
when she gets nervous,

855
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,830
she might not be able to do well as usual.

856
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,710
In my opinion,

857
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,190
she should

858
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,680
spend more time with the students

859
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,610
with good grades

860
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,160
to study and urge each other.

861
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,490
Isn't it a good thing to improve together?

862
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,469
Mom.

863
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,909
You're back.

864
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,699
Why are you standing here?

865
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm really thirsty.

866
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,670
Mom.

867
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,880
What did Ms. Chen say?

868
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,679
Youu still ranked third this time,

869
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,630
but

870
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,610
Ms. Chen praised you.

871
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,350
Keep up the good work.

872
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,540
Don't be too proud.

873
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,850
Aren't you angry?

874
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,949
Ms. Chen talked to me

875
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,050
about the monthly exam.

876
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,350
I was too impatient.

877
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,110
Although our goal is to be

878
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,230
the top student.

879
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,350
It cannot

880
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,150
be done in a moment.

881
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,300
By the way,

882
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,640
how is your relationship

883
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,190
with Wei Xing and Shi Wenke?

884
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,080
We're quite close.

885
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,400
That's good.

886
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,350
When you have time,

887
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,110
just talk to them

888
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,210
and communicate with them

889
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,340
to learn from them.

890
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,280
Take that!

891
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,250
Are you hot? I bought you ice cream.

892
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,780
I can get you.

893
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,720
Han Shuai.

894
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,140
How dare you!

895
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,690
What a man!

896
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,990
No, no.

897
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,940
It's a misunderstanding.

898
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,400
I was aiming at Wang Diqiu.

899
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,450
It's okay.

900
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,520
It's just water.

901
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,740
Just wipe it.

902
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,790
What's wrong with you?

903
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,870
Don't hold it back.

904
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,840
Tell me.

905
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,020
Don’t move.

906
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,850
Take your pick, Han Shuai.

907
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,790
I’ve been looking for you.

908
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,720
You are here.

909
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,950
What's wrong?

910
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,130
Wenwen's birthday is in a few days.

911
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,490
I've thought about it with Wei Xing

912
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,150
to prepare a birthday surprise for her.

913
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,150
What do you think?

914
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,820
Sure.

915
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,130
Let’s go and pick a birthday gift for her.

916
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
What do you think, Han Shuai?

917
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,810
No problem.

918
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,740
Same.

919
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,070
Look.

920
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,720
The green is so pretty.

921
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,320
Like Hulk.

922
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,630
Shi Wenke.

923
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,430
Talk to them.

924
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,490
Are they childish?

925
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,470
Let me take a good look.

926
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,750
The tongue.

927
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,730
The color is pretty.

928
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,760
A man is smart.

929
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,540
A bunch of men are idiots.

930
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,200
Let's go.

931
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,510
I've become so soft.

932
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,030
I don't want to eat anymore.

933
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,890
Let me help you.
