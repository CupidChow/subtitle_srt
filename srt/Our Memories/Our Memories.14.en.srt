The glasses are fine.

They are not broken.

It's okay.

Thank you anyway.

Yes, thank you.

In this business,

65
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,530
it's too hard

66
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,070
to do something.

67
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,950
It's hard to take any job.

I heard that Shanghai

Han,

72

don’t you want to try?

73
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,810

74
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,170
Think twice.

75
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,650
I dare not go.

76
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,480
It would be great if it was that easy to start a business.

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,070
Yes, Han is right.

78
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,710
Yes.

79
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,980
It's not easy to start a business.

80
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,780
In my opinion,

81
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,360
no matter how hard it is,

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,890
there is one thing I must do well.

83
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,730
That is

84
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,820

Cheers to your wife.

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,150

You're so loquacious.

how can they?

97

That's the funeral custom.

98
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,640
The adults want it to be lively

99
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,159
so that their family can leave in peace.

100

What is this?

110
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,990
Why is it so scary?

111
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,460
No.

112
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,950
These are all my cards.

113
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,540

She's mine. She's mine.

126
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,030
It hurts.

127
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,930
Why did you fight?

128
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,160
Grandma,

129
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,650
don't tell my parents about this.

130
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,120
If my mom knows,

131
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,430
she will skin me.

Where does it hurt?

144
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,670
My hand hurts too, Grandma.

145
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,360
Go away.

146

It's urgent.

This Cantonese is really interesting.

149
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,150
Forgive me for being unruly and indulging in love.

150

Isn't it so deep?

151
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,710
Who can understand that?

152
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,430
I don't have a Grandmother anymore.

153
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,490
It's okay.

154
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,230
All right.

155

The atmosphere here is a little heavy.

156
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,710
Right?

157
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,940
I told you.

158
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,600
If the elderly left in a dream,

159
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,950
that'd be a happy event.

160
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,470
We're having a celebratory banquet today.

161
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,440
Why are you pulling a long face?

162
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,510
Come on.

163
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,680

All right, don't cry. I'm here.

168
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,790
Don't mention Grandma.

169
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,550
Don't be sad in front of Diqiu and Tingting.

170
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,800
Try to liven up the atmosphere.

171

After school starts,

172

OK?

Hurry up.

176

Don't be late on the first day of school.

177
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,250
Get up.

178
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,090
Ting, get up.

179
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,000
Guo Ting.

180
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,590
Stop sleeping.

181
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,110
Get up.

182
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,520
Get up and go to school.

183
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,190
Guo Ting.

184
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,070
Who's calling me?

185
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,250
I'm going to school.

186
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,590
Diqiu!

187
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,180
Wake up, Diqiu.

188
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,540
Don’t force me to play tricks.

189
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,390
Wang Diqiu, wake up.

190
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,030
Where is he?

191
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,190
Downstairs.

192
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,430
Ting, hurry up.

193
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,680
Don't be late on the first day of school.

194
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,190
Good morning, Aunt and Uncle.

195
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,920
Morning.

196
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,609
I'll go get some porridge.

197
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,290
It seems

198
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,500
abnormal.

199
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,910
He's too abnormal.

200
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,780
Is he up to something?

201
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,360
What's wrong with that?

202
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,260
He's grown up.

203
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,290
I hope he has grown up.

204
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,890
Hurry up.

205
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,510
Well,

206
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,780
I heard the new president of the US is switching today, right?

207
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,130
Yes, his name is Ma...

208
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,070
Who cares?

209
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,810
Mind your own business.

210
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,250
Ting.

211
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,840
Thank you, mom.

212
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,760
Gosh.

213
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,790
Have you finished your homework?

214
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,620
I'll lend it to you if you haven't finished.

215
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,350
Finished?

216
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,150
I've been waiting for this ending.

217
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,560
Wang Diqiu is already a good student.

218
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,330
A good student doesn't need to copy homework, understand?

219
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,860
Besides, I've finished it.

220
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,580
Sure.

221
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,590
Wei Xing.

222
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,930
Wang has been weird lately.

223
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,360
Although he's still cheap,

224
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,790
but he's different.

225
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,010
He wakes up early every day

226
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,170
and does housework.

227
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,530
He's so strange.

228
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,870
If

229
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,890
there is a shortcut to growth,

230
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,270
it should be a setback.

231
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,240
What about you, Ting?

232
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,910
I want to be happy.

233
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,300
I want Grandma to rest assured.

234
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,750
Good stuff.

235
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,430
My cousin gave it to me during Chinese New Year.

236
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,080
What?

237
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,130
The most popular online game, Dungeon & Fighter.

238
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,010
It is more popular than CF.

239
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,740
I hope you two

240
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,990
download it tonight

241
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,990
and go to the instance zones with me.

242
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,830
After the college entrance examination.

243
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,560
I quit playing games recently.

244
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,230
Me too. I quit playing games.

245
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Where is Mr. Yang?

246
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,480
He's not here. Stop pretending.

247
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,600
I was so scared.

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,860
Let me tell you.

249
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,030
It's not easy to get this.

250
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,260
My cousin brought it back from Beijing.

251
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,110
If I lose it,

252
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,960
I'll be heartbroken.

253
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,510
The CEE is in a few months, Yi.

254
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,400
Can you focus on your study?

255
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,220
These exams are just ordinary exams.

256
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,940
I don't care as a genius.

257
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,110
Aren't you two really going to to play?

258
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,140
What is it? Let me see.

259
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,740
Wait.

260
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,480
Let go!

261
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:51,910
Sir.

262
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,240
One.

263
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,910
Two.

264
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,930
Yi.

265
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,130
How are you now?

266
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,560
You've seen my social, right?

267
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,100
During winter vacation,

268
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,300
my mom asked a teacher from Peking University to tutor me.

269
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,210
He said if I don't work hard,

270
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,280
I'd only be able to get in Peking University.

271
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,540
So annoying.

272
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,590
Shi Wenke.

273
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,570
Where did you find a tutor during winter vacation?

274
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,010
I don't think I need it.

275
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,540
Yeah.

276
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,090
Why waste money

277
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
when you are always the top3?

278
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,730
The good grades are real only without tutoring.

279
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,720
Yes.

280
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,740
You don't talk. You just nod.

281
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,450
After the end of the Six Kings the empire bounded by the four seas was unified under a single ruler.

282
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,060
And with Shu Shan stripped of its woods,

283
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,660
the E'Pang Palace appeared.

284
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,340
It stretched to more than three hundred li,

285
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,870
covering the sun in the sky.

286
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,870
From the north of Li-Shan it meandered to the west,

287
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,750
and then made straightway for Xianyang.

288
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,400
Two rivers flowing gently coursed their way

289
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,150
into the palace-walls.

290
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,260
Alright, class is over.

291
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,700
On the E'Pang Palace

292
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,600
hasn't been in the examination for years

293
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,400
but it's still on the key points.

294
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,100
So the probability of this year's exam is very high.

295
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,740
You all need to memorize it.

296
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,430
Did you have a good winter vacation?

297
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,500
Yes.

298
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,430
Good.

299
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,070
I hope you can keep it up.

300
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,130
The first mock exam is about to begin.

301
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,670
One

302
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,450
is to test the results of your last semester.

303
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,360
The other

304
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,950
is to see if you slack off during the winter vacation.

305
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,550
The results of this exam are posted.

306
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,520
I won’t hide it for you.

307
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,750
Zhao Heng,

308
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,910
come with me.

309
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,230
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,520
I'm late.

311
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,550
Ting, where did you go?

312
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,730
I decided to go to the directors' art exam.

313
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,980
So I sneaked out to sign up at noon.

314
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,010
I only take the first class tonight.

315
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,380
The one standing in front of you now

316
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,520
is the rising star in the future film industry.

317
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,620
[Yingyou Training]

318
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,220
Why didn't you

319
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,640
discuss with us about such a big thing?

320
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,170
Even I didn't know about it.

321
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,630
You are such a troublemaker.

322
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,830
Have you thought it through?

323
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,830
This is not a joke.

324
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,240
What kind of attitude is that?

325
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,290
Being a director is my dream.

326
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,690
So I have to take actions.

327
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,100
Alright, I believe in Ting.

328
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,430
She must have made the decision

329
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,870
after careful consideration.

330
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,430
Right?

331
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,620
Wei Xing.

332
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,860
You are the best

333
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,460
Actually the art exam's admission score

334
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,990
is much lower than the examination.

335
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,310
Ting's decision

336
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,050
was right.

337
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,700
When did you come up with this idea?

338
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,670
This morning.

339
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,530
So you signed up at noon?

340
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,630
Yes.

341
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,120
Actually, I have this idea since Chinese New Year.

342
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,070
I made up my mind this morning.

343
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,040
Trust me.

344
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,310
I'm going back to class to study.

345
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,490
I don't have time to listen to your nagging.

346
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,790
Shi Wenke, it's time for class.

347
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,750
Time for class. Let's go.

348
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,980
Wei Xing.

349
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,460
Han Shuai.

350
