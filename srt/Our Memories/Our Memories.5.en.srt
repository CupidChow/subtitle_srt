00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,320
You're back.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,250
Yes.

Wenke, look.

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,200
These are my trophies.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,520
These books

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,870
were printed in limited quantities.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,150
I specifically sought them out
and brought them back.

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,780
Why are you staring at Du Mingwei?

16
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,190
I just think he is weird.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,880
You knew he was more handsome than you.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,960
Are you jealous?

19
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,620
I don’t need to compete with him.

20
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,620
Your perspective is as shallow as
a Chihuahua.

21
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,750
Come on...

22
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,310
It's so crowded, Brother Yi.

23
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,950
Help me!

24
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,710
Du Mingwei is a big fool.

25
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,070
Nowadays, every breath I take beside him

26
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,380
feels wrong to me.

27
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,660
I deeply miss the joy and freedom
I felt living life on my own.

28
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,260
Han Shuai,

29
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,990
What do you think is weird about him?

30
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,110
Today, I...

31
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,600
unexpectedly ran into him at the restaurant
my mom and I own.

32
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,340
Aunt Jinzhi, right?

33
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,450
It's me.

34
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,260
You are?

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,650
I'm Du Juan's nephew.

36
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,260
She's busy today.

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,620
So...

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll carry the goods.

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,360

- No, no.

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,550
Thank you.

Let's go.

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,030
Let me buy you a drink.

44
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,190
No, thanks.

45
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,310
Don't mention it.

46
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,170
No need.

47
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,540
I'm leaving.

48
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,750
Mom.

49
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,950
He...

50
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,310
He said he's Juan's nephew.

51
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,310
So what?

52
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,750
Don't interrupt me.

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,010
He's in 12th grade now.

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,560
He didn't take
the local college entrance exam,

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,240
and he came all the way to his aunt.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Isn't it strange?

57
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,200
Besides,

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,740
Aunt Du Juan is not a local.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,870
She's from Sichuan.

60
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,230
Alright.

61
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,190
Let's start the class.

62
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,050
It's personal.

63
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,730
Don't tell anyone about this.

64
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,500
Come on.

65
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,210
Have a seat.

66
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,340
Mingwei made it.

67
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,370
You know what?

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,720
His dishes

69
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,940
are quite delicious.

70
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,560
He has grown up.

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,500
Why is it so quiet today?

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,850
I don't know.

73
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,060
Have you heard that

74
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,270
Du Weiwei's family sells fish.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,950
Who spread this?

76
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,450
Han Shuai.

77
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,550
No.

78
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,750
Although I don't like him,

79
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,150
I didn't spread the news.

80
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,270
Nor me.

81
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,990
Guo Ting.

82
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,150
She has a big mouth.

83
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,380
I...

84
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,830
It can't be her.

85
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,390
She only reads novels every day.

86
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,720
She doesn't care at all.

87
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,140
But Han Shuai's analysis was reasonable.

88
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,630
His family runs a fish stall.

89
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,150
They won't make much money.

90
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,680
He can only wear fake shoes.

91
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,950
What I wear

92
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,640
has nothing to do with you.

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,560
Do I need you to analyze

94
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,790
like a detective?

95
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,660
No.

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,480
My family sells fish at a stall.

97
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,550
What's wrong?

98
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,790
Who is bothering you?

99
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,350
No.

100
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,080
It's not me who spread this.

101
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,060
It’s a misunderstanding.

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,180
- Calm down.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,310
He didn't mean it.

104
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,690
Don't touch it!

105
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,980
Tingting didn't mean it.

106
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,570
Du Mingwei, calm down.

107
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,470
This must be a misunderstanding.

108
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,510
Han Shuai said it wasn’t him.

109
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,430
Of course not.

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
It's okay.

111
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,160
You don't have to be a peacemaker.

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Diqiu doesn't owe you anything.

113
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,500
Why are you being so hostile towards him?

114
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,720
What are you guys doing in the back?

115
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,630
Class begins.

116
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,610
Extra spicy strips. Math is invincible.

117
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,070
I'm so mad.

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,430
Du Mingwei...

119
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,820
When did I say
I discriminate on fish sellers?

120
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,810
My mom runs a restaurant too.

121
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,610
She goes to the market every day.

122
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,390
Judging from what you said,

123
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,890
Student Du

124
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,270
is a bit grumpy.

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,360
Diqiu.

126
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,350
Don't be so passionate to him in the future.

127
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,450
We are classmates.

128
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,190
We'll meet each other often.

129
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,040
It can't be helped if we fall out.

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,770
You are really the Holy Mother.

131
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,350
No, Father.

132
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,480
Don't you know enough about Diqiu?

133
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,030
He couldn't resist

134
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,150
getting involved in this matter

135
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,410
Wei Xing knows me well.

136
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,470
Fine.

137
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,270
You're truly a man worthy of my admiration.

138
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,160
What can I do?

139
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,559
Actually...

140
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,230
your problem is communication.

141
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,309
Between guys,

142
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,270
it's not uncommon for
tension or conflict to arise

143
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,669
Why don't you wait for a while?

144
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,110
If you force him to talk about this,

145
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,720
he wouldn't listen.

146
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,260
If he has a bad attitude, you'll be angry.

147
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,520
It'll be more vicious.

148
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,470
That makes sense.

149
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,590
I listen to Wei Xing.

150
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,270
Me too.

151
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,530
Wei Xing is right.

152
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,510
Hurry up.

153
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,670
Who can solve this question?

154
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,070
Guo Ting.

155
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,150
You answer it.

156
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,540
I choose B.

157
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,030
Why?

158
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,020
Among three short and one long options,

159
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,150
choose the longest.

160
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,260
What if they are the same?

161
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,090
If you hesitate, choose C.

162
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,080
When to choose A or D?

163
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,950
BBCAC.

164
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,640
There must be A among the five.

165
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,270
Okay.

166
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,110
Sit down.

167
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,230
Tingting.

168
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,670
She must summarize this
when she copied the answers

169
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,070
at Shi Wenke Bookstore.

170
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,950
Look, Du is so angry.

171
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,670
Let me inform you.

172
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,800
The school will organize
an earthquake drill tomorrow.

173
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,000
The time is pending.

174
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,190
Okay.

175
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,610
Get ready and go home.

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,140
Are you happy?

353
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,110
Much better.

354
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,050
Idiot.

355
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,070
Looks like she's fine.

356
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,830
Cool. Enjoy.

357
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm going to play mahjong.

358
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,580
Aunt Du will send tomorrow's dishes

359
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,540
earlier.

360
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,670
Pay it for me.

361
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,990
Then go back and do your homework.

362
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,700
Mom, bye.

363
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,510
Bye.

364
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,400
Here.

365
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,350
I was in a hurry today

366
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,490
and I forgot my wallet.

367
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,110
No. No.

368
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,700
It's okay.

369
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,500
I'll exchange the money for you.

370
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,350
Unbelievable.

371
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,790
Why do you always lose your temper?

372
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,010
Wei Xing, what are you being

373
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,920
so mysterious.

374
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,990
All right.

375
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,500
Look.

376
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,530
Try it.

377
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,250
Under the dim, lonely light,
my thoughts are broken.

378
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,580
As I gaze upon the moon through the curtains,
I heave a long sigh of melancholy.

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,960
Am I still quite cultured?

380
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,740
Coming.

381
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,370
Beauty Guo.

382
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,580
B.

383
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,330
T.

384
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,820
F.

385
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Chinese English.

386
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,540
Beautiful.

387
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,030
Wang, is your B OK?

388
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,030
Stop posing.

389
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,070
So funny.

390
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,130
You can't even stand properly.

391
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,100
Sister,

392
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,840
Happy now?

393
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,800
Who would have thought you have

394
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,070
such a sensitive and fragile heart.

395
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,360
One takes the opportunity to learn a lesson.

396
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,040
From now on,

397
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,070
it's best to give more compliments.

398
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
She's happy now.

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,950
I’m still angry.

400
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,230
Du Mingwei came to my house to
deliver dishes today.

401
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,580
I told him to give him a change.

402
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,320
but he suddenly threw a tantrum at me.

403
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,620
My mom and Aunt Du Juan are good friends.

404
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,030
We never quibble over

405
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,810
something like that.

406
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,410
In my opinion,

407
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,700
we should try a more gentle way.

408
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,300
A gentle way?

409
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Where is Guo Ting?

410
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
I'm starving.

411
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,270
Let's eat.

412
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,640
It's her turn today.

413
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,270
Welcome to the midday broadcast,

414
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,830
Xinghe Music Column.

415
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,150
A song was ordered for Du Mingwei today.

416
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,030
Hope music can cure him.

417
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,650
Wish him happiness every day.

418
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,210
We can be with him.

419
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,150
Du Mingwei.

420
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,040
Did you order the song?

421
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,600
Yes.

422
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,030
Do you have a grudge against me?

423
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,120
No.

424
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,030
I want...

425
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,590
Turn this off.

426
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,320
I said turn it off!

427
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,130
Turn this off.

428
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,070
You hurt me.

429
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,710
Let go!

430
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,760
Du Mingwei.

431
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,790
Come at me.

432
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,600
Don't touch me!

433
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,530
Stop.

434
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,680
Get up.

435
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,080
What are you looking at?

436
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,350
So what?

437
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,270
Don't make a mistake if you're embarrassed.

438
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,550
Hold your hands tightly.

439
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,610
You haven't eaten?

440
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,170
Does your hand hurt?

441
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,360
Are you okay?

442
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,400
Are you still dreaming?

443
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,880
12th grade, 12th grade

444
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,040
You'll become a mother
if you don't graduate.

445
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,550
Calculate how much time is left
until the college entrance exam?

446
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,310
Wang Huanyu.

447
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,900
Yes.

448
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,990
Why is it always you?

449
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,510
Are you trying to piss me off?

450
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,530
Mr. Yang,

451
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,390
I wish you could live a long life.

452
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,870
Stop joking.

453
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,020
Du Mingwei, look at you.

454
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,460
How did you take care of your new classmate?

455
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
I...

456
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,220
What?

457
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,330
Stand still.

458
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,710
Hold your hands tightly.

459
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,040
I'll come back to check.

460
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,630
Hold tight.

461
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,020
It's okay.

462
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,490
Mr. Yang is in a meeting.

463
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,680
Have some water.

464
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,360
Thank you.

465
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,310
I'm not thirsty.

466
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,910
Thank you.

467
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,250
Don't force yourself.

468
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,650
It's not embarrassing to drink some water.

469
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,950
I don't know

470
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,750
what upset you at the broadcasting station,

471
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,150
but we really meant well.

472
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,360
Well,

473
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,670
I apologize on behalf of everyone.

474
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,070
You could say we're now friends
through this experience,

475
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,910
and it's over.

476
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,390
Kindness?

477
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,070
You...

478
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,070
What's wrong with caring about you?

479
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,950
Mr. Yang.

480
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,170
Ms. Chen, you have a class?

481
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,800
Yang has left. Stop looking.

482
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,700
Is that something you should care about?

483
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,590
What did I say?

484
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,270
Right.

485
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:58,870
Come here.

486
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,880
I called you here

487
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
to talk about Du Mingwei.

488
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,910
We did it out of goodwill.

489
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,310
What Inverted Dragon's Scale did we touch?

490
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,270
No matter what,

491
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,930
it's wrong to fight a girl.

492
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,310
Moreover, it's Guo Ting.

493
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,830
It's indeed his fault.

494
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,790
But...

495
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,390
you are young

496
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,020
and grew up in a happy family.

497
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,830
You can't understand some situations.

498
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,130
Take me as an example.

499
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,260
My family was poor when I was young.

500
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,110
Four years in college
was the hardest for me.

501
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,840
Did your classmates bully you?

502
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,170
It's the opposite.

503
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,310
My classmates are nice to me.

504
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,630
The school also cares about me.

505
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,540
The school applied for tuition fee

506
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,470
and sent me

507
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,670
a Love Card.

508
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,990
That kind of meal card is
six yuan for others.

509
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,990
Three yuan for me.

510
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,200
So I never worry about food and drinks.

511
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,760
Then I don't understand.

512
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,310
Everyone is being so nice to you,

513
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,770
why are you still unhappy?

514
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,960
It's just because
everyone is being too kind to me.

515
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,640
Every time I went to the canteen to take out my meal card,

516
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,770
it's written as "Love Card" on the top.

517
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,490
Others will naturally look at me

518
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,410
with concern and sympathy.

519
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,560
I was forced to be treated differently.

520
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,830
So, I rather starve

521
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,160
than eat in the canteen.

522
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,030
Yang,

523
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,670
I think I understand what you mean.

524
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,870
You are all good kids.

525
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,340
I know you all are well-intentioned.

526
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,550
But remember,

527
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,350
excessive sympathy

528
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,170
is not necessarily the best form of care.

529
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Mr. Yang is right.

530
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,000
Du Mingwei is deeply hurt.

531
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,550
We can't wipe it out by doing these things.

532
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,080
Instead, it will make him feel unqualified.

533
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,870
I remember a psychology book mentioning that

534
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,890
when dealing with someone who has been hurt,

535
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,960
the best attitude is to treat them
with equality and sincerity.

536
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,930
Leave the rest

537
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,600
to time to heal.

538
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,110
Poor Du Mingwei.

539
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,470
It has happened.

540
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,240
Let's find a way to solve it.

541
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,030
I'll apologize to him now.

542
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,150
No wonder you're a chihuahua.

543
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,150
If you go to the classroom now,

544
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,200
everyone is watching.

545
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,800
It's adding fuel to the fire.

546
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,230
What should we do?

547
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,070
Tomorrow is the weekend.

548
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,670
Let's find a time

549
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,270
to apologize to him.
