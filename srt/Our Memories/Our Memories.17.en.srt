It won't cost a penny.

15

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,510
Fine. That's for all.

175
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,070
Why didn't you come

176
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,940
yesterday?

177
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,860
I had a phone call with Wei Xing.

178
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,770
Why are you so late today?

179
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,740
Yi,

180
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,040
what brings you here today?

181
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,400
She went to my home for something. I sent her back.

182
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,800
What is it?

183
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,490
None of your business.

184
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,320
Look at you.

185
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,150
The national college entrance exam is less than 100 days away.

186
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,550
Why do you still only care about having fun?

187
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,650
Who told you we're having fun?

188
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,210
Guo Ting will take the unified exam soon.

189
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,530
There are still many movies she hasn't watched.

190
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,100
I happened to have a lot of resources in my home.

191
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,070
So I brought them here especially.

192
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,040
Forget it, Yi.

193
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,150
In his eyes,

194
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,220
we are the type of people who like to have fun.

195
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,880
Anyway, Yi will watch movies with me in the future.

196
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,280
I don't need you anymore.

197
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,570
Bye.

198
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,430
Right?

199
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,310
Take care.

200
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,600
Be careful in Beijing.

201
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,040
Okay, I got it.

202
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,390
By the way,

203
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,370
have you memorized all the knowledge points I required?

204
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,780
Yes, of course.

205
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,830
I've memorized the Ode to the Red Cliffs

206
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,270
and the map of ocean currents.

207
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,050
I've also memorized the historical significance of the four major campaigns.

208
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,780
Don't worry.

209
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,140
What's there to brag about?

210
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,200
Wei Xing.

211
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,950
I'll introduce you to others who are also preparing for the Beijing Dance Academy.

212
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,790
Okay. Got it.

213
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,660
I'll be right there.

214
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,120
I'll wait for you outside.

215
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,670
Diqiu, I gotta go.

216
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,030
I have something else to do.

217
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,930
Do your best for tomorrow's second mock exam.

218
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,230
I'll wait for your call

219
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,360
9:30 p.m. tomorrow.

220
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,020
Keep bragging!

221
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,510
Look at you now.

222
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,530
Han Shuai,

223
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,840
well,

224
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,260
Wei Xing has made friends in Beijing so soon?

225
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,740
Are they men or women?

226
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,720
Are they close?

227
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,520
How would I know?

228
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,110
But,

229
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,720
I heard that boys who can dance

230
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,960
are all handsome

231
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,420
and attractive to girls.

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
Can't you say something nice?

233
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,210
Why are you here?

234
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,280
Where is Ting?

235
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,490
Yi is with her.

236
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,050
She doesn't need me.

237
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,050
Are you hungry?

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,730
Do you want some dumplings?

239
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,430
Why?

240
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,070
The sour smell in the air almost flushes into my nose.

241
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,250
There's no need to eat dumplings with vinegar.

242
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,510
It's very convenient.

243
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,030
You said I'm jealous?

244
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,910
I'm jealous of her?

245
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,830
Are you kidding me?

246
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,740
When I see Guo Ting,

247
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,590
I...

248
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm so annoyed!

249
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,100
Don't worry.

250
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,280
Ting usually reads romance novels.

251
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,390
There will be nothing between her and Yi.

252
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,190
I don't care.

253
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,910
You're pretending to be cool.

254
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,370
Fine.

255
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,710
I'm going up to do my homework.

256
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,990
If you have time, coax her.

257
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,740
I told you I wouldn't be jealous of her!

258
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
It tastes so sour.

259
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,640
Stop writing.

260
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,510
Time's up.

261
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,220
Hand in your test papers.

262
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,050
How was your exam?

263
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,440
Not bad.

264
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,990
Where is Ting?

265
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,440
She'll go to the city for the unified exam tomorrow.

266
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,110
She probably went back to pack up.

267
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,870
Someone

268
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,720
should seize his time.

269
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,440
Shi Wenke.

270
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,070
Lend me your bike key.

271
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,050
I'll get going!

272
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,620
♫A clear and vague gaze♫

273
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,140
Remember to coax Ting!

274
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,730
Got it!

275
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,940
♫Surrounds the blue sky♫

276
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,570
♫And keeps its promise♫

277
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,600
♫The smell of soda in that summer♫

278
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,420
♫The wind brings a trace of longing♫

279
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,930
♫The story after that is like an unfinished poem♫

280
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,920
♫Disappearing in the hustle and bustle before someone knows♫

281
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,310
♫The unfinished dream♫

282
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,210
♫The unmailed letter♫

283
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,880
♫Who should send it?♫

284
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Guo Ting!

285
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,000
♫Let's not say goodbye♫

286
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,070
♫We'll always be young♫

287
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,270
Ting!

288
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,120
♫Turns out that the dazzling light♫

289
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,420
♫Is youth shining into my world♫

290
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,370
♫At night when I toss and turn♫

291
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,920
♫Every day and night♫

292
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,340
♫When we're going to be apart♫

293
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,850
♫For a better future♫

294
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,400
Look at what they've done.

295
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,160
I told them in class

296
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,550
to memorize Hokkaido-based Fishery,

297
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,590
Peru-based Fishery,

298
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,070
and Newfoundland-based Fishery, in particular.

299
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,200
But they still chose the wrong answer.

300
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,300
They're the worst students I've ever taught.

301
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,460
Exactly.

302
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,970
Their essays are the same old.

303
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,510
They didn't even try

304
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,920
to memorize the advanced sentence patterns at all.

305
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm so furious!

306
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,349
Diqiu.

307
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,990
Wei Xing!

308
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,910
Why did you come back suddenly?

309
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,670
I came back after the art exam.

310
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,550
Great.

311
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,810
Look, I'm still doing my homework.

312
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,930
How was your second mock exam?

313
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Tell me the truth.

314
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,520
Did you fail the exam?

315
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,230
Wei Xing.

316
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,770
I trusted you so much.

317
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,320
But you disappointed me!

318
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,440
Wei Xing!

319
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,780
Wei Xing!

320
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,510
This time,

321
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,250
the students who rank first and second in our class

322
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,670
are also the top and second ones in our school,

323
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,670
that is, Shi Wenke and Jiang Wenwen.

324
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,140
Come on, applaud them!

325
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,750
Wenwen,

326
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,770
you did very well

327
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,130
in the second mock exam.

328
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,190
You bounced back to the normal state.

329
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,300
Trust yourself.

330
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,330
You need to be more confident

331
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,670
and concentrated.

332
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,030
Don't make the same mistake as you did in the first mock exam again.

333
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,320
Got it, Ms. Chen.

334
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,260
This time,

335
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,730
I'd like to especially praise one student.

336
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,790
Han Shuai!

337
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Come on. Stand up.

338
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,950
Han Shuai

339
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,660
makes it to the top 30 in the second mock exam.

340
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,820
Let's give him a round of applause.

341
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,150
He has only been in our class for a short time.

342
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,390
Many other students in our class are not as good as him.

343
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,350
This time, some of you have improved,

344
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,080
while some of you have slipped.

345
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,080
I won't criticize them one by one.

346
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,390
I'll cut to the chase.

347
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,830
Let's start to explain the test paper.

348
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,670
Open it.

349
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,110
Come on.

350
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,970
Here's the hot lamb soup.

351
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,350
Wenwen,

352
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,970
I'll praise you once.

353
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,810
You did well this time.

354
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,470
I knew Shi Wenke was the problem!

355
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,200
Don't talk to him

356
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,040
at school.

357
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,980
Do you hear me?

358
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,840
Good girl.

359
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,590
[Self-study Session]

360
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,320
Let's go play basketball?

361
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,960
Okay.

362
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,970
Let's go.

363
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,380
Let's go to play basketball.

364
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,230
I'm not in the mood because I didn't do well in the exam.

365
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,290
You guys should go.

366
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,670
Rest is also essential for learning.

367
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,870
It's no need to hurry.

368
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,430
You said that yourself.

369
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,240
You're right.

370
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,210
I should study hard while I'm studying.

371
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,730
I should enjoy it while I'm having fun.

372
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,290
Let's go.

373
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,730
Team up for 3V3. Anyone come with us?

374
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,030
Wang Huanyu,

375
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,590
didn't you see no one is talking to you?

376
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,650
Seems that you don't have sharp eyes.

377
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,790
We kindly invited you guys. Go or not.

378
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,590
Han Shuai,

379
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,620
your grades have improved.

380
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,490
Can you not drag us into slipping?

381
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,570
What are you talking about?

382
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,800
There are 34 students in our class.

383
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,280
Everyone's grades are stable and so are their rankings.

384
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,250
After you and Wang Huanyu came,

385
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,480
you took two places.

386
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,490
Wang Huanyu can't be included.

387
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,470
He doesn't have the strength as anyone does in our class.

388
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,360
Who knows how he got good grades in the first mock exam?

389
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,730
He keeps staying in our class.

390
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,390
-What did you say?- Forget it.

391
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,950
Monitor,

392
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,630
Wang Huanyu and Han Shuai

393
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,690
are disturbing us.

394
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,720
They can play if they want.

395
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,750
Why are they disturbing us?

396
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,660
Stop talking!

397
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,920
Wenwen is the monitor.

398
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,050
Don't make things difficult for her.

399
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,710
Let's go.

400
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,480
They're so mean.

401
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,280
They snitched on us.

402
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,430
The learning atmosphere in our class is tense.

403
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,360
Their reactions

404
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,710
are understandable.

405
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,410
It's more comfortable to be in my own class.

406
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,670
Guys, let's go to the playground for 3V3.

407
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,150
Nope.

408
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,810
Why?

409
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,490
Three of you are just enough. Let's go.

410
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,030
Are you three

411
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,670
afraid of the team composed by me and Diqiu?

412
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,270
I...

413
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,640
I'm hungry.

414
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,770
I'm too exhausted to play with you.

415
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,190
Let's eat something.

416
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,130
I've got a game,

417
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,030
named Chinese Paladin 3.

418
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,360
Do you want to have a try?

419
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,840
Chinese Paladin 3?

420
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,910
I like playing it too.

421
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,310
Yi, why don't you lend it to me for a few days?

422
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,390
That won't be necessary.

423
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,330
Why?

424
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,430
Right.

425
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,890
Mr. Yang could say that it's we who lead you astray.

426
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,490
Yeah.

427
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,890
What's wrong with you three?

428
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,670
Your behaviors are abnormal.

429
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,870
You're acting weird.

430
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,320
Forget it.

431
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,450
Let's take turns for 1V1. Let's go.

432
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,260
Hold on.

433
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,500
You must finish the four test papers

434
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,850
handed out tonight.

435
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,520
The teacher will check the answers tomorrow.

436
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,720
You're so clumsy.

437
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,540
I'm waiting for Wei Xing's call.

438
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,620
The art students all gather in Beijing once a year.

439
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,020
Many art students strive for the few places

440
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,000
to get into college.

441
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,130
Next, we're going to interview some of them.

442
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,380
They're outstanding talents among the art students.

443
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,030
W-Wei Xing!

444
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,350
She's on TV!

445
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,890
Now I'm in a famous dance room.

446
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,380
Most of the candidates will get their training here.

447
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,910
The girl and the boy in the camera are dancing gracefully through collaboration.

448
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,090
Wei Xing looks so beautiful and she's dancing so well.

449
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,880
The boy is handsome too.

450
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,750
I'm going upstairs to do my homework.

451
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,490
Okay.

452
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,670
Aunt!

453
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,150
I'm back!

454
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,200
Ting is back!

455
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,390
Why are you here?

456
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,000
I came to Wang Diqiu to do my homework.

457
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,200
And I'm heading back.

458
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,120
My girl,

459
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,170
how was your exam?

460
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,730
It went well, of course.

461
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,790
They were so happy to see me and kept praising me.

462
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,710
Really?

463
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,550
My girl is so amazing!

464
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,730
I'll tell your mom.

465
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,190
Why are you still here?

466
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll leave right away.

467
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,760
Suit yourself.

468
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,560
I'm really leaving!

469
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,080
Bye.

470
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,430
What did my mom say?

471
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm really leaving!

472
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,050
Diqiu,

473
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,640
you must work hard.

474
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,650
As long as you work hard,

475
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,030
you will definitely be admitted to the university you like.

476
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,070
I'll call you

477
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,090
as long as I'm available, okay?

478
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,920
I'll miss you very much.

479
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,230
Me too.

480
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,990
You want to go back to Class 4?

481
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,710
Is there anyone in Class 1 pushing you out?

482
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,860
No.

483
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,460
Everyone is nice to me.

484
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,540
Well,

485
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,880
I still need to contact your parents.

486
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,010
I understand your concerns.

487
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,890
But your parents' opinions are still important.

488
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,950
I can't let you go if they don't agree.

489
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,140
Got it.

490
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,940
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

513
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,070
recently.

514
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,430
He's in Class 1 now.

515
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,110
And Wei Xing has tutored him.

516
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,910
That's true.

517
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,110
But boys

518
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,950
always need time to accumulate.

519
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,240
I can't keep studying anymore.

520
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,670
Mom, here.

521
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,850
Are you done with your review?

522
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,990
Yes. Go away.

523
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,820
Go away.

524
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,390
Mom, have some fruits.

525
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,800
Is the weasel paying respect to the hen without the best of intentions?

526
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,770
No.

527
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,870
I just want to show you my filial piety.

528
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,390
Here.

529
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,280
Mom, you can have some

530
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,490
while I'm giving you a massage.

531
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,730
How does it feel, Mom?

532
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,550
Is it comfortable?

533
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,270
Not bad.

534
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,030
It hurts. Be gentle.

535
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,710
It's muscle damage.

536
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,870
How could I not suffer from such damage?

537
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,230
I serve you guys every day.

538
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,140
But now,

539
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
you're in Class 1.

540
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,210
My efforts are not in vain.

541
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,220
When you get into college,

542
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,470
your dad and I

543
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,480
can travel around the world.

544
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,410
I also want to have grandchildren.

545
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,910
What's wrong?

546
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,910
Why do you stop massaging her?

547
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,870
I want to go back to Class 4.

548
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,140
What did you say?

549
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,030
Really?

550
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,030
Don't even think about it!

551
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,940
Class 1 doesn't suit me.

552
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,080
What do you mean?

553
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,260
What do you mean?

554
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
You should adapt to the environment, not vice versa.

555
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,850
You finally got into Class 1 and yet you want to go back to Class 4.

556
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,180
Are you out of your mind?

557
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,850
Our neighbors all know it.

558
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,270
If you go back to Class 4,

559
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,110
your dad and I

560
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,190
will lose face.

561
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,830
Right.

562
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,760
Many students want to get into Class 1 but they can't.

563
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,490
I just want to go back to Class 4.

564
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,350
I haven't hit you for days.

565
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,550
Do you want a beating?

566
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,880
I'm going to study!

567
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,080
I'll criticize him.

568
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,910
What is he thinking?

569
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,970
Yi!

570
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,070
Wang is going back to Class 4.

571
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,710
Really?

572
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,320
He said it before me.

573
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,670
But,

574
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,630
it needs the consent of Ms. Chen and Aunt.

575
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,750
It's okay.

576
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,670
I knew that Wang Diqiu would never give up on us.

577
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,020
Good for him!

578
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,990
I've been really depressed at home lately.

579
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,250
I didn't even dare to stay for breakfast.

580
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,750
I can only hope

581
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,700
Ms. Chen can help me persuade my mom today.

582
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,740
I don't understand

583
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,130
why you have to go back to Class 4.

584
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,590
Bro,

585
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,200
you don't understand.

586
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,480
You can keep up with the learning rhythm in Class 1.

587
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,310
But I just got so lucky

588
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,790
to get good grades in the first mock exam.

589
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,350
I memorized all the points the exam covered.

590
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,010
Or, I happened to know about the answers.

591
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,410
There are more exams now.

592
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,210
My weak foundation

593
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,630
is gradually exposed.

594
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,840
If I keep staying in Class 1,

595
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,440
I'll be overwhelmed because of the great pressure,

596
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,040
and my grades will get worse.

597
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,610
If that's the case,

598
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,540
I'll be farther away from Wei Xing.

599
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,500
Actually,

600
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,150
Diqiu is right.

601
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,860
Sometimes, the environment that suits us can be more helpful to discover our potential.

602
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,910
The so-called key class and ordinary class

603
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,960
can't represent our rankings in the future.

604
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,910
It's just that

605
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,700
we need to follow the social rules.

606
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,260
It's like a dream

607
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,550
to hear such opinions from the top student in our grade.

608
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,640
Don't worry.

609
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,600
Although I'm not in the same class with you,

610
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,840
as long as I work hard,

611
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,160
I can be admitted to a good university.

612
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,720
-Fighting. -Fighting.

613
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,500
What are you up to standing there?

614
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,910
Do you want to team up for 3V3?

615
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,520
We need one more person.

616
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,390
We can also make it a mixed game.

617
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,220
-Let's go. -Let's go.

618
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,410
Diqiu, Han Shuai, I'm sorry.

619
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,370
We were a little petty before.

620
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,350
Tell me, what was that?

621
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,630
I always felt

622
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,190
you were close with those from Class 1

623
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,830
and didn't want to play with students with bad grades like us.

624
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,750
What are you talking about?

625
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,880
Are Han Shuai and I that kind of people?

626
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,930
To be frank, we were not confident enough

627
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,530
and easily gave up.

628
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,850
Come to think of it,

629
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,980
I'm not manly at all.

630
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,110
Nonsense.

631
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,710
Go! Get up for another round.

632
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,210
Come on.

633
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,880
I know what happened even though he didn't tell me.

634
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,150
My students in Class 1

635
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,630
pushed him out.

636
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,470
They unduly emphasize grades and rankings,

637
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,670
treating their classmates as enemies.

638
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,730
It's not their fault.

639
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,530
They all value these things.

640
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,100
Take the students from Class 4 as an example.

641
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,550
They look happy,

642
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,330
but they all want to strive for their future.

643
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,330
It's my fault.

644
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,210
I put a lot of pressure on them invisibly.

645
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,890
Should I learn from you?

646
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,770
I shouldn't always mention grades or rankings.

647
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,030
It's still necessary in different cases.

648
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,530
A reasonable competition can promote progress.

649
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,260
The key is how to guide them to see competition in a critical manner.

650
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,230
Actually, I'm here today

651
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,510
to talk

652
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,570
about Wang Huanyu.

653
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,550
Well,

654
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,600
if he got into trouble, I'll teach him a lesson.

655
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,650
Did he fight with someone?

656
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,850
No.

657
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,410
Wang Huanyu is a good kid.

658
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,850
Don't be too nervous.

659
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,930
I'm here today

660
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,270
to talk

661
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,090
about if he can go back to Class 4.

662
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,600
I can't let him go back to Class 4.

663
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,050
He finally got into Class 1.

664
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,530
Well...

665
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,570
He definitely doesn't want to study hard and wants to slack off.

666
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,900
How can we listen to him?

667
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,140
Calm down.

668
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,860
Just listen to her, okay?

669
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,950
How about this?

670
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,940
I'll show you his grades, okay?

671
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,030
These

672
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,590
are his previous grades when he was in Class 4.

673
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,070
He made progress every time.

674
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,490
Below them,

675
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,660
these are the grades after he came to Class 1.

676
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,100
His grades are unstable

677
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,920
and quite fluctuating.

678
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,780
He has thought it through.

679
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,610
He thinks the learning atmosphere of Class 1 doesn't suit him.

680
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,350
Sometimes, stress is not necessarily a good thing.

681
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,590
If he goes back to Class 4,

682
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,310
he'll come back to a learning environment he is familiar with,

683
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,710
which is good for his further improvement.

684
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,820
Huanyu told us about this.

685
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,930
But we thought he wanted to slack off again.

686
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,120
Yeah. So I didn't agree.

687
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,030
He has grown up.

688
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,370
He's very self-aware.

689
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,490
I believe you know that more than I do when he's at home.

690
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,540
Yes.

691
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,190
Son.

692
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,350
Mom.

693
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,070
Why are you here?

694
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,409
Are you sleepy?

695
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,790
I am.

696
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,940
But I still have two test papers to do.

697
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,370
You can go back to Class 4.

698
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,920
Really?

699
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,280
Mom,

700
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,239
you're so wise,

701
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,800
lovely, and kind-hearted!

702
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,280
-Thank you, Mom! -Stop it!

703
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,679
Stop flattering me.

704
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,469
As days pass by,

705
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,469
I watch you grow up from a little baby

706
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,370
to a tall grown-up.

707
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm very happy.

708
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,900
But,

709
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,360
I never

710
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,300
really paid attention to your needs

711
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,540
or respected you.

712
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,540
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,850
Mom,

714
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,260
don't say this.

715
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,690
It's nothing.

716
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,110
Now, you can go back to Class 4 from Class 1,

717
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,120
with the support of your dad and me.

718
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,190
But,

719
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,870
you have to work hard

720
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,130
for your life and dreams,

721
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,880
okay?

722
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,550
Don't worry.

723
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,930
I will be responsible for myself.

724
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,170
I trust you.

725
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,530
All right.

726
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,940
Go to bed early.

727
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,630
Go back and rest.

728
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,640
You too.

729
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,730
I'm leaving.

730
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,700
This class

731
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,800
is the last one

732
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,090
for Wang Huanyu as a member of Class 1.

733
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,710
He volunteered to go back to Class 4 to study.

734
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,350
Say goodbye to everyone.

735
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,890
I have a good time

736
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,150
in Class 1,

737
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,490
although it's a short time.

738
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,670
I wish you all the best in your studies.

739
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,350
Bye.

740
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,870
Wang Huanyu!

741
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,700
I have to apologize to you.

742
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,300
I'm sorry.

743
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,890
Me too. I'm sorry.

744
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,360
We shouldn't have said that to you.

745
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Actually, when you first came here,

746
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,030
we were not happy.

747
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,710
But now that I think about it, you didn't do anything wrong.

748
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,240
We were too narrow-minded.

749
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,490
Please stay.

750
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,560
Stay with us.

751
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,870
Yeah. Stay with us.

752
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,110
I know.

753
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,320
The conflict between us

754
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,320
is due to the fact that I'm not good enough.

755
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,470
You worked so hard in your freshman and sophomore years

756
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,000
and made it to the key class.

757
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:45,830
But I

758
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,130
got in only because of an exam.

759
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,060
In the past month in Class 1,

760
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,110
I was often surrounded by a tense atmosphere,

761
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,940
namely, grades and rankings.

762
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,870
Such atmosphere

763
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,190
made us argue

764
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,280
and anxious.

765
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,360
We fought with others before we knew it.

766
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,250
Now that I think of it,

767
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,210
if there's time,

768
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,890
I might as well do a few more test questions.

769
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,140
Class 4 suits me better.
