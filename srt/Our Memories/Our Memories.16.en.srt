00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,590
What the hell?

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,980
Why are you howling early in the morning?

[Our Memories]

00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,990
Ms. Zhang, here.

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,590
Let me show you Diqiu's performance in the exam.

11
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,270
Huiqin,

12
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,030
he performed so well!

13
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,990
He's like me.

14
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,020
He has improved a lot.

15
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,030
He can definitely get into university.

16
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,910
I didn't dare to think about it before.

17
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,960
But now, I think he may have a chance.

18
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,230
He can do it.

19
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,470
-Wish you good luck. -Okay.

20
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,190
I won't bother you then.

21
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,190
-Okay. -Bye.

22
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,030
Okay, bye.

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,190
Jinzhi.

24
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,590
Look.

25
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,630
Look at you.

26
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,760
You're so boring.

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,160
Why can't you praise him?

28
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,230
I heard you showing off from afar.

29
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,230
Aren't you tired?

30
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,060
No.

31
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,880
This is just the fifth one. It's not enough.

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Diqiu performed well in the exam.

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,579
I'm more than willing to share the news with others

34
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,040
even if I'll be exhausted.

35
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,320
I wasn't as crazy as you when Shuai ranked first in his class.

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,380
That's different.

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,160
In the past, the neighbors bragged to me

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,230
about how many scores

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,650
their children got.

40
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,230
Now,

41
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,950
I, Li Huiqin,

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,790
have such a chance to brag about my child's success.

43
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,100
Look at you.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
How proud you are!

45
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,730
Have some water.

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,770
Sit down and rest.

47
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,940

48
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,870
I'm hungry.

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,820
Let's see if I can get you something to eat.

50

Ting.

51
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,490
You can have some to hold you over.

52
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,070
Mom!

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,370
Mom!

54
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,190
Stop yelling.

55
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,760
Your mom is not here.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,660
She hasn't come back yet?

57
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,630
I guess

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,960
she won't come back

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,740
until she walks around the Universe Street.

60
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,250
How about this?

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,450
I'll go find your mom.

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,490
I'll go with you, Dad.

63
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,510
Ting, wait for us.

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,410
Okay.

65
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,710
Hurry up.

66
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,690
Wei Xing,

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,860
my good girl.

68
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,170
Diqiu performed well this time,

69
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,209
thanks to you.

70
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,870
Ms. Li, I didn't do anything.

71
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,370
It's mainly because Diqiu made a lot of effort.

72
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,490
I can brag

73
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,950
before others.

74
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,390
But I'm not going to shamelessly say he's credited with what he achieved

75
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,240
in front of you.

76
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,860
I know him best.

77
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,250
His English is self-created.

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
His Maths depends on charms.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,110
He relies on casting dice when encountering multiple choices.

80
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,200
So, you taught him well.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,050
You're credited with his good performance.

82
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,159
-Mom. -Mom.

83
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,659
I'm hungry.

84
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm so hungry that I made a mistake.

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,450
Look at me.

86
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,010
How could I forget you?

87
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,430
Wei Xing, I'm leaving.

88
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,409
Thank you.

89
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,520
Goodbye.

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,440
Thank you.

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,280
Go back.

92
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,630
Wei Xing.

93
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,710
Think of this

94
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,140
as the reward

95
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,410
for the tutoring you offered to Diqiu.

96
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,960
Take it.

97
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,820
Here.

98
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,840
Ms. Li, no need.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,640
I didn't do anything.

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,230
If you don't take it, I would think it's too little for you.

101
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,910
Take it.

102
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,930
Take it. Take it.

103
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,990
Mom. Mom. Mom.

104
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,150
Give it

105
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,110
to me.

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,150
What are you up to?

107
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,330
If you give it to her now,

108
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,630
she won't take it.

109
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,830
I can give it to her secretly during private tutoring.

110
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,600
He's right.

111
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,820
If you dare take it all for yourself,

112
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,180
you'd better be careful of your legs.

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,380
I swear. It won't happen.

114
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,110
I won't do it.

Let's go.

119

123

I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

124
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,470

Do you?

What do the three shots

127
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,760
of throwing a bone at the beginning of the 2001: A Space Odyssey show?

128
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,240
Time dilation, time compression,

129
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,740
time stagnation, and time repetition.

130
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,930
Isn't it just about throwing a bone?

131
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,700
Now I think

132
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,610
the maths questions we solved at school are quite simple.

133
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,410
Yes.

134
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,950

138
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,630
It's too hard.

139
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,750
This is too hard for me.

Don't try to take advantage of me.

Mr. Yang is here!

144
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,890
Mr. Yang,

145
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,850
everyone in Xinghe High School knew about

146
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,310
Han Shuai and Wang Huanyu!

147
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,860
Exactly.

148
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,680
The former top 60 of the whole grade

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,210
all came from the key class.

150
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,320
But this time,

151
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,710
you've brought honor

152
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,320
to our ordinary classes.

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,380
Ms. Wu, I'm still here.

154
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,800
Aren't you afraid that I'll be unhappy?

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,910
Mr. Yang, you can't hide your secret.

156
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,030
You have to share with us the experience

157
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,770
about how you improved the students with poor academic performance.

158
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,120
He did it himself.

159
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,000
He is smart.

160
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
He just didn't focus on his studies.

161
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,900
Now that he has focused on his studies,

162
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,870
he knows how to gain good grades.

163
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,470
It would be much easier for him to study well.

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,270
This is not a martial arts novel.

165
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,340
Like he opened his Conception and Governor vessels?

166
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,400
I don't believe it.

167
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,530
Neither do I.

168
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,280
Mr. Yang is right.

169
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,090
I don't think

170
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,750
there are stupid students in the world.

171
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,150
Instead, there are students who don't want to spend their time on their studies.

172
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,950
As for Wang Huanyu and Han Shuai,

173
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,210
since their grades are outstanding,

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,040
the school

175
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,360
should

176
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,210
provide them with a better learning environment.

177
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,650
Director, you mean...

178
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,550
The school decided to let Wang Huanyu and Han Shuai

179
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,630
study in Class 1

180
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,710
to try to get better results after 4 months.

181
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,790
Ms. Chen, when they're in Class 1,

182
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,950
please pay more attention to them.

183
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,220
Okay, no problem.

184
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,350
Really?

185
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,070
Yang,

186
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,480
we can study in Class 1!

187
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,200
Don't call me Yang.

188
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,490
I was so excited.

189
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,140
Dear, respectful Mr. Yang.

190
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,670
Yang,

191
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,270
if we study in Class 1,

192
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,500
will other students

193
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,179
have any objections?

194
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,039
Of course not, since the school has decided on it.

195
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,860
It's okay

196
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,750
to have one or two more people study in the class.

197
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,390
Mr. Yang,

198
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,070
when can we study in Class 1?

199
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,880
You can go now!

200
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,510
Really?

201
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,210
Tomorrow. Tomorrow!

202
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,270
Don't you need to pack up your things?

203
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,600
I've already talked

204
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,730
to Ms. Chen.

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,500
You can ask her directly if you need any help.

206
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,750
I understand.

207
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,120
If she knows, it means you also do.

208
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,380
Now is not the time for you to think divergently.

209
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,820
You're from Class 4 no matter what happens.

210
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,120
You have to listen to me even though you're in Class 1.

211
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,910
Don't worry, Mr. Yang.

212
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,110
Although we'll study in Class 1,

213
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,040
we'll always be members of Class 4.

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,070
Go pack your things up!

215
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll take care of it.

216
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,530
You've shown your true colors!

217
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,290
Wang.

218
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,830
Are you going to study in Class 1?

219
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,790
The news traveled fast.

220
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,350
Yang told us just now.

221
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,030
Then, will you go?

222
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,710
Yes.

223
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,470
Of course.

224
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,350
This is a good opportunity.

225
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,240
Class 1 is the key class.

226
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,870
Yes.

227
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,830
What about me?

228
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,230
Wang Diqiu!

229
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,950
It's fine that you studied secretly.

230
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,950
But you're even going to study in Class 1?

231
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,240
Yi, calm down.

232
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,980
I swear

233
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,410
I'll always be a member of Class 4

234
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,740
no matter what happens.

235
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,280
I don't believe you.

236
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,210
Just let them go

237
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,180
if they want to.

238
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,310
[Sea view B&B]

239
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,270
Mom?

240
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,790
Huiqin?

241
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,710
What are you doing?

242
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,430
Son.

243
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,020
From now on,

244
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,090
I won't be mean to you anymore.

245
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,180
I won't beat you or scold you anymore.

246
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,990
I'll always be gentle to you.

247
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,110
What do you think?

248
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,990
Mom. Mom. Mom.

249
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,350
Dad. Dad. Dad.

250
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,640
I'm scared.

251
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,470
What are you talking about?

252
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,180
Here, Son.

253
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,140
Have some oranges.

254
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,600
Come on.

255
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,630
I'll peel one for you.

256
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,870
No need, Mom.

257
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Why not?

258
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,040
Your hand

259
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,900
is specially used for exams

260
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,770
to bring glory to our ancestors!

261
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,320
Let me peel one for you.

262
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,190
Mom.

263
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,080
Shouldn't we use some incense to pray?

264
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,850
Go find the memorial tablets.

265
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,110
But,

266
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,100
it's not a festival now.

267
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,280
-I don't think it's necessary. -No need.

268
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,260
Why not?

269
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,340
Let's go.

270
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,180
-Let's go! -Dad.

271
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,630
Dad. Dad. Dad.

272
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,640
-Let's go. -Dad. `Dad. Dad!

273
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,470
We've got so many things to celebrate...

274
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,860
-In our home. -Mom.

275
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,030
Mom!

276
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,000
Huiqin

277
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,060
is probably being too overjoyed.

278
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,800
That's because Diqiu always failed exams.

279
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,640
This time,

280
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,070
he performed so well.

281
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,540
She's in a different mood now, of course.

282
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,350
Exactly.

283
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,160
We're the ones with great presence of mind.

284
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,870
We

285
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,610
have experienced all kinds of hardships.

286
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,000
Look how funny Aunt Li is.

287
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Am I right?

288
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,890
Where are you going? Don't you want to watch the movie?

289
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,310
Who is it?

290
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,970
Me.

291
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,660
I'm sleepy!

292
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,890
Come in. Come in.

293
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,790
What's wrong?

294
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,050
Are you still mad at me?

295
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,700
I can learn more knowledge if I study in Class 1.

296
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,340
And you know

297
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,420
my family is poor now.

298
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,090
They can't send me abroad for studies.

299
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,400
University is my only way out.

300
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,960
I thought you could understand me.

301
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,250
I didn't expect

302
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
you're mad at me.

303
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,420
That's not what I meant.

304
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,000
I just...

305
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,970
What?

306
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,350
The three of us were having so much fun.

307
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,110
No one will talk to me anymore

308
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,470
after you guys leave.

309
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,450
Aren't there Du Mingwei and Yi?

310
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,210
They can accompany you.

311
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,160
Besides,

312
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,470
Class 1 is so close to Class 4.

313
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,130
You can come to me after class whenever you want.

314
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,600
It's a deal then.

315
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,480
You're not allowed to be others' close friends.

316
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,950
Okay.

317
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,430
Again? Haven't you got bored with it?

318
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,010
-It can't be broken no matter what happens. -It can't be broken no matter what happens.

319
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,850
If you don't obey it,

320
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,090
you'll be cursed

321
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,730
with stepping on shit when you go out,

322
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,880
not bringing tissues to the toilet,

323
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,180
and no seasoning bags for instant noodles!

324
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,420
Is it necessary to be like this?

325
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,200
Yes.

326
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,870
Fine.

327
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,780
I promise you.

328
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,510
You're not angry anymore, right?

329
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,110
Yes.

330
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,500
Why are you so happy?

331
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,770
Are you proud just because you've improved a little?

332
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,950
You did well in this exam

333
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,870
because what you prepared complied with the exam questions.

334
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,800
Don't slack off.

335
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,020
I won't.

336
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,310
I can't focus

337
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,020
because I'm so excited.

338
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,700
Why are you so excited?

339
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm going to be your deskmate tomorrow.

340
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,810
My deskmate is Shi Wenke.

341
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,450
How can you be my deskmate?

342
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,670
I almost forgot this thing.

343
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:38,780
Here.

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,460
Please put down your pens.

345
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,990
Today, let's welcome Wang Huanyu and Han Shuai

346
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,340
from Class 4.

347
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,240
From now on,

348
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,660
they'll join our class and study with you together.

349
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,000
I hope you can help each other.

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,260
Come on. Welcome them!

351
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,700
Where do you want to sit?

352
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,580
Ms. Chen,

353
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,680
Wang Huanyu can take my seat.

354
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,440
He just joined our class,

355
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,580
and Wei Xing

356
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,750
can help him.

357
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,560
Well,

358
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,630
what do you think?

359
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,710
Yes!

360
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,060
I'd like to sit with her!

361
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
If I sit with the top student in my grade,

362
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,150
I'll study harder.

363
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,390
Fine.

364
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,720
Go ahead.

365
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,590
Shi Wenke, you and Han Shuai can sit in the last row.

366
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,830
Wei Xing and Shi Wenke,

367
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,070
you have to help them

368
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,950
keep up with our class as soon as possible, alright?

369
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,860
I'm leaving.

370
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,640
Come on. Let's start the morning reading.

371
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,970
Hello, it's Shizai Bookstore.

372
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,130
How can I help you?

373
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,990
It's okay.

374
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,030
Huanyu, you may go back to your seat.

375
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,119
Let's take a look at their answers.

376
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,620
Huanyu,

377
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,910
you should listen to the second question carefully later.

378
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,980
It's okay. Take your time.

379
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,810
I believe you can solve the question next time.

380
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,730
Come on.

381
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,060
Stop what you're doing.

382
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,470
The weekly exam will begin.

383
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,950
Is there a weekly exam in the school?

384
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,030
There is no such rule in the school.

385
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,000
But our class will use night self-learning classes

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,460
to hold an exam once a week.

387
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,680
Hurry up and pull your desk.

388
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,600
-Alright. Has everyone had the test paper? -Put these away.

389
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,070
Don't talk to each other.

390
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,730
Begin with your test papers.

391
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,540
Hurry up.

392
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,150
If you don't want to leave after school,

393
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,610
then you do have a problem.

394
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,100
Wei Xing, please help me with this question.

395
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,030
Which one?

396
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,760
-Wenwen. -Ke.

397
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,550
Hello.

398
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,650
This one?

399
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,580
Let's go home.

400
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,730
You should go home by yourself.

401
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,190
We just finished the exam.

402
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,710
We haven't finished our homework yet.

403
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,370
We plan to finish it at school before going home.

404
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,650
Ting.

405
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,050
Why don't you come with us?

406
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,460
Forget it.

407
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,080
I'll also study for a while with them.

408
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,530
I can't be a drag on them.

409
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,810
Fine.

410
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,590
Well,

411
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,570
we're leaving.

412
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,360
Bye.

413
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,910
Bye.

414
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,190
Go home early.

415
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,270
Bye.

416
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,670
Alright, hurry up.

417
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,100
Step up our efforts and we can go home early.

418
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,400
You don't seem to have any problem in terms of this question.

419
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,290
What about your homework?

420
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,290
I don't know my homework.

421
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,160
Then what are you gonna do?

422
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,070
How about

423
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,550
I help you with yours?

424
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,460
Never mind.

425
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,320
I think I can do this too.

426
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,840
How has your family been recently?

427
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,090
One word to conclude.

428
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,930
Calm.

429
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,530
That's good.

430
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,620
Actually, I'd rather my mom scold me.

431
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,980
Otherwise, I would feel weird.

432
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,070
Do you think

433
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,720
I have Stockholm syndrome?

434
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,870
No.

435
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,750
Maybe she realized your academic pressure,

436
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,270
so she wants you to relax.

437
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,610
I hope so.

438
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,020
Mom.

439
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,430
Nice to meet you, Auntie.

440
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,810
Is it you

441
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,500
who called us in the middle of the night?

442
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,270
-I... -Don't try to lie to me.

443
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,650
Look at this.

444
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,390
Auntie.

445
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,590
Why couldn't you call him openly?

446
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,170
Jiang Wenwen,

447
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,290
you even deleted all the call history.

448
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,060
What is the secret between you two?

449
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,430
Are you afraid I'll find out?

450
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,870
Mom,

451
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,140
what are you talking about?

452
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,000
What I am talking about?

453
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,330
I'm your mother. I have to look out for you!

454
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,480
Shi Wenke,

455
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,370
I know you have a good grade.

456
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,120
But Wenwen

457
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
is also good at studying.

458
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,580
She's going to be admitted to Project-985 universities.

459
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,310
Now is a critical moment for her.

460
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,170
When both of you get into college,

461
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,350
you can date whenever you want!

462
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,050
No one will interfere in you two!

463
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,440
Mom, what are you talking about?

464
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,680
Stop it.

465
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,940
Can you promise me?

466
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,620
Auntie,

467
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,260
can we talk somewhere else?

468
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,070
Right here.

469
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,510
-No. -Can you promise me?

470
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,390
Enough, Mom!

471
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,330
Because you always make a fuss

472
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,140
and are suspicious of me,

473
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,020
I deleted the call history.

474
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,670
Shi Wenke is my best friend.

475
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,590
When I have spare time,

476
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,110
what's wrong with me calling my best friend?

477
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,470
Also,

478
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,980
I'm not what you think I am.

479
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,500
I can't get into Project-985 universities! I'll never get into them!

480
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,550
Jiang Wenwen!

481
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,080
Jiang Wenwen!

482
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,190
Stop!

483
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,660
Jiang Wenwen!

484
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,880
Jiang Wenwen, from tomorrow on,

485
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,790
I'll take you to and from school!

486
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:00,900
Wei Xing,

487
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,050
what are you looking at?

488
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,690
Look.

489
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,150
It seems to sprout.

490
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,910
I don't know if it can blossom

491
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,850
when we take the national college entrance exam.

492
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,460
We can come to see it together when it blossoms.

493
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,900
Diqiu,

494
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,430
you must work hard.

495
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,560
As long as you work hard,

496
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,140
you will definitely be admitted to the university you like.

497
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,500
Don't worry. I did so well in the first mock exam.

498
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,210
I'm sure I can do well in this weekly exam as well.

499
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,050
Trust me.

500
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,970
I trust you.

501
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,550
The school is about to close.

502
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,750
All of you, leave now.

503
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,430
OK.

504
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,580
Sir, we're leaving.

505
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,840
Let's go home.

506
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,630
Was I drooling?

507
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,190
Its torrent dashes down three thousand feet from high;

508
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,070
As if the Saliva River fell from the azure sky.

509
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,070
You're dead! Don't go!

510
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,570
Stop!

511
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,190
Let's go.

512
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,120
Hurry up.

513
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,190
I envy Wenwen so much.

514
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,040
Her mom would take her to and from school every day.

515
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,630
We escort you every day.

516
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,200
What's there to be envious?

517
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,000
That's true.

518
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,170
Do you know how to solve all these questions?

519
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,090
Attention, everyone.

520
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,560
The exam results are out.

521
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,550
I'll explain it in the next class.

522
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,280
107 points.

523
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,480
Wang Diqiu, 90 points.

524
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,090
Wang Huanyu,

525
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,180
why did you only get 90 points?

526
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,580
You didn't pass the exam.

527
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,960
Didn't you get over 100 points during the first mock exam?

528
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,290
Such a huge difference.

529
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,400
Didn't you cheat on the exam?

530
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,970
It's impossible to cheat since the first mock exam is a unified exam at the municipal level.

531
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,420
It's understandable if one doesn't perform well once.

532
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,810
Diqiu can do better.

533
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,990
Wei Xing, why do you always speak up for Wang Huanyu?

534
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,830
Then what? I should speak up for you?

535
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,800
Han Shuai, you scored so high!

536
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,070
You even scored the last question.

537
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,110
Teach me about it.

538
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,610
Sure, no problem.

539
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,320
And me.

540
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,800
Vice Chairman,

541
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,860
there are two new boys in our class.

542
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,320
One has attracted the attention of Wei Xing,

543
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,000
while the other has attracted the rest of the girls in our class.

544
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,570
Can you do it or not?

545
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,610
Why can't I?

546
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,590
Guo Ting,

547
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,500
do you want to play a board game?

548
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
What board game?

549
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,610
It's very popular these days. We should play it with cards.

550
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,610
Let me show you.

551
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,330
There are loyal officials, lords, rebels, traitors,

552
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,160
and cards related to Thirty-Six Stratagems.

553
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,390
Why are these rules so complicated?

554
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,350
It gives me a headache.

555
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,580
I should go find Wang and Han Shuai.

556
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,360
Don't.

557
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,030
Sit down.

558
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,810
Why?

559
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,690
Class 1 looks down on Class 4.

560
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,420
You'll suffer if you go to them.

561
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,840
I just want to go to Wang and Han Shuai.

562
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,390
Their words won't have anything to do with me.

563
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:24,910
Forget it.

564
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,610
They won't even come back here.

565
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,470
Maybe they've become friends with those in Class 1.

566
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,820
Yi,

567
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,450
you've overthought it.

568
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,590
Do you want to play a board game?

569
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,110
You can bring it here

570
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,900
and use this formula.

571
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,260
Okay, I'll think about it when I get back.

572
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,640
Do you have a phone?

573
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,530
Yes.

574
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,840
Can you give me your phone number?

575
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,720
Okay.

576
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,220
Thank you.

577
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,590
♫The sigh of the wind♫

578
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,650
♫Gives rise to the ripples of my mind♫

579
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,000
♫Taking away the precious oxygen♫

580
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,410
♫In my indulgence and ruins♫

581
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,480
♫Maybe every distance♫

582
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,160
♫Has its reason♫

583
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,840
♫A sober person can't do things willfully♫

584
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,570
♫Parallel celestial bodies♫

585
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,890
♫Should acknowledge their parallel destinies♫

586
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:59,040
♫No matter how tide rips emotions♫

587
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,490
♫Everything will go back to the beginning♫

588
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,950
♫Maybe all illusions♫

589
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,810
♫Aren't necessary to be signed by me♫

590
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,810
♫They'll be buried in your heart silently♫

591
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,810
♫And listen♫

592
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,870
♫If I, a shooting star♫

593

♫Spend all the courage to get close to you♫

594
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,640
♫We'll be apart when we meet♫

595
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,400
♫I dare not to cross the Roche limit♫

596
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,970
♫Or be dominated by my curiosity♫

597
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,730
♫So don't blame anyone for running away♫

598
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,820
♫The process is far more complicated♫

599
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,910

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,700
♫I will protect you silently♫

603
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,360
Ting,

604
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,560
here, eat more.

605
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,150
Here, have some vegetables.

606
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,890
Okay.

607
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,650
Diqiu.

608
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,870
Thank you, Dad.

609
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,570
-Son. -Okay.

610
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,230
Here, have some vegetables.

611
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,950
Mom. Mom. Mom.

612
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,870
I'm a big eater, but I'm not a pig.

613
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,670
Studying has consumed a lot of your energy.

614
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,920
Eat more to get more energy.

615
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,270
By the way,

616
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,090
I've prepared specially made pig brain soup

617
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,740
for you.

618
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,530
You can be more intelligent if you have some.

619
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,570
Here, this is for Ting.

620
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:18,610
Have a try.

621
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,550
Here, Son.

622
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,720
It's yours.

623
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,370
Try it.

624
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,960
Mom! Mom! Mom!

625
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,600
I think since it's such nutritious soup,

626
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,730
Ting should have it.

627
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,380
Both of you have to drink it.

628
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,960
Open your mouth.

629
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,300
Mom. Mom. Mom.

630
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,670
I...

631
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,970
Want to add something.

632
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,720
What do you want to add?

633
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,540
Do you want a slap?

634
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,370
I won't add anything.

635
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,830
Then open your mouth.

636
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,680
Open your mouth.

637
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,360
Is it that bad?

638
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,530
Xing.

639
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,670
Dad.

640
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,630
Take this.

641
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,060
It's convenient to contact us.

642
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,150
Beijing is cold and windy.

643
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,560
Take this.

644
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,220
It can warm your stomach and feet.

645
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,130
Thank you, Dad.

646
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,440
Coming!

647
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,690
Wei Xing.

648
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,120
Why did you pack so many clothes up?

649
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm going to Beijing tomorrow.

650
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,220
Beijing?

651
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,750
With whom? Why?

652
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,670
For how long? Where will you live?

653
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,510
When will you come back?

654
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,980
Why did this happen suddenly?

655
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,700
You asked me so many questions all at once.

656
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Which one should I answer first?

657
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,690
Ms. Lu

658
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,360
asked me to go find her friend

659
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,550
to practice my skills for some time,

660
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,010
until the art exam begins.

661
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,300
I'm not sure

662
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,880
when I'll come back.

663
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,030
You've never left us.

664
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,200
You've never gone to a place so far away.

665
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,290
Don't worry.

666
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,240
As long as I'm available,

667
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,090
I'll call you, okay?

668
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
Don't pull a long face!

669
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,930
I'm going to leave.

670
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,410
Don't you have any farewell gift for me?

671
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,210
Gift?

672
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,600
It was a joke. You really prepared one?

673
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,720
♫Your words are gentle♫

674
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,490
♫But powerful♫

675
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,610
♫That can transcend my life♫

676
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,190
♫Fearless of all adversities♫

677
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,310
♫Let's fly far away♫

678
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,600
♫In the name of love♫

679
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,660
♫You're a shooting star in the mortal world♫

680
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,120
♫You have a pair of gentle eyes that look into the crowd♫

681
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,950
♫Fly over♫

682
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,710
I've spent all the money my mom gave me in your yard.

683
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,840
