I...

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,510
I'm just reading "The Lost Tomb."

35
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,620
It's a very popular tomb robbering novel.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,840
It's quite intriguing in its depiction of artifacts and archaeology.

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,770
You must like it.

38
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,480
Could you tell me more about it?

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,880
What tomb did the main character explore?

40
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,190
The first tomb

41
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,300
is the Seven Star Tomb of the Duke Lu's Palace.

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,790
Is it about Lu Shang, the Duke of Zhou Dynasty?

43
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,760
How did you know?

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,990
I happened to have read about it before.

45
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,750
His tomb is actually located behind Dawanglou Village,

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,110
Chaihudian Town, Tengzhou City, Shandong Province.

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,350
The author probably drew inspiration from real historical figures,

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,110
which makes it quite interesting.

49
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,950
Yes.

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,080
I just wish I had superpowers

344
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,040
to kill all monsters.

345
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,680
You're so annoying.

346
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,490
Let Xinxin think for herself.

347
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,750
I've made it.

348
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,870
I want to always be with Mom and Dad.

349
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,830
Okay, then quickly blow out the candles.

350
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,110
Once you blow out the candles, your wish will definitely come true.

351
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,730
Here.

352
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,370
I am the Jade Rabbit from the Moon.

353
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,360
Today,

354
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,790
I'm going to eat all you little kids.

355
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,980
You Jade Rabbit!

356
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,110
Monkey King and Pig King.

357
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,760
Attack!

358
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,370
Spare my life!

359
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,720
You don't look like the Monkey King at all.

360
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,190
You are the White Bone Demon.

361
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,250
White Bone Demon doesn't look like this. And you don't look like the Pig King.

362
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,130
You're so thin.

363
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,440
Since when did the Monkey King have bangs?

364
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,640
What's wrong with having bangs?

365
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,110
All right.

366
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,600
Wish our Wei Xing a successful recovery.

367
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,160
Cheers!

368
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,510
Come on. Cheers.

369
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,150
Wait.

370
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,750
Thank you.

371
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,440
Since when did it become your Wei Xing?

372
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,900
It's just a matter of time.

373
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,960
Shut up.

374
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,940
The flu is over.

375
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,470
Don't be angry.

376
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,830
Don't talk to me. I'm annoyed.

377
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,290
Cheers.

378
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,400
You're so naughty.

379
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,800
Honey, let's cheers too.

380
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,480
Go away.

381
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,100
Who wants to drink with you. You're so naughty.

382
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,160
Huiqin,

383
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,410
I know I was wrong.

384
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,850
What are you doing? Let go.

385
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,670
You're so naughty.

386
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,910
The neighbors are seeing us.

387
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,990
So what if they see?

388
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,450
We are legally married.

389
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,810
You're not my mistress.

390
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,080
How dare you think about having a mistress?

391
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,650
You...

392
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,050
So naughty.

393
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,070
I was wrong.

394
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,600
Don't be so silly again.

395
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,390
Yes.

396
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,350
You're so annoying.

397
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,770
I'll be with you

398
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,000
forever.

399
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,920
With your lousy delivery project,

400
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,410
is there really someone investing?

401
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,140
What do you mean by lousy delivery?

402
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,830
I've told you countless times,

403
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,610
the future of the Chinese catering industry is promising.

404
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,560
Within ten years,

405
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,620
our company will definitely grow stronger and larger,

406
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,270
and we will definitely go public.

407
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,300
You're bragging.

408
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,750
Our small town can't contain you anymore.

409
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,790
Hurry up and go chase your big dreams.

410
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,840
Before I chase my big dreams, can you do me a favor?

411
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,260
Help me come up with

412
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,670
a down-to-earth name,

413
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,030
preferably something that

414
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,530
makes people hungry just by hearing it.

415
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,700
Have you eaten?

416
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,250
Good name.

417
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,110
Are you crazy?

418
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,680
Hurry up.

419
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,670
Do whatever you need to do.

420
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,430
Don't bother me.

421
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,900
Go.

422
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,390
Take your contract and go.

423
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,610
Have you eaten?

424
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,060
Have you eaten?

425
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,730
Aren't you leaving yet?

426
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,090
Go away.

427
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,580
Have you eaten?

428
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,370
Go.

429
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,150
What's going on?

430
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,910
Look what I wrote down?

431
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,810
Is he freaking mental?

432
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,850
I mean...

433
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,490
Dad,

434
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,480
the name you came up with is just...

435
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,660
It sounds so nice, doesn't it?

436
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,490
Your mom came up with it.

437
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,670
I just said it casually.

438
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,040
Who asked you to really register a name?

439
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,670
But it sounds nice,

440
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,280
doesn't it? Guo Ting.

441
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,240
Very good.

442
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,320
It rolls off the tongue.

443
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,680
See?

444
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,120
Good things are always appreciated by someone.

445
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,180
I just think this name is really good,

446
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,750
both down-to-earth and artistic.

447
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,510
Dad,

448
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,960
if Guo Ting supports it,

449
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,770
then there's definitely a problem with this name.

450
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,120
Boy, what kind of reasoning is that?

451
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,240
How can you say that?

452
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,950
How can you say that!

453
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,190
We're leaving first.

454
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,340
-Bye, Mom. -The kid.

455
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,740
Take care on the road.

456
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,940
Fighting for fun every day,

457
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,140
it's good to be young.

458
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,260
Do you think this name doesn't sound good?

459
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,030
Of course it's good since I came up with it.

460
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,200
Indeed.

461
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,140
Have you eaten?

462
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,810
Yes.

463
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,360
Look at you,

464
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,710
standing there like a fool.

465
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,790
Come and help.

466
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,380
I want to beat ten!

467
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,550
Yongchun.

468
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,320
Wang Huanyu.

469
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,830
Wang Huanyu.

470
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,080
Wang Huanyu!

471
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,020
You're sleeping soundly.

472
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,140
You're even laughing.

473
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,070
What's so funny?

474
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,710
I dreamt that I ranked second in the class

475
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,200
and in the top hundred of the grade.

476
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Look at your desk.

477
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,440
I ranked 12th in class and ranked 125th in grade.

478
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Isn't this a dream within a dream, Yang?

479
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,150
Mr. Yang, Diqiu probably hasn't realized it yet.

480
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,990
Sit down

481
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,910
to wake up.

482
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,470
Look.

483
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,980
His grades from last semester were so poor,

484
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,550
but after just a short winter vacation,

485
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,630
he has improved so much.

486
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,120
You guys should learn from him if you have nothing else to do.

487
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,050
Let's continue.

488
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,410
If you don't know how to solve a question, I can tell you.

489
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,610
Take a look.

490
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,840
The one sitting in front of you now is first in the class

491
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,330
and sixtieth in the grade.

492
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,140
Everyone, please check your papers yourselves first.

493
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,490
I've reminded you several times about some of these issues,

494
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,150
and yet mistakes still occur.

495
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,950
Also, about the last three big questions,

496
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,750
I've said it before, you can't lose points on them.

497
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,110
Come with me.

498
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,410
Did Ms. Chen go to talk to Jiang Wenwen?

499
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,760
Very likely.

500
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,060
This time, Wenwen only got tenth place.

501
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,160
That shouldn't be the case.

502
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,330
Normally, without Wei Xing participating in the first mock exam,

503
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,390
Jiang Wenwen could have gotten first or second place,

504
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,790
but unexpectedly, she got tenth.

505
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,190
Shi Wenke got first.

506
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,370
Wenwen,

507
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,000
how long have you been like this?

508
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,200
Occasionally.

509
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,200
I do this when I'm stressed out.

510
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,890
I have a bit mysophobia.

511
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,390
But your hands

512
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,150
are all red.

513
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,750
I'm fine.

514
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
I just need to apply more hand cream.

515
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,630
Wei Xing,

516
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,490
please don't tell anyone.

517
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,800
I don't want them to worry about me.

518
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,940
I'm hungry.

519
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
Me too.

520
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,610
What do you think my mom will cook for dinner tonight?

521
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,390
Braised Chihuahua.

522
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,190
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

523
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,460
Ting.

524
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,910
Wei Xing.

525
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,930
Wei Xing.

526
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,110
How did you tutor Wang Diqiu?

527
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,110
He ranked twelfth in the class.

528
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,670
Really?

529
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,510
What is this?

530
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,220
It's mutual achievement.

531
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,620
You don't even know, Yi is so jealous.

532
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,610
He's been hanging around Wang Diqiu,

533
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,870
asking for study tips.

534
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,080
How about you tutor me too?

535
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,090
I have better talent than him.

536
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,740
Next time, twelfth place may be mine.

537
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,540
Guo Ting,

538
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,130
please recognize yourself.

539
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,550
Even if the answers were given to you,

540
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,880
you might not copy them.

541
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,550
Say it again.

542
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,210
Ting.

543
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,240
Wei Xing,

544
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,320
I have something to do at home.

545
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm leaving first.

546
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,900
Bye.

547
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,480
What's wrong with Wenwen?

548
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,320
Wenwen didn't do well on this test.

549
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,520
What rank did she get?

550
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,440
Top ten in the grade.

551
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,990
She's not happy even though she got top ten?

552
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,050
If I were in the top ten,

553
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,470
I'd be smiling all the way.

554
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,970
Do you think Wenwen is like you,

555
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,410
having no requirements for yourself?

556
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,670
She has high standards for herself,

557
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,580
unlike you, who are easily satisfied.

558
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,390
Shi Wenke,

559
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,920
can you take Wenwen home?

560
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,870
I'm a bit worried about her.

561
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,360
Okay.

562
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,060
I'll go first.

563
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,200
-Dad. -You’re back. -Uncle.

564
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,680
Ms. Li.

565
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,290
the first mock exam results were out.

566
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,130
Go away.

567
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,770
Can't you see I'm busy?

568
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,720
Don't bother me.

569
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,920
Mom, my results were out.

570
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,630
Take a look.

571
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,650
I did really well.

572
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,080
It seems that you only got a few points everytime.

573
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,280
You think you can become the top scorer?

574
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,750
It's true that negative reinforcement isn't advisable.

575
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
You always underestimate your son.

576
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,800
If you do well in the exam,

577
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,030
I will

578
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,080
listen to you for everything in the future.

579
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,700
You said it.

580
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,730
How much is this?

581
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,530
How much is this?

582
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,630
How much is this?

583
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,730
You added a zero at the end.

584
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,190
Who are you trying to fool?

585
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,470
Ting.

586
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,310
Aunt,

587
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,560
my brother really ranked twelfth in the class this time.

588
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,360
Twelfth from the bottom?

589
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,760
No, twelfth from the top.

590
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,920
Really?

591
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,780
Yes.

592
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,230
My boy,

593
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,730
you finally have some achievement.

594
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,230
Ms. Li.

595
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,000
Calm down.

596
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
This will be the norm from now on.

597
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,290
You must reward us.

598
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,880
Steamed duck, steamed bear paw, steamed deer antler,

599
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,040
let's have them all.

600
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,120
Our Diqiu

601
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,430
-has achieved something. - Mom.

602
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,630
-Aunt. -Mom.

603
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,970
Your mom is rarely happy like this.

604
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,900
So, who's cooking dinner tonight?

605
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,780
Let's eat out.

606
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,670
Dad,

607
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,240
do you have money on you?

608
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,300
Let's wait until your mom gets back,

609
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,560
then we'll discuss it.

610
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,100
My boy.

611
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,120
Okay.

612
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,860
I got it, Ms. Chen.

613
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,920
Thank you. Okay.

614
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,550
Okay, bye.

615
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,550
I heard about

616
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,230
your first mock exam results

617
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
from Ms. Chen.

618
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,170
What's been going on with you lately?

619
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,680
Why have your grades dropped significantly?

620
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,610
Is there something going on at home

621
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,960
or do you feel overwhelmed by the pressure of senior year?

622
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,320
You absolutely cannot slack off during this time.
