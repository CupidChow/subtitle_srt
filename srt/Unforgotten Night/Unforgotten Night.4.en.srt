00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,480
What about your parents?

168
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,600
I have none.

169
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,420
I only have these people as you can see.

170
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,720
You're not going to introduce me to any of them?

171
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,830
Is this your room?

172
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,570
What about mine?

173
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,670
You...

174
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,270
Let go of me!

175
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
It's just a hug.

176
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,780
I'm sleepy.

177
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,260
I've been working for the whole day,

178
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,570
while also searching for you.

179
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,810
You should take a rest then. I'm also going to rest in my room.

180
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,530
This is your room.

181
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,710
I won't share a room with you! We're not even dating!

182
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,210
Well, do you want to?

183
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,260
What?

184
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,420
To be my lover.

185
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,820
But we don't love each other.

186
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,550
Even if you don't love me

187
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,220
that doesn't mean that I don't love you.

188
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm sleepy.

189
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,090
Let's continue our talk tomorrow.

190
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,530
Let me go then.

191
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,880
Can't I just hug you?

192
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,730
You're so cute.

193
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,090
Thank you for coming to stay with me.

194
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,580
Don't run away from me ever again.

195
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,830
I've slept so deeply.

196
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,800
Geez!

197
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,750
It's so annoying!

198
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,940
Danai.

199
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,470
Please take a seat.

200
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,660
What brings you here?

201
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,410
Nothing. I heard you're at the office, so I came here to pay you a visit.

202
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,310
By the way, did anyone make my beautiful sister upset?

203
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,860
You're frowning.

204
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,350
It's nothing.

205
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,900
It's just that my crush hasn't been picking up my calls for many days.

206
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,050
Who's the guy dumb enough not to pick up your calls?

207
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,980
He's probably insane.

208
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,550
Exactly! I'm pretty and dedicated.

209
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,360
Why doesn't Kamol pick up my...

210
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,940
I mean, why doesn't he pick up my calls?

211
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,170
Is it the same Kamol that I know?

212
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,220
I'm not sure.

213
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,200
But...

214
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,410
I don't think the world is that small.

215
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,660
Let's not talk about this anymore. I'm hungry now. Do you want to get something to eat?

216
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,470
That's too bad. If it's the same Kamol,

217
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,350
I'd want to ask if you could make an appointment with him for me.

218
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,370
Maybe he and I can collaborate on bidding for the casino project.

219
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,770
Danai, are you going to bid at the casino auction?

220
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,570
Yeah.

221
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,020
It's a very interesting project.

222
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,000
But the main issue is Kamol.

223
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:12,450
My informant told me that Kamol's company will also participate in this bidding,

224
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,070
and he even has reached an agreement with investors from South Korea.

225
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,900
If this rumor is true, it won't be easy for me to win the bid this time.

226
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,900
I don't think I can be of any help.

227
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,170
But...

228
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,670
I hope that it's just a rumor.

229
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,580
All right.

230
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,560
My friends just invited me to eat out.

231
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,120
Do you want to join us?

232
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,260
No, thanks.

233
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,470
I know that when you ladies say "Let's grab a meal," it's not just about eating.

234
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,960
After that, you also have to go shopping.

235
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,230
You better go now. Don't mind me.

236
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,630
Okay.

237
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,930
Alright. I'm off then.

238
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,760
Okay.

239
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,800
Hello, Minister.

240
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,300
It's me, Danai.

241
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,180
That's right. About the casino,

242
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm sure that the Korean investors will side with me.

243
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,510
Don't worry about it. I'm sure I can beat Kamol at the auction.

244
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,910
Thank you, sir.

245
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,140
Goodbye.

246
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,220
It seems like you have something to say.

247
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,800
Well.

248
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,280
You better dress up first.

249
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,150
Just say it.

250
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,410
I'm just curious.

251
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,740
Do you have to get a tattoo to become a mafia?

252
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,400
That's all?

253
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,550
I thought you wanted to take a shower with me again.

254
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,670
Don't try to change the topic.

255
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,530
I got this tattoo when I was 18 years old.

256
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,330
At the time, I wasn't involved in any business yet.

257
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,500
It's just my personal preference.

258
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay, it looks pretty.

259
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,170
By the way, do you like tigers?

260
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,440
Actually, I want to get a tattoo as well.

261
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,350
I have a pet tiger.

262
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:15,980
Huh?

263
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,940
I think it's better...

264
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,250
if you don't ruin your flawless skin

265
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,510
with sharp tattoo needles.

266
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,230
Did you say you have a big tiger as your pet?

267
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,260
[Unforgotten Night]

268
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,520
Would you like to watch me change?

269
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,370
No!

270
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,240
Who wants to watch you change clothes?

271
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:57,980
In that case,

272
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,770
wait for me to get changed.

273
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,570
And let's go downstairs together.

274
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,780
I'll introduce you to everyone.

275

[Unforgotten Night]

276
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,200
Kim.

277
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,780
My name is Nee. I'm the head of the housekeepers here. I'm happy to be at your service.

278
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,790
This is my grandson, Baiboon. He came to study in the city.

279
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,880
Hello, sir.

280
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,330
I'm Kom. I'm Mr. Kamol's assistant.

281
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm Krit.

282
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,270
I'm Lop.

283
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm Ruj.

284
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,610
The three of them are Mr. Kamol's assistants too.

285
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,640
Hello, guys.

286
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm Kunanon. You can call me Kim.

287
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,980
Okay, sir.

288
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,460
Nice to meet you all.

289
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,220
Now that I've introduced you to everyone,

290
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,420
do you feel more at ease?

291
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Why are you saying that out loud? I'm just being friendly here.

292
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,490
Listen up, everyone.

293
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,320
Kim is my lover.

294
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,480
I hope you all take care of him as much as you take care of me,

295
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,540
no,

296
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,990
take care of him even more than you take care of me.

297
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,150
Understand?

298
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,710
Understood.

299
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,470
Aunt Nee, please take care of him.

300
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,480
Kim can be a bit stubborn.

301
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,410
Sure, Mr. Kamol.

302
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,930
Who's stubborn? You're talking nonsense.

303
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,980
Aunt Nee, I'm a very well-behaved person.

304
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,740
Also, what he said about me being his lover is not true.

305
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,370
He's delusional.

306
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,290
Alright, Mr. Kim.

307
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,680
Whether it's almost lover or lover,

308
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,540
they are the same.

309
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,460
You're being stubborn again.

310
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,210
I'm not talking to you anymore.

311
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,720
Aunt Nee. Also... Baiboon, right?

312
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,930
Yes.

313
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,400
Let's go somewhere else.

314
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,680
I haven't had a good look at this house yet and I'd like to take a tour.

315
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,480
My grandmother has to prepare meals with others in the kitchen.

316
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,190
If you don't mind, Mr. Kim, I can show you around.

317
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,130
Mr. Kim? You can just call me by my name.

318
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,760
Alright. This way, then.

320
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,440
Follow Kim,

321
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,620
in case he wants something.

322
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,820
Yes, sir.

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,550
Ruj.

324
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,290
Yes, sir.

325
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,300
Did you investigate the matter that

326
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,460
I asked you to?

327
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,380
Yes, I did.

328
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:03,990
Even though Danai attempted to entice them, the investors remain firmly on our side.

329
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,410
Sir.

330
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,740
Should we try to contact investors from other countries?

331
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,140
There's an Australian investor who just contacted me.

332
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,040
I think Danai only focuses on Korean investors now.

333
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,270
Do you need me to investigate some background information about this Australian investor?

334
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,510
Okay.

335
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,150
I'll leave this to you.

336
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,580
But I have a meeting with Evan later.

337
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,690
If you have more information about Danai,

338
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,020
report to me immediately.

339
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,850
Yes, sir.

340
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,570
What are you looking at?

341
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,950
I noticed Lop has been following us just now.

342
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,990
Oh, I already told him to go do something else.

343
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,570
When you were running after Kom,

344
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,200
I told Lop to stop following us and find something else to do.

345
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,220
Does Lop follow your commands?

346
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,590
Of course.

347
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,270
Because I threatened him

348
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,250
that I would tell Mr. Kamol to fire him if he didn't leave us alone.

349
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,880
Huh?

350
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,860
That's how it is.

351
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,480
By the way, are you close to Kom?

352
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,540
Yes.

353
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,490
Kom is very kind.

354
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,730
Look!

355
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
He bought me a phone.

356
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,170
He does seem kind.

357
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,770
Mr. Kamol is also kind.

358
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,390
But I'm still afraid of him.

359
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,140
Actually, I'm afraid of him too.

360
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,910
You're afraid of him too? But you're his lover, aren't you?

361
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,220
I think he's scary sometimes,

362
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,030
but more often, just annoying.

363
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,930
Do you love Mr. Kamol?

364
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,470
Did I ask you a weird question?

365
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,660
You don't have to answer me.

366
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,530
It's not weird.

367
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,180
It's just...

368
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,300
I'm not sure how I feel right now.

369
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,960
But if I have to answer that question...

370
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,200
I guess it's a feeling of...

371
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,950
wanting to try to love someone.

372
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,050
Something like that.

373
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,300
Wanting to try to love someone?

374
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,890
Yeah.

375
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,410
What does that mean?

376
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,300
To be honest, I think every relationship is complicated.

377
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,990
You will understand more when you grow up.

378
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,610
Trust me. You'll understand it soon.

379
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,540
Okay.

380
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,590
Wanting to try to love someone?

381
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,570
Kim.

382
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,010
Why is he so angry?

383
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,000
Baiboon, you can go inside first.

384
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,900
Why are you yelling?

385
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,740
If you don't want me to yell at you,

386
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,720
you have to behave.

387
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
Since when did I misbehave? I was just talking to Baiboon.

388
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,810
Why did you threaten Lop like that?

389
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,430
I ordered him to take care of you.

390
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,170
You should just let him do his job.

391
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,910
Because it's annoying!

392
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,160
[Unforgotten Night]

393
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,030
I'm inside your house. I didn't even go anywhere.

394
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,130
It makes me feel uncomfortable to have someone following me around, do you understand?

395
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,800
If you want me to stay here, I have one request.

396
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,390
Don't tell anyone to follow me around when I'm here.

397
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,780
Why did you tell Lop to follow me? I really want to know.

398
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,490
Kim.

399
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,270
Open the door.

400
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,710
No.

401
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,650
If you don't,

402
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,430
I'll break down the door.

403
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,159
You said that I threatened your subordinate. But you're the one threatening me all this time.

404
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,690
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,170
I'm just worried about you.

406
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,719
Why are you worried? We're not dating or anything.

407
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,040
Because you won't date me.

408
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,480
So what? Are you going to force me?

409
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,180
If I'm your boyfriend, all I have to do is stay still to make you happy, right?

410
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,370
Actually, you should tell your subordinates that I'm staying here as a prisoner.

411
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,950
Because I can't go anywhere by myself in this house.

412
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,020
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,710
You can do whatever you want.

414
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,620
But I have one request.

415
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,470
If you want to go out, there must be someone else to accompany you.

416
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,650
That's all I ask.

417
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,020
Can you do that for me?

418
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:58,880
You promise?

419
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,430
Don't change your mind later.

420
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:15,830
Who's that?

421
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,840
It's me, Lop. The food is ready, sir.

422
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,530
I'll be right there.

423
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,810
Yes, sir.

424
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,360
I'm hungry.

425
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,660
Let's go eat.

426
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,010
Just keep trying to run away.

427
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,180
Baiboon.

428
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,260
Yes?

429
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,040
Let's eat together.

430
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,800
Kom, too. Let's eat together.

431
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,150
There's a lot of food on the table.

432
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,530
Kim's invitation is equivalent to my invitation.

433
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,440
Have a seat.

434
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,470
Yes, sir.

435
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,690
Any updates on Baiboon's school?

436
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,910
I have sorted that out already. Tomorrow is his first day of school.

437
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,010
Well, then.

438
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,390
You should drop him off at school tomorrow.

439
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,760
I can go by myself.

440
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,890
Let Kom drop you off.

441
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,430
Mr. Kamol, speak nicely. Baiboon is not your subordinate.

442
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,620
Use a nicer tone.

443
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,070
This is my usual tone.

444
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,610
What kind of usual is that?

445
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:19,850
Let's eat.

446
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,500
See you in ten minutes in the car.

447
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,310
Yes, sir.

448
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:56,930
Kom.

449
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,470
Yes?

450
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,290
Take Baiboon back for sleep.

451
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,150
Yes, sir.

452
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,910
Let's go back to your room.

453
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,990
Kom.

454
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,260
Why aren't you going upstairs to sleep?

455
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,470
Is your work done?

456
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,570
Are you waiting for me?

457
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,580
Nope, I was watching a movie.

458
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,620
You should go upstairs to sleep. I'll walk you there.

459
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,400
It's pretty late. Why are you dressed up? Where are you going?

460
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I have to go out and check on something. You should sleep first.

461
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,810
No need to wait for me.

462
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,560
Who said that I was waiting for you?

463
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,290
You don't have to walk me upstairs.

464
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,790
I'm going to bed now.

465
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,050
Are you trying to possess me by looking at me like that?

466
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,590
Can I hug you?

467
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,900
Can I?

468
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,350
If you want to hug me, just do it. Why do you keep asking?

469
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,420
Hey!

470
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,470
Because if  I don't ask, you'll get mad at me.

471
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,100
Why is it just me who wants to hug you?

472
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,770
What are you thinking about?

473
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,960
Nothing.

474
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,430
You should go to work now. You don't have to walk me upstairs.

475
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,790
But I want you to walk me to the car.

476
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,930
Can you walk me to the car?

477
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,890
Mr. Kamol, did you watch too many dramas?

478
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,670
I want you to walk with me.

479
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,040
Fine. Let go of me first. How am I supposed to walk if you hug me like this?

480
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,530
Actually,

481
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,750
I can carry you there.

482
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,350
Don't even think about it.

483
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,660
Let's just walk together.

484
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,450
Thank you.

485
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,520
Goodnight, Kom.

486
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,140
Goodnight.

487
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,020
My boss is not here. You can't go inside.

488
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,370
I don't believe you. Get out of the way!

489
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,040
Sorry, you can't go in there.

490
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,270
Ms. Cherry!

491
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,890
Mr. Kamol, where are you?

492
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't believe that you're not home.

493
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,040
Ms. Cherry, you can't barge into someone's house like this.

494
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,640
Mr. Kamol.

495
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,420
Where are you?

496
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,500
I'm sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Kim.

497
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,690
It's okay. And this lady is...

498
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,220
Who are you?

499
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,410
What's your relationship with Kamol?

500
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,130
I'm so dead.

501
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:56,710
Lop.

502
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,050
Who is this woman?

503
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,020
I should be the one asking that question.

504
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,300
Mr. Kim, this is Ms. Cherry. She is...

505
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,150
Mr. Kamol's colleague.

506
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,230
Ms. Cherry, this is Mr. Kim.

507
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,780
He's our new boss, also Mr. Kamol's lover.

508
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,600
[NEXT EPISODE]

509
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,250
My boss won't be happy to find out what you did.

510
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,350
Why did you do that? Why did you ask for trouble?

511
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,660
If you think I was asking for trouble, just kick me out of your house.

512
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,930
Who made my beautiful sister this upset?

513
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,440
Mr. Kamol brought some random man in to live with him.

514
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,330
It's time for me to introduce myself to your lover.

515
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:01,730
You...
