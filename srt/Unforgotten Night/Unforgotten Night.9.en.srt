Kamol!

10
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,690
This happened because of you, Mr. Kamol.

11
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,430
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,600
Why did he have to target me?

13
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,670
Because he knows

14
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,880
that you are my weakness.

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,539
How are you going to deal with those thugs?

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,450
I'll send them back to their boss.

17
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,160
That's for my brother and my nephew. They got hurt because of you!

18
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,530
But... I've never told Mr. Kamol about Day.

19
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,570
Kim!

20
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,350
Kim!

21
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,710
May. Jin.

22
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Both of you, stop. What are you guys doing?

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,170
Where have you been?

24
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,890
Oh.

25
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,079
I went to stay over at my friend's house.

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,890
There was a slight problem.

27
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,260
Kit and Lop.

28
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,570
You guys can wait at the reception area over there.

29
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,280
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,660
Let's go.

31
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,829
Let's talk inside.

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,800
I was worried that something might've happened to you.

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,350
But seeing your face today, I feel relieved now.

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,500
Why? What's with my face?

35
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,190
You look so lively. It's like there is something good happen to you.

36
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,090
That's right. You might not know this,

37
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,110
but you always looked sad before. Even your eyes looked sad too.

38
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,820
But you're not like that anymore.

39
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,130
When you're smiling, your eyes are smiling too.

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,970
People who are in love always look younger.

41
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,440
You actually look younger.

42
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,270
That's enough. Stop talking nonsense.

43
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,520
You guys should get back to work.

44
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,240
Alright.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,310
By the way, are you going to have lunch with us?

46
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,829
I'm not sure whether Mr. Kamol will take me to lunch somewhere else.

47
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,600
Aww.

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,150
Are you guys boyfriends now?

49
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,730
Stop teasing me and get back to work.

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,440
Fine. Let's go, Jin.

51
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,840
[Mr. Kamol]

52
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,330
Who's calling you now?

53
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,579
Get back to work now!

54
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,870
Is something wrong?

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,780
You don't have to wait for me.

56
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,710
You can go eat first.

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,150
Your work is not finished yet?

58
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,370
There's an accident at the warehouse.

59
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,080
Mr. Kamol!

60
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,720
It's nothing serious. I'm fine.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,280
They were removing the ceiling beam, and it fell down.

62
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,610
Only Kom and I got hurt.

63
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,600
You have to be more careful next time.

64
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,450
You're worried about me again.

65
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,430
I'm worried about both of you.

66
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,570
I'm hanging up now. I have to get back to work.

67
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,280
Thank you so much.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Alright.

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,340
Okay.

70
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,570
This is so satisfying!

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,310
I thought he was smart, but after all he's just a loser. Kamol.

72
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,300
What happened?

73
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,730
Get ready to be happy.

74
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,990
It's not official yet, but the inner circle of officials told me that

75
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,440
I would win the casino concession this time.

76
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,370
Really?

77
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,690
Yes!

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,120
That's because the minister trusts us more than anyone else.

79
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,450
Whether in terms of financial resources, status or other conditions,

80
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,880
we're the most suitable candidate.

81
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,990
Congratulations, Danai.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,700
Not just me. We should celebrate this together.

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
And don't forget.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,160
We should prepare to go make fun of him.

85
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,640
Kim.

86
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,740
Your boyfriend- ah! I mean, there's someone here to see you.

87
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,660
How did you get here so fast?

88
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,480
This is not fast. It's already evening.

89
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,960
But I haven't finished my work yet.

90
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,290
I'm not in a hurry.

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,420
I can wait.

92
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,840
I miss you.

93
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,620
Stop it.

94
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,720
Let me see your wound.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,900
Does it hurt a lot?

96
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,360
What did the doctor say?

97
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,350
My arm's not broken.

98
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,800
Good thing I used my arm to cover my head.

99
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,950
That's what the doctor said.

100
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,730
Why are you still joking around?

101
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,290
Let me see the prescribed medicine.

102
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,280
It's with Kom.

103
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,150
Did anyone else get hurt?

104
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,520
Only Kom and I got hurt.

105
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,460
If Baiboon knows, he will be upset.

106
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,409
You have to be more careful next time. Do you understand?

107
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
What are you looking at?

108
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,930
I've told you already.

109
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,430
I miss you.

110
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,549
Slow down.

111
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,789
Oh, Kim!

112
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,140
-Baiboon!
-Are you hurt?

113
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,770
Are you hurt?

114
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,200
My knee hurts.

115
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,050
I think I might have injured my knee.

116
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,130
Let me see.

117
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,240
I think we should go inside and get your wounds cleaned.

118
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,340
Let's go.

119
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,100
Okay.

120
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,920
Come on.

121
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,170
Please look after him.

122
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,890
Why did you suddenly want to ride a surfskate?

123
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,100
Everyone knows how to play it, so I want to try it too.

124
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,650
It's not a problem if you want to play.

125
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,170
But you have to promise me you'll wear protective gear next time.

126
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,550
Understand?

127
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,820
Okay.

128
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,600
Good.

129
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,730
How come you have time to play today? Don't you have any homework?

130
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,330
I finished it already.

131
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,920
His class finished early today.

132
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,820
But he didn't tell me.

133
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,640
He probably did all the homework while waiting for me.

134
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,880
I didn't want to bother you.

135
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,620
It's okay. You can call me next time then, alright?

136
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,980
Okay, Kim.

137
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,890
All done.

138
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,560
Do you want to play again? I can watch you while you play.

139
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,860
So Kom can take a rest.

140
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,400
He's injured and he needs more rest.

141
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,800
How did you get injured?

142
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,910
Baiboon doesn't know yet?

143
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,880
Then I think you two should talk first.

144
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,330
Baiboon, I guess you shouldn't continue playing.

145
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,900
I think I should go.

146
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
So, what happened to you?

147
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,200
There was an accident at the warehouse.

148
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,310
I'm not seriously injured. That's why I didn't tell you.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,750
Where did you get hurt? Do you want me to check it for you?

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,060
Is it at the back?

151
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,170
I'm sorry!

152
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,400
Your hurt your back, right? Let me see.

153
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,380
It's okay, Baiboon.

154
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,400
I went to see the doctor.

155
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,030
I'm fine.

156
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,220
Did you do something wrong?

157
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,930
I didn't know that Kom haven't told Baiboon about the accident yet.

158
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,730
And I mentioned it right in front of Baiboon.

159
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,620
So, you're running away from your mistake?

160
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,440
I guess.

161
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,570
They'll figure it out.

162
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,480
I'm going to the tiger cage.

163
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,970
Wanna join me?

164
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,500
Is this yours?

165
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,270
[Unforgotten Night]

166
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes, it's mine. I guess I dropped it.

167
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,130
I'll go get it fixed.

168
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720

Do you want to try going inside the cage?

I think I better not. It's so dangerous.

Why didn't you tell me that you were coming?

233

I texted you a long time ago.

But if you knew I was coming, I wouldn't have found out that you wanted to retire.

There might be some problems.

I know Danil won't let me live in peace if he knows I have a lover.

He will probably come after you.

00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,020
You should keep it. I'll give it to you.

336
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,790
Why are you giving me this? You should keep it.

337
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,240
I really want you to have this. I believe that if you carry it with you all the time, you will be safe.

338

I'm worried about you.

339
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,960
At least keep it so I will feel more relieved.

340
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,450
If you carry it with you, I'm sure you'll be safe and sound.

341
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,860
Well... I have to go now.

342

No.

I have something to talk to you about.

Please wait a minute.

355
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:12,140
I got a call. They told me that Danai might win the bid.

356
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,280
Because he made a good offer.

357
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,850
I'll look into it.

358
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,960
It's too late, Kamol. I've sent people there already.

359
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,420
The information I got about Danai's offer is that

360
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,510
he will give them 300 million baht a year for the investment and development.

361
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,420
I've sent them a new offer.

362
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,490
I'll give them 500 million baht a year.

363
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,150
Do you know where Danai will hold the auction?

364
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,340
AI Building.

365
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:46,510
Right. AI building is located at the center of the city. That building has the best location.

366
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,370
I will contact Mr. Karin about the location.

367
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,390
I hope that you won't fail this time.

368
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,670
I won't.

369

About your retirement, I'll think about it.

370

So, don't let me down this time.

I have something urgent to tell you.

375
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,400
If it's about Danai,

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,270
Yeah.

381
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I think it will be hard for you this time.

382
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:01,720
But I think these documents I've got for you might be helpful.

Everyone in this world has to face pain and disappointment.

The same goes for investment.

If you invest in something that doesn't make a profit,

390

you should invest in something else that is more profitable.
