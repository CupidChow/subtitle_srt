Aunt Nee, you're a part of Mr. Kamol's family.

If there's anything you want to eat, Mr. Kim,

I can prepare it for you. I have to prepare breakfast for Mr. Kamol anyway.

Can I cook for him next time?

You don't have to do that.

Okay.

Mr. Kamol chose the right person as his partner. You're so adorable, Mr. Kim.

Mr. Kim,

177

love is a beautiful thing. I don't think it's unusual.

Mr. Kamol is lucky to have you taking care of him.

Okay.

You seem unhappy.

Are you drunk?

If you're not drunk, how about having a drinking competition with me?

Are you trying to get me drunk?

Is it because you've fallen for me already?

That both of us like to use violence?

288

00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,280
And don't forget to tell the others about that.

334
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,040
Yes, sir. I'll make sure that no one makes a slip.

335
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,690
Why does it seem like you guys are not enjoying the view?

336
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,920
What are you guys talking about?

337
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,400
Nothing.

338
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,030
What's the matter?

339
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,450
I have something to ask.

340
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,940
If you're free,

341
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,070
I want to invite you to do something exciting.

342
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,400
Are you excited that you get to cook for everyone?

343
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,320
A little.

344
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,880
It's been a while since I've cooked.

345
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,200
Mr. Kamol, can you get me the basils?

346
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,150
I saw that Aunt Nee always prepares meals for us.

347
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,250
So I want her to take a real rest this time.

348
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,160
Kim.

349
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,930
Just a second.

350
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,040
Alright.

351
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,050
What's up?

352
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,100
I've decided.

353
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,280
Even if Evan isn't willing to let me retire, I'll quit anyway.

354
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,050
Mr. Kamol, if it's because of me...

355
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,010
-It's because of you. -You...

356
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
I don't want you to worry about me.

357
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,250
I know you need more time.

358
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,970
But for me,

359
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,810
my feelings for you is more than just liking you.

360
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,700
Thank you.

361
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,740
But...

362
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,100
what about your subordinates?

363
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,120
What are you going to do with them?

364
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,210
There are plenty of other works for them to do.

365
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,220
I just won't get involved in any shady businesses anymore.

366
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,400
Kim.

367
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,230
Yes?

368
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,260
I want to ask you something just to make sure.

369
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,320
Okay.

370
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,070
You don't have to tell me about your feelings.

371
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,980
But I just want to know if you have decided to move in with me.

372
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,550
Yes.

373
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,030
That's all you've got to say?

374
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Well, you asked me just one question.

375
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,850
I will give you the full answer then.

376
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,410
You're the one who makes me forget the pain of the past.

377
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,390
And it's you...

378
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,940
who makes my life full of unforgettable memories.

379
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,890
Are they good memories for you?

380
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,670
They're pretty good overall.

381
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,880
Actually, I've never told you about my love life before.

382
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,600
You...

383
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,140
You don't have to tell me.

384
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,210
There are only two of us here.

385
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,970
So let's just talk about us.

386
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,480
Come eat with us, Aunt Nee.

387
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,360
Please join us, Aunt Nee.

388
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,030
Let's start eating.

389
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,060
Kom.

390
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,030
Baiboon.

391
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,160
I...

392
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,240
I thought you were outside with Mr. Kim.

393
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,910
That's why I didn't wear anything.

394
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,070
Oh, I just got back.

395
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,630
What happened to your back?

396
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,740
It's swelling.

397
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,820
I think I might have gotten hurt from playing in the pool yesterday.

398
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,980
No, you're lying.

399
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,280
I saw you went outside last night.

400
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,160
You were wounded after that, right?

401
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,320
Is it because I'm younger than you?

402
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,610
That's why you've never told me anything even when something's wrong.

403
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,160
I'm worried about you, Kom.

404
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,120
I know that you're worried.

405
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,820
I'm sorry.

406
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,890
We're home.

407
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,800
My whole body is aching.

408
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,120
Are you tired?

409
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,540
Do you want to go upstairs and take a rest first?

410
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,870
I'm not tired, just sore.

411
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,100
But actually, going upstairs doesn't sound too bad.

412
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,980
Let's go then.

413
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,990
Hey! What are you doing?

414
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,160
Stay still. I will take you upstairs.

415
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,450
Let go of me.

416
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,830
Do you want me to help you recall your memory?

417
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,920
[NEXT EPISODE]

418
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,680
That depends on whether it arouses me or not.

419
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:19,340
Let's go.

420
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,080
Baiboon, look out!

421
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,090
Kim used to be Day's partner.

422
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,900
I guess you don't mind sharing the guy who used to be with your subordinate, right?
