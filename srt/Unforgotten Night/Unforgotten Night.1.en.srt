Hello, sir. Long time no see.

Hello. It's been a while. How have you been?

9
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,660
Good. How about you?

10
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,800
I heard that your business is doing well.

11

That's right. It is all thanks to you for helping me out, Mr. Kamol.

If you need any help, feel free to call me anytime.

Of course, I will definitely do that.

All right.

63
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,980
so he tried to escape and destroyed our properties.

64
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,410
But don't worry, sir. Our men already dealt with it.

I'll check it myself.

69

You go sort out the issues at the port.

Please allow me to report it to you.

73
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,530
At first, he didn't admit to his wrongdoings. So we had to use violence.

Are you going to tell me the truth?

168
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,380
Say it!

169
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,730
I feel so sorry for Kim. Why is he so sad and depressed?

170
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,320
I wonder too.

171
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,890
If he's a cartoon character,

172
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,890
there will be a gloomy vibe around him and a dark cloud over his head.

173
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,520
Should we...

174
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,610
Should we ask him to hang out with us tonight?

175
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,610
Maybe he will be a bit more relaxed.

176
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,530
That's a great idea.

177
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,810
No wonder you look so beautiful today.

178
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,150
I've prepared myself.

179
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
-You better be.
-I really am.

180
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,370
How do I look?

181
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,050
-Amazing.
-Not as amazing as you are.

182
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,170
When did you come here? You scared me.

183
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,790
You're going back home now?

184
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,690
I was going to invite you to come hang out with us. Are you free tonight?

185
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,710
That place is so good! The atmosphere is good. The drinks are good. Everything is good.

186
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,330
You won't feel bored.

187
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,410
That's right, Kim. You can trust her.

188
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,130
She likes to go to clubs and write reviews of each place.

189
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,680
Let's go out to empty your mind. Maybe you'll feel better.

190
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,030
Please.

191
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,460
Fine. Let's go.

192
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,170
You guys send me the location then.

193
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll drive and meet you there.

194
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,670
Great!

195
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,480
This is the gathering of hot guys and girls.

196
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,040
I'll post a lot of pictures and stories on my Instagram.

197
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,580
Please.

198
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,220
We're going to hang out, not to take pictures.

199
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,560
Don't let me catch you taking pictures, May.

200
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,050
Well, maybe I'll take a few pictures.

201
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,970
All right. Just a few.

202
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,110
See you later then, Kim.

203
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:36,960
Okay.

204
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,180
Jin ended up ditching us tonight.

205
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,510
You're not having fun? You're so quiet.

206
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,910
Exactly.

207
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,500
Let's take a picture together. I'll post it on my IG story to make Jin jealous.

208
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,530
Yes! Let's do it. Take a lot of pictures!

209
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,310
We look good.

210
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,660
I'm having fun just watching you guys.

211
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,170
If there's something wrong, you can tell us.

212
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,030
We can't do anything much, but we still want to help.

213
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,000
It seems like you're heartbroken.

214
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,060
Not really.

215
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,590
It was a one-sided love.

216
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,520
But it still hurts like being dumped.

217
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,680
A man like you having a one-sided love?

218
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,290
Oh my god.

219
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,780
I can't believe it.

220
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,670
One-sided love...

221
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,640
So does that mean he rejected you?

222
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,890
Yeah. Something like that.

223
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,920
Gosh.

224
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,810
Even someone like you got rejected.

225
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,810
If I'm single now, I will probably be alone for the rest of my life.

226
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,600
That's true.

227
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,250
Well, when it comes to love, if it's not meant to be, then it won't. It's not really about looks and such.

228
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,030
Can I ask you guys something?

229
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,300
How could I get over him?

230
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,760
I don't mean literally forgetting him.

231
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,250
But how can I go back to being casual with him like before?

232
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,890
I'd say, keep moving forward. Just try to move on.

233
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,020
Try to look at things from a broader perspective.

234
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
You may find that a lot of people are interested in you.

235
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,720
Well said. There's a saying that you don't need to seek love,

236
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,790
and it will come to you at the right time.

237
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,220
That's right.

238
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:05,150
But where is my love? I've been waiting for ages. I still have no one.

239
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,970
Be patient.

240
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,810
It will come.

241
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,620
It better be.

242
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,720
I feel much better now. Thanks to both of you.

243
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,780
You're welcome. Shall we drink?

244
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,220
Let's drink.

245
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,980
Bottoms up?

246
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,790
Drink it slowly.

247
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,610
How are you getting back home? Jane and I will be leaving soon.

248
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,550
Yeah. My boyfriend is waiting for me.

249
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,200
Oh, Jane, keep it low.

250
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,430
You guys can go first. I'll sit here for a while.

251
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,320
I'll see you at the office then.

252
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:47,980
Okay.

253
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,830
Let's go.

254
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,910
Get back home safely.

255
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,230
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Kin.

256
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,780
Bye.

257
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,390
Let's go.

258
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,820
What are you doing?

259
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
Stop fooling around.

260
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,500
♫Please let me love you once, let me see with my heart♫

261
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,980
[Unforgotten Night]

262
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,710
I've been waiting for you.

263
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,430
Are you tired?

264
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,820
What brings your here? Just say it.

265
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,880
What if it's not a business-related matter?

266
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,510
I just miss you.

267
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,620
Can't I come to see you because of that?

268
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,190
I don't have time for a guest who didn't make an appointment.

269
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,930
Kom, send off the guest.

270
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,050
Yes, sir.

271
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,910
Come on.

272
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,690
Why are you so hurry to chase me out?

273
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,300
I just want to please you.

274
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,300
If you have something to say, say it.

275
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,000
The upcoming casino concession.

276
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,930
Don't you want to know

277
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,010
who your competitors are?

278
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,290
I always let you do what you want.

279
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,460
But don't you dare cross the line.

280
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,450
I like it when you become fierce.

281
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,420
I like you so much.

282
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,000
So I'll let you in on a secret.

283
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,290
This cassino concession...

284
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,310
My dear.

285
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,350
Get yourself ready to compete with Danai.

286
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,210
So he finally dares to come out of his shell.

287
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,370
Good.

288
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,020
Do you need my help?

289
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,650
I need to use the bathroom.

290
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,990
Kom, send off the guest.

291
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,300
Yes, sir.

292
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,760
Are you looking at me?

293
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,570
Yes.

294
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,510
I'm looking at you.

295
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,810
Are you...

296
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,330
interested in me?

297
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,560
Yes.

298
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,810
I'm interested in you.

299
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,000
If so...

300
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Can you help me forget that man's hug?

301
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,980
As long as you can accept me.

302
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,380
I can.

303
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,310
You can do whatever you want to me.

304
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,230
Are you drunk?

305
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,520
I'm not.

306
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,660
I'm fully conscious.

307
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,060
If something happens,

308
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,020
are you sure

309
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,810
you won't regret it later?

310
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm sure.

311
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,520
Well then.

312
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,090
I'll make you forget his hug.

313
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,300
My boy.

314
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,780
I'll ask you one last time.

315
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,910
Are you drunk?

316
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,890
I'm not. I'm fully aware of everything.

317
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,560
If you're drunk,

318
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,280
I won't do it.

319
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,780
Can you hug me?

320
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,690
You really won't change your mind, huh?

321
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,730
No matter how violent I get,

322
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,659
you can take it, right?

323
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,480
Well, let's do something fun.

324
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,200
My boy.

325
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,110
Oh you...

326
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,800
What did you call me?

327
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,980
Master Kamol.

328
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,870
What did you call me?

329
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,110
Master Kamol.

330
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,080
You're the one I've been looking for.

331
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,950
It's not going to be our last night together.

332
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,550
