00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,420
You better keep in mind that Kamol belongs to me!

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,729
I shouldn't get you involved.

12
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,800
You're going out for work tonight?

13
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,830
I have to go to the pub.

14
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,840
Can I go with you?

15
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,050
The lady downstairs bought you a drink.

16
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,720
Don't tell me that you're mad at me because of this drink.

17
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,150
Why is he so sulky?

18
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,740
Will you stop being mad at me?

19
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,070
Kom.

20
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,490
Let's go home.

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,420

23
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,040
Get in the car!

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,420
What happened?

25
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,160
I think they just wanted to threaten us.

26
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,829
That's what I thought.

27
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,770
I think both of you should go inside first, let's wait and see.

28
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,390
Kim, let's go.

29
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,880
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,620
Where are you? Your house or condo?

31
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,650
I'm at Ko Tao with Itt and his nephew. What's the matter?

32
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,090
I have a favor to ask you.

33
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,800
I want Kim to stay with you for a while.

34
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,850
You want Kim to stay with me?

35
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,020
Yes.

36
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,690
It's for his safety.

37
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,760
What's wrong?

38
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,460
My boss wants Kim to stay with us.

39
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,100
I don't mind. It will be fun to hang out with more people.

40
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,170
Okay, Boss.

41
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,790
We don't mind.

42
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,040
Alright.

43
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,200
Take care of him for me.

44
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,050
Okay.

45
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,910
Are you really okay?

46
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,990
Yes, I'm okay.

47
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,840
Don't be stubborn, Kim.

48
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,840
It's you who should stop being stubborn!

49
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,320
You should listen to me too.

50
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,600
I can take care of myself.

51
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,330
This is not a joke, Kim.

52
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,740
Everything I do...

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,240
is for your safety.

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
How can staying with Day be safer for me?

55
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,350
What's the difference from staying with you?

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,220
If someone really wants to shoot me, they'll still find a way to do it.

57
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm gonna say this for the last time.

58
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,580
Go stay with Day.

59
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:44,830
No!

60
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,440
If you won't let me stay here,

61
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,490
even though there are many bodyguards to keep an eye on me,

62
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,900
I'll go back home.

63
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,940
Or I can go back to my condo.

64
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,420
You can't go back to those places.

65
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
You will put everyone around you in danger.

66
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,660
Trust me, Kim.

67
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,850
I just want you to be safe.

68
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,320
You forced me to come here when you wanted me.

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,610
And when you don't, you just toss me aside like this?

70
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,950
It's not like that, Kim!

71
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,470
I just don't want you to get involved in this situation.

72
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,110
It's too late, Mr. Kamol.

73
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,960
It's too late since the day I stepped inside this house.

74
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,430
Take care of Mr. Kim.

75
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,680
Who's that?

76
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,390
It's me, Lop.

77
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,720
My boss let me tell you that he won't come back home today.

78
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,630
He has errands to run.

79
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,420
Tell him that he can go wherever he wants.

80
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,400
Come on. This is the second time now.

81

I will go to Ko Tao. Are you satisfied now?

Give him your phone.

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,960
I can't. Mr. Kim has gone to his room.

Is he really mad at me?

133

Yes, he is.

Make sure he arrives there safe and sound.

Yes, sir.

Kim is really angry at me.

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,060
He doesn't want to come?

138
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,480
I guess so.

139
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,140
But he said he would go.

140
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,740
He'll leave tomorrow morning.

Yes, sir.

144
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,260
Your boss just called?

145
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,450
Yeah.

146
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,200
He said Kim is upset.

147
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,360
Maybe Kim doesn't want to come here.

148
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,780
I guess.

149
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,710
But he will come anyway.

150
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,830
He will come here tomorrow morning.

151
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,250
Maybe Kim thinks that he is bothering us.

152
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,410
Even if he comes here,

153
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,430
whether he might bother us or not,

154
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,440
it's not going to be a problem.

He won't.

160
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,980
The next time he wakes up will probably be in the morning.

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,550
Make sure he arrives safely. Boss insists.

168
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,550
Roger that, sir!

169
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,150
Kamol will kick you out someday.

170
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,200
That 'someday' that you mentioned means today, doesn't it?

171
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,710
I'll take you there.

172
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,720
No need, I can go by myself.

173
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,210
Hello, Kim.

174
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,060
Hello.

175
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,330
Salmon, say hi to uncle Kim.

176
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,710
Hello.

177
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,770
Day, I'm so sorry for disturbing your vacation.

178
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,300
It's not a problem.

179
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,040
That's right. It's more fun to hang out with a lot of people.

180
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,130
It's not that fun when there's just Salmon and I.

181
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,580
I'll take them to the beach. Do you want to join us?

182
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,980
You guys can go. I'll take a rest first.

183
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,160
You're really not coming?

184
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,790
We will go snorkeling.

185
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,300
We will go to see the coral reefs too!

186
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,440
I want to see Nemo.

187
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,040
I think we should let Kim rest.

188
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,700
You can play with him.

189
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,460
I'll play with you tomorrow.

190
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,970
The views here are very beautiful. Isn't that right, Salmon?

191
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,930
You already said that.

192
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,160
Well, it's really beautiful.

193
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,910
Kim, you can see the sea view from your room.

194
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,980
Salmon, you have to apply sunscreen first.

195
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,900
Sunscreen will protect me from sunburn.

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,970
My mom told me that sunburn would make my skin peel.

197
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,350
That's correct! So, you must apply sunscreen.

198
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,230
Okay.

199
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,140
Salmon is such a smart kid.

200
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,650
He's my nephew, that's why he's so smart.

201
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,700
You're nuts.

202
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,710
What does that mean, Uncle Day?

203
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,730
It means... Uncle Itt.

204
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,180
Let's go to the beach.

205
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,710
I'll deal with you later.

206
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,550
Lucky him that it makes you laugh, or I'll hit him.

207
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,650
Oh, right. Your room is upstairs on the left.

208
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,300
Thank you, Itt.

209
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,020
Kim, your smile could light up the whole world.

210
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,030
You should get some rest.

211
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,630
Day! Wait for me!

212
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,920
Come in.

213
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,240
Boss, Day called and said that Mr. Kim has arrived there safely.

214
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,870
Kim won't answer my calls.

215
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,390
Excuse me, sir.

216
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,410
The contract with Korean investors has been drawn up.

217
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,450
It is ready to be signed.

218
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,140
Do you want me to send it to Mr. Hyung-sik?

219
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,290
He told us to make an appointment.

220
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,000
Do it then.

221
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,580
Yes, sir.

222
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,830
Send someone to look after Kim.

223
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,750
Yes, sir.

224
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I've sent our people to patrol around the house already.

225
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,040
Good.

226
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,760
[Unforgotten Night]

227
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll wake him up to take a shower, you can shower in your room first.

228
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,100
Kim.

229
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,200
Oh, Itt.

230
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,970
Wait for me to take a shower first, then we'll go eat.

231
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay.

232
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,520
Day looks like he'll make a good dad.

233
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,770
He looks cool.

234
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,960
He takes really good care of my nephew. Salmon prefers Day more than me now.

235
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,570
You should have came snorkeling with us.

236
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,960
It was really fun! We saw clownfish too.

237
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,350
I feel bad that I didn't go too. I won't miss it tomorrow.

238
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,100
Go take a shower now, Itt.

239
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,820
You will get sick if you keep talking.

240
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,200
Alright!

241
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,610
Go.

242
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,920
Go take a shower.

243
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,220
You will get sick if you keep talking.

244
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,490
It would be nice if Kamol and I were like them.

245
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,970
But that will never happen.

246
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,080
Salmon, your mouth is messy now.

247
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,380
Come here. I'll wipe it out for you.

248
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,780
Come on.

249
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,430
Oh, you're so messy!

250
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,150
Eat slowly.

251
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,660
Okay.

252
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,780
Done! You can go back to your seat.

253
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,610
You guys are like family.

254
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,770
How could we be a family? I'm a man.

255
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,090
So? You are Day's boyfriend.

256
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,180
But, Kim...

257
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,150
Hey! What's wrong?

258
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,060
I like the familial moments between you guys. It's cute and lovely.

259
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,510
Itt.

260
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,070
Are you overthinking about Kim and I again?

261
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,790
Itt, don't worry about it.

262
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,560
What happened between us ended a long time ago.

263
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,460
Right now, Day is just one of my best friends.

264
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,810
Well... I...

265
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,320
I'm not overthinking about you and Day.

266
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,950
You misunderstood.

267
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,890
I'm just wondering if you're his boss's boyfriend.

268
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,590
No, I'm not.

269
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,490
What are you talking about? Look at Kim's face.

270
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,760
What! I'm just curious.

271
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,960
He's sad now.

272
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,110
I'm sorry for ruining the mood.

273
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,010
It's okay. I just don't want you to worry about Day and I.

274
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,400
I won't mind that anymore. You don't have to worry.

275
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,470
Let's eat.

276
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,790
This grilled prawn is very yummy, isn't it?

277
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,710
It is! It's so yummy because Uncle Day peeled it for me.

278
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,120
Yes, sir.

279
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,460
Day, are you with Kim right now?

280
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,790
Yes.

281
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,540
He's with me now.

282
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,350
Why is he not picking up the phone?

283
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,670
I've been calling him since noon.

284
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,180
You should punish him.

285
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,660
I'll ask him for you.

286
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,670
Kim, why aren't you answering Boss's phone?

287
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,770
My boss has been calling you since noon.

288
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,410
I didn't hear the phone ring.

289
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,350
I also don't have my phone with me now.

290
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,310
Let me talk to him.

291
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,090
Yes, sir.

292
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,750
Kim, Boss wants to talk to you.

293
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,570
No, I don't want to talk to him.

294
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,790
I have nothing to say to him.

295
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,950
You heard what he said, right?

296
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,370
Day, let me talk to him.

297
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,530
Kim misunderstood me.

298
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,550
It's up to you. I don't want to force you.

299
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,460
Hello?

300
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,810
You're ignoring my calls on purpose, aren't you?

301
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,070
You already know, so why are you still calling me?

302
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,470
It's not like you care about me anyway.

303
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,710
Are you mad at me?

304
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm not!

305
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,390
You don't have to take me back when everything's done.

306
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,950
I will go back to my house.

307
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,890
Do you think I will let you go so easily?

308
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,270
Don't be mad at me now. I don't have time to make it up to you yet.

309
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,550
Then don't! I don't want to see your face anyway! You jerk!

310
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,960
Uncle Kim, you're not going to eat?

311
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,190
He just finished a phone call.

312
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,230
Which one is good?

313
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,110
Can you recommend me?

314
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,170
The prawn!

315
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,570
Uncle Day can peel it for you. It's very yummy!

316
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,140
By the way, where are you guys going tomorrow?

317
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,380
Oh, we're probably going to the beach.

318
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,680
Should I go to the beach with you tomorrow?

319
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,220
Yes!

320
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,960
Is it because of my boss?

321
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,400
What?

322
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,390
Is it because of him that you're like this?

323
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,890
You seem irritated.

324
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,740
It's not because of him!

325
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:44,410
♫I don't know if you're going to believe it or not♫

326
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:51,700
♫I just realized what love is the day I met you♫

327
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,250
You don't have to care so much about me, Mr. Kamol.

328
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:01,400
♫The first time our eyes met, when we're only a breath apart♫

329
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,920
I don't want to fall deeper than I already have.

330
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,360
Kim, have you gone to bed yet?

331
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,020
Not yet. The door is not locked. You can come in.

332
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,480
If you're not sleepy yet, do you want to watch a movie with me?

333
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,070
Sure. I'm not sleepy yet.

334
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,460
Great! I thought I had to watch it alone.

335
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,850
Where is Day?

336
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,620
Day has gone to bed with Salmon already.

337
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,260
I don't want to bother him. He's probably tired after a long day.

338
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,810
Can I ask you something?

339
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,680
What do you like about Day?

340
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,880
Why are you asking me this?

341
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,710
Are you shy?

342
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,470
You don't have to tell me if you're too shy to say it.

343
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,060
No, I don't mind telling you.

344
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,410
If you ask me what I like about him,

345
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,790
maybe...

346
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,470
because Day is Day.

347
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,320
He loves me for who I am.

348
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,130
He makes me a better person.

[Unforgotten Night]

350
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,970
What about you?

351
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,770
Have you started to like Kamol yet?

352
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,760
Let's just forget about my problem.

353
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,230
You can go first. I'll meet you later.

354
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,040
Okay.

355
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,940
Yes?

356
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,640
Take a seat.

[Unforgotten Night]

358
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,940
Sit on a chair.

359
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,720
If you sit on the floor like that,

360
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,360
Kim will scold me if he knows.

361
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,530
Fine.

362
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,969
You have your phone with you, right?

363
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,710
Yes.

364
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,389
Call Kim for me.

365
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,530
And talk to him.

366
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,610
I don't want him to feel lonely.

367
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,860
You want me to call and talk to Kim?

368
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,800
Yes.

369
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,389
Kim is still angry at me.

370
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,260
He won't answer my calls.

371
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,659
He will pick up the phone if it's you.

372
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,440
Alright.

[Baiboon]

374

Turn on the speakerphone.

Yes, sir.

376
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,770
Hello, Baiboon.

377
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,250
Hello.

378
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,770
Well...

379
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,180
Are you going to bed yet?

380
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,530
Not yet. I was about to watch a movie.

381
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,190
Why are you calling me for?

382
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,060
Why are you not going to bed yet?

383
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,220
I'm going to bed soon.

384
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,770
Ask him if he's still mad at me or not.

385
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,390
Um...

386
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,270
Kim, are you still mad at Mr. Kamol?

387
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,020
Why did you suddenly ask me that?

388
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,520
Um... well...

389
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,480
Who told you to call me?

390
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,130
Is it Mr. Kamol?

391
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,100
Well...

392
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,370
Baiboon!

393
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,270
You're on his side now?

394
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,550
Kim, don't be mad at me!

395
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:13,570
Mr. Kamol told me that you're very angry at him.

396
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,570
That's why he wanted me to call you.

397
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,230
Mr. Kamol is sitting next to you, right?

398
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,270
He also told you to turn on the speakerphone, didn't he?

399
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,920
Yes...

400
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,240
Mr. Kamol! Why are you always getting on my nerves?

401
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,470
Why do you have to bother Baiboon?

402
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,040
He has to go to school tomorrow!

403
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,650
Stop being so childish!

404
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,120
Then pick up my calls.

405
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,190
No.

406
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,170
If you want to talk to me, you have to do it in person.

407
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,470
I won't talk to you on the phone.

408
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,300
Baiboon, I won't help you if you're late for school tomorrow.

409
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,650
Oh, okay.

410
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,110
Kim is smart.

411
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,410
Don't you think so?

412
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,750
Yes.

413
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,280
I have the motivation to work now after hearing his voice.

414
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,350
He cares about you, Baiboon.

415
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,470
You can go to bed now.

416
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,050
Okay.

417
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,480
He will talk to me only in person huh.

418
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,660
Baiboon, why aren't you asleep yet?

419
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,460
Not yet.

420
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,560
Is there anything?

421
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,460
I'm just curious.

422
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,340
Curious about what?

423
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,530
About Mr. Kamol and Kim.

424
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,490
Can I ask you something?

425
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,240
Sure, if I know the answer.

426
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,970
Mr. Kamol seems to love Kim so much.

427
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,370
He really cares about Kim.

428
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,660
He knows that Kim is angry at him, but why won't he go see him?

429
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,530
Sometimes, we can't do everything the way we want.

430
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,470
I understand.

431
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,690
We don't always get what we want.

432
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,390
No matter how much we desire it.

433
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,060
You should go to bed.

434
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,390
Kom, are you tired?

435
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,570
You should get some rest too.

436
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,620
I'm fine.

437
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,850
You should be worried about yourself.

438
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,870
You have to focus on your studies,

439
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,870
and help your grandmother.

440
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,390
It's a lot of responsibility for a kid your age

441
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,190
I'm not like the other kids.

442
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,170
Those responsibilities are not a burden to me.

443
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,530
It can't be compared to what Mr. Kamol and Kim have done for me.

444
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:03,810
You did well.

445
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,060
I hope you'll always be a good boy.

446
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,360
I'm looking forward to seeing you grow and flourish.

447
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,070
I want to thank you as well

448
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,760
for teaching me a lot.

449
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,720
Glad to hear that.

450
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,070
Go to sleep now.

451
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,530
Okay.

452
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,470
Thanks.

453
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,740
Do you want some coffee?

454
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,360
You didn't sleep well last night?

455
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,220
Yeah. I couldn't stop thinking about the movie, so I had trouble falling asleep.

456
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,110
Wasn't it because of my boss?

457
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,840
How could it be about your boss, Day?

458
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,280
Thank you.

459
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,900
Kim, is something wrong?

460
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,640
You can tell me.

461
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,030
I'm fine.

462
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,550
Itt, have a seat.

463
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,700
I'll take you to the beach when Salmon wakes up.

464
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,710
Uncle Kim!

465
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,800
Let's play!

466
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:36,980
Let's go.

467
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:37,890

Come on.

469
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,630
Let's go.

470
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Come with us.

471
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,660
Alright.

472
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,740
Uncle Day, do you want to come with us?

473
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,120
Let's go!

474
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,480
Coming!

475
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Ouch! It stings!

476
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,150
I've told you to avoid running in the sun.

477
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,080
-It hurts.
-Both of you are so naughty.

478
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,810
What's wrong with Salmon?

479
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,090
His back hurts from sunburn.

480
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,700
Ouch! It stings!

481
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,480
I've applied moisturizer for him. I think it might help.

482
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,320
You better use aloe vera gels, or else it won't get any better.

483
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,800
We don't have it.

484
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,570
Day, look after him for me. I'll go buy it.

485
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,460
I'll go.

486
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,060
But...

487
00:43:59,110 --> 00:43:59,830
I'll be back soon.

488
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,770
If someone knocks on the door, don't open it.

489
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,220
Take care of him.

490
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,570
It hurts.

491
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,060
It's so painful, isn't it?

492
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,290
Itt, I think you should apply a cool, wet cloth on his skin to relieve the pain.

493
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,440
How do you feel now?

494
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,710
You were just running around and flexing your muscles in front of me this afternoon.

495
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,700
Uncle Kim, it's so painful right now.

496
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,660
It will get better soon.

497
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,270
Who's there?

498
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,020
It hurts.

499
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,700
Itt, you look after Salmon. I'll get the door.

500
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,690
Alright.

501
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,100
I'm here to get the dishes.

502
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:02,470
Does it hurt?

503
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,350
He's here to get the dishes.

504
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, you can let him in.

505
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,310
Please come in.

506
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,170
Itt! Salmon! Watch out!

507
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,970
Come here!

508
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:17,590
Let me go!

509
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,100
Let go of him!

510
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,780
Let go!

511
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,250
Itt!

512
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:37,980

513
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:39,040
That's for my brother and my nephew. They got hurt because of you!

514
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,740
I haven't told Mr. Kamol about Day.

515
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,970
Do you know who Cherry is?

516
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,640
What's wrong, Baiboon?

517
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,060
She came to our house last night.

518
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:52,300
Who is she?
