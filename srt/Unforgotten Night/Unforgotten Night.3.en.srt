You have people following you around and calling you "boss".

Kom.

165
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,730
Send someone to check on Danai.

166
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,370
Find out if he has contacted any of our partners.

167
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,720
Yes, sir.

168
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,650

169
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,930
Yes, sir.

170
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,000
Tell Lop to call someone at Kim's office.

171
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,770
and let them know that Kim will arrive home safely.

172
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:19,830
Yes, sir.

173
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,740
Why do I like you so much?

174
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,170
What time is it now?

175
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,300
It's 11 p.m.

176
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,390
11 p.m.? Why didn't you wake me up?

177
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,579
My phone is dead.

178
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,420
May must be worried about me now.

179
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,700
Don't worry. I already told her.

180
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,940
Also,

181
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,200
I didn't want to wake you up because you were sleeping so soundly.

182
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,870
You called May?

183
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,740
Wouldn't that make her question the fact that I...

184
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,850
That you're here with me?

185
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,990
I told my subordinate to call her

186
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,180
and tell her you're safe home.

187
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,660
Don't worry.

188
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,130
You can trust me.

189
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,180
I'll go back now.

190
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,160
Okay.

191
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,170
I'll send you back home if you want to.

192
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,870
Get up, then.

193
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,990
What do I have to do

194
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,990
if I want to see you every day?

195
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,330
Move in with me.

196
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,340
I'll give you the same answer, which is no.

197
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,890
I'm not rushing you.

198
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,910
I'll give you a couple of days to think about it.

199
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,500
Once you decide it,

200
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,370
I'll go pick you up myself.

201
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,620
I want you to come and live with me.

202
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,810
Okay?

203
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,820
If that's the case,

204
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,390
I can go back home by myself.

205
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,110
I hope we'll never meet again.

206

Kim.

207
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,130
I've told you

208
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,550
that I want to get to know you.

209
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,430

210
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,300
Yes, sir.

211
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,950
Give me the car keys and get the car ready.

212
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,330
Yes, sir.

213
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Let me wash my face first, and we'll go back together.

[Unforgotten Night]

216
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,080
Kim, have a good rest.

217
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Thank you for dropping me off. You can leave now.

218
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,040
Do you know that you look like a cat trying to threaten me?

219
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,930
I'm human.

220
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:00,910
Okay.

221
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,250
I'll leave then.

222
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,380
I hope that you'll reconsider what I said.

223
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,950
Just leave. I want to sleep now.

224
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,570
Hello, May.

225
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,110
Hello, Kim. Are you all right? They didn't try to kill you, right? You're safe, right?

226
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,220
Sorry for making you worried. I'm back at my condo now.

227
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,060
That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

228
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,620
I don't want to say this, but his subordinates are so rude.

229
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,730
I'm fine. Thank you for worrying about me. You should get some rest.

230
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,820
Okay. It's good to hear that you're okay. Get some rest. I'll see you at the office.

231
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,680
Okay, see you later.

232
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
It's all because of you, Mr. Kamol.

233
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,590
I haven't thought about Day at all today.

234
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,740
You can really make me forget him.

235
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,560
Mr. Kamol.

236
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,830
Hello, Ms. Cherry.

237
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,610
I want the full treatment today since I'm going to meet my special someone.

238
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Of course. Please wait.

239

Here you go.

240
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:17,970
Thank you.

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,690
Have a seat.

243
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,410
Alright.

244
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,950
Well... I need some advice.

245
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,100
It's about my friend.

246
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,030
Sure.

247
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,280
My friend told me that...

248
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,430
someone asked him to live together.

249
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,230
Like, they had a one-night stand.

250
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,160
But then that person suddenly asked my friend to move in with him.

251
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,180
Do you think I...

252
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,310
What do you think I should tell my friend?

253
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:14,900
I think it's too fast. Your friend don't know his personality and how he lives his life.

254
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,380
It's not like living in his house for free, right?

255
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,470
You're right.

256
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
But I think you can tell him that

257
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,900
it's better to get to know each other more before moving in together.

258
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,920
There are a lot of men in black suits in front of our office. What should we do?

259
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,960
What's going on?

260
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,240
Hello, Kim. We're sorry for disturbing you.

261
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,240
We're here for your safety.

262
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,320
That's right. Don't mind us. You can live you life as usual.

263
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,960
How can you call this "usual"?

264
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,940
Are you calling me because you miss you too much?

265
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,530
Stop it.

266
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,110
Tell your subordinates to leave and give me back my normal life!

267
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,890
He's quite stubborn.

268
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,510
Sir.

269
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,320
We can identify those who committed the arson now.

270
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,440
We've found out that these two were sent by Danai.

271
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,870
As I expected.

272
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,590
Get ready.

273
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,100
Since he wants to play with us,

274
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,390
show him that we are not the ones he should be messing with.

275
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,080
Yes, sir.

276
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,180
Kamol is here, right?

277
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,020
He's not available for guests at the moment. Please go back, Ms. Cherry.

278
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,300
I'm not a guest.

279

Kamol, look at Kom. He won't let me go in to see you.

280
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,180
I'm getting angry now?

281
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,540
Why are you here?

282
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,850
I'm here to invite you to dinner. Shall we go together?

283
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,990
I'm not free.

284
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,140
Please excuse me.

285
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,090
You've changed.

286
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,130
You're not like this before.

287
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,440
You used to be kind.

288
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm not a kind person.

289
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,910
If you were not kind, you wouldn't have saved me on the first day we met.

290
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,300
You would've let me get hit by the car.

291
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,450
If that wasn't an act of kindness, then what was it?

292
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,040
If I've done something to make you misunderstand my intention,

293
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,010
I'm sorry about that.

Should I call Day?

328
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,640
Hello, Day. Are you free? Can I talk to you?

329
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,690
Sure. What's wrong?

330
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,400
Where are you? Can I come to see you?

331
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,630
I'm out of town right now. Is there anything?

332
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,570
It's nothing.

333
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,150
I can wait until you come back.

334
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,220
Wait until I go back to Bangkok then. I'll call you.

335
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,430
Hey, Itt. Why don't you dry hair after getting in the water? You'll get sick.

336
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,300
I know. My towel is with you.

337
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,530
I gotta go. I have to deal with something.

Come here. I'll dry it for you.

340
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,160
Why don't you dry your hair?

341
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,400
Did I make the right decision to call Day?

342
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,910
I'll find out if I can forget about him yet or not.

343
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,100
What's going on?

344
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,800
Are we going to die?

345
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
I have no idea.

346
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,200

He dares to do this to me?

353
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,500
Everyone in Danai's company is scared now.

354
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,900
A rabid dog like him

355
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,190
should be scared too.

356
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:46,429
Also, those people who spied on us have disappeared.

357
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,310
Good.

358
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,690
Now they'll know that they shouldn't mess with me.

You're all useless!

361
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,230
How could you let him do this?

362
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,810
Maybe it's not Kamol's doing this time. Mr. Danai.

363
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,820
Are you serious?

If it's not him, then who?

Dumbass!

366
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,950
Listen to me. From now on, keep an eye on him.

367
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,170
He will try to get back at us again.

How's Kim?

370
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,230
He goes to work as usual.

371
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,270
He loses his temper because of Lop sometimes.

372
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,560
Nothing's changed. Everything is as usual.

373
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,700
Does he think that he can continue to not pick up my calls?

374
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,950
Hello.

I'll pick you up this evening.

He's so stubborn, just the way I like.

Our guy is still keeping an eye on Kim, right?

384
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,330
Yes, sir. Lop's team is still watching him.

Can I come over to your house and talk to you?

Can I tell you in person?
