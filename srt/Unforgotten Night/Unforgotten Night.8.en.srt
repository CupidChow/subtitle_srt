You forced me to come here when you wanted me.

Itt,

13
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,930

I'm just wondering if you're his boss's boyfriend.

Then pick up my calls.

17

If you want to talk to me, you have to do it in person.

You will talk to me only in person, huh?

Ouch! It hurts.

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,900
Itt, I think you should apply a cool, wet cloth on his back to relieve the pain.

25

You were just running around and flexing your muscles in front of me this afternoon.

26
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,390
It hurts, uncle Kim!

27

29
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,570
It hurts.

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,329
Itt, you can look after Salmon. I'll get the door.

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,370
OK.

32

I'm here to get the dishes.

33
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,130

34
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,030
He's here to get the dishes.

Are you alright?

46
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm fine.

47
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,620

Day, I'm sorry.

51

Itt and Salmon got hurt because of me.

52

It's okay, Kim.

It's good that you're safe.

54

Salmon, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,310
This happened because of you, Mr. Kamol.

56
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,230
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,360
If both of you need any help,

58
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,870
just let me know.

59
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,870
I don't ask for much,

60

as long as you don't take Day back to work for you.

61

No matter how much I want to,

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,450
he won't come back to work for me.

63
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,070
Salmon, come here.

64
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,720
Let me sit with you.

65
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,310
Who allowed you to sit?

66
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,290
You're still mad at me?

67
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,380
You kicked me out of the house.

68
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,530
You knew what would happen, but you still sent me here.

69
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,070
You've dragged Day and everyone else into this mess.

70
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,150
And you still have the nerves to ask me if I'm still mad at you?

71
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,730
I'm sorry, Kim.

72
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,550
I'm sorry for getting you into trouble and getting hurt.

73
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,290
It's my fault for being too reckless.

74
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,420
Then,

75
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,650
can you tell me what's going on?

76
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,670
Why did they hurt me and those around me?

77
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,430
I think I have the right to know.

78
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,480
What right?

79
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,330
You're right. What rights do I have?

80
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,400
I'm glad...

81
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,170
that you want to know more about me.

82
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,580
Kim, don't be mad at me.

83
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,280
You have the right to know everything about me.

84
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,580
If there's anything you want to know,

85
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,050
you can ask me.

86
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,180
Then can you tell me what's going on?

87
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,400
Can you explain it to me?

88
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,300
I'll start by telling you about myself then.

89
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,010
I'm running a lot of businesses right now.

90
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,230
I own five bars.

91
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,570
Two of them are casino bars.

92
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,790
I'm also involved in the arms trade.

93
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,770
However, all of my businesses

94
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,480
do not involve narcotics and human trafficking.

95
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,770
About what happened today,

96
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,179
it's likely linked to my latest business.

97
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,270
The casino concession.

98
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,970
As you know,

99
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,490
this kind of business comes with a lot of rivalries.

100
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,800
Many people hate me.

101
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,650
But the person who seems to hate me the most

102
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
is probably Danai.

103
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,480
I think you know who he is.

104
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,170
So that means Danai is behind what happened today?

105
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,790
I think so.

106
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,250
I've already told my subordinates to check on it.

107
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,400
Does it hurt now?

108
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,910
If it's actually Danai,

109
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,100
why did he have to target me?

110
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,670
Because he knows

111
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,660
that you are my weakness.

112
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,310
That's why I sent you here to stay with Day.

113
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,060
I didn't expect him...

114
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,910
to change his target on you.

115
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,320
When I knew that you might be in danger,

116
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,300
I came here as soon as possible.

117
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,220
I'm glad that you've asked to meet me here today.

118
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,320
What did you want to ask me about?

119
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,780
I want to know what Danai is planning to do.

120
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
How could you just frankly ask me that?

121
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,140
I can't tell you that...

122
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,170
because we're not together.

123
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,850
I won't waste my time then.

124
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,410
Because I think...

125
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,800
we can no longer be friends.

126
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,590
Hold on.

127
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,010
Danai is planning to capture Kim.

128
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,840
And he already found out that Kim is at Ko Tao.

129
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,640
Thanks.

130

By the way, please address Kim properly next time.

Why?

146

Will it be possible if I ask you not to kill them?

147

I can't promise you that.

The person you hurt...

I've never expected that a big shot like you would call me.

Actually, I didn't want to call you at all.

I don't want to go back yet.

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,730
A person like me never threatens people.

338
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,630
I've returned your subordinates back to you.

339
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,580
My job here is done.

340
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,830
But they might be missing some parts.

341
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,990
Since they laid a hand on my lover.

342
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,560
Wait!

343
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,210
Kim.

344
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,890
Get in the car.

345
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,980
I will, but after my business here is done.

346
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,540
Kim!

347
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,090
I didn't punch you because you captured me!

348
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,490
But that's for my brother and my nephew. They got hurt because of you!

349
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,710
Sorry man.

350
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,470
I couldn't stop him fast enough.

351
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,860
You dare

352
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,870
to do this to me?

353
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,970
You want some more?

354
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,840
If you dare!

355
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,370
Kim,

356
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:03,890
let's go.

357
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,550
Darn it!

358
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,940
You guys are useless!

359
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,140
Idiots.

360
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
Is there something wrong, Kim?

361
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,280
Well, I'm hungry. Can I use the kitchen?

362
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,340
You can call Aunt Nee to cook for you.

363
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,400
It's okay. It's already late.

364
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,070
I just want to make something simple.

365
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,070
Alright.

366
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,070
If you need anything else, you can call my subordinates.

367
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,050
Okay.

368
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,450
Do you want to eat too?

369
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,670
I can cook for you as well.

370
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,100
If you want to make it for me,

371
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,170
I will eat it too.

372
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,440
I'll let you know when it's done then.

373
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,180
Do you admit that you're starting to fall for me now?

374
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,930
Kim.

375
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,230
What's wrong?

376
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,380
Why are you guys not going to rest?

377
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,830
I'm here to report you about the concession.

378
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,140
Everything is done.

379
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,640
According to the information we've got, I'm sure we will this time.

380
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,530
Good.

381
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,600
How should I answer Ms. Cherry?

382
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,400
Tell her I'm busy. I've got a lot of work to do.

383
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,360
Just come up with something.

384
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,180
Yes, sir.

385
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,080
Hello.

386
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,820
He's busy.

387
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,830
You can't come here right now, Ms. Cherry.

388
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,740
Alright, Ms. Cherry.

389
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:00,960
Okay.

390
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,470
Ms. Cherry...

391
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,690
tell me what you've got to say.

392
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,770
I've told our workers to check the warehouse structure thoroughly before starting to fix it.

393
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,790
I can assure you that it won't happen again.

394
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:28,929
Good.

395
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,239
You should get some rest.

396
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,270
Yes, sir.

397
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,110
Anything else?

398
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,810
Well, you seem to be in a good mood these days.

399
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,130
Since I've started working for you, I've never seen you like this before.

400
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,889
[Unforgotten Night]

401
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,130
Why don't you try falling in love?

402
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,480
Love?

403
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,100
[Unforgotten Night]

404
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,600
Mr. Kamol! You startled me.

405
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,050
Why did you sneak up on me like that?

406
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,950
What are you doing?

407
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,270
Oh, I made fried squid.

408
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,930
Also, stir-fried shrimp and basil.

409
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,700
And this is seaweed soup.

410
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,170
Do you think you can eat them?

411
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,290
I can eat everything you make.

412
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,610
Mr. Kamol, stop getting in the way. I'm going to cook.

413
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,390
Is there anything I can help you with?

414
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,340
Do you know how to cook?

415
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,760
How can I not know that?

416
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,940
Then...

417
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,750
can you peel and devein the shrimp?

418
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,010
I don't like doing it since it makes my fingers hurt.

419
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,820
Thank you.

420
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,450
I can see that you're looking at me and smiling.

421
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,740
You're delusional. Who's smiling?

422
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,730
Is that your phone vibrating?

423
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,290
I'll check it later.

424
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,830
[See you]

425
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,110
See you.

426
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,370
You're here to get your laptop bag?

427
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,280
What's the matter?

428
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,280
Come here for a second.

429
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,510
What's wrong with you?

430
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,030
If I can finish my work early, I'll go see you in the afternoon.

431
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,310
Also, you have to pick up the phone every time I call.

432
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,220
If I don't pick up the phone, you'll call your subordinates to talk to me anyway.

433
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,740
Can I go now?

434
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,270
Baiboon will be late for school.

435
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,570
Wait.

436
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,740
What's the matter with you?

437
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:17,900
It's fine.

438
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:19,920
You may go.

439
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,000
What?

440
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,410
Thank you, Kim.

441
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,060
Lop will take you to work, right?

442
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:50,910
Yeah.

443
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,210
You should go to class now. It's past nine o'clock.

444
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,420
Okay. See you later, Kim.

445
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,770
See you.

446
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,260
What's wrong, Baiboon?

447
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,540
Kim, do you know who Cherry is?

448
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,880
I don't know her personally.

449
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,480
What's wrong? Why are you asking about her?

450
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,050
Actually, it's nothing.

451
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,790
I heard her talk to Kom.

452
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,220
It seemed like she came to our house last night.

453
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,440
Who is she?

454
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,780
She is Mr. Kamol's friend.

455
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,400
I guess she came to talk about work.

456
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,560
There's nothing to worry about.

457
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,210
You should go to class now.

458
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,320
Concentrate in class, alright?

459
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,720
Okay.

460
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,080
See you later.

461
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,540
Goodbye, Kim.

462
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,160
Bye.

463
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Where are you?

464
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,380
I just dropped Baiboon off at school, I'm on my way to the office now.

465
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,920
I'm about to go to the warehouse.

466
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,590
Okay.

467
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,720
Well then... I'll hang up now.

468
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,000
Why are you hanging up so quickly?

469
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,250
Are you about to leave?

470
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm worried that you might get bored of hearing my voice.

471
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,190
Why would I feel bored? I haven't said anything about that at all.

472
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,050
Kamol.

473
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,670
A traffic jam is more boring than your voice.

474
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,970
I'm hanging up now.

475
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,670
Why are there so many people in this picture? Who are they?

476
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:17,890
There's Dad, Mom, Uncle Day, Uncle Itt, Uncle Kim, and me.

477
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,260
Do you miss Uncle Kim?

478
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,940
I do.

479
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,280
Day, I'll call Kim, alright?

480
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,770
Go ahead.

481
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,370
I'll call Uncle Kim for you. Wait a minute.

482
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,220
Hello.

483
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,200
Uncle Kim! I miss you so much!

484
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,440
Salmon, I miss you too.

485
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,770
Kim, are you busy right now?

486
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,500
Not at all. I'm in the car.

487
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,600
Where are you going, Kim?

488
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,370
I'm going to my office.

489
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,160
Have you eaten anything yet?

490
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,590
I've eaten already. I have a big tummy now!

491
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,460
Oh, Kim. I haven't sent you the pictures that we took together.

492
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,350
I'll send them to you now.

493
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,110
Okay!

494
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,690
Don't forget to send me the pictures of you guys snorkeling too, I want to see.

495
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,940
Snorkeling with a lot of fish, right?

496
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,670
I'll tell Uncle Itt to send them to you as soon as possible.

497
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,850
You have to come with us next time.

498
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,000
Of course, Salmon. I will go snorkeling with you next time.

499
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,060
Hooray!

500
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,820
You guys are too loud.

501
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,280
Someone is jealous.

502
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,080
Uncle Day is jealous!

503
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,030
Nonsense! Who's jealous?

504
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,980
Kim, I have to go now. I'll send the pictures to you later.

505
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,140
Okay.

506
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,520
Bye-bye, Salmon!

507
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,220
Bye-bye, Uncle Kim.

508
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,200
I talked to him over the phone for only a few minutes.

509
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,930
You're so whiny.

510
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,360
Why?

511
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,620
You got a problem with that?

512
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,130
You're whiny, but I still love you anyway.

513
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,180
Oh! Uncle Day, I saw you smile just now.

514
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,120
Salmon, your eyes are playing tricks on you.

515
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,040
I didn't smile.

516
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,240
He saw it, so why don't you just admit it already?

517
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,350
Uncle Day won't admit the truth, right, Salmon?

518
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:49,520
Uncle Day doesn't admit that he smiles!

519
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,600
I'll catch you now! Come here!

520
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,690
I won't! Oh, no!

521
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:55,940
Come here!

522
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,320
I got you!

523
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,140
I don't feel pain anymore.

524
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,210
Is it because of Mr. Kamol?

525
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,950
But... I've never told him about Day and I.

526
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,570
Will there be a problem if you quit this business?

527
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,820
[NEXT EPISODE]

528
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,480
I want to retire.

529
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,170
It's too late, Kamol. I've sent people there already.

530
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,770
You did well just once, but you dare to ask for retirement?

531
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,150
Danil.

532
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,050
Evan has a brother named Danil.

533
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,330
My relationship with Danil is more than just a casual acquaintance.
