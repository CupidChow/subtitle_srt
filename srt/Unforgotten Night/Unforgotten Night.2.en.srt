He really acts like a mafia.

168
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,940
Kom.

169
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,480
Send someone to keep an eye on Kim.

170
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,460
Don't let him out of your sight.

171
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,050
Understood, sir.

172
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,190
About the warehouse.

173
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,940
What happened exactly?

174
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,760
Explain it to me.

175
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,730
It happened when the guards were changing shifts.

176
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,860
Someone sneaked in to set fire.

177
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,100
We were able to capture one of them,

178
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,210
but the rest have escaped.

179
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,990
I already told Krit to take that person to the office.

180
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,780
Did anyone get injured? Did anything get destroyed?

181
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,280
Fortunately, our latest products have been exported already.

182
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,480
There were only a few bulletproof vests left in the warehouse during the fire.

183
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,530
As for our subordinates, they are all safe.

184
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,770
Did you tell the police not to interfere with this?

185
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,350
Yes, I did, sir.

186
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,300
Good.

187
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,580
I'll deal with it myself.

188
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,740
Who sent you here?

189
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,370
Hey!

190
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,050
My boss just asked you a question.

191
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,330
Answer him.

192
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,540
If you're not going to answer,

193
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,730
well, then...

194
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,230
Clean this mess up.

195
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,930
And go find out who sent this scumbag.

196
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,900
Wait! Don't hurt me! I'll tell you!

197
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,210
It's too late.

198
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,390
They're all dead?

199
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,040
Didn't you say only one of them was captured?

200
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,000
Maybe the one who got captured confessed everything.

201
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,930
But at least we managed to burn down his warehouse.

202
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,970
I know! But that also means he's aware that I'm behind all of this.

203
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,130
He killed all my subordinates to threaten me. Nice try, Kamol!

204
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,580
He stuck his nose into my business first, and now he has killed my subordinates!

205
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,880
I'd like to see who will have the last laugh in the end.

206
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,260
Hey!

207
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,180
Tell everyone that we'll have an urgent meeting.

208
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,330
Yes, sir!

209
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,180
Kamol!

210

Danai.

211
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,859
My father told me to give this to your father. Congratulations on getting a cabinet seat.

212
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,800
Thanks. Have a seat.

213
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,680
Hey.

214
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,210
Thank you on behalf of my dad.

215
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,680
My dad is not here today. He went out to play golf with his friends.

216
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,680
Please send my regards to your father too.

217
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,020
Sure thing.

218
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,980
By the way, Danai, don't you want to get into politics like your father?

219
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,600
I want to have a brother who is a politician.

220
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,180
I know we're just cousins, but I've always seen you as a real brother.

221
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,950
Aww.

222
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,930
That's so sweet.

223
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,760
No wonder my dad adores you so much.

224
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,920
All right. Maybe I'll try in the next election.

225
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,280
Danai, what are you doing right now? Am I disturbing you?

226
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,400
I saw your subordinate leaving the room just now.

227
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,620
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

228
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,780
Have you eaten anything yet?

229
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,990
Do you want to have lunch with me?

230
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,720
Of course. I'd love to!

231
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,920
Okay.

232
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,180
I'll tell them to set the table.

233
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,330
Pick up the call, Kamol. This is urgent!

234
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,440
Hello, Ms. Cherry.

235
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,760
Why didn't Kamol pick up the call? I have an urgent matter to talk to him.

236
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,480
My boss is in a meeting.

237
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,670
You can tell me instead.

238
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,910
Fine.

239
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,130

I'll go to Korea by myself.

Only you this time? Is Mr. Evan coming with you?

245
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,110
Mr. Evan has specifically assigned me to take care of this case.

246
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll report and keep Mr. Evan updated on this case.

247

And about Kim. How is he?

254
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,710
He hasn't left the apartment since we left, except for a couple of times to go downstairs for takeout.

255
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,210
Lop tried to do it for him, but Kim wouldn't let him do that. He insisted on coming down by himself.

256
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,440
You are...

257
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,870
serious about this guy, right?

258
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,160
You know me well.

259
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,440
If I wasn't serious,

260
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,280
would I waste time looking for him in person?

261
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,770
No, sir.

262
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,760
I've never seen you interested in anyone as much as Mr. Kim.

263

By the way, I already told our subordinates to deal with the people who caused the fire at the warehouse.

There's one more thing.

If it's about Cherry, I already know that.

266
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,410
I just didn't want to pick up the call.

267
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
But this time, I think you should listen.

268
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,900

Since she provided the information, I think it should be Danai, right?

272
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,100
Yes.

273
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,580
It matches the information we got from those arsonists we took care of.

274
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,140
As for his motive,

275
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,580
I think he must know that we've sent people to spy on him.

276
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,480
I was just collecting information.

Where did you get my number?

I don't know. You number just pops up on my phone.

Liar. You're being rude.

Why didn't you ask me for my number politely?

370

It's my privacy.

Please don't call me again. Or else I will change my phone number.

I just wanted to tell you that I have to go abroad for work.

So I won't be able to see you for the next few days.

When I return, I'll pick you up at your place.

It's good that you're no longer brutal.

Come on, Kim. We were just teasing you being so mean.

You wouldn't even let us pay you a visit.
