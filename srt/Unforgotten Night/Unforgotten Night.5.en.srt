I have a problem with someone. That's why I can't go back to my place.

11
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,560
So I wanted to ask if you could let me stay here for a while.

Your boss didn't force Kim to go with him, right?

15
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:56,950
Actually,

16
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,550
I've never seen him care about anyone.

17
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,150
From now on, this is our home.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,220
It makes me feel uncomfortable to have someone following me around like this. Do you understand?

19
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,780
Why doesn't Kamol pick up?

20
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,770
Is it the same Kamol that I know?

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,630
I'm sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Kim.

22
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,430
It's okay. And this lady is...?

23
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,230
Who are you?

24
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,329
What's your relationship with Kamol?

25
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,020

Who is this woman?

28
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,750
I should be the one asking that question.

29
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,790
Mr. Kim, this is Ms. Cherry.

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,300
She is...

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Mr. Kamol's colleague.

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Ms. Cherry, this is Mr. Kim.

33
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,710
He's our new boss. He's also Mr. Kamol's lover.

34
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,540
Lover? He's more like a call boy.

35
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,120
You better get out of here!

36
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,290
You don't have the right to set foot in here.

37
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm sorry, Ms. Mr. Kamol's-Colleague.

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,270
If you think someone here is selling his body,

39
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,440
I can assure you it's not me.

40
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,240
You! Get out of here!

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,620

Am I allowed to step foot out of here?

44
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,640
Mr. Kamol will probably get really angry if I leave this house.

45
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,850
But I don't mind.

46
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,010
I don't want to stay here anyway.

47
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,150
You can't!

48
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,130
You can't go anywhere without telling my boss.

49
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,100
Or else he'll kill me.

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,350
Then what should I do?

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,360
Your boss's colleague doesn't want me to stay here.

52
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,210
Ms. Cherry, could you please leave first?

53
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,410
You dare to chase me out?

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm not chasing you out.

55
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,450
You're here to see my boss.

56
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,540
But my boss is not here right now.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,160
So please leave for now.

58
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,680
Fine.

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,350
But you have to answer my question first.

60
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,100
Did Kamol let him stay in this house as his lover?

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,900
I have no reason to lie.

62
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,130
That's not true! I don't believe it!

63
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,230
Ms. Cherry, I think my boss won't be happy if he knows that you're behaving like this.

64
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,990
You won't let me talk to him, huh?

65
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,190
Fine.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,940
I'll call Kamol instead.

67
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,710
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,930
If you don't leave now,

69
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,170
Kamol will kick you out someday.

70
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,680
I understand now why Mr. Kamol wants someone to follow me around.

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,820
He hasn't called me back. Did he purposefully not answer my calls?

72
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,200
He's busy with work at the moment.

73
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,650
I know that! He's always busy with work.

74
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,740
Do you know about Kim?

75
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,660
Tell me everything. Tell me why Kamol let him stay in his house.

76
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

77
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Give your phone to Kamol now. I'll talk to him myself.

78
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,730
He's not available at the moment.

79
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,990
If he won't talk to me, I'll tell everyone about his boyfriend.

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,650
A weakness like that could be easily targeted.

81
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,560
Actually, you can tell anyone about that.

82
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,980
But I think if you do that, my boss will never talk to you ever again.

83
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,310
You're using Kamol to threaten me. What else can I do?

84
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,150
If there's nothing else, I have to hang up.

85
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,560
Alright! Just hang up the phone then!

86
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
You're becoming more like a robot.

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,270
And I'm telling you this for the millionth time to tell Kamol to call me back!

88

I won't let you be someone else's.

It's okay. You should go back to sleep.

From now on, I won't let Cherry bother you anymore.

There are some similarities between us.

As for Cherry, she lost her mother.

We understand each other as a friend.

But lately, Cherry has been trying to get closer to me.

Yeah. Why would I be guarding him while he's sleeping?

Why didn't I see them the last time I went for a walk with Baiboon?

162
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,540
Baiboon just came to live here too. He's not allowed to go near the tiger cage.

163
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,090
I see.

164
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,460
It's so hard to get away from them.

165
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,380
Wow! They're real tigers!

166
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,890
Whoa!

167
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,650
Where did he go?

168
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,510
Mr. Kim!

169
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,580
Tell everyone

170
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,930
to wait for me in the living room!

171
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,400
Go!

172
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Yes, sir.

173
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,650
Who took him to the tiger cage?

174
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,940
Who?

175
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:19,910
It was me.

176
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,160
So it's you, Kit.

177
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,810
No! Mr. Kamol, don't!

178
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,060
Stop it. I sneaked out by myself.

179
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,410
Kit didn't take me there.

180
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,070
What if something happened to you?

181
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,800
What am I supposed to do?

182
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,070
And did anything happen to me?

183
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,500
You're raging at everyone even though nothing's happened to me!

184
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,210
Get out of my face, Kit.

185
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,790
Don't show your face around here again!

186
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,340
Kom.

187
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,320
Yes, sir.

188
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,160
Check on Whipped-cream and Kemo.

189
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,710
Yes, sir.

190
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,370
All of you, get out!

191
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,270
Why did you do that?

192
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,150
Why did you ask for trouble?

193
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,240
If you think I was asking for trouble, just kick me out of the house.

194
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,100
I will never do that.

195
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,850
Let go of me!

196
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,120
Cherry.

197
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,850
Who made my beautiful sister this upset?

198
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,760
Mr. Kamol let some random guy move in his house.

199
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,040
And they said that...

200
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,000
he's Kamol's lover.

201
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,470
Kamol's lover?

202
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,750
I think I know how you can tame him.

203
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,210
So, are you going to walk the same path as me now?

204
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,120
My beautiful sister.

205
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,760
Don't act like we're not close. I'm your brother.

206
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,200
Clean it properly. Lift it up and clean it.

207
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,020
Careful. Don't drop it. Can't you see the dust under it?

208
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,140
You have to lift it up and clean underneath too, don't only clean the outside.

209
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,970
You two go check if the breakfast is ready.

210
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,860
Go now.

211
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,630
Aunt Nee.

212
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,730
Oh, Mr. Kim.

213
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,480
Do you need anything?

214
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,040
Nothing. I just wanted to know where Mr. Kamol went.

215
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,240
He went out with Kom this morning.

216
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,920
Are you hungry? I'll go get breakfast ready for you.

217
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,540
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

218
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,000
Does it hurt?

219
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,200
I'll go get you some ointment.

220
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,520
It's okay. It's not that painful.

221
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,830
It will heal soon.

222
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,400
Please be patient.

223
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,730
I know that you might be feeling uncomfortable staying here. But Mr. Kamol is actually a very good person.

224
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,240
Alright.

225
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,720
Please wait just a moment. I'll prepare breakfast for you.

226
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,590
Thank you, Aunt Nee.

227
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,250
How are you, son? You're calling us very early in the morning. Is something wrong?

228
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Nothing. I just miss you.

229
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,950
Aww. You're such a sweet pie today.

230
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,820
Look at your son.

231
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,230
He is such a sweet talker.

232
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,160
Kim, when are you coming back to help me plant the trees?

233
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,500
I'm a little bit busy these days because I have to take care of the annual financial statement for a big company.

234
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,600
You're going to be richer than me, Kim.

235
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,890
I wish.

236
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,550
I'll treat both of you to a big meal.

237
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,990
I'll go back home when I'm free.

238
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,230
Sure. Take care of yourself.

239
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,500
I love you so much, my son.

240
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,610
I love you too, Mom.

241
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,380
What about me?

242
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,470
I love you too, Dad.

243
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,740
Good.

244
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,990
See you soon, Kim.

245
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,480
See you.

246
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,840
Hello, Kim. How are you?

247
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,560
I'm fine.

248
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,000
How about you? How's everything?

249
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,660
I'm glad to hear that you're doing well.

250
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,450
Thanks.

251

[Unforgotten Night]

252
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,100
How's work?

253
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,330
Don't worry. I'll help you with it.

254
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,330
But we still have to finish the annual financial statement for a big company.

255
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,730
You can send the documents to me via e-mail.

256
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,820
I have time to do it.

257
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,230
Are you sure?

258
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,970
I'm sure. Just send it to me.

259
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,130
Alright. Take care, Kim.

260
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,950
You too. Take care.

261
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,450
Okay.

262
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,820
[Unforgotten Night]

263
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,130
How are you doing?

264
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,560
Have you been busy at work lately?

265
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,640
As you can see from my typing speed, you shouldn't even have to ask.

266
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,880
I want to ask you to eat out with me today.

267
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,630
I want to apologize for yelling at you.

268
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,140
Also, about Cherry.

269
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,260
Can you take me to buy my personal stuff?

270
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,370
Sure.

271
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,650
Up to you.

272
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,330
Kom, why don't you invite Baiboon to come with us?

273
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,490
I don't think Baiboon can go. He has a lot of homework to do.

274
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,850
We can take him with us next time.

275
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,940
If you want to go somewhere,

276
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,640
I can take you there.

277
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,460
Hey, go to sleep. Why are you lying here?

278
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,650
Let me rest my eyes for a minute.

279
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,690
Is he actually a mafia? He's acting like a kid.

280
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:07,360
There are so many bodyguards around us. Are you worried that people won't know that you're a mafia?

281
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,000
Please bear with it. You'll get used to it soon.

282
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,140
Why do I have to bear with it? It's not like I'm going to stay with you for long.

283
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,640
Don't mention it again.

284
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,610
You don't want to try to understand me no matter how I explain it.

285
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,600
If you're going to be mad, I can shop later. Let's just go back home.

286
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,390
Do you even care how I feel?

287
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,380
Kom. Lop.

288
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,320
Yes, sir.

289
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,830
Follow Kim.

290
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,130
I'll wait for you at the cafe.

291
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,960
Yes, sir.

292
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,790
Why are you not coming with me?

293
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,330
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.

294
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,260
Boss, are you really not going with him?

295
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,440
Do you think I was joking?

296
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,650
But Mr. Kim seems to be angry at you.

297
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,320
That is...

298
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,860
what I want.

299
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,900
Tell me.

300
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,210
He's been going home lately since I've been watching him.

301
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,450
He doesn't stay over at the hotel anymore.

302
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,340
But I haven't discovered that he has a lover like Ms. Cherry said.

303
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,160
Our spy is calling. Please excuse me.

304
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,260
Pick up the phone and turn on the speaker.

305
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,920
I found Kamol with an unknown man at the shopping mall near Rama-9.

306
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,760
What does he look like?

307
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,380
He looks tall and slim and has good posture. He's walking next to Kamol.

308
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,400
It's time for me to introduce myself to your lover, Kamol.

309
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,050
Kom.

310
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,280
Do you know how old Kamol is?

311
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,510
I think he's in his early thirties.

312
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,670
He's not that young anymore. So why does he get angry over small things?

313
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,940
You guys probably don't gossip about your boss, huh?

314
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,980
Do you need my help?

315
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:30,990
No.

316
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,620
You probably won't listen to me if I say no.

317
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,620
Just do whatever you want then.

318
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,850
Let's go.

319
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,040
Alright.

320
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,900
What? I just want to say hi to your boss.

321
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,970
Hello, Mr. Kamol. I'm Danai.

322
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,060
What a coincidence meeting you here.

323
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,260
It's good that we are meeting each other here.

324
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,400
We'd better not meet each other anywhere else.

325
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,090
By the way,

326
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,430
why are you drinking coffee alone here?

327
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,900
What about you? What brings you here?

328
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,360
Or...

329
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,720
Are you here to drink coffee alone as well?

330
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
No. I have errands to run around here.

331
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,220
I saw you by coincidence, so I just wanted to say hi.

332
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,330
You wanted to say hi to me... Do you even know me?

333
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,410
With that expression, are you dissatisfied with me?

334
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,260
I'm not.

335
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,770
Then I'm leaving.

336
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,990
I don't want to disturb your coffee time.

337
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,130
Be my guest.

338
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,390
Why did you bump into me and not apologize?

339
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,710
Sorry.

340
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,980
I'll make it up to you next time.

341
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,550
Kim.

342
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,750
Who's that guy? Someone you know?

343
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,780
I don't know him.

344
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,090
Are you hungry? Let's get something to eat.

345
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,840
Up to you.

346
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,610
Let's go.

347
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,360
They seem like a loving couple. Don't you think so, Cherry?

348
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,780
I think it's more like a temporary fling.

349
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,040
A man like Kamol won't pick that kind of guy as his lover.

350
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,000
I think so too.

351
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,920
He'd better choose someone who's suitable for him.

352
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,280
Like my beautiful sister, you're the most suitable one for him.

353
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,670
What do you want?

354
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,770
I don't want anything, Cherry. I just want to see you happy.

355
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,370
Then you shouldn't have brought me here.

356
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,520
Calm down, my little sister.

357
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,389
I just want to know...

358
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,949
Do you still love Kamol?

359
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,969
Why?

360
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,810
Because if you still love him,

361
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,510
you have to help me.

362
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,360
I can promise you that if I succeed,

363
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,210
Kamol will love you back.

364
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,160
We can easily get rid of Kim.

365
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,120
What do I need to do?

366
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,390
I'll organize a secret party

367
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,640
as a gift to thank those who help me with the casino concession.

368
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,430
So things will be easier for us.

369
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,460
[Unforgotten Night]

370
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,710
And I'll send an invitation card to Kamol.

371
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,040
Kamol won't come.

372
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,900
That's right. I know that he won't show up.

373
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,350
But I'll use Kim as the bait.

374
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,730
I'll find some time to meet Kim personally.

375
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,350
And I'll invite him to this party.

376
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,290
If Kamol knows that Kim is coming,

377
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,080
he won't let Kim come alone.

378
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,460
When the time comes,

379
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,600
whatever you want to do,

380
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,270
or whichever way you want to use to separate Kamol and Kim,

381
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,780
it's all up to you.

382
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,020
I'll give you a chance to do it.

383
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,410
Come here.

384
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,010
Kim.

385
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,250
Come and sit here.

386
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,210
How do you feel living here?

387
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,800
Do I have the right to feel anything?

388
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,640
How can you say that?

389
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,500
You're the one I want to stay with.

390
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,950
You're the one I want to get close to.

391
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,870
You want to get close to me just because we're compatible with each other?

392
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,010
Let me ask you something.

393
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,760
If someday you meet someone who is similar to me,

394
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,700
you will probably toss me aside, right?

395
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:30,410
You won't believe me if I say it now.
