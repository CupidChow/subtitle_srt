It's because of him, right? That's why you want to retire.

11
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,240
My life is mine.

12
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,270
Do you love him that much?

13
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
Is that why you betrayed me? Huh?!

14
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,500
Even if Evan isn't willing to let me retire, I'll quit anyway.

Thank you.

16
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,300
Actually, I've never told you about my love life before.

17
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,760
You don't have to tell me.

I've seen photos of you long ago.

Hello, I'm Danil.

22
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,490
I'm Kim.

23
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,680
What is your relationship with Kamol?

24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,990
Speak in Thai.

25
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,540
So that my boyfriend can understand too.

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,230
Let him continue to be confused.

27
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,190
Speak in Thai.

28
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,530
What is your relationship with Kamol?

29
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,670
Mr. Kamol has told you already.

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,079
You're so arrogant!

31
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,260
I think it's getting late now.

32
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,160
If there's something you want to discuss,

33
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,320
we can talk about it tomorrow.

34
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,420
No, I want to talk now.

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,329
Do you want me to ask you nicely

36
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,790
or do you want me to throw you out?

37
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,570
No, I'm going to stay here tonight.

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,820
Danil!

39
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,550
Mr. Kamol.

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,579
You can let your guest stay here.

41
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,290
We can stay in another room.

42
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,890
Did you say I was a guest?

43
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,540
I've been staying here since before you came into his life.

44
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,570
Kim.

45
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,730
How dare you.

46
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,440
Do not cross the line.

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
I've told you.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's talk tomorrow.

49
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,090
Fine, I will stay somewhere else tonight.

50
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,730
But don't hide him from me.

51
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,500
I won't go anywhere.

52
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,820
By the way, what kind of food do you prefer?

53
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,730
I'll let someone prepare it for you.

54
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,810
No need.

55
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,770
I'll see you tomorrow.

56
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,310
You're pretty good at handling a difficult situation.

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,290
I wouldn't dare to do that if I didn't know about Danil before.

58
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,420
Are you afraid of him?

59
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,250
Actually, I am.

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,890
But I know that you're here with me.

61
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,950
Danil wouldn't dare do anything to me.

62
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,150
Danil is always like this.

63
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,659
He likes to act childishly.

64
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,850
I'm actually headstrong and possessive.

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,950
Am I being childish too?

66
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,610
It's okay. I don't mind if you act like a child.

67
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,159
As long as you don't leave me

68
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,610
You too. Don't leave me.

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,960
Mr. Kamol.

70
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,110
You have to go out for work, right?

71
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,620
Can you not go?

72
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,710
Is it that important?

73
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,780
Yes, it is.

74
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,980
Very important.

75
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,860
This is freaking boring!

76
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,400
When are you going to deal with those annoying people?

77
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,370
What are you waiting for?

78
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,110
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

79
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,350
It will be a big issue if I deal with Danai now.

80
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,950
It will draw more attention.

81
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,240
It's like we're killing fleas.

82
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,040
No one will care.

83
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,470
You'd better deal with it as soon as possible before it's too late.

84
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,890
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,659
And about your retirement...

86
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,130
Is it because of the guy named Kim?

87
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,570
Yes.

88
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,810
I don't want my loved one to get hurt.

89
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,400
Because I love him so much.

90
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,970
And I want to be with him for a long time.

91
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,299
Love is so boring.

92
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,260
Make sure you get rid of all the remaining fleas.

93

He looks ordinary.

97
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,030
His career doesn't indicate anything remarkable.

98
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,890
His education...

99
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,890
He attended the same university as Day.

100
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,170
Go find out whether he knows Day or not.

101
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,180
Can I feed him now?

102

Do you want to feed him more?

106
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,230
One more.

107
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,030

Don't act like you've never seen it.

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,230
I think I might have seen it,

but I already forgot.

112
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,990
Do you want me to help you recall your memory?

113

That depends on

You didn't even think about waiting for me, Kamol?

I need to talk to you about something.

170
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,160
He's more important than Evan and me?

171
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,780
You and Evan are like my brothers.

172
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,310
But Kim...

173
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,010
Kim is my everything.

174
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,650
No! I won't let that happen!

175
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,230
Did you know that Kamol and I used to have...

176
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,700
If you're going to say 'sex',

177
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,270
then I already knew.

178
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,810
And you accepted it?

179
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,050
I know who I am and what I am doing.

180
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,140
And you don't have to worry.

181
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,890
Kim is not here to replace anyone.

182
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,330
I won't let this end so easily.

183
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,770
I'll take back what's mine.

184
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,540
Are you sure that Danil no longer has feelings for you?

185
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,910
He's so spoiled.

186
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,170
He behaved like that because he didn't get what he wanted.

187
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,610
He's just being possessive.

188
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,630
Do you still trust me, Kim?

189
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,930
You're important to me.

190
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,250
I trust you.

191
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,900
I also have confidence in you.

192
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,210
Danil can't do anything to hurt me.

193
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,550
You don't have to worry.

194
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,590
I trust you too.

195
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,070
From now on, if Danil bothers you again,

196
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,820
you have to tell me.

197
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,810
I will.

198
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,940
[Unforgotten Night]

199
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,270
Hello, May.

200
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,050
I think TT company's account balance is incorrect.

201
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,580
Just a second, I'll check it for you.

202
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,680
After you check it, please send it to my e-mail.

203
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm looking through the report right now.

204
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,490
Okay.

205
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,790
By the way, how are you? You're gone. I'm kinda worried about you.

206
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm doing well. Don't worry.

207
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,180
Okay.

208
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
Come and visit us sometime. We miss you.

209
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,860
Okay. I'll go when I'm free.

210
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,830
Alright. I'll send you an e-mail later. Please wait.

211
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,870
Sure, I have to go now.

212
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Okay, goodbye.

213
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,480
Are you scared?

214
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,850
Do you know how I deal with people who get in my way?

215
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm not interested.

216
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,050
None of them end up well.

217
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,240
Get out of Kamol's life.

218
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,010
It's impossible for Kamol to quit this business.

219
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,680
I will only get out of his life when he doesn't want me here anymore.

220
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,750
I drove past your parents' house the other day.

221
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,430
Your dad was planting some trees.

222
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,680
If I want someone to die or to disappear,

223
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,570
it won't be hard for me.

224
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,320
I also remember that there are two beautiful ladies at your office.

225
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,190
I think they are worth a lot of money.

226
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,400
Are you done talking?

227
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,640
I will continue with my work.

228
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,790
You're trying to piss me off?

229
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,760
Mr. Danil, let go of Mr. Kim.

230
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,290
Mr. Danil, I think you know what will happen if my boss knows about this.

231
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,330
Watch your mouth.

232
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,450
Mark my words. I do what I say.

233
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,840
Mr. Kim, are you alright?

234
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,440
Are you okay?

235
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,340
I'm fine.

236
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,770
Don't tell Mr. Kamol about this.

237
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,850
Yes, sir.

238
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,890
Danil, you should learn some manners.

239
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,190
Send these documents to Evan.

240
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,150
Yes, sir.

241
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,120
Evan won't let you do it.

242
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm not asking for your opinion.

243
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,920
And don't assume what Evan thinks.

244
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,540
Do you think I don't know what you're planning to do?

245
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,370
It's not as simple as you think.

246
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,800
Maybe you'll even have to sacrifice with a life if Evan doesn't let you go.

247
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,740
If one life has to be sacrificed,

248
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,740
it won't be Kim's.

249
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,970
Why do you care so much about this guy?

250
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,650
What about me? I can give you everything, especially sex!

251
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,400
Danil!

252
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,990
Do you think it's the right time to talk about this in front of my subordinate?

253
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,170
Get out of here then!

254
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,650
Don't you dare order my subordinates around.

255
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,900
You may go now.

256
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,360
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

257
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,590
Come here, Kim.

258
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,880
What's the matter?

259
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,320
I just want to ask what you want to eat for lunch.

260
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,690
Gosh! I'm still standing right here!

261
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,680
Mr. Danil, is there anything you want to eat?

262
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,160
No!

263
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,080
I won't let Kamol throw everything away.

264
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,280
I will do everything to stop you. Wait and see!

265
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,940
Mr. Danil seems like a person who needs a lot of love and care.

266
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,880
How do you know?

267
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,400
Because I used to be like that.

268
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,150
I know how painful it is.

269
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,400
You're such a kind person.

270
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,400
I'm glad that I've chosen the right person to love.

271
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,670
I'm here to report on Kim's background.

272
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,880
Don't mention his name in front of me!

273
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,990
But you must know about this.

274
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,780
We've found that Day and Kim used to be together.

275
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,060
What did you just say?

276
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,770
He was in a relationship with Day before?

277
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
Day, who used to be Kamol's subordinate?

278
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,200
That's right.

279
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:13,870
I see.

280
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,600
Does Danil still bother you these days?

281
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,410
He does come and quarrel with me sometimes, just as usual.

282
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,990
Do you want me to dry your hair?

283
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,580
Let me.

284
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,860
Soon, I won't have to be involved in this chaos anymore.

285
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,860
Wait for me, Kim.

286
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,610
Evan.

287
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,500
Why are you here so early, Evan?

288
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,380
I have to sort out some issues quickly.

289
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Is it about Kamol?

290
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,050
It's none of your business.

291
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,340
Don't cause any problems or do anything to trouble me.

292
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,340
I won't let Kamol retire.

293
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,010
I won't let that happen!

294
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,370
Danil!

295
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
Hello.

296
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,430
When are you coming back?

297
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,700
I'm still working.

298
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,880
You can sleep first.

299
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,990
I...

300
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Is there something wrong?

301
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,770
Nothing's wrong.

302
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,540
Kim, what's wrong?

303
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,970
I don't want to be silly and self-centered.

304
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,770
But I was hoping you'd be back soon.

305
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,330
But I also understand that you have work to do.

306
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,050
You're so cute.

307
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,700
I don't mind if you're being self-centered.

308
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,520
I don't mind if you're being silly.

309
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,330
I will go home as soon as I finish my work.

310
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,620
I will wait for you.

311
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,520
I want to end all of this quickly.

312
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,080
Accounting documents, sir.

313
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,260
Where's Danil?

314
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,470
Is he still bothering Kim?

315
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,530
He still bothers Kim sometimes, but it's nothing serious.

316
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,200
Excuse me, sir.

317
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,860
Mr. Evan and Danil are here.

318
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,050
When will you

319
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,500
go back to Russia?

320
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,480
Why are you in such a hurry to chase me away?

321
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,920
You haven't listened to my fun story yet.

322
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,840
Or do you want me to tell you something fun in front of all your men?

323
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:27,760
I want to know how well you know Kim.

324
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,730
It doesn't matter.

325
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,170
It's none of your business.

326
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,720
Are you sure?

327
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,140
I have nothing more to say to you.

328
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,770
If you're done here, you should get out of here.

329
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,630
It seems you don't know Kim's past.

330
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,230
I don't care about what happened in the past.

331
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,840
But Kim

332
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,699
used to be Day's partner.

333
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,449
I guess you don't mind getting the guy who used to be with your subordinate, right?

334
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,010
Where are you going?

335
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,199
Get out.

336
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,520
You can't run away from the truth.

337
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,920
In the end, you'll come crawling back to Evan and me, just like before!

338
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,650
Get out!

339
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:23,990
Danil.

340
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,860
Danil said...

341
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,390
Kim and Day used to be together.

342
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,740
Maybe Danil just wanted to mess with your head.

343
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,620
Go find out.

344
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,750
What if what he said is true...

345
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,350
I...

346
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,140
I don't want to think about it.

347
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,150
Just do as I say.

348
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,820
Yes, sir.

349
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,680
Why does it have to be someone close to me?

350
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,940
[Unforgotten Night]

351
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,460
From now on,

352
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,620
I will no longer work for Evan.

353
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,690
And I won't involve myself in any shady businesses.

354
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,510
I only want people who are willing to stay with me.

355
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,450
If anyone of you doesn't want to work for me anymore,

356
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,380
let me know.

357
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,930
I will send you to work with Evan.

358
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,680
I will stay with you, Boss.

359
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,140
Me too. I'll stay with you, Boss.

360
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,460
-I'll stay with you, Boss.
-I'll stay with you, Boss.

361
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,520
Thank you

362
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,640
for trusting me.

363
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,120
Baiboon, I gotta go. See ya!

364
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,930
Baiboon.

365
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,370
Hello, Kim.

366
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,020
Hello.

367
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,590
Let's go.

368
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,190
Baiboon, look out!

369
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,750
Baiboon, are you okay?

370
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,390
I'm fine.

371
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:23,950
Kom.

372
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,400
Take Baiboon to rest.

373
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,130
Baiboon.

374
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,090
If you need something, you can tell Kom.

375
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,780
Yes, sir.

376
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,000
What happened?

377
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,810
Someone tried to shoot us.

378
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,940
I told Lop to find the culprit.

379
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,120
Danai won't let go of me, huh.

380
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,610
I asked people in that area. They said there was a lady standing there.

381
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,770
A lady?

382
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:05,950
Yes, sir.

383
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,120
After she fired the gun, a car came to pick her up.

384
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,930
Lop.

385
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,730
Yes, sir.

386
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,900
Send more people to protect Kim and Baiboon.

387
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,080
Kim.

388
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,390
If you're going somewhere, take Lop with you.

389
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,460
I'm not sure if Cherry has something to do with this.

390
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,460
I'll look into it.

391
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,780
Lop.

392
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,470
Yes, sir.

393
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,270
Take care of Kim.

394
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:38,910
Yes, sir.

395
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,800
Where are you going?

396
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,380
I've got work to do.

397
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,120
What's wrong with him?

398
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,340
Why...

399
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,670
I think so too. He's not like himself.

400
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,480
He's still not home yet?

401
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,440
Mr. Kim, please take a seat.

402
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,420
Thank you.

403
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,570
Do you want to eat the congee now?

404
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,770
Sure.

405
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,310
Alright.

406
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,840
Where's Baiboon?

407
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,440
He's a bit sick, so I let him take some medicine and rest.

408
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,700
Is it serious?

409
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,350
Not really. He just has a slight fever.

410
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,830
I think he's still shocked about what happened yesterday.

411
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,590
Mr. Kamol didn't come back home last night?

412
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:11,140
If he didn't go out early in the morning, I think he probably didn't return home last night.

413
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,810
Because I haven't seen him today.

414
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,630
Thank you.

415
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,020
Mr. Kim.

416
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,910
Mr. Kamol is probably busy with work. So don't worry.

417
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,960
Thank you.

418
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,500
You're welcome.

419
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,350
Yes, Mr. Kim.

420
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,780
Is that Ruj?

421
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:02,590
Yes, sir.

422
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,060
Well... Boss is sleeping right now.

423
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,120
He worked until late last night.

424
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,520
Tell him to call me back.

425
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,240
Yes, sir.

426
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,880
Why did he lie to me?

427
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,690
I think Mr. Kim knows.

428
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,440
What should I do if he gets angry?

429
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,120
It's because you were so obvious.

430
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm not surprised if he knows.

431
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,890
Boss, I'm not good at lying.

432
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,300
Kim won't be mad at you.

433
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,260
But he will be mad at me.

434
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,170
I want to drink coffee.

435
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,810
Have you eaten breakfast yet?

436
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:25,850
Yeah.

437
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,670
Can I ask you something?

438
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,570
What happened to your hand?

439
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,460
You should be worried about yourself first.

440
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,300
I heard that Kamol didn't come back home last night.

441
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,100
Hoe did you know?

442
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,260
Both of you are hot-tempered.

443
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,590
Last night...

444
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:57,010
I told him about your past with Day.

445
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:04,770
Lop!

446
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,320
Yes, sir.

447
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,670
Get the car ready.

448
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,730
Mr. Kim, where do you want to go?

449
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,190
To see Mr. Kamol of course. Are you trying to make me mad?

450
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,260
No, sir.

451
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,570
Let's go.

452
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:23,910
Yes, sir.

453
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,740
Is he going to trust me?

454
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,140
You don't care about me anymore, right?

455
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,920
[Next Episode]

456
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,720
Is that Kim?

457
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,700
Yes.

458
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,390
You used to be with Kim?

459
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,470
We used to be in a relationship.

460
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:51,730
Kim.

461
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,250
You made the right decision.

462
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,100
What the hell?

463
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,540
Get our men ready.

464
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,650
I will get rid of every single one of them before my retirement.
