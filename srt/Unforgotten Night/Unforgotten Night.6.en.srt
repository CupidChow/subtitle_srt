Danai really likes to stir up trouble.

But since he'll organize such a huge event, I can hardly miss it.

74
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,770
Also, it seems like Danai finally realized that our Korean investors have bailed on them.

75

He's too slow to realize that.

Danai, what kind of gifts are you planning to give to all the guests attending the event?

82
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,090
Just some small gifts for those who are willing to lend me a hand in the casino auction.

83
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,520
I dare say these gifts are enough to make politicians, police, and diplomats obedient to me.

Did you accept the invitation card?

109

I accepted it because I was annoyed.

Why didn't you refuse him? You know it's dangerous.

111

I know that it's dangerous. That's why I tried to end the conversation sooner and just walked away.

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,330
Come and sit down, Kim.

164
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,680
Did you bring the invitation card with you?

165
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,000
-Yeah.
-Can I have it?

166
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,900
Why?

167
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,390
I can't let you attend that banquet.

168
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,690
It's too dangerous. I want you to wait at home.

169
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,690
I'll come back home as fast as I can.

170
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
I know you won't let me go.

171
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,300
How lucky am I that you don't just lock me up in here?

172
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,440
Thank you so much for coming today, sir.

173
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,140
- I'm glad to be here.
- Thank you, sir.

174
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,900
If you need anything, please let me know.

175
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,580
Sure.

176
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,540
Please excuse me.

177
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,870
Thank you for coming today.

178
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,020
Ms. Khing.

179
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,630
Hello.

180
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,660
How are you doing?

181
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,360
I'm good.

182
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,270
How's the business? Still running smoothly?

183
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,660
I hope that we'll get to work together.

184
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,560
Stick to the plan.

185
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:38,990
Yes, sir.

186
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,140
Are you really going to go, Mr. Kim?

187
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,630
Please don't go.

188
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,690
If you guys won't come with me, I'll go there alone.

189
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,550
You decide.

190
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,500
Have you eaten anything yet?

191
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,390
Mr. Kamol.

192
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,370
I thought you weren't coming.

193
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,900
Thank you.

194
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,790
Please excuse me.

195
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,930
Kim.

196
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,650
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,830
I've never thought a big shot like you would care to join a small party like this.

198
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,100
Well, you invited me.

199
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,540
How could I say no to that kind offer?

200
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,260
The banquet is quite small,

201
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,670
yet very luxurious.

202
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,560
But I think...

203
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,660
it's still not good enough to make you win the concession.

204
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,670
Damn you, Kamol.

205
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,410
Mr. Kim, I'll get you a drink.

206
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,850
You've come all the way here, you might as well stay for a while.

207
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,770
The "Friends and Sponsors Appreciation" event will never happen if we didn't have our president.

208
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,410
So please welcome Mr. Danai Permsap to the stage.

209
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,180
Thank you, everyone.

210
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,330
I've organized this event to thank you all for always supporting my company.

211
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,450
I've prepared gifts for everyone, the staff will hand it out to you.

212
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,450
I would like to say thank you once again.

213
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,780
Everyone in the company, including me, appreciates all the help.

214
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,560
Please enjoy the night.

215
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,260
My friend is a grateful person.

216
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,990
I also want to give him a gift.

217
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,370
What the heck?

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hold it carefully.

219
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,460
I can't help you if it explodes before it's supposed to.

220
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,890
What do you mean by that?

221
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,600
Listen carefully.

222
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,160
It is...

223
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,290
what you think it is.

224
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,200
A bomb?

225
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,660
If you have something to say, just say it quickly.

226
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,260
You trust people too easily.

227
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,190
Get him!

228
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:27,990
Let go of me!

229
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,130
Didn't I tell you

230
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,010
not to involve yourself with Kamol?

231
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,430
But you still won't walk away.

232
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,180
You better keep in mind

233
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,560
that Kamol belongs to me!

234
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,560
Get out of Kamol's life if you want to live in peace.

235
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,800
I didn't want to be a part of his life!

236
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,200
You should be telling him to let me go.

237
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,570
Don't waste your time on me if you want Mr. Kamol.

238
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,550
Sir, Mr. Kim has disappeared.

239
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,290
I've told our people to search for him.

240
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,540
Everyone, please hold the gift in your hand carefully.

241
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,760
I can't guarantee your safety if you drop it.

242
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,870
What is it?

243
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,690
It sounds like the ticking of a clock.

244
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,720
A clock?

245
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,540
I agree, I hear it too.

246
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,800
I don't want to discredit my friend.

247
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
But inside the box that everyone is holding...

248
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,890
contains a bomb.

249
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,900
A bomb?

250
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,950
Please remain calm. I can help you all.

251
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,260
It's not true!

252
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,510
There is no bomb at all.

253
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,460
I put cash inside the box.

254
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,000
You can open it if you don't believe me.

255
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,750
If you want to open it, then go ahead.

256
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,400
Or should I try throwing a box instead?

257
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,840
Don't!

258
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm sure that it will explode.

259
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,790
Don't do it!

260
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,540
What do you want? I can give you everything. But please help us.

261
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,960
Yes! We are all government officers here. We are influential people, and we have a lot of money. So if you want power or money, we can give it to you.

262
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,900
Keep those things to yourselves.

263
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,540
There's only one thing that I want you guys to do.

264
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Just put the box down and leave this place.

265
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,690
Repeat, leave this place one person at a time.

266
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,140
Please leave.

267
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,110
Wait! Don't go!

268
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,900
This is all a misunderstanding!

269
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,950
Ms. Khing!

270
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,640
It's just cash inside the box!

271
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,230
It's a bomb-ticking sound!

272
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,760
If you want to play a strategy game, can you make it harder for me?

273
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,490
[Unforgotten Night]

274
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,140
You...

275
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,220
Boss.

276
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:20,630
Have you found Kim?

277
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,300
We haven't found him yet.

278
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,770
Natee!

279
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,610
Yes, sir.

280
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,690
If he starts playing any tricks, detonate the bomb.

281
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,970
Yes, sir.

282
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,510
Ms. Cherry, the party is over.

283
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,090
There are bombs inside this place!

284
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,600
We have to get out of here now!

285
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,330
I'll go check on Mr. Danai first.

286
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,530
[Unforgotten Night]

287
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,890
Lock him up first!

288
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,180
Let go!

289
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,830
Let go of me!

290
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,350
Mr. Kamol, what's going on? Why are all the guests rushing out of the hall?

291
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,090
Where is Kim?

292
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,880
I don't know!

293
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,120
It hurts!

294
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,240
Let go of me!

295
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,130
If you're not my friend,

296
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,610
you won't be standing here right now.

297
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,300
Why?

298
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,840
Are you going to hurt me?

299
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,340
Do it then!

300
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,160
Don't cross the line.

301
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,320
Kim is important to me.

302
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,510
You don't want to see me get angry.

303
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,030
Beg me.

304
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,930
Beg me for the location of the person you're worried about.

305
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,700
Boss.

306
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,440
Get out of my way.

307
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,350
Uncle! Wait.

308
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,850
Why are you rushing out?

309
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,740
Cherry, why is the safety system not secured at all?

310
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,190
I trusted your dad so much.

311
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,640
But Danai is really bad.

312
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,650
What's going on?

313
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,520
There are bombs inside.

314
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,470
Danai can't even organize a proper event.

315
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,340
He put all the guests in danger.

316
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,490
It will be hard for me to help him in the future.

317
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,970
Even your dad's connections won't be able to help him get away with this.

318
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,440
You better leave now.

319
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,190
We have no idea when the news reporters will show up.

320
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,970
What a disgrace.

321
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,920
He might even get caught for the bribery.

322
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,440
Your dad's reputation will also be ruined if people find out that a daughter of an influential politician is involved in this matter.

323
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,750
You should leave quickly!

324
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,230
How did everything go wrong?

325
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,000
Mr. Kamol, watch out!

326
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,030
Careful!

327
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,380
Who hurt you? Tell me.

328
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,360
I'm going to kill them.

329
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,670
What took you so long?

330
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,140
You're not hurt, are you?

331
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,140
You don't have to be worried about me.

332
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,710
Does it hurt?

333
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm fine. I won't die just because of a scratch.

334
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm sorry for coming so late.

335
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,310
I shouldn't get you involved.

336
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,690
Everything's under control, sir.

337
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,950
I'll leave the rest to you.

338
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,640
I'll take Kim home first.

339
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,840
Yes, sir.

340
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,750
Thank you.

341
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,320
Look, it's already on the news.

342
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,380
The news reporters are so fast nowadays.

343
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,950
If I was the guest, I would be furious after reading the news.

344
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,490
The officers did not find any bombs inside the venue.

345
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,280
The boxes only contained clocks.

346
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,180
Don't you think it's funny?

347
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,790
Are you okay?

348
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,830
I'm fine.

349
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:47,140
What would you do if the guests didn't believe that there were bombs inside those boxes?

350
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,310
I would detonate the bomb in front of them.

351
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,080
There was an actual bomb in the venue.

352
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,290
But since everything went according to plan, I just had to get rid of it.

353
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,720
Are you that surprised?

354
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,180
I know that you wouldn't be able to accept it if you knew my plan.

355
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,360
Who could accept the fact that you're going to blow up the hotel?

356
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,170
What about Ms. Cherry? Did you anticipate her being there?

357
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:35,140
Actually, I followed her because I was worried that she would ruin your plan.

358
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,690
I had expected it.

359
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,450
But I was slightly careless.

360
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,010
I didn't expect that she would go that far.

361
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,080
But I think she really likes you.

362
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,810
Cherry and I can only be friends.

363
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,990
From now on, Cherry won't dare to bother you anymore.

364
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,610
Did you do something to her?

365
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,110
I didn't.

366
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,690
I just told her frankly.

367
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,400
You don't have to worry about someone who slapped you.

368
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,350
I'm not worried.

369
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,540
Do you know

370
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,520
how worried I was when you disappeared from the event?

371
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,800
Don't be dramatic.

372
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,360
I was seriously worried about you, Kim.

373
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,650
Please don't reject my feelings.

374
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,790
Let's eat.

375
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,020
Dig in.

376
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,400
A major event that shocked the society turned out to be a farce.

377
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,510
A luxurious hotel reported that there were bombs inside.

378
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:30,600
However, when the officers entered the place to check for bombs, all they found were clocks.

379
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,390
Damn it!

380
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,910
[Unforgotten Night]

381
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,380
Boss, I've told the hotel staff not to say a word about what happened.

382
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,080
I know that already!

383
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,690
Why the heck did you have to report this to me again?

384
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,140
If the reporters know, they will be having fun writing news about it already.

385
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,540
Just get out of my face!

386
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,420
Yes, sir.

387
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,320
Kamol, I swear I'm not done with you!

388
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,210
Is that you, Kim? Come in.

389
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,890
[Unforgotten Night]

390
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,930
Are you busy?

391
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
A little bit. What's up?

392
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,020
It's late in the afternoon already.

393
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,700
You should eat before continuing with your work.

394
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,010
You'll get sick if you continue to work hard and not eat anything.

395
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,230
What are you doing? Someone might come in and see us.

396
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,699
I need a hug to boost my energy.

397
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,810
I have a lot of work to finish tonight.

398
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,810
You're going out for work tonight?

399
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,520
I have to go to the pub.

400
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,570
Can I go with you?

401
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,630
No.

402
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,530
It's dangerous.

403
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,500
Even when you're coming with me?

404
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,659
Why don't you just lock me up then?

405
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,540
You won't let me go anywhere.

406
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,239
I can't even go to your workplace.

407
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,050
Fine. You can come with me.

408
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,820
But you can't complain that it's boring.

409
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,950
I can't be with you all the time.

410
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,040
Then I might as well ask you this.

411
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,680
I have a favor to ask.

412
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,880
Let's continue working after we finish our meal.

413
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:34,770
Water.

414
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,100
Hey.

415
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,920
Which one is Kemo, and which is Whipped-cream?

416
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,960
Whipped-cream is more adorable. Why don't you take a guess?

417
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,390
Whipped-cream... Is that him?

418
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,870
He's cute while sleeping. He seems to be domesticated.

419
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,940
Bingo! That's Whipped-cream.

420
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,570
Do you like tigers?

421
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,550
I do.

422
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,920
If you like them, you should visit them often,

423
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,930
until they're familiar with you.

424
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,230
You can ask Kom to take you here when I'm not free.

425
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,930
Once they are familiar with you, we can come here to feed them together.

426
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,090
Okay?

427
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,880
Sure.

428
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,120
By the way, do you think...

429
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,780
Kemo would let me touch him?

430
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,100
Kemo is not domesticated. He's quite aggressive.

431
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,420
You need to spend some time with him.

432
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,450
Right now, I really want to give Whipped-cream a hug.

433
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,820
You can do that once you're close to him.

434
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,620
Really? Will you show me?

435
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,110
Sure.

436
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,290
Just like this.

437
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,440
Hey, I'm not a tiger.

438
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Go over there. Whipped-cream is there.

439
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,590
Go ahead.

440
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,680
Fine, I'll go.

441
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,490
Go.

442
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,320
I will hug them someday.

443
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,330
Grandma, I'm done.

444
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,160
Oh, Kom.

445
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,810
I just walked past Aunt Nee.

446
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,190
I see.

447
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:59,730
Do you need anything? Have you eaten yet?

448
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,680
No. Is there anything else left for me to eat?

449
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,470
Well, can I...

450
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,820
make omelette rice for you? I can make it right now.

451
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,520
Oh, it's fine.

452
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,120
Wait for me. It won't take longer than ten minutes.

453
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,640
Please.

454
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,250
Please.

455
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:24,830
Okay.

456
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,730
Thank you.

457
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,540
Why are you thanking me?

458
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,560
You've been taking care of me more than I do of you.

459
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,380
Did you finish your work?

460
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,360
I'm taking a break right now.

461
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,570
I have to go outside later.

462
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,630
You're going with Lop?

463
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:08,810
Yes.

464
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,460
Are you tired?

465
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,670
I'm already used to it.

466
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,160
Mr. Kamol is going with you, right?

467
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,240
Yeah.

468
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,120
So that means everyone will go outside, right?

469
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,130
Mr. Kim is going, too.

470
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,790
Kim too?

471
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,070
What's the matter?

472
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,130
Oh, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

473
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,450
I guess you don't want to be here and answer all these questions. I think I should go.

474
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,080
Well... it's not that I don't want to answer your questions.

475
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,210
Can you sit with me?

476
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,040
Of course.

477
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,150
I have a question to ask you, Mr. Kom.

478
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,290
Do you prefer spicy food or do you have more of a sweet tooth?

479
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,930
I can eat everything.

480
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,480
Alright.

481
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,750
Is it good?

482
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,940
It's good.

483
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,670
I'll make it for you next time.

484
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,480
Sure.

485
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,390
Kom, come and sit with us.

486
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,750
This is yours.

487
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,860
This is Mr. Kamol's.

488
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,740
And this one is mine.

489
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,760
Come on, Kom, have a drink.

490
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,560
Your boss won't be angry. Let's drink.

491
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,090
Kom doesn't drink while he's on duty.

492
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,360
Why?

493
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,790
I have to protect my boss.

494
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,690
Not even a sip?

495
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,140
The safety of my boss and you must come first.

496
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,910
By the way, why do you guys have to open the car door for us?

497
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Actually, no. You guys open every door for us.

498
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,730
How is that related to safety?

499
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,730
We just want to do it for you two.

500
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,080
Did you order them to do that, Mr. Kamol?

501
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:32,770
In that case, you don't have to do that for me. Just serve your boss then.

502
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,510
I'm afraid I can't promise you that.

503
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,200
It's up to you then.

504
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,530
Wow, there are so many people here.

505
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,070
This room is great. You can see everything from up here.

506
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,560
I purposefully designed it this way.

507
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,200
You can go do your work. I'll wait for you here.

508
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,460
Okay.

509
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,390
If you need anything, there are people outside, just call them.

510
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,310
Oh. You're done with work?

511
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,560
Yeah.

512
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,840
Are you bored? Do you want to go home now?

513
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,770
Actually, I found something.

514
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,020
I think your pub looks very classy.

515
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,430
But the light near the toilet is so dim.

516
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,300
I saw a couple coming out from that way, too.

517
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,480
I think they went there to do something.

518
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,070
If you make that area brighter, you might be able to solve that problem.

519
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,820
What are you laughing at?

520
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,600
You are actually concerned about my business.

521
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,430
I was just thinking since I got nothing to do.

522
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,850
You can just sit and chill if you have nothing to do.

523
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,610
Come on, I just...

524
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,370
Excuse me.

525
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,930
The lady downstairs bought you a drink.

526
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:46,950
Who is it for?

527
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,520
To that gentleman over there, sir.

528
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,070
Don't tell me that...

529
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,520
you're mad at me because of this drink.

530
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,230
Yeah.

531
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,440
Why are you so angry? Fine, let's go home then.

532
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,520
I think that I'm getting drunk and feeling quite sleepy.

533
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:31,710
OK.

534
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,300
He's so jealous.

535
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,820
Will you stop being mad at me?

536
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,520
Why don't you go to stay with Day?

537
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,110
[NEXT EPISODE]

538
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,580
You forced me to come here when you're happy,

539
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:09,360
and when you're not, you just toss me aside like this?

540
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,180
The "one day" I mentioned before is today, isn't it?

541
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,230
I like the atmosphere in your family, it's very cute and happy.

542
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,230
Itt,

543
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,540
are you overthinking about Kim and I again?
