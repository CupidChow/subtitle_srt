I'm sorry.

20

You didn't come back because you didn't want to see me?

21

It's not like that, Kim.

22
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,970
If you have something to say, it's better to talk at home.

23
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,640
Danil already told me.

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,120
He already told you that Day and I used to...

25
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,410
I don't care about the past.

26
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,990
I don't believe you!

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,670
Otherwise you wouldn't be ignoring me like this.

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,900
Let's talk about this when we get home, Kim.

29
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,250
Can't you listen to me for once?

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,980
Kim.

31
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,100
You say you're busy,

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,900
but the truth is you don't care about me anymore, right?

33
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,150
It's not like that, Kim.

34

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,700
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,470
And you. Tell Day to pay me a visit.

42
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,710
If he refuses...

43
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,870
then tell him I will personally go find him.

44
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,490
Understood.

45
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,710
Was that the guy named Kim?

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,940
Yes.

47
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

48
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,880
It's alright. After all, this is the person that made you want to quit.

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,970
There is nothing more troubling than the fact that you want to quit, Kamol.

50
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,370
Stay strong, Kim.

51

Yes, I'm very satisfied.

74
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,810
Actually, you should be thanking me. You already saw that Kamol can't accept your past.

75
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,350
It's a good thing that you're not falling in any deeper than you are now.

You go. I have to keep an eye out around here.

92
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,050
I really can't handle it, can't you help me? If something happens, it'll be a big problem.

I won't answer that question.

I asked our men to go check on Mr. Kim's condo.

What did he tell you to do?

He told me to stop Lop while he took Mr. Kim outside.

167
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,520
No.

168
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,890
That wasn't me. I didn't shoot.

169
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,110
Danai forced me.

170
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,470
But... how is that kid?

171
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,430
He's alright. It missed, didn't hurt us.

172
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,599
But... who actually fired the shot?

173
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,010
It's part of Danai's plan.

174
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,170
Kim.

175
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,880
Even though I don't really like you... but Kamol and I had a talk.

176
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,010
We will remain as friends.

177
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,130
I will never betray Kamol.

178
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,870
Okay, I trust you.

179
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,840
Stop reminiscing about the past! Who knows whether we will be able to escape from here!

180
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,520
Ms. Cherry, do you know why Danai captured us?

181
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,250
It probably has something to do with the Casino's concession.

182
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,610
Danai holds a grudge on Kamol for that.

183
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,490
Let go!

184
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,730
I will kick all of you!

185
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,370
Let me go!

186
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:07,930
Let go of me!

187
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,590
What's going on? I told you to capture just one person.

188
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,800
Why did you also capture a foreigner?

189
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,550
He tried to help Kim, so I brought him with us too.

190
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,230
You sneaky little dog.

191
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,630
You dare talk back at me?

192
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,750
Go on.

193
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,840
I'll hit you until you can't talk anymore.

194
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,790
You want the Casino concessions, right?

195
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,860
Pretty smart.

196
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,220
Then you should have foreseen your own fate, right?

197
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,660
You are the bargaining chip in this deal for me.

198
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,980
No way.

199
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,640
Kamol and I are not partners anymore.

200
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,880
That's right. I'm Kamol's partner.

201
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,940
Whatever. I don't care who it is.

202
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,800
Film all of them.

203
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,870
Don't forget to include my lovely sister, Cherry.

204

205

This is just a little appetizer.

Tomorrow,

210
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,100
meet me at my warehouse at 9 PM.

211
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,990
Oh, and don't forget to bring the casino operating permit with you.

212

I've told you to deal with him quickly.

217

It's my fault for being careless.

Follow me.

It seems like, you're a little impatient, aren't you?

222
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,730
Where's the permit? Let me see it.

223
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,630
Where are my people?

224
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,180
If you want to see your people...

225
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:25,260
you'll have to sign the casino operating permit first.

226
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,820
You're so shameless.

227
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,950
It's done.

228
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,170

They're fine.

They're not missing any limbs yet.

231
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
Bring them out.

No. Mr. Danil should go first.

If you shoot, I'll shoot!

265

Put your weapons down first,

266
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,160
or you won't leave here unscathed.

267
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,340
I'll be a fool if I believe you.

268
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,580
Hey, Kamol. Let's make an exchange.

269
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,840
You give me the permit, and I'll give you your lover.

270
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,980
Okay.

271
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,230
Then let's put the gun down at the same time.

272
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,330
Give it to me.

Are you alright?

274
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,110
I thought you wouldn't come.

He's injured in the head.

285
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm going to bring him home first.

286
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,650
You should go get it checked. Evan and I can handle the rest here.

Mr. Danil also needs someone to care for him.

334
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,750
Especially from you, his brother.

335
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,360
Mr. Danil is a very brave person.

336
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,720
He stepped in and helped me when I was in danger,

337
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,790
even though he didn't even like me.

338
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,530
I think he just needed someone to protect him too.

339
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,880
The reason why he acted hostile towards me was probably because he's scared...

340
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,420
He's scared that I'll take Mr. Kamol away from him.

341
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,590
I'm sorry, Kim.

342
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,300
I'm really sorry.

343
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,310
It's alright.

344
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,290
I have an answer for you, Kamol.

345
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,820
If it's for someone like Mr. Kim, I understand why you'd want to quit.

346
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,110
You can do whatever you want.

347
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,550
Thank you for understanding, Evan.

348
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,580
Thank you for helping me understand my brother a bit more.

349
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,980
But we still have to apologize to you.

350
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,340
I'm sorry, Kim.

351
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,870
And thank you, for everything.

352
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,860
Don't worry about it.

353
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,780
Hey, Itt!

354
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,990
Day! How did you guys get here?

355
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,060
If you're waiting for Mr. Kamol, he went to the airport with Mr. Evan and Mr. Danil.

356
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,900
It might take a while.

357
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,160
We're not here to see Mr. Kamol. We're here to see you!

358
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,850
I heard that you injured your head?

359
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,940
As you can see.

360
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,720
Let's go inside and play with Whipped-Cream.

361
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,920
Do you want to come, Itt?

362
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,570
Nah. You can go ahead, Kim.

363
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,770
I'll be here waiting for you guys.

364
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,080
Do you have something you want to tell me?

365
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,070
No, I'm just here to visit.

366
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,060
That's not true.

367
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,400
You're smart.

368
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,970
I just think that there's something you should know

369
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,600
about Mr. Kamol's feelings.

370
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,040
Yesterday, when you ran out from the pub...

371
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,060
Mr. Kamol told me to pay him a visit.

372
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,400
He asked me...

373
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,820
Were you partners with Kim before?

374
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,660
We've been in a relationship before.

375
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:44,860
Since when?

376
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
Answer me.

377
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,780
Since I've started working for you... around high school.

378
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,600
For all this time,

379
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,010
it was you who made Kim so upset, right?

380
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,300
Should I just break your neck?

381
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,400
From now on,

382
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:47,220
between you and Kim, there is nothing anymore.

383
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,050
Understand?

384
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,530
Understood.

385
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,730
He really loves you, Kim.

386
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,760
Although I have to follow my Boss's orders,

387
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,950
actually,

388
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,380
this is also Itt's demand.

389
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
He doesn't allow me to care about anything other than him.

390
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,130
What are you whispering about? Are you guys gossiping about me?

391
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,340
When you come out of the cage, see how I'll deal with you.

392
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,050
Alright, I'll let you handle me when I come out later.

393
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,120
So... everything's back to normal between you and my Boss, right?

394
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,700
He's never stopped loving you.

395
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,580
He's never hesitated at all.

396
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,410
Thanks for telling me all this.

397
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,390
You should have a talk with him as soon as possible.

398
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,220
Your owner is quite cute, isn't he, Whipped-Cream?

399
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,140

They already went back.

406
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,010
Day told me about what you asked him.

407
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,330
How did you feel about that?

408
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,980
I felt like...

409
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,860
I was really stupid.

I don't know whether your feelings are the same as mine.

You're making my clothes wrinkle.

Will your parents

429

dislike people who are not dressed neatly?

430
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:27,720
You're worrying too much.

00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,580
I'm hungry.

499
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,290
Let's eat.

500
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,310
Kim.

501
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,180
Why are you staring at me? What's wrong?

502
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,650
So... will you accept us, Dad?

503
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,520
You must get an answer out of me, huh?

504
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,070
If my answer was no, would I let him have lunch with us?

505
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,510
Think about it yourself.

506
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,130
Kim.

507
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,610
Stop acting clingy. There are so many people here.

508
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,500
My Dad is the best!

509
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,840
Your love may face many challenges in the future.

510
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,360
But you have to learn to be tolerant.

511
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,360
Okay.

512
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,090
Go and sit properly.

513
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,600
I'm hungry.

514
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,040
Let's dig in?

515
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,810
What's this box?

516
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,310
It's a suit.

517
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,270
Whose is it?

518
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,220
Ours.

519
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,440
Why do we have to dress up like this?

520
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,800
Why is our house so dark?

521
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,610
Isn't it weird?

522
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,930
They probably forgot to turn on the lights.

523
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,770
But it's really dark.

524
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:13,360
What are you worried about? Do you think anyone will be brave enough to enter our house?

525
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,510
I don't know, but it's really weird. Aren't you curious?

526
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:22,880
You're worrying too much.

527
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,810
Wait.

528
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,780
Why is this place so dark?

529
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,660
Where's the light switch?

530
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,370
Mr. Kamol.

531
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:00,850
Mr. Kamol.

532
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,720
Where is everybody? Is this a joke?

533
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,500
No, it's not a joke.

534
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,870
Where's my phone?

535
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,540
Did you take it?

536
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,660
Whose boyfriend is this? So harsh.

537
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,050
He's really strict, sir.

538
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,870
What are you guys playing at? Turn on the lights right now.

539
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,630
Surprise!

540
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,080
Were you surprised?

541
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,650
Congratulations, Kim!

542
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,950
Thank you so much, May.

543
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,020
And congratulations to you too, Mr. Kamol.

544
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:03,840
Thanks.

545
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,780
Congratulations, Boss.

546
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,300
And you too, Kim.

547
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,130
Thank you, Itt.

548
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,120
Congratulations, Boss.

549
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,640
And you too, Kim.

550
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,590
Here, Mr. Kamol.

551
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,730
Thanks.

552
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,770
Congratulations.

553
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,140
Thanks, Baiboon.

554
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,120
I swear.

555
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,580
I'm not really good at this sort of thing.

556
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,910
These guys asked me if they could throw a party.

557
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:49,600
I just gave them my permission.

558
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,020
Thank you.

559
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,360
I was so surprised, I thought you were up to something mischievous.

560
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,660
Thank you, everyone!

561
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,690
Excuse me, Boss.

562
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,960
To celebrate this loving couple, let's all raise our glasses.

563
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,100
Congratulations!

564
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,960
Everyone is very warm and loving.

565
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,870
You are very lucky to have a family like this.

566
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:23,440
It's not just my family.

567
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:25,990
Everyone here...

568
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,260
is also your family.

569
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,760
I really want to celebrate with you in private right now.

570
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,530
Guys, the couple is planning to leave! They must be thinking of going straight to their bedroom.

571
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,060
Lop.

572
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:50,850
Yes, sir.

573
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:52,700
Are you making fun of me?

574
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,960
Why don't I arrange a marriage for the three of you?

575
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,720
He likes it! I bet he does.

576
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,290
Those three...

577
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,930
Don't worry about it, you're still young.

578
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:25,570
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

579
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,450
Come on, Kiss! Sir!

580
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,110
Come on, Boss! Hurry up!

581
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,140
Come on, Kim.

582
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,100
I have nothing to do with this.

583
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,470
They're making a scene.

584
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:35,970
Hurry up!

585
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:43,830
So sweet!

586
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:09,840
Kim.

587
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,980
Yes?

588
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,380
About our marriage,

589
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,150
if you want to...

590
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,340
No need. I don't need anything else as long as I have you.

591
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,280
I feel that the two of us must stay together for a long, long time.

592
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,090
You...

593
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,100
If forever exists...

594
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,100
[Unforgotten Night]

595
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,110
I hope that we'll be together forever.

596
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,250
I also want to be with you forever.

597
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:40,680
From now on,

598
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,560
we belong to each other.

599
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,090
Yes.

600
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:56,430
♫I don't know if you're going to believe it or not♫

601
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:04,920
♫I just realized what love is the day I met you♫

602
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:13,520
♫The first time our eyes met, when we're only a breath apart♫

603
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:20,060
♫You're the one I'm looking for♫

604
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,930
We'll have each other from now and forever.

605
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:29,920
Tonight...

606
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,260
is this what you want?

607
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,270
I'm deliberately tempting you this much. If you still refuse...

608
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,680
wouldn't that be a bit too mean?

609
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,600
I won't let you go.

610
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:48,870
Kim.

611
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,580
Let's go.

612
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:54,070
Where should we go?

613
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,500
I'm bored of the bedroom.

614
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:05,210
[THE END]
