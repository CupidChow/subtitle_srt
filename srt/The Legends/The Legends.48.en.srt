[Episode 48]

3
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,870
Miss Lin, I've heard much about you.

4
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,920
Luo Mingxuan?

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,420
Precisely.

6
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,730
Miss Lin, you previously told me that cooperation requires trust.

7
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,240
Jinxian's return is the greatest secret in our Immortal Sect.

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,450
You must not disclose it to others.

9
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,170
Miss Lin, please have a seat.

10
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,480
No need.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,810
Whatever you have to say, just say it.

12
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,110
All right. Since Miss Lin is a straight talker, I won't beat around the bush.

13
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,130
I wonder if you would be willing, Miss Lin, to lay down

14
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,920
the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,630
Miss Lin, if you are willing to donate the Liuhe Tianyi Sword to Jin Xian,

16
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,790
our Immortal Sect will do its best to repay you.

17
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,980
I wonder how Jin Xian would repay me.

18
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,430
Killing Lu Zhaoyao and Li Chenlan.

19
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,120
You don't want me to?

20
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,090
A gentleman has one word...

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,540
...wild horses can't take it back.

22
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,570
I hope you will fulfill your promise soon.

23
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,750
Jin Xian, then how should we proceed from now on?

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,850
Notify each of the Immortal Sects' Leaders. We'll assemble and discuss how to deal with the Wan Lu Sect.

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,880
But ever since everybody thought that... at Lu Zhaoyao's hand, you...

26
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,770
After that, each of the Immortal Sects have been fending for themselves,

27
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,340
as fragmented as sand. I'm afraid that at the appointed time, each may harbor different feelings.

28
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,060
It wouldn't go well.

29
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,630
At present in Jianghu, it is widely spread that the Xu Zong Sect was destroyed by the Wan Lu Sect.

30
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,260
We need only sit back and wait for news; we'll take advantage and strike.

31
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,530
Naturally, all the people will be unified against the Wan Lu Sect.

32
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,680
Sister Ziyu, you are finally back.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,430
Where's your Liuhe Tianyi Sword?

34
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,780
- You didn't--
- Xiao Ai!

35
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,010
Remember.

36
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,890
We are in the Immortal Sect, there are some decisions that can't be avoided.

37
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,840
- But... I...
- Don't ask me anymore.

38
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,340
Just remember. T Wan Lu Sect

39
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,540
will soon have big trouble.

40
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,180
What big trouble?

41
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Lu Zhaoyao and Li Chenlan are both going to lose their life.

42
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,690
Why is parting from this world always so hurried?

43
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,560
There was not even time to say a proper farewell.

44
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,800
I'd like to drink a pot of wine with him.

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,110
I don't want to have sad days.

46
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,520
I'll be drunk today and then let it go.

47
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,570
I persuaded you to go seek medicine

48
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,450
and it became a push to your death.

51
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,570
Neither of us was ever able to predict events in this life.

52
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,880
We've always been played by fate to this point.

53
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,560
Don't blame yourself.

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,820
If anyone's to blame, it's me.

55
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,290
How come Qianjin's not here? Is she feeling unwell?

56
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,880
Ever since she came back, Miss Shen's been spending all days either in the kitchen, making custard cakes;

57
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,500
or in Master's bedroom, drinking tea.

58
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,450
She won't talk nor listen to anyone.

59
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,730
Now she's probably in Master's bedroom.

60
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,960

that a Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sects will be held on Phoenix Mountain.

We'll discuss together the extermination of the Xu Zong Sect.

92
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,060
I heard that Gu Hanguang was killed in the Xu Zong Sect as well.

93
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,790
I wonder if you have any clue.

94
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,210
Not at all.

95
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,980
At present, Jianghu is facing a new storm. South Hill Master, too...

96
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,970
Senior Sister, back then you destroyed your power.

97
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,670
Now, it's like this. Do you regret it?

98
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,620
I've never regretted it.

99
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,470
Then, I'll just take leave.

100
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:02,190
[Prescription note - Qianjin occasionally has heart palpitations... can reduce...]

101
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,510
After checking the corpse we brought back from the Xu Zong Sect, have you found the cause of death?

102
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,990
The life was drained.

103
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,170
Looking at the method of the crime, it loos like Jiang Wu's doing. Except...

104
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,370
It wasn't Jiang Wu.

105
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,320
I think so, too.

106
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,200
Jiang Wu's style is extremely rampant.

107
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,130
He wouldn't destroy a sect without making a sound.

108
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,040
Could it be an internal act in the Xu Zong Sect?

109
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,350
There is no way to know this. After all, Jiang He is dead now.

110
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,640
I only have a conjecture. In the Xu Zong Sect they used blades very sparingly.

111
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,020
Hanguang was also Jiang He's junior in apprenticeship.

112
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,820
Though they had been apart for many years,

113
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,250
their brotherly affection was still there.

114
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,890
Jiang He would not have willingly thrown Hanguang in the dungeons.

115
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,940
So, I reckon that the one who injured Hanguang

116
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,300
made Jiang He throw his junior into the dungeons and destroyed the Xu Zong Sect

117
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,560
should be the same person.

118
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,520
Mo Qing, are you feeling any better?

119
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,610
Not too bad.

120
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,420
Today. it seems my inner demon is not too agitated.

121
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,300
I have a grasp on how to suppress it.

122
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,330
See. I told you everything would get better.

123
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,590
I'm the one who made you all worry.

124
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,160
What were you talking about a moment ago?

125
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,430
Hanguang's death is not clear.

126
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,430
We are just investigating this matter.

127
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,030
For one thing, we must give Miss Shen an answer.

128
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,810
For another, we'll give an answer to ourselves.

129
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,980
Does the Xu Zong Sect's secret art still exist?

130
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,000
It was never found.

131
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,800
Do you suspect that the Xu Zong Sect's trouble was due to their secret art?

132
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,220
I'll go check right now.

133
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,300
Zhaoyao, I'm a little hungry.

134
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,830
Make something to eat for me.

135
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,570
Deal.

136
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,920
Today, at the Grand Meeting it seemed Sect Leader Chi was preoccupied.

137
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,370
What is it? What is there that cannot be said in front of the crowds

138
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,080
and absolutely required to have us called here?

139
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,620
Everyone, please come in.

140
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,790
Dear comrades, long time no see.

141
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,900
Jin Xian!

142
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,670
- Jin Xian.
- Jin Xian.

143
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,880
Jin Xian, your continuous escapes from death fill me with true admiration.

144
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,400
I suppose that calling us here means you must have a careful plan.

145
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,030
Jin Xiu, your mind's exquisite as usual.

146
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:19,190
That's right. This secret summoning is precisely to uphold Immortal Sect's great justice

147
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,000
in one swoop eradicating the Wan Lu Sect and saving the people of the world from their misery.

148
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,670
Jin Xian is still devoted to all living creatures.

149
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,880
But the present situation is not like it used to be.

150
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,030
You were defeated by Lu Zhaoyao twice.

151
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,030
This greatly contributed to the spread of chaos in Jianghu.

152
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,530
Now, the Wan Lu Sect in addition has Li Chenlan.

153
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,740
Its might has doubled.

154
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,330
Allow me to ask, Jin Xian, how do you plan on eradicating them?

155
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,930
Jin Xiu, are you...questioning my capability?

156
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,420
Jin Xian, your words are too grave. It's just that of all ten major Immortal Sects,

157
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,800
our sects here today are the only ones left with power.

158
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,850
If we were to commit to fighting again, you'd have a way to come out unscathed,

159
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,130
but we would have no way to.

160
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,070
How dare you, Jin Xiu!

161
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,620
We in Wang Xing Sect will pledge with our life to follow Jin Xian.

162
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,000
Su Nan Sect will pledge with our life to follow Jin Xian!

163
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,070
Jin Xian,

164
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,900
Jin Xiu might have been rude, but he does have a point.

165
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,540
The Immortal Sects have suffered too many defeats. I'm afraid

166
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,080
we can't afford any more unnecessary sacrifices.

167
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,520
What do I need to do to make you all believe in my power again?

168
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,900
Have you heard of New Mountain's Jiang Wu?

169
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,520
It is said that he was the one who wiped out the Xu Zong Sect.

170
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,870
If you take action against him and get rid of this source of evil,

171
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,130
my Tian Xuan Sect, of course, will give you full support

172
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,730
in eliminating the Wan Lu Sect.

173
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,020
All right. I shall do as you suggested.

174
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,170
What happened?

175
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,480
Are you all right?

176
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,100
- Hurry. Let's go.
- Sect Leader.

177
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,550
- Sect Leader.
- Sect Leader.

178
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,150
I'll go in alone.

179
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,330
Father. Father! Father!

180
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,920
Father!

181
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,570
Li Chenlan, this place will be your burial ground.

182
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,700
[Grave of Wan Lu Sect South Hill Master - Gu Huichen "Hanguang"]

183
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,400
We said that you'd play with a handicap of three.

184
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,120
[Grave of "Hanguang"]

185
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,960
What is Sister Shen doing?

186
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,580
- Sister...
- Shh!

187
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,530
Let's not disturb her.

188
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,540
I thought we planned to take her out to have fun and relax.

189
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,650
Let's just leave her alone.

190
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,460
[Grave of Wan Lu Sect South Hill Master - Gu Huichen "Hanguang"]

191
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,310
You're quite good at this.

192
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:05,240
You and Li Chenlan are both so busy. At least I can make myself useful.

193
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,750
You've grown up, girl.

194
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,890
Have you visited Qianjin lately? How is she?

195
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,690
She... I see her at South Hill Master Gu's s grave every day

196
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,410
playing chess with herself.

197
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,340
By the way, Demoness, if you're worried about her, why don't you visit her?

198
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,770
Gu Hanguang died to get medicine for Mo Qing.

199
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,470
Until I find the murderer, I'm too ashamed to face her.

200
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,800
[Pure Wave Palace]

201
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,870
Li Chenlan, come to Fengmo Mountain tomorrow to have a showdown with me.

202
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,940
The victor owns Lu Zhaoyao. The loser will leave his life there.

203
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,690
Jiang Wu.

204
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,610
Mo Qing, what were you burning?

205
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,000
Nothing important. It's just a secret letter from the Dark Guards.

206
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,570
- Have they found a way to eradicate your Demon Essence?
- No.

207
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,340
The Dark Guards reported that Lin Ziyu was spotted in Phoenix Mountain.

208
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,260
Mo Qing, from now on, leave the trivial matters to Zhiyan.

209
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,380
She seems to be doing a great job. We don't have to worry at all.

210
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,560
You'll just need to recuperate properly.

211
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,890
All right. As you wish.

212
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,890
The moon is beautiful tonight. Let's go moongazing.

213
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,180
Mo Qing, do you like it?

214
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,010
Yes. Make another.

215
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,720
- I'll make a dragonfly.
- Make a butterfly again.

216
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,170
Why?

217
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,200
I love things that come in pairs.

218
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,740
What a coincidence. I love things that come in pairs, too.

219
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,850
You're mine. No one can take you away.

220
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,220
You aren't crazy yet?

221
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,620
Rubbish.

222
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,300
I'll take you to a place.

223
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,540
Do you remember what this is?

224
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,120
That year you were sealed by the old Demon King here.

225
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,940
Can you feel the pain from back then?

226
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:44,020
Li Chenlan, you and I are now done.

227
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,600
Mo Qing?

228
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,690
Sima Rong, do you know where Mo Qing went?

229
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,240
In Wu'e Hall, I didn't see him. I was just coming to look for him in Pure Wave Palace.

230
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,500
I haven't seen him all day. The Wanjun Sword isn't there, either.
He must have gone out.

231
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
Why wouldn't he tell me anything?

232
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,960
Don't panic. Just consider what kind of thing

233
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,570
Chenlan wouldn't be willing to discuss with you.

234
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,680
You owed me a life.

235
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,990
You wouldn't give it; I took it myself.

236
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,580
Starting today, all that you owe me,

237
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,930
I'll take it back piece by piece with my own hand.

238
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,290
Mo Qing, what were you burning?

239
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,580
Nothing important. It's just a secret letter from the Dark Guards.

240
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,020
Zhaoyao?

241
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,540
I think he probably went looking for Jiang Wu.

242
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,510
Arrogant!

243
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,640
Look first at whose place this is.

244
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,890
If I'm arrogant, it's fine.

245
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,700
If you're arrogant, you just have to die!

246
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,770
Let's go!

247
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,110
- Go.
- Ah Wu.

248
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,670
- Let's go together.
- Go!

249
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,800
I'm telling you to leave!

250
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,410
When Lu Zhaoyao wields this sword, I think it's quite pretty.

251
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,400
Somehow when you hold it, you look like a sissy.

252
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,200
Then come try it.

253
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,880
The more you struggle, the more it will counterattack you.

254
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,770
Son, listen to me.

255
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,240
Jiang Wu from New Mountain.

256
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,140
Your arrogance and your true strength

257
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,490
don't match each other at all.

258
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,400
Who is this?

259
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,680
It's me.

260
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,190
What are you doing here?

261
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,710
