[The Legends]

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,790
[Episode 14]

3
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,190
Tricks of the world: The vain is the truth,

4
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,270
and the truth is vain. What the eyes see is a mere fabrication.

5
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,140
This illusion is not in the setting. It is on me.

6
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,200
Liuhe Tianyi.

7
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,560
This old ward has been guarding here for so many years,

8
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,380
yet it is the first time I see such a young man break through the illusion trap.

9
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,100
Not many people are willing to chop their own body to get a sword.

10
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,540
Who are you?

11
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,090
I am the guardian of the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

12
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,470
But these past many years, I'd become a gravedigger for youths like you.

13
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,740
Kid, you are still young.

14
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,140
Don't be confounded by empty glory and power.

15
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,340
You still have a chance to leave now.

16
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,010
To the Liuhe Tianyi Sword, there is but this iron cast road.

17
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,410
Magic can't be used on the island. You can only walk your way through.

18
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,810
Then on the iron cast path, at every step, you will bear the pain of lightning.

19
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,720
On both sides, there is a bottomless precipice.

20
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,380
If you fall, there are countless deadly triggers. Kid!

21
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,030
A thousand bolts of lightning or a ten-thousand-foot fall

22
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,220
could not stop me from taking the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

23
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,900
Fine. Then I will be watching from the opposite side.

24
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,450
Madness! You dare cut off the iron road.

25
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,800
Don't you know that no-one will come again?

26
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,380
And you will have no way back!

27
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,220
My way back is not up to you.

28
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,940
You lost.

29
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,000
I was wrong indeed. At this age,

30
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,210
being deprived of power, you still retain such skills.

31
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,040
The Liuhe Tianyi is Heaven's Sword. It can slay the evil in the world.

32
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,590
All who came for the sword were Jianghu's highest masters.

33
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,560
In the end, they all chose to renounce. Do you know why?

34
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,140
All who take Heaven's Sword must die by Heaven's Sword.

35
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,020
Today, the Liuhe Tianyi Sword is still here.

36
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,590
It's not because they lacked skills, but because the human heart is weak.

37
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,140
The importance of life is not living or dying.

38
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,510
I'm willing to perish for my madness, even if I'm burned to ashes.

39
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,560
I never thought that by extracting the sword, I would actually meet you.

40
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,940
This... This dark vapor...

41
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,380
So that's how it is.

42
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,560
In this world, whoever pulls out the Liuhe Tianyi Sword

43
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,860
can take it away. Except for you.

44
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,030
Demon essence is in your heart. Your nature mutually clashes with Heaven's Sword.

45
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,350
Today, I die here.

46
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,630
A day will come when you must die by the Sword of Heaven.

47
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,810
Mutually clashing?

48
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,250
Qin Zhiyan, wake up!

49
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,810
Hurry up!

50
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,320
Wake up! Hey! Rise and run!

51
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Wake up! Wake up!

52
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,960
Still not waking up?

53
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,760
Jiang Wu is going to take you home and make you the mistress of the fort.

54
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,020
Still not waking?

55
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,320
Let's go!

56
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,660
If you don't go now... by night time we'll just...

57
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,310
we'll just be stuck here even worse!

58
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,300
What a pain! What a pain!

59
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,580
This woman sleeps like a pig!

60
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,380
Liu Cangling doesn't want you anymore.

61
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,270
Why? What happened?

62
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,140
You're finally awake.

63
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,870
Demoness! I was really scared to death!

64
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,150
My head is hurting so much.

65
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,850
Your head hurts? I'm afraid that very shortly it won't just be your head hurting.

66
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,650
This... This is Jiang Wu's place!

67
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,090
- Xiao En, you're back?
- Ah Wu!

68
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,430
You brought so many people from the Immortal Sects again.

69
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,120
How's that? Aren't I good?

70
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,410
Very well!

71
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,720
What are you staring at?

72
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,410
Quick, go hide on the other side of the window. In a while, I'll draw Jiang Wu away, then you come back.

73
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,040
Tomorrow, in the daylight, when my body's concealed, we'll think of a way to leave.

74
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,760
Hurry!

75
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,390
Little Beauty! Are you sobered up?

76
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,250
Little Beauty?

77
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm awake. My alcohol tolerance is low, I passed out with one cup.

78
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,660
If I'd known, I wouldn't have made you drink wine.

79
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,640
How stuffy is that blanket? Come out and keep me company for a while.

80
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,960
I have some food prepared for you. Be quick about it!

81
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,600
All right, I'll be right there.

82
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,260
You all, behave!

83
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,210
Hurry, to the dungeons!

84
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,620
- Let go!
- Behave!

85
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,330
- Don't move!
- Walk on!

86
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,670
Go!

87
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,860
- Let go!
- Hurry!

88
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,720
Go!

89
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,270
- Walk on!
- Quick!

90
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,060
Sit.

91
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,830
Little Beauty, I got something to discuss with you.

92
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,600
Talk. What is it?

93
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,760
Be my woman.

94
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,060
Your proposition... sounds pretty interesting.

95
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,540
[Wu'e Hall]

96
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,910
Sister Ziyu, Ah Da was ordered to watch over Qin Zhiyan.

97
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,610
Now, Ah Da is injured. Qin Zhiyan's location is unknown.

98
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,910
If the Sect Leader starts asking...

99
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,470
Qin Zhiyan's movements are erratic. No need to heed her.

100
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,040
At present we can only wait for Ah Da to wake up.

101
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,220
We'll ask him what happened, then we can make a move.

102
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,300
Yes.

103
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,630
I think being my woman would be extremely interesting.

104
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,060
Would it? It's just too bad

105
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,990
that I'm nobody's woman. I'm only myself.

106
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,370
Impudent, arrogant Qin Zhiyan.

107
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,360
I like you exactly like this, not knowing the limits between the sky and the land.

108
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,620
Knowing limits... do you?

109
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,550
Amusing. You're truly amusing.

110
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:27,030
I'm not forcing you. I want to slowly tame you.

111
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,920
Then, you have to put in some effort.

112
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,930
What's the fun in only eating? How about we play a game?

113
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,470
Fine.

114
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,050
- Let us go! Let us go!
- Be quiet!

115
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,390
- If you don't shut up, we'll kill you!
- Let us go!

116
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,120
Be quiet! Be quiet!

117
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,580
Oh no! Demoness doesn't know I was brought in here.

118
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,390
What to do?

119
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,670
- ♪ 2 good brothers... 9 puzzle rings... 8 immortals hands...
- ♪ 2 good brothers... 5 beats all... Six, six, six!

120
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,630
You lost!

121
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,760
Willing to bet; admit defeat!

122
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,990
It's almost daylight.

123
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,320
Enough, enough, I'm done bullying you.

124
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,250
- I'm going back to sleep.
- Don't!

125
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,150
I've got a game that's even more stimulating. I'll take you to see it.

126
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,940
Not interested.

127
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,260
Little Beau---

128
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,610
It's really weird. I'm so happy even after I lost.

129
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,120
Zhiyan?

130
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,930
Zhiyan?

131
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,080
Zhiyan?

132
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,310
Strange. Where did that girl go?

133
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,580
- Let us go! Let us go! What are you doing?
- Be quiet!

134
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,150
- Be quiet! Shut up!
- Let us go!

135
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,800
- Let us go!
- Be quiet! Can't you hear?

136
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,050
What are you doing?

137
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,890
Silence!

138
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,120
- Let us go! Let us go!
- Shut your mouths!

139
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,290
Shut up!

140
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,420
Today, your master, me, is in a good mood. Let's play first.

141
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,710
Let us go!

142
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,000
Jiang Wu! You are impudent!

143
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,200
Where did that Qin Zhiyan run to?

144
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,300
I've looked all around and I haven't seen her.

145
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,200
She usually has no smarts, but when she hides, she's quite thorough.

146
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
This time we caught a lot of Immortal Sects disciples.

147
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
They're all locked in dungeons. Ah Wu even commended me.

148
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm rather worried about publicity. It will make Ah Wu into a target for all.

149
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Doesn't matter. Ah Wu is so strong.

150
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,100
Dungeons? Will it be...?

151
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,200
What is it? Not a fun game?

152
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Refrain from insulting us!

153
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
So what if I humiliate you?

154
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,000
So what if I humiliate you? How come you're so chatty?

155
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Jiang Wu, you are going too far!

156
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,700
What are you doing?

157
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,000
How childish. He'll play such a babyish game.

158
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Jiang Wu? What do you want to do?

159
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Jiang Wu!

160
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
The smell of anger.

Only,

162
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,200
what I like even better is the smell of fear.

163
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,700
What are you doing?

164
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,000
Demon Jiang Wu! A man may be killed, but not dishonored!

165
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,400
Either you kill us or chop us, do whatever you like.

166
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
Kill us or chop us, make a choice!

167
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,000
Come! Come! Jiang Wu!

168
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,700
All right.

169
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,600
Then, let's get serious.

170
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Come!

171
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,700
Little Beauty?

172
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Why are you here?

173
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,100
How did you get locked here?

174
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Demoness! I...

175
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm here! Didn't you say you weren't interested?

176
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
I'd always thought your idiocy had a limit.

177
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,600
I never expected you to go beyond my imagination.

178
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,800
Since you came to my turf, you have to follow my rules.

179
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Even if you're a little beauty, you can't be an exception.

180
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,810
Play a game with them, yeah?

181
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,900
Today, from this cell,

182
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,200
only one person can come out alive. I'll give you one hour's time.

183
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,400
What are you saying? What rotten game are you playing?

184
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
Save me!

185
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I'll count to three. Everybody, get ready to start!

186
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,800
Don't panic. I'll think of a way.

187
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I'll thing of a way. Don't panic!

188
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,100
One!

189
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,000
Think of a way!

190
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,100
Only one person can get out.

191
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,000
Two!

192
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,900
Only one person can get out.

193
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,900
Right!

194
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,700
Three.

195
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Quick, go near the door!

196
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,700
Aren't you going?

197
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
I had never seen such a bloody scene.

198
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,800
I had never met such a foolish partner.

199
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,400
I thought that the Sword Tomb was my life's rock bottom.

200
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,800
Who'd have thought that, actually, you are.

201
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,000
One Jianghu, over 800 sects, myriads of people...

202
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
How did I end up meeting you?

203
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
Even my life is linked to yours.

204
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,500
- What a headache!
- Demoness...

205
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,300
Demoness! Why don't we run?

206
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,600
I think if this goes on, I'll die of fright.

207
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,200
You think I don't want to run?

208
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Wait. Wait and see if someone comes to save you.

209
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,800
Who'll come and save me?

210
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Your uncle!

211
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,800
Right! Uncle!

[Thousand Dust Pavillion]

Suyu.

214
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,000
- Pavillion Master.
- Is Suyan healthy?

215
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
Senior Brother's wound is almost healed.

216
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,100
But he is still in a sulk over Jiang Wu's escape.

217
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
Jiang Wu's true strength is not to be underestimated.

218
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,800
Tell him there is no need to take it to heart.

219
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
Yes.

220
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,770
Pavillion Master, there is a message through the pigeon.

221
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,800
Uncle, I've been imprisoned outside Jiangzhou, in Jiang Wu's residence. Come rescue me quickly. Zhiyan.

222
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,700
You've been here with me for two days and you still won't change your mind?

223
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,480
Didn't I say it? You want me to work for others. This can't be changed.

224
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,800
But... you could work for me.

225
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,700
What makes you think you are in the position to discuss conditions with me?

226
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,620
My confidence.

227
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,000
Ah Wu! Qin Qianxian's here!

228
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,900
Qin Qianxian?

229
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll have a look.

230
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Hide well.

231
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,400
All right.

232
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,600
Little Monster?

233
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,000
Qin Qianxian and Li Chenlan are both here.

234
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Little Beauty, you make it pretty lively.

235
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,200
Master, how did you come back so soon from getting the sword?

236
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
Why would you be entangled with Jiang Wu?

237
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,100
Where's Ah Da?

238
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,100
That's a long story.

239
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Strange. How can he push me so much in a corner?

240
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Master Qin, today you came in a rush and I didn't prepare a gift for you.

241
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,800
In the future, I won't let you return empty-handed.

242
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Leader Li.

243
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,500
Where is Jiang Wu?

244
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
That was not Jiang Wu himself, but merely a puppet.

245
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,100
The Puppet Art?

246
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,600
This Jiang Wu acts so extravagantly,

247
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,000
but he's also rather cautious.

248
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
I'd really like to go back to Wan Lu Sect.

249
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
But right now, there is no way to call Zhiyan out and go away together.

250
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,000
If I make her go back such a long way by herself,

251
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,400
she might get into some accident on the road. It seems I have to wait until daylight again.

252
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,200
Let's go. Come back to Wan Lu Sect with me.

253
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Wait!

254
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,600
I haven't seen my uncle in such a long time, I want to catch up with him!

255
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,300
Catch up?

256
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,000
You want to go back to Thousand Dust Pavillion with me?

257
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,100
No, no. I see it's so late. Let's depart tomorrow, yes?

258
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Sit, sit. Come on. Sit.

259
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,100
Have a seat! Here.

260
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,620
Don't keep quiet!

261
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,500
It's a little awkward.

262
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,600
It's over. I'll go make some tea for you.

263
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
Sounds like there's no movement.

264
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
I'll go have a look.

265
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,500
Forget it. I'll wait for Demoness to come and call me.

266
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,760
Ah Wu! Ah Wu, are you hurt?

267
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,270
It's nothing. A small matter.

268
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,650
What about the wound those men from Thousand Dust Pavillion gave to your puppet's body?

269
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,810
That wound can't hurt me.

270
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,440
Qin Qianxian, Li Chenlan...

271
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,510
Today's insult, one day I'll return it twofold.

272
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,650
Sorry.

273
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,220
Luckily I held on; otherwise, I'd have been caught.

274
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,650
I got things in the room. I'll gather them a moment.

275
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,730
You have the nerve to sleep! Get up, quick!

276
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,210
Demoness, how's it going outside?

277
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,310
Where's Jiang Wu?

278
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,980
What happened after my uncle arrived?

279
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,260
Li Chenlan arrived, too.

280
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm starting to turn transparent. Gather up everything and go out.

281
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,950
Go back to Wan Lu Sect, but tell Li Chenlan to call for a coach to go.

282
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,370
I also have to call for a coach?

283
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,940
Right! So I can go back with you two.

284
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,090
Hurry up. Don't make them wait too long, or they'll get suspicious.

285
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,890
Go!

286
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,890

287
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,090
Did you gather up everything?

288
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,220
I... still want to go back to Wan Lu Sect.

289
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,880
You have your ideas. It is not my place to interfere.

290
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,670
Since you are fine, I'll go back to Thousand Dust Pavilion.

291

In my opinion, this uncle of yours

295
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,380
doesn't sound at all like he doesn't believe you, as you said. He's quite good to you.

That way the scenery outside will be very nice to enjoy.

303
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,960
Just say you want it, that's enough. What's all that rubbish?

304
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,060
Let's go. We'll call for a coach.

305
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,630
Keep up!

306
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,230
Why are you so afraid of him?

307
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,330
He's very scary!

308
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,810
Good for nothing.

No-No... Master, Ah Da did his best. It wasn't his fault.

00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,820
I know my wrongdoing; Sect Leader, please administer the punishment.

322
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,340
Go stand at the wall for a time; leave matters of the Dark Guards to Ah Da for the moment.

323
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,420
Sect Leader, Wan Lu Sect is going through a critical moment.

324
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,870
I have been checking about Yuan Jie colluding with the Immortal Sects.

325
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,130
I'm ready to make up by eliminating Yuan Jie and then go in meditation.

326
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,890
No need. This matter will be seen to by someone else.

327
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,020
You're dismissed. Have Ah Da come in.

328
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes, Sir.

329
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,220
The Sect Leader wants you inside.

330
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,580
Sister Ziyu!

331
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,400
- The Captain's here! Captain!
- Sister Ziyu!

332
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,060
- Captain! Captain!
- Captain!

333
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,750
Did the sect leader punish you?

334
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,630
I didn't get an excessive punishment. He's just having me rest for a few days.

335
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,760
But for a while I can't be on duty at the Wu'e Hall.

336
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,690
For the moment, you'll all follow Ah Da's instructions.

337
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,260
What?

338
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,330
That is to say that Sect Leader removed you from your post and gave it to Ah Da?

339
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,070
But why would Sect Leader do that?

340
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,720
For a little girl from the Immortal Sect, he'd actually turn-

341
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,400
Enough!

342
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:37,860
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

343
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:43,920
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

344
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

345
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,490
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

346
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:58,890
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

347
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:06,430
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

348
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:13,830
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

349
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:21,370
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

350
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:32,450
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

351
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:52,050
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

352
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,880
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

353
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,370
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

354
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:06,390
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

355
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:12,920
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

360
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:51,420
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

361
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:58,860
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

362
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:06,420
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

363
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:17,400
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
