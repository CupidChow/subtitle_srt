[Episode 42]

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,380
Seventeen!

4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,080
Seventeen! Hurry, wake up!

5
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,910
The Wan Lu Sect is in trouble!

6
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,000
Chenlan, Jiang Wu has cast a spell on these cell doors.

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,740
Based on our current strength, it's unlikely that we can get them open.

8
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,100
What I'm most worried about now is her health.

9
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,600
Don't worry. Zhaoyao will take care of herself.

10
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,350
With her character, Jiang Wu will have a rough time.

11
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,400
Ah Rong, isn't Qin Qianxian's power the only way

12
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
to make the Heart Lotus blossom?

13
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,500
Do you have another idea?

14
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,440
- I heard that the Wan Lu Sect was taken over by Jiang Wu.
- Yes.

15
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,920
We'd really underestimated that Jiang Wu. Who'd have thought? Not even the Jianxin sect had had the best of the Wan Lu sect.

16
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,590
Instead, it was taken over by this new demon.

17
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,450
Right. This Jiang Wu is really lucky.

18
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,420
He managed to catch the time when Li Chenlan's power was weak.

19
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,750
The Wan Lu Sect changed hands in one day. Li Chenlan was marrying Lu Zhaoyao and became a prisoner.

20
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,310
This world's affairs really are inconstant!

21
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,100
Miss, please stop there.

22
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,320
You're dismissed.

23
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,050
- Yes!
- Yes!

24
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,820
I know why you came here. I'm taken aback at this outcome, too.

25
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,750
But you need not fret. Let a few days pass. I have my own ways to take down Jiang Wu.

26
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,770
I can't wait that long.

27
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,710
Li Chenlan is in the dungeons now, and it's uncertain whether he's dead or alive. I must go check.

28
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,960
Since Li Chenlan was defeated, if you go to the Wan Lu Sect now,

29
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,900
it's like an ant trying to stop a coach. Not only will you die,

30
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,450
you'll also ruin the grand plan.

31
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,130
All right. Then do tell! What is this grand plan you're talking about?

32
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,490
At the moment I can't tell you, yet. What you have to do is just wait.

33
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,190
Wait?

34
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,800
I've only ever wanted Li Chenlan.

35
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,360
For him, I've been staying here, compromising again and again. But what's the result?

36
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,600
Leaving aside whether Lu Zhaoyao died or not, now even Li Chenlan's life is at risk.

37
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,050
[Kindness, Justice, Propriety, Wisdom, Faith]

38
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,060
You Immortal Sect people are really disgusting.

39
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,700
Father! Father! You know that the Wan Lu Sect...?

40
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,320
- I know already.
- I have to--

41
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,970
Cangling! Cool down first.

42
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,120
Remember. You must not act on impulse.

43
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,620
Jiang Wu occupied the Wan Lu Sect; Lu Zhaoyao, Li Chenlan, and the Hill Masters were all taken as prisoners.

44
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,980
With our current strength in the Jianxin Sect, how can we help?

45
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,450
We... can only watch?

46
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,260
Hold our strength, keep a low profile, and then be ready to seek an opportunity.

47
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,950
Seek an opportunity?

48
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,880
But our saviors are at peril and we won't save them, is this the right way?

49
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,300
Father, I really don't understand now.

50
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,210
The Wan Lu Sect acts arrogantly but have saved many people.

51
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,830
The Immortal Sects uphold justice but hurt many people.

52
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,110
So, what is right and what is wrong? What is black and white?

53
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,500
The justice we uphold in the Immortal Sect, what kind of justice is it?

54
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,370
Cangling, your heart is confused.

55
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,080
For these few days don't push yourself anymore.

56
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,330
Calm your heart. Look carefully for the answer.

57
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,220
You're planning to keep me captive?

58
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,490
Lame. Either just kill me,

59
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,440
or let me go. What did you capture me for?

60
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,810
- Because I like yo--
- I don't like you.

61
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,190
Lu Zhaoyao, I let Li Chenlan live

62
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,230
in deference to you.

63
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:51,560
From now on, you have to remember your place every moment; you are one of my people.

64
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,700
Yes, you're formidable. But, Little Red Hair,

65
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,240
also, remember. I'm not one of yours.

66
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,100
I don't belong to you. And I don't belong to him.

67
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,700
I only belong to myself.

68
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,640
Who you belong to now... is up to me.

69
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,340
Young lord, what matter has you worried and sad?

70
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,860
I'm sad that my life is like this lake water.

71
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,950
I don't know which direction to go.

72
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,160
How can it not know? All the waters in the world go towards the sea.

73
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,230
All the people in the world, too, go towards death.

74
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,660
Old man, you instead see everything through.

75
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,350
It's only that now I'm like a drop in the ocean.

76
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,550
My mind is unclear.

77
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,990
What I used to consider just, right, moral,

78
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,480
seems to have been completely overthrown now.

79
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm a humble old man and I don't understand great principles.

80
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,050
I only want to cross through on my boat every day, earn an honest keep, support my family,

81
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,190
and to be able to walk upright here between Heaven and Earth.

82
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,930
Brother Cangling.

83
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,000
Take care.

84
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,700
One day I hope to see Jianxin Sect

85
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,390
rise once more, unchanged in its immortal spirit,

86
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,620
reflecting the pure heart of the world.

87
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,630
To take due responsibility.

88
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,430
That is all the justice within my power.

89
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,820
[Phoenix's Song Hall]

90
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,130
Jiang Wu took control of the Wan Lu Sect all by himself.

91
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,350
He has captured Li Chenlan and Lu Zhaoyao. Everyone has been locked up.

92
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,970
I'm afraid no one can contain this new demon of New Mountain.

93
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,700
Previously, we were working with Jiang Wu.

94
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,010
- Right now...
- What's this noise?

95
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,710
Deacon Chi. Sect Leader Xiong.

96
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,330
Instead of doing your work, you're acting like loose tongue women.

97
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,910
- That's enough! Get back to work!
- Scram!

98
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,580
Yes.

99
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,140
Xiong Tian, don't be too strict.

100
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,420
Jiang Wu took down Wan Lu Sect. This was indeed a surprise.

101
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,510
It's normal for the disciples to discuss it.

102
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,770
Jin Xiu, you still have the brass to come to Mount Phoenix?

103
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,410
Brother Xiong Tian, why would you say that?

104
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,650
Jiang Wu has taken over the Wan Lu Sect. Right now, he holds top position in Jianghu.

105
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:12,140
That's right. It was you who told us that there was a need for checks and balances.

106
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,140
You joined hands with Jiang Wu and harmed Qin Qianxian. That's why Jiang Wu is being so arrogant!

107
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,170
About the attack on the Thousand Dust Pavilion,

108
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,330
didn't your disciples take part in it?

109
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,320
I was waiting for both of you here to discuss the plan to deal with Jiang Wu.

110
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,060
Previously, when he wanted to attack the Wan Lu Sect, we didn't respond.

111
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,290
Given his character, I believe that he'll be holding grudges against us.

112
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,160
Right now, he owns the Wan Lu Sect and we can't underestimate his powers.

113
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,420
If, one day, he acts against us, the Immortal Sects will be ruined, too.

114
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,460
Jiang Wu just took over Wan Lu Sect.

115
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,370
Now, the Wan Lu Sect is a sturdy institution, like a cockroach it may be toppled but it won't die.

116
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,110
As to how things will pan out, nothing is certain yet. Let's see which way the wind blows.

117
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,010
Let's wait and see if there's a need for us to make a move.

118
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,350
What Deacon Chi said makes sense.

119
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,820
Deacon Chi's opinion is indeed a reasonable one.

120
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,740
- But...
- No need to discuss it further.

121
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,630
But there is something that is imminent.

122
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,300
I heard that you held Leader Tang captive in Mount Phoenix.

123
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,740
That is a bit inappropriate.

124
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,050
Right! Why are you holding Tang Yun captive?

125
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,580
Tianxuan Sect doesn't call the shot in Mount Phoenix.

126
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,040
Jin Xiu, you must quickly release Leader Tang.

127
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,450
Why are you shouting?

128
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm just afraid that Jiang Wu will hurt my little Yun Yun.

129
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,700
Judging from the current situation, of course, I won't keep her locked up anymore.

130
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,880
Of course, you have to release Tang Yun. Also, you should quickly leave Mount Phoenix.

131
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,600
After all, this is Jin Xian's former place.

132
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,740
That's right. Mount Phoenix was Jin Xian's place.

133
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,880
Jin Xian should be the one to ask me to leave.

134
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,830
Who are you to voice your opinion here?

135
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,030
Young Lord, Leader Tang wants to see you.

136
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,090
Sect Leaders, I shall take my leave.

137
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,420
How's your rest?

138
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,250
I'll sit with you for a bit.

139
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,460
Lu Zhaoyao, don't you feel curious?

140
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,210
No.

141
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,090
Don't you want to know why I suddenly liked you?

142
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,680
No.

143
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,640
Even so, I'll still tell you.

144
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,160
Then, why don't you cut the crap?

145
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:36,180
Would you believe that someone came into existence because of you?

146
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,580
I believe it; isn't that you?

147
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,750
You already knew?

148
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,410
Qin Qianxian told me already.

149
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,230
Don't you think the current situation is very similar to that day?

150
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,480
- Which day?
- The day you captured Qin Qianxian.

151
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,380
All of you said was that I'm Qin Qianxian's inner demon. As I see it,

152
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,120
Qin Qianxian was just the body housing my soul.

153
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,770
I came to life because of you. I became stronger because Qin Qianxian couldn't resist it.

154
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,660
I grew bigger in his heart. I could control his willpower and led him into an obsession.

155
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,560
During the battle at the Sword Tomb, he stole your body.

156
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,630
He kept you in the ice wall of Mount Su.

157
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,720
I didn't expect him to be chanting every day to purify his heart. In the end, I was cast out of him.

158
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,680
Lu Zhaoyao, have you ever seen a demon that was stripped from a heart?

159
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,680
No one understands an inner demon. Not even I do.

160
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,340
But I realized that there was another power inside me.

161
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,320
I could absorb human fear.

162
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,220
Let us out!

163
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,450
Let us out!

164
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,490
Let us out!

165
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,200
The resentment.

166
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,450
Resign to your fate now, I considered you a brother.

167
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,390
You actually stabbed me in my back?

168
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,590
Also, rage.

169
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,060
Don't you humiliate us!

170
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,890
Let us out.

171
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,150
It's just like devouring the distracting thoughts in Qin Qianxian's heart.

172
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,220
I put these emotions into my body.

173
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,130
Slowly, it made me stronger and I grew bigger.

174
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,010
That's how Jiang Wu appeared before you.

175
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,370
Why are you telling me these things?

176
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,660
I don't care where you came from, and whom you are here for.

177
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,350
I just want you to know that I came into existence because of you.

178
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,700
Little Red Hair, it hasn't been long since you made your debut, and you've only been here in Jianghu for a few years.

179
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,990
You had to go through strenuous efforts to get what you have now.

180
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,550
So perhaps you've never had an elder teach you

181
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,130
that a person shouldn't get too cocky.

182
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,580
I really like you.

183
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,690
Even the angry look on your face is so adorable.

184
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,710
Say that you love me.

185
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,660
I don't!

186
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,800
All right. Be stubborn all you want.

187
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,930
Unless you say you love me, I'll go to the dungeons and kill one of Wan Lu Sect's people each day

188
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,770
until you say you love me.

189
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,680
Jiang Wu!

190
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,380
Get back here.

191
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,060
You made up your mind real quick.

192
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,670
I'm hungry. Get me some food.

193
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,400
- Ah Wu.
- Go get some food.

194
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,660
Ah Wu, I listened to your conversation just now.

195
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,100
Who told you to listen?

196
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,190
No, Ah Wu. I think you're cool in everything else you do.

197
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,200
But not this.

198
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,860
Lu Zhaoyao is open to persuasion, but not to coercion. Your method won't work.

199
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,070
Do you have an idea?

200
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,410
I think you need to prepare the food yourself.

201
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,300
The food that you prepare yourself will be able to touch her heart. This will work with the ladies.

202
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,360
All right. I'll heed your advice.

203
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,710
This will really work?

204
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,620
You make some food for her, then ask her about her health.

205
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,580
Right now, Lu Zhaoyao is surely unable to let go of the Wan Lu sect people.

206
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,980
Use a more carrot and stick. No doubt you can win Lu Zhaoyao over.

207
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,640
Ah Wu, even though we have occupied the Wan Lu Sect,

208
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,550
our manpower is not enough. Even the dungeons are overcrowded.

209
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,630
Then kill them.

210
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,510
Ah Wu, if you're like that, Lu Zhaoyao won't like you.

211
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,760
- Then make them kill each other.
- You still remember,

212
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,480
in the past, the Dark Guards would rather commit mass suicide than kill each other.

213
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,710
Then, let them be overcrowded. If they suffocate to death, it's the same.

214
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,720
Mo Qing! Mo Qing!

215
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,350
Mo Qing.

216
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,770
Li Chenlan, you can't beat me now.

217
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,780
In my body, I have Qin Qianxian's power.

218
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,060
In his body,

219
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,320
he has Qin Qianxian's power.

220
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
That is to say

221
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,000
that in Jiang Wu's body there is Qin Qianxian's magic power.

222
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,800
You want to make him help you?

223
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,890
Leaving aside how dangerous this is,

224
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,350
just consider Jiang Wu, he took such pains to obtain Qin Qianxian's power,

225
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,220
how would he ever give it up?

226
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,400
Time waits for no one.

227
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,680
Even if Jiang Wu isn't willing, I must make him agree.

228
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,190
When Zhaoyao explodes for the fifth time,

229
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,460
there will be nothing more to do.

230
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,850
How many times has Zhaoyao exploded until now?

231
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,720
Twice already.

232
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
Have a taste. I grilled it myself.

233
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,190
What is it? Weren't you hungry?

234
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,480
I was hungry before. Now I have no appetite.

235
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,620
Even if you have no appetite, you have to eat.

236
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,670
Being locked in made me lose my appetite. Let me out and I'll eat.

237
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,780
Lu Zhaoyao, about that, there's no room for discussion.

238
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,110
Little Red Hair, how about you and I make a deal?

239
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,550
I don't want to make deals with you now. I only want to have some romance.

240
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,660
You came late. I've already married Mo Qing.

241
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,940
In this life, I'll only have a romance with him.

242
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,330
He hadn't even removed the veil. How can it count as "married"?

243
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,600
In my heart, I've already married him. In my heart, there's only him now.

244
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Imprisoning me like this makes no sense at all.

245
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,500
In my opinion, it makes sense. In my heart now, there's only you.

246
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,950
All I think about is you. All my dreams every night are all of you.

247
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,360
Really?

248
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,920
- Then dig your heart out and let me see.
- Fine!

249
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,060
Smack me one on the lips and I'll dig my heart out.

250
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,790
I smacked with a bit too much strength. Pardon me.

251
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,660
It doesn't matter. I'll put some strength in as well. You pardon me, too.

252
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,720
What kinda trick? Fireworks?

253
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,420
Twice...

254
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,120
The third time!

255
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,300
[Land of Sojourn]

256
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,660
Sister, this is the third time.

257
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,300
I really get weaker every time.

258
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,510
What should we do here?

259
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,910
I'm worried sick! I'm worried sick!

260
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,720
You're here again? I exploded twice, too! What to do?

261
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,760
Is the remedy not ready yet?

262
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,390
Research requires time. There is no time!

263
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,160
If I really die because of that pill,

264
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,770
even as a ghost I won't leave your crooked shop in peace!

265
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,650
I'm afraid by then I'll be a ghost, too!

266
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,890
Sister, Sister! You're so weak. Rest a bit first!

267
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,360
I was just stressing over how to get away from Jiang Wu and now I'm finally out.

268
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,000
Of course, I have to go rescue first.

269
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,930
You're in such a hurry. Who do you want to rescue?

270
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,750
My husband.

271
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,140
Little Niece, where's this?

272
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,780
The Wan Lu Sect's dungeons.

273
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,770
You got drunk and missed it.

274
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,370
The Wan Lu Sect now belongs to Jiang Wu. He locked all of us in.

275
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,020
Then, what about Sect Leader?

276
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,240
She's captive.

277
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,980
No one can think to lock me up.

278
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,100
Mo Qing, wait. I'm coming to save you.

279
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,780
You still want to run?

280
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,960
Tell me. Where is Lu Zhaoyao?

281
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,390
Otherwise, I'll just kill you.

282
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,300
Jiang Wu, if you do this, you'll only make Zhaoyao hate you.

283
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,540
I don't care. I only want her to belong to me.

284
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:50,510
Li Chenlan, you think the way you are now is worthy of Lu Zhaoyao?

285
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,640
Zhaoyao never came here.

286
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,130
I don't believe she won't come back.

287
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,860
I'll wait here with you.

288
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,240
Seventeen, can you break your way out?

289
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,920
No problem. Anyway, enchantments are useless on me.

290
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,940
Do your best!

291
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,990
What's with you?

292
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,840
I'm hungry!

293
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,530
I was in a hurry to drink,

294
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,320
I ate too little, and now I have no energy in my body.

295
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,260
Do you have any food on you?

296
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,530
Yes!

297
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,460
How are you? Had enough?

298
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,200
No need to hurry. As I see it, Jiang Wu is so good to Lu Zhaoyao,

299
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,660
who knows, maybe now they're having a chat over tea, all happy and carefree.

300
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,240
That's true.

301
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,290
The Wan Lu Sect has been through so much these past years. As long as we have Sect Leader, for sure there will be no problem.

302
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,550
Right. The Sect Leader being locked up in the dungeons, that has never happened.

303
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,390
Then, you can still be so calm and collected?

304
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,970
Little Monster,

305
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,420
wait. I'm coming to save you.

306
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,460
Looks like Lu Zhaoyao doesn't love you that much.

307
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,790
It's been so long and I haven't seen her get here.

308
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,130
You can still laugh?

309
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm laughing at how your jealousy looks.

310
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,720
Ugly.

311
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,130
Zhaoyao, how are you feeling?

312
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,010
You have thoughts to spare for me? How are you?

313
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,050
In your heart, you really can't let go of him.

314
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,550
I'll just kill him now.

315
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,290
Conceited!

316
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,650
Mo Qing!

317
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,850
Your power is a lot less than it was.

318
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,370
But I like it.

319
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,530
Jiang Wu!

320
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,900
No!

321
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,870
Don't! Mo Qing!

322
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,170
Mo Qing! No!

323
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,820
Zhaoyao...

324
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,440
Speak. Where did they go?

325
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,360
You seized the Wan Lu Sect and you captured the sect leader. With such a might,

326
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,140
if you don't know something, how could I know it?

327
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,840
You can be so irritating with words even with both legs broken.

328
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,700
Do you believe I'll also break your elbows?

329
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,020
As you please.

330
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,520
Fine.

331
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,410
I know you don't fear me.

332
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:12,560
But I hear that the Wan Lu Sect's West Hill Master knows everything in the world without leaving his house.

333
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,570
I think you must know what my favorite game is.

334
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,790
The dungeons are full of your Wan Lu Sect people. If you keep being stubborn,

335
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:44,310
these swords will stab your buddies' hearts. Will you tell me,

336
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,080
or do you want to watch them die? Choose!

337
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,060
The Forbidden Area in the red-stone forest!

338
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,380
What's the point of acting tough? You should be tough in your heart.

339
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,930
Zhaoyao. Zhaoyao!

340
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,340
Zhaoyao! Wake up, Zhaoyao!

341
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,700
Zhaoyao.

342
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,710
Zhaoyao!

343
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,600
♫  One night like a dream, there’s a curse inside my heart ♫

344
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:18,540
♫  One word flies by, suddenly forgetting past worries ♫

345
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:25,650
♫  One thought’s interval, pour out a bowl of wine ♫

346
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,100
Don't be afraid.

347
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,500
Get up. Let's go.

348
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,910
♫ One frown, like magic, unhesitant to receive torture ♫

349
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,060
♫ One leaf makes Autumn, love and hate are groundless ♫

350
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,020
I'm just...

351
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,390
a little tired.

352
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,270
♫ One word, white hair, endless shallow waves, ♫

353
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:57,290
♫ One call, one life romance ♫

354
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,840
I will find a way to save you.

355
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,750
I will!

356
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,280
♫ a thousand times ♫

357
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,670
♫ a lifetime's stake... ♫

358
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,820
Don't worry...

359
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,620
I'm Lu Zhaoyao.

360
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,340
In the past, there was no storm I hadn't seen.

361
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,950
Haven't I always pulled through?

362
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,480
I hope...

363
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,720
that every storm you have to face in the future

364
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,450
will all fall on me.

365
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:23,580
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

366
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,520
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

367
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,980
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

368
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,130
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

369
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:44,490
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

370
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:52,020
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

371
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,280
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

372
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:07,030
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

373
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:18,200
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

374
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:38,630
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

375
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:44,480
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

376
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,050
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

377
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,040
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

378
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,500
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

379
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:07,060
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

380
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:14,410
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

381
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:21,990
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

382
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:29,400
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

383
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,060
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and Earth are shaken  ♫

384
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:44,330
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

385
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:52,110
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

386
00:42:52,110 --> 00:43:03,250
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
