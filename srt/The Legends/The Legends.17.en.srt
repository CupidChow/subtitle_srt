[Episode 17]

3
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,230
Sect Leader, Liu Cangling in Jiangzhou sought out Miss Zhiyan.

4
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,040
How long has it been since Liu Cangling left Jianxin Sect?

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,080
Less than half a month.

6
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,690
Is there any unusual movement in Jianxin?

7
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,640
Not at all.

8
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,720
There's nothing unusual?

9
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,400
For now, go check Jianxin Sect's latest developments.

10
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
Yes, Sect Leader.

11
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,210
If I don't come, will you think you have no injury on your body?

12
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,140
I've been practicing medicine for so many years; those who come begging for treatment are all out to survive.

13
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,680
Today, I can say I opened my eyes.

14
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,510
For the first timem I've seen a fool playing with his life to amuse a girl.

15
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,590
I'm not playing with my life to amuse her.

16
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,930
So, I'm accusing you wrongly.

17
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,820
Your competition with that Immortal Sect woman was actually for exercise.

18
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,880
I was simply rebelling to fate's imposition. I only wanted to wrestle with it for a little bit.

19
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,890
How refreshing.

20
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,120
It is the first time I've heard about this sort of struggle against fate.

21
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,950
I don't care how you struggle. If you die and ruin my reputation as King Yama's Scourge,

22
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,400
I won't let you get away with it.

23
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,580
If I really get snatched by King Yama,

24
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,940
then I will no longer be under your jurisdiction. What can you do to me?

25
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,990
You certainly do not fall under my jurisdiction.

26
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,390
But that woman making you struggle with fate will still be alive.

27
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,920
I'm warning you: if you use your inner energy again

28
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,420
and the wound reopens, I won't be able to treat you.

29
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,100
I don't even know where that girl went. After such a long time, she's still not back yet.

30
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,520
Qin Zhiyan!

31
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,180
I'm tired. I'm going back to sleep.

32
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,890
The little girl now has a temper?

33
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,860
Have you gone soft and want to go with Liu Cangling?

34
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,460
How could that be?

35
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,940
I want to avenge my father with all my heart. You know that.

36
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,190
But you love him.

37
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,940
But his father killed my father.

38
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,500
It's his father who killed your father, it wasn't him who did it.

39
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,990
It's still a rift of bloody vengeance.

40
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,280
Fine. I'm just making sure.

41
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,350
This Liu Cangling, you'd best give up on him.

42
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,740
You two have no future.

43
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,530
The sun's setting. Sima Rong and Li Chenlan are thick as thieves.

44
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,290
In a bit, I'm going to do some small talk. You stay in the room and wrap yourself up.

45
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,820
Demoness, watch your step!

46
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,610
I always have the feeling that Li Chenlan now can see through us.

47
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,400
If you keep provoking him, the good days will be over for you and me.

48
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm provoking? He stole my position,

49
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,650
my sect, my life. I'm just not allowed to take it back?

50
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,030
In Wan Lu Sect, we have no polite interactions.

51
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,780
It was always about one's skills.

52
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,920
West Hill Master.

53
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,730
Miss Zhiyan, can I help you?

54
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,650
I was bored. How about we p—

55
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,360
Playing chess, Miss, you are no match for me.

56
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,310
...get some noodles, or go for a stroll?

57
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,760
I've had dinner. If you're hungry, you can look for another friend

58
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,990
to go out and eat something.

59
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,360
West Hill Master is making fun of me. What friend do I have?

60
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,730
Little Monster!

61
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,300
I only have the person I love!

62
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,500
So, Miss Zhiyan, the person you love is...

63
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,240
My master!

64
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,190
Just as well. You can go and eat something with Chenlan.

65
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,090
Master! When did you get here?

66
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,760
Not long ago.

67
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,760
Let's go.

68
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,210
Master, I was just feeling bored and went to the West Hill Master to have fun.

69
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,540
Let's go out on the streets!

70
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,020
This acting skill is really of one of a kind.

71
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,850
Let's get a candied hawthorn berry first, to nibble on.

72
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,500
Master, the hawthorn skewer you bought is really good.

73
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,080
Zhiyan, do you know what you're doing? Come away with me!

74
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,120
- Let go.
- Let go.

75
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,620
You let go.

76
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,700
Fine! I'll count down from three and you let go together.

77
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,480
Three... two... one...

78
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,950
Li Chenlan, you...

79
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,480
Zhiyan, do you know what you're doing?

80
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,060
Go away.

81
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,720
Zhiyan, you...

82
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,100
Zhiyan, I know you're mad at me.

83
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,400
I thought about it: since you said you're not coming back,

84
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
then I'll come and stay by your side.

85
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,460
Qin Zhiyan, what on earth did you tell him?

86
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Okay, then: you fight him. If you beat him, I'll go with you.

87
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,500
Fine.

88
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,820
You are no match.

89
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,650
Li Chenlan, you...!

90
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,880
But if you want to watch, there's no harm in it.

91
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,850
Li Chenlan, you're going too far!

92
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,240
Today, I'll fight you with my life!

93
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,590
You're amazing, Master!

94
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,700
Again.

95
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,420
What a persistent young man.

96
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,070
You know you stand no chance.

97
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,710
We won't know until the end of the match.

98
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,960
Jianxin Sect is corrupted. But surprisingly, they have a courageous young man like him.

99
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,790
No wonder Zhiyan loves him.

100
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,220
If I make him fight Li Chenlan seriously,

101
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,080
Zhiyan will turn into a dramatic crybaby again if he gets hurt.

102
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,220
That'll be troublesome.

103
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,850
Master, I've got a suggestion. He's no match for you in martial arts.

104
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,310
Let's be fair in case others accuse Wan Lu Sect of bullying him.

105
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,370
Why don't we go for a battle of luck?

106
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,190
Luck?

107
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,670
What's your choice of game, gentlemen?

108
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,490
She just joined Wan Lu Sect not long ago... and you taught her to gamble already?

109
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,850
- Big or Small.
- All right.

110
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,560
But I didn't learn the techniques from him.

111
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,980
- Big or small?
- I'll go for big.
- Small.

112
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,400
It's big! Big!

113
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,010
It's big. This gentleman won.

114
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,760
Again.

115
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Let's have a best of 3. You can go first this time.

116
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
- Big.
- Small.

117
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,340
He lost again.

118
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,970
I didn't do anything.

119
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,570
How about a best of 5?

120
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,780
- He can replace me.
- Me?

121
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,600
All right.

122
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,630
- Big.
- Small.

123
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,440
Thank you.

124
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,830
You're surprisingly unlucky.

125
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,720
One-one. We need another game.

126
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,520
What's next?

127
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,340
How about chess?

128
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,190
I agree.

129
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,910
What's going on?

130
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,480
Chief Sima, we'd like to borrow your chess set.

131
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,730
I don't mind lending you my chess set, but you must allow me to watch it.

132
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,220
How could we say no to that? Join us.

133
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,260
What's going on? Why is Brother Cangling here with Li Chenlan?

134
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,500
Why did Zhaoyao bring him over?

135
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,910
It's over. This is bad. She's too reckless.

136
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,370
This will be a crucial move. You need to think carefully.

137
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,960
If you lose, you must stop bothering her.

138
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,520
People say that life is like a game of chess.

139
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,060
One wrong move leads to another. One careless move and the whole game is lost.

140
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,000
Sometimes, the harder you try, the more hopeless you get.

141
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,990
In life, we're often helpless.

142
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,660
I thought of myself as a chess player,

143
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,200
but it turned out that I was merely a pawn.

144
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,660
But still,

145
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,820
there are things I can't let go of.

146
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,320
"Humans are fortune's fools."

147
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,210
That's just an excuse.

148
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:46,190
It wasn't fate that led you to this. It was your own choice.

149
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,940
You've lost.

150
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,340
[Sima Residence]

151
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,980
It's getting late. Please return, Young Master Liu.

152
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:53,510
[Sima Residence]

153
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,620
Master, you said that there's no such thing as fate...

154
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,560
and that we always have a choice.

155
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,760
What about you? Did you come this far...

156
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,260
because of your own choice?

157
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,510
Was fate not a factor?

158
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,050
It was my own choice.

159
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't believe in fate.

160
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,190
If fate were real, I wouldn't give in to it.

161
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,650
You're so unfriendly towards fate.

162
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,680
That's why you're so unlucky, Master.

163
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,760
I don't need luck.

164
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,220
We haven't had dinner.

165
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,860
Never mind. I'm kind of sleepy now.

166
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,590
Since I got captured by Jiang Wu, I somehow became a sleepyhead.

167
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,010
You should go to Gu Hanguang.

168
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,860
I'm just sleepy. That's all. I shouldn't trouble the genius physician.

169
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,270
Look, Master. The moon is so beautiful tonight. Why don't we...

170
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,520
The weather changed so quickly.

171
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,120
It's a beautiful night indeed. Let's go to another place to see the moon.

172
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,320
Master, you're a busy person.

173
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,140
- I'm not busy.
- I...

174
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,860
Master, is this the Levitation Magic?

175
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,510
What's the matter?

176
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,030
Nothing.

177
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,010
Master, do you have a crush on me?

178
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,650
The moon is really beautiful here.

179
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,990
The moon is beautiful?

180
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,160
So does he like me or not?

181
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,860
Did he see through my deception?

182
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,200
How are you doing in Jiangzhou City?

183
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,860
It's fun in Jiangzhou City.

184
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,400
Then you may extend your stay. You can tell me if you have any problem.

185
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,250
Master, with you by my side, why would I have any problems?

186
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,470
Just say the word and I will help you, no matter what your problem is.

187
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,380
I went to Mount Chenji in order to avenge my father. What do you think I want to do?

188
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,590
There is something unusual going on in Jianxin Sect lately.

189
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,490
I've sent men to investigate. We'll find out soon.

190
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,340
Thank you, Master.

191
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,980
It's so difficult to read Little Monster's mind.

192
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,990
But never mind. I've no time for that.

193
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,860
I have an advantage now.

194
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,340
I won.

195
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,580
All right, you won.

196
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,720
Come.

197
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,930
- Cheers. Mrs. Qin.
- Thank you.

198
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm good, right?

199
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,320
Uncle Liu.

200
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,860
Father. Mother.

201
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,490
Uncle. Aunt.

202
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,160
Sit down.

203
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
I beat Brother Cangling in today's match.

204
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,180
Oh?

205
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,340
Then, it must be Cangling letting you win.

206
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,160
Of course not.

207
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,290
Brother Cangling, hurry and tell them if you went easy on me.

208
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,160
Zhiyan has improved a lot.

209
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,910
Yes, she did improve a lot.

210
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,570
Have more food.

211
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,960
Thank you, Father.

212
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,630
The kids are all grown up.

213
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,390
Brother Liu, is their arranged marriage since young still valid?

214
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,360
Yes. Of course. it's valid.

215
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,890
Brother Qin. Mrs. Qin. Cheers.

216
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,840
Bottoms up.

217
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,180
Eat more.

218
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,620
- Please go ahead.
- Eat.

219
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,430
Thank you, Brother Cangling.

220
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,010
- Please go ahead.
- Eat.

221
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,280
- Zhiyan.
- Let go of me.

222
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,900
- Zhiyan, this matter is suspicious.
- My father would never...
- Shut up!

223
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,670
Your father killed my father right before my eyes!

224
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,720
Why won't anyone trust me?

225
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,790
Zhiyan. Calm down, Zhiyan.

226
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,380
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

227
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,160
The Qin and Liu Families will be sworn enemies.

228
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,320
As this hairpin.

229
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,000
Zhiyan. Zhiyan! Where are you going?

230
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,290
Since no one in the Immortal Sects believes me,

231
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,590
I'll go to Wan Lu Sect... to train in martial arts

232
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,200
so that I can avenge my father!

233
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,850
Zhiyan!

234
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,800
The moon is really beautiful tonight, but it's nowhere comparable to you, Master.

235
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,210
What are you doing?

236
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,700
Demoness, I think that Li Chenlan really likes you.

237
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,770
What nonsense.

238
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,530
I just tested him. He really likes you.

239
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,650
He agreed to investigate Jianxin Sect for you.

240
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,590
Thank you, Demoness.

241
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,670
"What night is this night?"

242
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,360
"At last we are alone. How shall we celebrate?"

243
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,920
Enough.

244
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,860
If you've time for poems, why don't you train yourself?

245
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,650
Demoness, do you think Brother Changling has left the city?

246
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,110
That's none of your business now.

247
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,190
You only need to remember that... the two of you have nothing to do with each other anymore.

248
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,640
You're so indecisive and sentimental.

249
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,790
I have no idea what Li Chenlan likes about you... apart from your face.

250
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,740
Haven't you bullied me enough yet?

251
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,630
I'm so glad.

252
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,200
Glad about what?

253
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,730
You can finally tell that I'm bullying you.

254
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,200
I dare you to bully Li Chenlan instead.

255
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,590
Stop acting all nice and submissive in front of him.

256
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,310
Even if you don't feel embarrassed,

257
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,610
as the person sharing your face, I'm embarrassed.

258
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,820
There's no hurry.

259
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,250
Once I get hold of the Liuhe Tianyi Sword, I will find the opportunity.

260
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,810
You're just in denial. Can you bring yourself to kill him when you're really given the chance?

261
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,990
Why can't I bring myself to kill him?

262
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,950
There's nothing I haven't been through.

263
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,010
I've gone to all the dangerous places in the world.

264
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,820
I dare to do all the things that I wanted to do.

265
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,920
He stole my Wan Jun Sword... and took my life back then.

266
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,670
Why would I not be able to kill him?

267
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,360
I won't hesitate to stab him in his heart... and send him to the Underworld.

268
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,170
I won't even give him a chance to fight back.

269
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't know what happened between the two of you back then.

270
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,240
As for Li Chenlan, I don't know much about him.

271
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,970
But don't say that about yourself.

272
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,440
I don't know how pompous you used to be,

273
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,040
but after all the time we've spent together,

274
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,990
I know you're not a heartless demoness.

275
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,580
It's true that you're a little nasty. But each time I have asked for your help,

276
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,610
even though you speak tough, you always helped me in the end.

277
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,810
I'm cowardly and useless.

278
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,100
Also, often a burden.

279
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,150
But you never treated me with contempt or left me behind.

280
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,820
Demoness,

281
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,430
I believe in you. You're not that kind of a bad person.

282
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,650
They are right about it.

283
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,520
The Lu family from Mount Fengmo (Mount of Sealed Evil)

284
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,290
are so evil, so sinister,

285
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,400
they must be exterminated!

286
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,990
I didn't do wrong.

287
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,130
I'm not evil!

288
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,960
Since leaving Mount Fengmo,

289
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,360
I didn't do wrong and feel no remorse for everything I've said and done!

290
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,490
You're the wrong one!

291
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,610
You are the one who killed the innocent!

292
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,730
You're a man without justice!

293
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,970
It's you who doesn't see your sins!

294
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,630
Back then, I was determined to be a good person.

295
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,380
No one would listen to me.

296
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,270
Now that I've done all the bad things in the world,

297
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,740
a young lady tells me that I'm not a bad person?

298
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,240
People from the Immortal Sects are so weird.

299
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,970
- Demoness...
- It's late.

300
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,310
I'm going to bed. Go meditate.

301
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,940
Demoness...

302
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,370
Miss Zhiyan.

303
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,540
Miss Zhiyan?

304
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,210
Is that the West Hill Master?

305
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,260
Sorry for disturbing your rest, Miss.

306
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,580
It's only that, after pondering for quite a while, I think

307
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,770
that it would be better to tell you about this.

308
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,930
About what?

309
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:12,730
Your old friend has been waiting for you all night long.

310
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,390
All night long?

311
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,390
Outside there's so much night dew.

312
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,540
You can't go. Don't go soft. You'll make a mistake.

313
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,060
I'll just go have a look.

314
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,870
Immortal Sect girl.

315
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,330
[Sima Residence]

316
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,260
Zhiyan!

317
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,620
Zhiyan! Go back with me. Jianghu is dangerous.

318
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,750
I'm just worried about you.

319
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,210
In Wan Lu Sect, I'm very well. You don't need to worry about me.

320
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,490
I won't go back with you.

321
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,320
Today... consider it a farewell.

322
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,840
Zhiyan! Why can't you believe me for once?

323
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,990
You and I grew up together. Don't you know in your heart what kind of man my father is?

324
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,950
Enough! You clearly know that I'm not going back with you.

325
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,300
Whatever you say, it's no use.

326
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,780
I know.

327
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,540
I just don't want to give up. And I don't want...

328
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,070
I want to be with you.

329
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,800
I'm not going back with you.

330
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,200
Sect Leader Li, yesterday I lost the match. But Zhiyan...

331
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,380
Liu Cangling, you are the young master who has been gone for several days,

332
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,500
and yet Jianxin Sect doesn't care at all.

333
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,460
When you were locked in our sect's dungeons,

334
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,730
your father, Liu Wei, not only did not send anyone to rescue you,

335
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,640
but all the people in Jianxin Sect, up and down,

336
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,690
have kept the same indifferent stance whether you lived or died.

337
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,890
And you don't find that odd?

338
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,800
A sect's young master, so dim-witted to this extent.

339
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,400
Zhiyan. Zhiyan!

340
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,930
[By truth, reach the gods]

341
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,130
Much has been happening in Jianghu.

342
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,310
The Sect Leader has been tired out and took ill.

343
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,640
Therefore, the Sect matters, large and small, will be managed by me.

344
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,260
Until the Sect Leader's health improves,

345
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,910
thank you for doing your part.

346
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,130
Just obeying Sect Leader's orders!

347
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,060
Sister!

348
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,420
I haven't seen you in a long while. How did you find the time to come today?

349
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,440
I came to check my account.

350
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,950
How's it going? Do you have more money on your account now?

351
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,970
This place you all have here is no good to me.

352
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,450
That's why we always have to do good deeds.

353
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,130
You never know if one day you encounter some strange events.

354
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,020
- I'll ask you a question.
- What is it?

355
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,590
In the Land of Sojourn, do you have something like the oblivion soup?
(Note: in tales, a soup to make people forget grievances and love)

356
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,590
What is that?

357
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,370
I mean a pill that can make you forget that messy stuff relating to love.

358
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,270
Sister, who do you want to forget?

359
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,920
It's not for me. Would I get trapped by feelings? It's for another girl.

360
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,510
There are all sorts of things in our Land of Sojourn.

361
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,060
But if it's not for you, Sister, bringing it back would be no use.

362
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,400
The things in this Land of Sojourn

363
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,760
can only have use for the people in Land of Sojourn.

364
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,930
Then, do you know how to deal with a little girl all weepy about a man?

365
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,750
Drink a lot of hot water!

366
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,960
Then, how about taking her out to the market, making some purchases?

367
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,620
- Is that useful?
- It's useful for sure.

368
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,340
Enjoy! Enjoy!

369
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,740
Any trouble can be solved with a skewer of grilled meat.

370
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,330
If you still can't solve it,

371
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,610
then add a candied hawthorn.

372
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,850
But I'm not up to eating.

373
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,820
You never tried! Try and you'll know.

374
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,370
Come, come, come! Boss!

375
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,370
Here.

376
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,510
Go!

377
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,360
- Boss,
- Yes?
- Ten skewers of chicken feet, ten skewers of beef,

378
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,190
- ten skewers of lamb and add two pig feet.
- Huh?

379
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,110
You... Miss, your appetite is really good!

380
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,470
Please, here, here.

381
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,990
My appetite is the best.

382
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:41,270
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫
