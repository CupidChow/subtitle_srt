[The Legends]

2
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,160
Such vicious looking disciples. How can I get in?

4
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,630
Who is there?

5
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,390
Blood. Oh no, that chit is in trouble.

6
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,210
Little lady.

7
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,520
It's a little lady. Why are you covering your face?

8
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,870
Maybe she is really ugly.

9
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,260
Take it off, let us see.

10
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,890
Regardless of why she is here. She is acting suspiciously.

11
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,050
Let's capture her and give her to the Dark Guards.

12
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,960
Take her clothes off

13
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,720
to see what she is exactly here for.

14
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,210
Who dares to be messing with the Wan Lu Sect?

15
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,580
What can you do if I am messing around here?

16
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,560
Demoness.

17
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,330
But before you couldn't even fight the guard at the door.

18
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,520
That's because I wasn't prepared before. Fists are more than enough to handle these people.

19
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,090
Go.

20
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,150
Amazing.

21
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,350
I will give you a warning today.

22
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,100
From now on, this little black ball is under my protection.

23
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,760
I will skin whoever tries to disrobe her.

24
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,230
You wait for it. I am going to notify the Sect Leader.

25
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,040
Go right ahead.

26
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,210
Let's see if your Sect Leader favors you or his personal disciple.

27
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,460
That's nonsense. How can Sect Leader take you in as his own personal disciple?

28
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,870
Go to Wu'e Hall and ask him then. [Hall of No Sin]

29
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,140
Little Black Ball, let's go.

30
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,990
Wan Lu Sect's leisure guards are too scary.

31
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,060
They are just as scary as the previous times.

32
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,110
Wan Lu Sect had always been like this.

33
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,100
Just so, in the past; also now, and in the future, as well.

34
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,440
Since you've joined Wan Lu Sect, you need to be mentally ready for this.

35
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,130
No... what?

36
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,230
Demoness.

37
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,850
- Be quiet.
- What are you doing?

38
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,480
Don't be upset about getting bullied in Wan Lu Sect.

39
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,970
You can choose to be bullied by those disciples outside or let me bully you.

40
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,260
I think it's better off for you to let me bully you.

41
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,920
At least I am also a Sect Leader.

42
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,910
From now on, you will stay here like this. Don't play any tricks.

43
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,820
Be quiet. I won't give you anything to eat if you continue to make a ruckus.

44
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,970
Be alert today. North Hill's Master is not in.

45
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,580
Yes.

46
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,560
Where did that old guy Yuan Jie go? Ruining my plans.

47
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,750
At this point, I'd better elevate my energy level.

48
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,290
Or else, next time, I won't be able to handle the higher level disciples.

49
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,140
Not to mention, I need to kill the Little Monster and get back my sect leader position.

50
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,420
Yesterday, I rushed through the Forbidden Zone and didn't have a chance to check out the Land of Sojourn.

51
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,750
Stop.

52
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,460
Who are you?

53
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,380
I am the Sect Leader's special agent. He left an object in the Forbidden Zone and commanded me to fetch it.

54
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,840
I've never heard of a special agent for the Sect Leader. No one can enter the Forbidden Zone.

55
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,610
Ignorant fool. Watch out for your head if you hinder the Sect Leader's task.

56
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,570
You've already forgotten that I am the Sect Leader's personal disciple.

57
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,770
Yes. Pardon my lack of manners.

58
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,930
Special Agent, this way, please.

59
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,830
Should we notify the Sect Leader about this?

60
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,430
I don't know either.

61
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,690
Last time, what did those two pedestrians call it?

62
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,860
Sir, wait a second.

63
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,440
Greetings.

64
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,860
Greetings, how are you?

65
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,990
Do you know of a pill that can return my peak power?

66
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,360
Miss, do you mean the Recovery Pill?

67
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,180
Yes, that's the one. Where is it?

68
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,950
At... Mom?

69
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,680
Young Lady, why are you speaking to my son so casually?

70
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,800
If you want to speak, let's talk about your birth time?
(For purpose of marriage seeking.)

71
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,830
I want to check and see if you are a good match for my son.

72
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,480
Miss, pardon us. My mom is in a rush to find a wife for me.

73
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,210
The Recovery Shop is about ten zhang up front.
(10 Zhang = 3.3 m)

74
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,900
Thank you.

75
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,840
Miss, don't leave.

[Recovery Shop]

77

[Recovery Per One Hour]
Recovering back power is charged at a per hourly rate.

79

Now Li Chenlan manages the Wan Lu Sect. He also has the Wanjun Sword. (Ten Thousand Ton Sword)

80
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,070
I would need two weeks to a month in order to prod him.

81
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,200
These one or two hours is not enough at all.

82
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
Wait a second.

83
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,330
You can't go in.

84
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,200
Why can't I go in if the store is open?

85
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,760
You don't have any money in your account.

86
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,660
What money? How do you know I don't have money?

87
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,750
Scanned by the Heavenly Currency Mirror; we will see precisely if you have money or not.

88
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,410
With your poor attire, you want to enter our Recovery Shop? Scram.

89
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,830
Who are you saying is poor? Come here!

90
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,950
Aren't you the older sister from last time? What are you doing here?

91
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,740
Murdering someone!

92
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,120
Sinful. The word kill starts from the mouth and that's bad vibes. Calm down.

93
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,390
- Let go!
- Calm down, Older Sister. What are you doing?

94
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,890
- If you hit someone in the Land of Sojourn, you'll be arrested.
- Who will dare arrest me?

95
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,200
Those snobbish people, how dare they say I have no money?

96
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,210
Isn't this money?

97
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,720
- Older Sister.
- Trying calling me "older sister" one more time.

98
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,460
Little Older Sister, you don't know. Land of Sojourn's currency is different from the outside.

99
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,940
How is it different? Could it be that the Land of Sojourn uses paper (funeral) money?

100
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,810
Not that. In order to enter the Land of Sojourn, someone needs to experience life and death.

101
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,610
Walk past the Palace of the King of Hell, see the face of the King of Hell, and then you'll enter the mysterious Land of Sojourn.

102
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,170
The Land of Sojourn has its own rules;

103
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,150
currency is not that, it's this.

104
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,810
Your heart? By weight? How much can that be worth?

105
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,700
It's one's character!

106
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,570
There's a Big Vitality Bank here that records all the good and evil deeds of everyone who enters the Land of Sojourn.

107
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,320
The amount of money in your account is the amount of your good and evil deeds. The more good deeds is more money.

108
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,850
Do fewer good deeds and the less money you'll have.

109
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,340
- What a lousy rule.
- It doesn't matter if the rule is lousy or not,

110
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,500
it's just like this. The truth is, if you're bad, then you're poor. You will have no money.

111
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,200
The Land of Sojourn has our own rules.

112
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,940
If you want to earn money, you'll have to do good deeds and earn merit. For normal people,

113
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,860
doing one good deed is a thousand, saving a life is ten thousand.

114
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,100
- Also--
- Fine!

115
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,130
I'll do it. But I need to be quick.

116
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,800
If I hire someone to do good deeds for me, will it also go into my account?

117
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,640
It counts. As long as someone uses your name to do the good deed for you.

118
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,940
The money will count towards your account.

119
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,800
Fine. What's your name? The next time I come to the Land of Sojourn, I'll find you to play with.

120
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,540
My name is Zi You.

121
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,290
I haven't finished all the rules. You're just leaving as you please!

122
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,120
It's time for me to go to work. I need to hurry up.

123
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,390
I'll leave the doing good deeds to Qin Zhiyan.

124
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,030
I will just practice my skills. This way, we kill two birds with one stone.

125
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,720
If you just eat one pill, we'll give you a thousand. Everyone come and see.

126
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,570
This is a chance of a lifetime! Everyone don't miss out on it!

127
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,990
Our store's grand opening sale, new edition Empty Pill!

128
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,370
Just eat one pill... one pill... and we'll give you one thousand! Be courageous and try something new!

129
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,770
- That's amazing.
- So amazing.

130
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,700
- What's the effect if we eat this Empty Pill?
- Yeah! Yeah! Tell us!

131
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,580
Our Empty Pill is the Land of Sojourn's exclusive new item.

132
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,270
So it's actually finding someone to test the pill.

133
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,970
- Customer, how can you say that? Don't leave, customer.
- Let's go, let's go.

134
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,630
Little Older Sister, it's fate to see you again. Do you want to try it?

135
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,970
How come you're everywhere? Aren't you the waiter in the inn?

136
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,430
A day is so long I have to take advantage of it.

137
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,630
I have two jobs. It's not tiring but relaxing, and I earn money.

138
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,160
Is your shop reputable?

139
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,000
Our Empty Shop is the Land of Sojourn's century-old shop; we don't cheat the old or young.

140
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
What use do I have if I eat it?

141
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,320
This medicine has different effects on everyone.

142
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,920
It can increase strength or increase physique.

143
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,540
What if it has no effects after I eat it?

144
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,730
That's impossible! Our Empty Shop is the Land of Sojourn's trustworthy business.

145
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,590
It's an officially recognized medicine research institute.

146
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,350
We have an after-sale guarantee so you can eat without worries.

147
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,980
If you have questions, we will immediately resolve it. Quick.

148
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,300
Fine. I'll try it.

What a confusing medicine.

151
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,090
My power seems to have increased a little bit.

152
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,070
I just keep feeling nauseous.

It's you again, trespassing in the Forbidden Zone.

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,870
Don't expect me to forgive you twice!

155
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,060
Master, last time I was forced to.

156
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,540
I was forced this time, too.

157
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,220
Forced you? Who forced you?

158
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,300
This kid is testing me. Seems like if I don't mix in some trust, I won't get away with it.

159
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,230
It's her. She forced me.

160
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,770
Do you know who's grave this is?

161
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,510
I know. Lu Zhaoyao.

162
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,720
There are no words on the gravestone, how did you know?

163
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,040
Lu Zhaoyao appeared in my dream.

164
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,360
She appeared in your dream?

165
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,510
Yes, she told me to do good deeds for her.

166
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,460
Or else, she'll haunt me and kill me.

167
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:41,220
I look just like Qin Zhiyan right now. Even if he investigates, he won't find anything.

168
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,580
Impossible.

169
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,380
Impossible. If she's still here, she would definitely find me first.

170
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,630
On this topic, Little Monster really saw through my intentions.

171
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,650
Wait until I recover my power, the first person I’ll go after is you.

172
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,560
I don't know why she appeared in my dream,

173
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,700
maybe it's because I strayed into this place and got tangled by her.

174
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,070
Master, you can't blame me for what happened this time.

175
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,560
- Why did she find you?
- She told me to do good deeds for her.

176
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,480
Do good deeds?

177
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,720
I think it's so she can earn merit.

178
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,520
Earn merit?

179
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,590
How is she in the dream?

180
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,280
Her? She looks pale and appears to be vicious.

181
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,170
She keeps telling me how she feels cheated.

182
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,580
She said she was supposed to rule over Jianghu; climb to the peak of her lifetime.

183
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,520
But she died so mysteriously and felt so worthless.

184
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,740
She's actually not any different from before, just that she hates you.

185
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,000
She said she gave you a token that time. If you rescue her in the sword tomb,

186
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,560
she'd give you glory and wealth.

187
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,830
She didn't expect you to steal her WanJun Sword and kill her.

188
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,780
She said she'd be back to get revenge.

189
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,970
Then, how come she still hasn't come?

190
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,060
He's provoking me.

191
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,770
Master, wait for me! Master!

192
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,840
Hurry kneel. Sect Leader.

193
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,460
Se…Se… Sect Leader.

194
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,500
You keep letting people into the Forbidden Zone. Seems like you are slacking.

195
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,390
I really don’t know who is allowed or not allowed to enter the area.

196
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,020
Also, she said she's your disciple.

197
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,630
She said she was instructed by you to search for something.

198
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,920
Sect Leader's disciple?

199
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,520
Yes, didn’t I kneel down to you yesterday?

200
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,980
Have I agreed?

201
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,620
You didn’t reject.

202
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,380
Master, I couldn’t do anything about Lu Zhaoyao entering my dreams.

203
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,840
You don’t like people coming to this Forbidden Zone. I’m not interested in this place either.

204
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,030
Mighty Master, please spare me.

205
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,600
How is it, Master?

206
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,220
How is it, Master?

207
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,320
Master?

208
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,810
Go farm in front of the monastery for ten days.

209
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,620
Yes, yes, yes.

210
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,430
Thanks, Sect Leader. Thanks, Sect Leader.

211
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,770
Did you see?

212
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,960
I saw it, I saw it.

213
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Sect Leader favors Miss.

214
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,320
Favoring, favoring.

215
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,470
Would Miss want me to call for a carriage to send you back?

216
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,920
- You’re not blaming me for getting you into trouble?
- I’m not daring.

217
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,010
Farming in front of the monastery is joyful.

218
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,490
Consider yourself as quick-witted. Call for the carriage.

219
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,880
Yes, yes, yes. Stand up! Go get the carriage!

220
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,300
Yes, yes, yes.

221
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,400
A bunch of pigs!

222
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,860
It’s her again.

223
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,510
- Why is she in a carriage?
- Why so ostentatious?

224
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,500
- Is she really Sect Leader’s disciple?
- It’s impossible. Why would Sect Leader choose her?

225
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,620
- Who is she? Look at her.
- What's so good about her?

226
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,150
Just look at her.

227
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,680
She’s too arrogant.

228
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,130
Why did you tie me up?

229
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,420
Didn't you call me Demoness? Does a demoness need a reason to do something?

230
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,850
When I’m happy, I tie you up. When I’m unhappy, I hit you. Are you afraid?

231
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,680
How could you be like this? You’re an excessive bandit.

232
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,650
You really are…

233
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,780
I'm an excessive bandit because I'm astonishing.

234
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,360
If you disagree then fight with me.

235
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,600
If you don’t have the energy to fight against me then be obedient. Don’t cause troubles.

236
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,000
This junk pill from the Land of Sojourn,

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,100
just eat one and it makes you this uncomfortable.

238
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,800
So early in the morning, are you letting people sleep?

239
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Keep being noisy and I won't give you any food!

240
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,900
- What do you want to say?
- You...

241
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,600
You became invisible.

242
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,300
What invisi...

243
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,300
This.. What is this?

244
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,600
I became invisible?

245
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Who is it?

246
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Who is it?

247
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
They can't see me.

248
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Open! Big! Big! Big!

249
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,400
Continue! Continue!

250
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,200
Don't leave!

251
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
Don't leave! You win money and just leave?

252
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,300
Big! Big!

253
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,200
Who is it?

254
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
- Who?
- Me.

255
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
- Who?
- Me!

256
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,700
Probably your imagination. Here, sit.

257
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Seems like other than Qin Zhiyan, others can't see me.

258
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,200
They also can't hear me talk.

259
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,500
[No Evil Palace]

260
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Sect Leader, what happened?

261
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,700
You were standing guard outside, was there anything unusual?

262
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Report, Sect Leader.

263
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Just now, I felt someone bump me outside but I didn't see anyone walk past.

264
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,400
- Bumped you?
- Yes.

265
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,000
My personal dagger is missing.

266
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Sect Leader, perhaps...

267
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,800
Leave it. Don't talk about what happened today.

268
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,100
Leave me.

269
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,700
Yes.

270
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,520
How can you be so careless?

271
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,240
You were also next to me,

272
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,940
did you see someone pass by?

273
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,290
- We didn't.
- Enough.

274
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,500
Good thing Sect Leader didn't get hurt.

275
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Since he said to not talk about it, don't discuss it in the future.

276
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Yes, Guard Leader.

277
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,900
- Guard well.
- Yes.

278
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,150
Who tied you here?

279
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,570
Lu... Lu Zhaoyao. Lu Zhaoyao!

280
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,000
If you reveal any information about me, I'm over and you're also over.

281
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,700
Think it through. Can you survive at Wan Lu Sect by yourself?

282
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,200
Where is she?

283
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Fine!

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,570
If you fool him this time,

285
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,300
I'll never tie you up; you can move freely!

286
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
I won't hit you, yell at you, or tease you!

287
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Your problems are my problems. I'll settle everything for you.

288
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I...

289
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,300
I also don't know where she is.

290
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
You don't know?

291
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,900
Did you say she appeared in your dream?

292
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,000
Repeat after me. She appeared in my dream so I can do good deeds for her.

293
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,600
She appeared in my dream so I can do good deeds for her.

294
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Then how did she tie you up?

295
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,000
I... I tied it myself.

296
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You...

297
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,000
You're saying nonsense, do you know how to lie?

298
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,400
Since you tied it yourself,

299
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,500
then you must have a solution to untie it yourself.

300
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,200
Show me how you'll untie it.

301
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,920
It's over, it's over. It's over.

302
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,500
Oh my goodness.

303
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,700
I untied it!

304
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,910
Tell him again, you untied it.

305
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,700
I.. I untied it.

306
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
- So you really can untie yourself.
- So I really can untie myself.

307
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,900
Ah Da!

308
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Sect Leader.

309
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,200
Teasing Moon Peak, Qin Zhiyan, watch her.

310
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,400
If there's anything unusual, report to me immediately.

311
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,700
Yes.

312
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,420
I'm wedged between you two big demons. I really don't know what sins I committed in my past life.

313
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,200
Careful what you say in the future, little girl.

314
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,140
My name is Zhiyan.

315
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
Little girl, I'm telling you.

316
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,000
Can't you say my name nicely?

317
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,010
I can't. To outsiders right now, we share the same face.

318
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,970
You're me and I'm you.

319
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,450
You losing face is me losing face and I can't lose face.

320
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,800
Why?

321
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,570
Lu Zhaoyao never loses face.

322
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,480
But... in others' eyes, they don't see your face.

323
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,410
So talkative. Who knows how long this will last?

324
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,910
Anyway, I used your face. Your face is my face.

325
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:38,740
Listen. Wan Lu Sect is not an easy place to mix in. If you want to stand your ground in Wan Lu Sect,

326
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:44,120
you'll have to rely on your strength to talk. If you can't rely on strength, learn how to kiss up.

327
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,590
I came to Wan Lu Sect so I can rely on my own strength to avenge my father!

328
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:55,070
Kiss up? That impairs one's integrity! I'm not doing it.

329
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,280
Integrity? You?

330
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,920
With your kungfu, you can't even beat a low-level sect disciple and you want to talk about integrity?

331
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,790
With your integrity, a low-level sect disciple will stomp you till even a dog won't look at you in the future.

332
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,380
Then... Then what do we do?

333
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,880
I recently got you the status of Li Chenlan's disciple.

334
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,080
Really? You really became Li Chenlan's disciple?

335
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,390
Not me, but you and I.

336
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,710
How did you get this position?

337
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,670
Doesn't matter how I got it.

338
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,100
Just know you're someone with status now.

339
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,950
If a disciple bullies you, remember to stand your ground and not cower.

340
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,220
Oh.

341
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm going out tomorrow night and won't be at Teasing Moon Peak.

342
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,410
Go find some medicine to increase your skills.

343
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,260
Your skill right now is so low, it can't even compare to the pig I raised.

344
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,960
You need to take more medicine, increase it a bit.

345
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,580
Okay, I understand. You also need to take more!

346
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,700
That day when we were in front of North Hill's Master,

347
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,740
that door guard, like that,

348
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,780
you just collapsed in front of the entrance.

349
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,210
Also, we walked all the way from Thousand Dust Pavilion to Wan Lu Sect.

350
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,450
Not to mention the tele-transport skill, I haven't seen you use other low-level skills either.

351
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,090
To tell the truth, you don't have much skill left in your body. Right?

352
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,370
I guess after this long day you're still not tired.

353
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,470
Why don't you go down the mountain and do good deeds for me?

354
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,620
But those sect disciples will bully me.

355
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,500
You have me. Guaranteed you won't be taken advantage of.

356
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,520
Jiangzhou City is the most prosperous place in the martial arts world.

357
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,560
Everyone comes here; those from the Immortal Sects or the carefree warriors.

358
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,410
There's food, drink, and amusement. What a great place.

359
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,700
Plenty of chances for dining and merrymaking. But we have something to do.

360
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:22,330
What is it? We just took over Xin Shan Sect. We still need to take care of internal affairs.

361
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,980
We came to Jiangzhou City in such a hurry. Must be something important.

362
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,530
I, Jiang Wu, want to be known across the world.

363
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,860
People who hear about me in Jianghu should either pee their pants,

364
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,270
or at least panic at the mention of my name.

365
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,590
Then what are we doing here this time?

366
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,660
Stirring up some trouble.

367
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,640
Stirring what trouble?

368
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,220
Haven't thought it through; I'll tell you when I know.

369
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,750
Great!

370
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,790
One more.

371
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:59,400
I've been here all day but I don't see anyone that needs help.

372
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,010
We still need to do it.

373
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,590
All right.

374
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,270
There's a kid over there who fell, go make him feel better.

375
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,280
He's such a big kid. He's crying because his candied hawthorn berries fell to the ground?

376
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,130
Stop talking nonsense and just go.

377
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,760
Before you comfort him, remember to use my name.

378
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,900
Hurry over there.

379
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,440
Shopkeeper, give me a skewer of candied hawthorn.

380
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,720
Here, stop crying.

381
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,520
Thank you.

382
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,880
Lu Zhaoyao told me to give you this candied hawthorn.

383
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,420
The Demoness is here to steal my candied hawthorn again!

384
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:02,660
Lu Zhaoyao. Your name is so well-known.

385
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,390
Come and have a look.

386
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,900
These are freshly picked.

387
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,300
So, you often stole people's candied hawthorns in the past.

388
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,450
It's none of your business. Quickly find something good to do.

389
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,980
Old lady, I didn't knock you down.

390
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,610
- You're killing me.
- Go over and help the old lady. Use my name.

391
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,500
Oh.

392
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,100
Go! Go!

393
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,420
Grandma, are you okay? Lu Zhaoyao told me to come help you.

394
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,670
Grandma, don't be afraid. Lu Zhaoyao...

395
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,860
Cart driver, don't go.

396
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,530
Don't go. What cart driver? You are the one who knocked me down.

397
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,730
What?

398
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,530
What? What "what?" Give me money! I need to see a doctor!

399
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,130
You– I didn't!

400
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,260
Didn't? You're not allowed to leave.

401
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:40,370
- Someone ran into me and won't take responsibility! I need to see a doctor!
- A stinky guy pretends to be an old lady. So noisy.

402
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,790
It's... It's a guy?

403
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,060
You just realized?

404
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,950
Let's go. Don't mind him.

405
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,030
Sect Master, I've kept an eye on the girl from the Immortal Sect for some time.

406
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,810
I found out she's unusual all around.

407
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,440
What did she do?

408
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,170
Today, she went to Shun'an Town. Bought a candied hawthorn for a kid.

409
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,800
And then the kid got scared and ran away.

410
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,390
Then, she saved a swindler who wanted to extort money. The swindler got scared off, too.

411
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,090
What else did she do?

412
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,040
Other than that, nothing else.

413
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,910
Okay.

414
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,140
- Continue watching her.
- Yes.

415
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,340
Who exactly are you?
