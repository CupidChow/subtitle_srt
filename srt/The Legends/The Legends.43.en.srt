3
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,590
I hope...

4
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,930
that every storm you have to face in the future

5
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,390
will all fall on me.

6
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,050
Zhaoyao, this was the fourth time already.

7
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,700
I'm really scared.

8
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,170
What are you scared of?

9
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm such an infamous demoness.

10
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,870
If I go to the Underworld,

11
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,070
I'll frighten even the ghosts.

12
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,750
King Yama's palace won't be willing to make room for me.

13
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,070
Even if I have to kill my way through the Underworld,

14
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,060
I will still get you back.

15
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,580
Zhaoyao.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,650
Zhaoyao.

17
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,450
Zhaoyao.

18
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,430
Zhaoyao.

19
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,020
Zhaoyao.

20
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,390
Zhaoyao.

21
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,630
Exchanging affections over a grave. Pretty bad taste.

22
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,190
You really are the Son of the Demon King; this energy is evil enough.

23
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,420
Now, that's the way the Son of the Demon King should be.

24
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,210
Let me see your true strength. Bring it on!

25
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,680
What do you mean?

26
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,230
Zhaoyao's life is in danger. Our fight is meaningless.

27
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,750
So what?

28
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,380
Let's join hands and save her first.

29
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,500
All right. Kneel down and bow to me three times, then I'll help you.

30
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,990
Little Monster, I'm back.

31
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,760
I said!

32
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,650
Let's make a happy event!

33
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,850
So what is Lu Zhaoyao's illness

34
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,370
that you'd put down your dignity and sacrifice yourself like this to save her?

35
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,620
You probably have seen her go up in fireworks.

36
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,590
I have.

37
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,720
After five times, she'll die.

38
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,750
This was the second time?

39
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,180
This was the fourth time.

40
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,830
When is the next time?

41
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,400
It might just be the next instant.

42
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll save her, but remember...

43
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,760
I'll save her because I love her,

44
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,950
not because you asked me.

45
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
You want me to give up Qin Qianxian's power?

46
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,830
For the power you'll lose, I'll think of a way to make up later.

47
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,760
You'll make up?

48
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,650
I want Lu Zhaoyao to owe me forever.

49
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,430
How come Qin Qianxian's item is here in your hands?

50
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,850
This is called "Heart Lotus. "It is the Thousand Dust Pavillion's sect treasure.

51
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,620
What's it for?

52
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,310
The Diamond Hexagram.

53
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,030
Remember, Qin Qianxian's power is necessary to make the lotus flower blossom.

54
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,650
At the right moment, you just infuse the power into the formation.

55
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,760
It's that simple?

56
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,370
While you infuse the power, I'll use the force of the Wanjun Sword to hold down the eye of the formation

57
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,070
and protect the balance of the three of us inside the diagram.

58
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,750
Once we open the formation, the people inside it can't move any more;

59
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,140
otherwise, we won't be able to hold the center down. Then we won't only waste all the effort,

60
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,700
but whoever is in the formation will risk their life, too.

61
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,000
Fine.

62
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,120
Sister Ziyu.

63
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,670
Sister Ziyu. Sister Ziyu.

64
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,470
What's going on in the Wan Lu Sect?

65
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,080
Why would it be controlled by Jiang Wu?

66
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,130
During Sect Leader's wedding with Lu Zhaoyao, Jiang Wu suddenly showed up and caught us off guard.

67
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,800
None of the Hill Masters or even Qin Zhiyan could escape it.

68
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,870
If it wasn't because I was away on a mission,

69
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm afraid I would be locked in the dungeon like our fellow people.

70
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,690
Where's Sect Leader?

71
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,730
Sect Leader... Sect Leader lost the Wanjun Sword.

72
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,470
His powers aren't as good as before.

73
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,140
Also, Jiang Wu cast a spell on the dungeons.

74
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,680
I'm afraid it's not that easy for him to get away.

75
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,760
Sister Ziyu, where are you going?

76
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,560
Sect Leader's life is hanging in the balance. How can I sit by and watch?

77
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,930
If you go to the Wan Lu Sect, it's as good as throwing your life away.

78
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,570
Even so, I still have to go.

79
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,980
Sister Ziyu, I'll go with you.

80
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,370
Sister Ziyu, you can go through extreme danger for Sect Leader.

81
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,130
Although I can't do it,

82
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,810
I'll be right behind you.

Why are you here?

85
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,150
Captain and I are risking our lives to save you. And you keep this attitude?

86
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,780
- You're the Wan Lu Sect's traitors!
- You...

87
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,050
That's right. I betrayed the Wan Lu Sect.

88
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,130
But I didn't betray the Dark Guards.

89
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,400
I, Lin Ziyu, have always been loyal to Li Chenlan alone.

90
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,810
There can be internal strife in the Wan Lu Sect, but I won't let it fall into the hands of others.

91
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,800
Ah Da, I want to save Sect Leader. Whether you're coming or not is up to you.

92
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,610
I'll trust her once more. Get the weapons!

How would I know?

96
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,510
The evil energy comes from me.

97
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,490
Right. I'm different from Qin Qianxian. I'm the demon in his heart.

98
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,980
The powers that come from the heart demon will release evil energy.

99
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,880
From now on... you can never carry out massacres.

100
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,430
You can't control me.

101
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,180
Can this only work with Qin Qianxian's force stored in my breast?

102
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,130
Jiang Wu, what are you doing?

103
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,780
Saving her.

104
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,390

[Wu'e Hall]

Why does it feel like Jiang Wu is helping Sect Leader?

Why would it be you?

113
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,730
Contain the eye of the formation!

114

You're willing to risk your life for her?

115
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,960
My life was always hers.

116
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,180
Li Chenlan, today it was me who saved you and the Wan Lu Sect,

117
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,000
but I'll never save you again.

118
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,200

Look! This barrier looks somewhat odd?

The barrier seems to have become weaker.

123

Is it possible that Jiang Wu has been defeated?

124
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,830
It's an urgent situation. I'll get you out of here first.

125

- Hurry. Let's go!
- Ah Da!

I even dug out my heart to save you.

Ask him if you don't believe it.

133

Jiang Wu and I joined hands and activated the Diamond Hexagram Formation.

- Ah Wu! Ah Wu! Bad news!
- What's the matter?

- I said to catch them again.

You...

139

All thanks to me.

143
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,260
Little Red Hair, what did you just say you were going to do to my people? Catch them?

144
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,580
That's right. They aren't my people. Why should I keep them?

145
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,220
The Wan Lu Sect was mine, to begin with. If we're precise, it's also Little Monster's.

146
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,280
Since when was it yours?

147
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,170
Very well, Lu Zhaoyao. I even gave you my heart. And as soon as you're up, you forget all gratitude.

148
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,350
These are two different things. I admit that you've saved me.

149
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,590
I'll repay you for that. Right, Mo Qing?

150
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,010
But as to whom Wan Lu Sect belongs to, we need to discuss it all over again.

151
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,810
All right. Let's play it by Jianghu's rules.

152
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,700
On the day of your wedding, I took over the Wan Lu Sect.

153
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,590
Like you say, "The strongest is lord."

154
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,940
Of course, I'll be the sect leader.

155
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,680
All right. Let's discuss it based on this theory.

156
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,400
Little Red Hair, how about...

157
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,660
Little Red Hair, return the Liuhe Tianyi Sword to me!

158
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,940
I don't have it.

159
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,300
Where is it then?

160
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,010
In order to open the Diamond Hexagram, we needed the ancient power of Heaven's Sword.

161
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,250
Lin Ziyu caught me off guard and stole the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

162
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,630
So your injury was inflicted by Lin Ziyu?

163
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,860
It's nothing serious.

164
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,420
Hey, hey!

165
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,550
I got hurt, too. Show some concern, will you?

166
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,120
I really gave you my heart.

167
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,150
You don't believe it? All right. I'll strip and show you.

168
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,540
Look.

169
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,140
You really dug out your heart?

170
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,990
You thought I was kidding? There's a hole here.

171
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,740
Thanks for saving me. Come hell or high water,

172
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,190
I, Lu Zhaoyao, will surely return the favor.

173
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,020
No need for that. Just chasing him away will do.

174
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,260
No way. Mo Qing is my loved one. If he leaves,

175
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,450
I'll leave with him.

176
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,830
All right.

177
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,980
So, you're saying that you're offering the Wan Lu Sect to me?

178
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,890
I established the Wan Lu Sect by myself.

179
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,840
I couldn't bear to part with it. But if you can protect it,

180
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,740
I'm willing to abdicate the position to repay your kindness.

181
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,690
Lu Zhaoyao, I admire your generosity.

182
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,900
But aside from you, there's nothing to my liking in the Wan Lu Sect.

183
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,920
If you leave, I'll ruin it.

184
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,270
Then, what do you want?

185
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,100
Stay and be the sect leader with me.

186
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,990
If I stay, he has to stay, too.

187
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,720
Why keep him? To guard the mountain gate?

188
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,940
To be the sect leader.

189
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,300
All right. Just because I like you,

190
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,260
from now on, he, you, and I,

191
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,350
we will be the three sect leaders. How about that?

192
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,170
Three sect leaders?

193
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,600
That's quite interesting.

194
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,870
Ah Wu!

195
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,670
I'm talking. Why are you interrupting?

196
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:32,230
Gather everyone. I want to announce it to the world.

197
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,720
Ah Wu, the position as the sect leader is yours to begin with.

198
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,310
Why are you sharing it with them?

199
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,790
Do you know what strategy is?

200
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,690
Strategy?

201
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,260
Lu Zhaoyao has made a concession.

202
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,810
If I'm too overbearing, it will make her think that I demand too much.

203
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,380
So that's it.

204
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,800
Ah Wu, you're playing the long game.

205
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,240
I thought you'd lost your mind over Lu Zhaoyao.

206
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,650
I have lost my mind over her.

207
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,860
Otherwise, why would I put up even with Li Chenlan for her?

208
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,190
Did we escape from the dungeons just to see this?

209
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,990
I should've just gone home with Qianjin.

210
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,890
Three Sect Leaders? This is the first time I've heard of such a thing.

211
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:09,390
This Demoness always does things that are out of our expectations.

212
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,460
If I'd known earlier, I would've stayed in the dungeons and not come out; waste of energy.

213
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,690
The Wan Lu Sect originally belongs to Sect Leader Li.

214
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,890
You, scoundrels, took advantage when he was down to prevail.

215
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,320
Now Sect Leader Li is fine, how can he let you occupy the nest?

216
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,250
Sooner or later, we'll chase you out of the Wan Lu Sect!

217
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,900
- Yes, chase you out!
- Chase you out!

218
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,380
If Sect Leader Jiang hadn't used his powers to save Lu Zhaoyao,

219
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,740
how would you all have the chance to escape from the dungeons?

220
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,790
- That's true.
- Nonsense!

221
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,750
You all should leave this place and go fund your own sect.

222
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,060
- That's right!
- Go fund your own sect!

223
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,530
I want to fight!

224
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,500
Seventeen! Come back.

225
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,960
Don't create more trouble.

226
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,170
Put away all your weapons! The sect leaders will be coming soon. Stand up straight!

227
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,030
Sect Leader is here.

228
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:12,350
We agreed to be sect leaders together. If I walk behind you, it isn't fine.

229
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,500
Then, let's all be equal and go in together.

230
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,990
All right.

231
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,580
[Wu'e Hall]

232
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,530
There's only one main seat in Wu'e Hall, but there's three of us.

233
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,870
To avoid complications in the future, let's be clear on the rules first.

234
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,980
Who will sit in the middle seat?

235
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,530
Based on the rule of first-come, first-served. You take the seat.

236
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,560
All right. It's no problem if you sit in the middle.

237
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,220
I won't stand on ceremony then.

238
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,830
Wait.

239
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,630
You sit in the middle, I can accept it since I spoil you.

240
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,370
But the left is an honored seat, why does he get to sit on the left?

241
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,330
Didn't we say "first-come, first-served" rule?

242
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,510
I'm the first sect leader, so I sit in the middle. He's the second sect leader so he sits on the left.

243
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,890
You're the last one, so you sit on the right.

244
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,780
Then that's not okay. I want to sit on the left; make him change with me.

245
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,290
You're not changing, right? Fine.

246
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,100
I'll sit here then.

247
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,330
This matter is now settled.

248
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,690
- All right, we called everyone here today--
- To tell everyone that, from today on,

249
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,010
the Wan Lu Sect will have three sect leaders.

250
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,930
- In the future, we'll all be a family and--
- Have a more open heart and forget about the past.

251
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,220
Why are you interrupting?

252
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,660
All of us are Sect Leaders, how come you get to talk and I can't?

253
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,100
All right, you talk.

254
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,700
I'm done talking.

255
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,100
Former Sect Leader, since our Wan Lu Sect has three Sect Leaders now,

256
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,860
then who should handle the sect affairs in the future?

257
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,320
Everyone, suggest an idea and we'll listen to whoever has the best one.

258
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,810
It's settled then. If nothing else, you're all dismissed.

259
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,500
Yes, Sect Leader Lu! Sect Leader Li!

260
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,330
Yes, Sect Leader Jiang!

261
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,260
Yes, Sect Leader Lu! Sect Leader Li!

262
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,910
Yes, Sect Leader Jiang!

263
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,550
YES, SECT LEADER LU! SECT LEADER LI!

264
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,380
YES, SECT LEADER JIANG!

265
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,800
YES, SECT LEADER LU! SECT LEADER LI!!

266
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,560
YES, SECT LEADER JIANG!!

267
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,500
- What are you doing?
- What are you looking at?

268
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,690
- Keep yelling!
- Go ahead and yell!

269
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,450
- Go yell!
- Who's scared of who?

270
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,550
What's wrong with you?

271
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,070
I can't, little niece. I'm too sad.

272
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,580
I already didn't like Little Monster,

273
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,430
but Sect Leader does like him.

274
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,220
And now this Jiang Wu appeared! It's because of him that Qin Qianxian can't play with me.

275
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,790
And now I need to follow his orders.

276
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,570
If I'd rescued Sect Leader back then, there wouldn't be so many annoyances.

277
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,200
Enough talking, Little Niece. I'm going to practice martial skills.

278
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,390
When I defeat Little Monster and Jiang Wu, Sect Leader will be mine!

279
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,990
Hill Master, you have not been to Wu'e Hall on official meetings in so long.

280
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,340
Is there any big change that you went this time?

281
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,840
Such a great Wan Lu Sect,

282
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,270
turned into a game of little children playing house.

283
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,940
Those two already used to give me a big headache.

284
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,850
And now there's a third one.

285
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,190
It was much quieter when I was in the dungeons.

286
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,310
Where's Qianjin?

287
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,350
Miss Shen went to the kitchen. She said she wanted to prepare some pastries.

288
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,330
Hill Master... you should persuade Miss Shen.

289
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,090
Tell her to go to the kitchen less. It's been a whole morning,

290
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,060
she's failed five times.

291
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,020
She used up almost all the honey and flour in the house.

292
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,730
Do I lack for such things?

293
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,000
I've kept you for five years and wasted so much food, how come you didn't say anything?

294
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,630
Didn't you always teach us, that frugality is a virtue?

295
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,170
I heard you've been cooking the whole morning.

296
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,490
Are you here to laugh at me?

297
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,660
How would I dare?

298
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,410
Failed again.

299
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,430
It's hot! I didn't make it right this time.

300
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,520
When it's made right next time, you can have a taste.

301
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,250
All right.

302
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,010
What's this?

303
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,890
Open it and take a look.

304
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,050
That's my horoscope.
(T/N: for marriage proposal)

305
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,830
This is...

306
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,690
Now Wan Lu Sect has three sect leaders. Who knows what trouble they will bring to us.

307
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,540
Why don't we hold our wedding as soon as possible?

308
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,030
Are... you willing?

309
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,150
[Xu Zong Sect]

310
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,170
Jin Xian, it's time to drink your medicine.

311
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,600
Jin Xian, did you know something interesting happened in the Wan Lu Sect?

312
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,590
There are three sect leaders.

313
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,060
This is the first time I've seen it in my life.

314
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,710
Really?

315
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,630
Then, I'll let Jin Xian rest.

316
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,430
That's right.

317
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,020
Jin Xian, do you have any requests? Just tell me.

318
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,240
Jin Xian, if you have any request, feel free to ask me. So long as it's within my ability, it will be my duty.

319
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,050
It's nothing.

320
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:24,660
Just that I read these scrolls and I'm curious.

321
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,500
Go ahead.

322
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,380
Is Xu Zong Sect's secret skill related to the age of all former sect leaders?

323
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,290
This... Sect Leader warned us, this is Xu Zong Sect's secret.

324
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,570
It's not suitable to tell others.

325
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:44,380
I'm not trying to pry, it's just that my life

326
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,920
was saved by your sect leader.

327
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,920
I just want to do the best I can to prolong his years,

328
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,230
to repay him for saving my life.

329
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,590
So that's the case.

330
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,020
I just heard Master mention it once.

331
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,210
He said that the secret magic will bring great powers.

332
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,940
But because it's too powerful,

333
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,700
it will reduce the lifespan of the spell-caster.

334
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,390
So, each sect leader is at their weakest when they are born.

335
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,350
They become strongest at the age of 30.

336
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,950
But ever since the first generation's sect leader, none lived past the age of 30.

337
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,530
Then... Sect Leader Jiang right now...

338
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,960
Master intends to end his family's fate in this generation.

339
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,030
That's why my master hasn't taken a wife up to now.
