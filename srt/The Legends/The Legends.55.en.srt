160
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,970
Jianxin Sect's popularity has been rising recently.

161
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,050
Sect Leader Liu was also blessed with another son.

162
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,660
Right. I almost forgot, with all the things I have to do,

163
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm lucky you reminded me, Sister Shen. I'll go prepare a gift for Sect Leader Liu now.

164
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,440
Oh, I haven't tasted your sweets yet!

165
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,490
So good!

166
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,470
Oh right, I still need to go prepare the gift. I'll take leave.

167
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,100
For some people, there are certain things that would be best left behind.

168
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,910
But to me, not letting go

169
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,390
will be the happiness of the rest of my life.

170
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,820
Stop touching him. He just peacefully fell asleep.

171
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,620
The saying in Jianghu is "Liu in the South, Qin in the North."
(T/N: Liu is Cangling, Qin is Zhiyan)

172
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,480
We can say that now everyone has settled.

173
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:10,120
The free wanderers and Immortal Sect are like waters from the same spring: running for a thousand miles,

174
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,620
in the end all go back to the sea.

175
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,380
This far away journey

176
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,400
in the end is complete.

177
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,930
[Eternal as Sun and Moon]

178
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,630
Father!

179
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,160
Father.

180
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,450
Who gave it to you?

181
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,170
That big sister there.

182
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,350
What? You dare object?

183
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,760
Haven't you heard of me?

184
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,700
Do you have money with you? Give us your money and we'll let you pass!

185
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,050
Don't be impatient. One must not be proud or impatient.

186
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,700
You.

187
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,850
My foot! It hurts!

188
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,040
If someone bullies you again, come and tell me, Lu Seventeen.

189
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,240
I'm the East Hills Master of the Wan Lu Sect.

190
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,640
Whoever dares harm others,

191
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,190
I'll break their arm!

192
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,370
Young lady, thank you for saving me.

193
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,020
You're from Thousand Dust Pavilion, too?

194
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,530
Yes.

195
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,070
How can you be so weak though you are also from Thousand Dust Pavilion?

196
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,860
Miss, are you one of our Sect, too?

197
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,140
Not me. I'm talking about a friend of mine.

198
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,230
Not only was he stronger, but also more handsome than you.

199
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,950
Miss, now that you say so, I wish to make their acquaintance.

200
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,560
I wonder, where is this friend of yours now, Miss?

201
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,270
They said he brought salvation to the people.

202
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,990
So, everyone can be him.

203
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,430
But "everyone" is too many people!

204
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,770
So, I'm still looking for him.

205
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,530
Men, carry the Sect Leader back to Wu'e Hall.

206
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,050
Yes.

207
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,190
You finally used your Engineering Technique on yourself.

208
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,540
You finally decided to came back and visit.

209
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,920
Passing by. On the way, I came to see you all.

210
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,610
Now that I've seen you, I'm not worried anymore.

211
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,960
Then... Chenlan isn't out yet?

212
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,980
There's no hurry. Save your finest tea and wait for us.

213
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,970
The story ends here.

214
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,290
People say that women are loyal, while men are fickle.

215
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,990
Even though Lu Zhaoyao was the infamous demoness,

216
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:21,120
in front of Li Chenlan, she was just a gentle lady.

217
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,190
Towards Li Chenlan,

218
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,000
from beginning to end, she was besotted with love.

219
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,450
As for Li Chenlan, at first, he was cold and cruel.

220
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,750
But because of Lu Zhaoyao's deep love,

221
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,000
no matter how much trickery and scheming he had,

222
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,040
it all turned into gentleness on his fingertips.

223
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,020
In this world, all feelings will be requited as long as they are genuine.

224
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,250
But Heaven is cruel. With two people who were deep in passion,

225
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:58,040
it had to put the world in between them, and separate them forever.

226
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,690
What's are you laughing at?

227
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,940
I'm laughing that the storyteller added spice to the story and switched the roles.

228
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,530
This isn't a sad story at all.

229
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,270
Moreover, the hero and heroine should swap roles.

230
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,260
Nonsense!

231
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,800
This is my favorite story!

232
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,960
I cry each time I hear it! What do you know?

233
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,620
Have you ever loved someone like them?

234
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,230
There is a man I love.

235
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,470
He once hated the entire world.

236
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,790
He was tired and sick of living in this world.

237
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,200
He seemed to have thought of destroying the world before.

238
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,890
Perhaps, he even felt that the people were none of his concern.

239
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,150
But he did not become a person like that in the end.

240
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,460
He was strong, but gentle.

241
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:14,120
I love him. I've never regretted it.

242
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,970
What a mediocre musician. Leave with your zither at once.

243
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,680
Look at that ugly guy. It seems he's never heard beautiful music.

244
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,490
That's right.

245
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,830
It's true. I have the ugliest face in the world,

246
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,840
but I have heard the most beautiful zither music.

247
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,650
I was once an infamous demoness.

248
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,870
I changed a lot because of one person.

249
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,010
I stopped stealing candied hawthorn from kids.

250
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,780
People stopped fearing me.

251
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,510
Be more capable. Stop crying.

252
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,340
I once saw an ocean of stars in someone's eyes.

253
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,830
I was captivated by that.

254
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,190
After he left,

255
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,840
in pursuit of his shadow,

256
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,180
I never dare miss any starry night sky.

257
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,820
Yet, I never saw the same bright stars again.

258
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,140
Zhaoyao.

259
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,600
Back then, I was in this spot, too,

260
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,140
trying every possible way to obtain the Wanjun Sword.

261
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,330
And, now, I'm here to put it back.

262
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,270
Life is unpredictable indeed.

263
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,410
All these years, I've been regretting that day all along.

264
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,930
What do you regret?

265
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,130
If it wasn't for that day, we wouldn't be here today.

266
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,130
Otherwise, how would I have known

267
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,610
that the Little Monster who guarded the mountain gate back then

268
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,190
was actually hiding so many things in his heart?

269
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,430
Mo Qing!

270
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,600
Mo Qing!

271
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,720
For you.

272
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,450
Thanks, Big Brother.

273
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,960
Little Monster, I realized...

274
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,170
What?

275
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,130
After sealing the Wanjun Sword, you seem to have turned gentler.

276
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,490
You're back to your original self.

277
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,140
Zhaoyao, do you remember what you said the first time we met?

278
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,200
I said, "I'll take you away."

279
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,330
All right. I'll follow you to the end of the world.

280
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,150
Li Mingge! Are you done yet?

281
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,600
Why are you so slow at changing clothes?

282
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,180
Coming! What's the hurry?

283
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,650
Since we came out,

284
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,730
this time we need to do some great thing in Jianghu like father and mother did back then.

285
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,590
Since I brought you out, just leave everything to me.

286
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,110
- Do I look like her? Do I?
- Yes, you do.

287
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,920
Must I paste this fake scar onto my face?

288
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,880
Of course, you have to.

289
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,270
That's what father used to look like then. It looks great.

290
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,680
Mother fell for father because the scar looked good.

291
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,070
So, this time out, even if we can't replicate our parents' past success, at least we mustn't embarrass the family.

292
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,760
Or else, what about this? First, we'll practice our ultimate survival skill.

293
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,890
Then, you start.

294
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,570
Watch.

295
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,950
Young Master, Sir, this little woman willingly admits defeat.

296
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,920
Do I look like her?

297
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,350
Young Master, do I look like her?

298
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,000
- Young Master? Young Master?
- You don't.

299
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,100
How do I not look like her? I've seen Mother fawn like this with father.

300
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,490
Sister, why don't we just go back?

301
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,130
What are you afraid of? At worst, I'll beg father.

302
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,030
- I'm father's favorite.
- Stop flattering yourself.

303
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,940
Father's favorite is clearly Mother.

304
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,690
Li Mingshu, you're just jealous of me.

305
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,340
So what? You want to bite me?

306
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:26,920
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

307
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,880
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

308
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,360
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

309
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,450
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

310
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:47,770
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

311
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:55,370
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

312
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:02,870
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

313
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:10,410
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:20,980
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,390
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

318
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,360
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

319
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:02,860
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

320
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:10,400
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

321
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,810
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

322
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:25,370
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

323
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:32,780
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

324
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:40,340
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and Earth are shaken  ♫

325
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:47,870
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

326
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:55,460
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

327
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:06,000
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
