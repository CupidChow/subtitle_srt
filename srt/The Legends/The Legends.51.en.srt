00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
[Episode 51]

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,210
Jin Xian, all this power in your body...

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,550
Suruo, before dying, not only sacrificed her life to protect me,

5
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,240
but also left me all the power of the ending of her life.

6
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,910
In order to live up to her trust, I cultivated myself with bitter effort

7
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,160
and, in the end, achieved mastery.

8
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,810
As for who destroyed the Xu Zong Sect,

9
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,200
in my opinion Lu Zhaoyao, Li Chenlan, and Jiang Wu: the three of them

10
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,640
must have something to do with it.

11
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,440
Why is that?

12
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,010
As far as I know, Lu Zhaoyao, after the battle on Phoenix Mountain,

13
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,910
had an inexplicable illness and had to rely on some kind of force

14
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,940
to restore her body and cure her disease.

15
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,210
I suppose it must have been then that she set her eyes on Jiang He's secret art.

16
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,230
She sent Gu Hanguang to investigate for information;

17
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,080
hence, Gu Hanguang also died in the Xu Zong Sect.

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,140
Said like that, it makes some sense.

19
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,280
Except, Jin Xian, this is all conjecture without proof. Do you have solid evidence?

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,300
Of course, I wouldn't slander anyone.

21
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,730
Come in.

22
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,080
This is the Wan Lu Sect's previous captain of the Dark Guards.

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Since she couldn't stand Li Chenlan's and his people's crimes,

24
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,130
she forsake darkness for light and joined our community.

25
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,210
Ziyu, come tell everyone.

26
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,060
Is what I just said true or not?

27
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,340
Jin Xian's words are true.

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,590
The Xu Zong Sect was certainly destroyed by Jiang Wu and Li Chenlan.

29
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,700
And all of this was for Lu Zhaoyao.

30
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,730
Have you all heard? Even the Wan Lu Sect people say so.

31
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,260
You still have any doubt?

32
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,690
This...

33
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,940
Pavillion Leader Qin. Sect Leader Liu. Sect Leader Tang.

34
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,960
Do you still have anything to ask?

35
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,440
Good.

36
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,890
Today, I called everyone here for something else, too.

37
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,040
When I killed Jiang Wu on Fengmo Mountain,

38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,150
I saw that Li Chenlan's Demon Essence is already out of control.

39
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,390
I'm afraid, that which I've been fearing for years is happening.

40
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:37,820
I think it is time to bring the son of the Demon King to trial once more.

41
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,640
Who would have thought that at our next meeting you would already be sect leader.

42
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,570
It's to my embarrassment.

43
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:03,050
Are you still mulling over the matter of the Xu Zong Sect?

44
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,510
Precisely. You and I have lived at the Wan Lu Sect for a while.

45
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,400
We are well acquainted with the disposition of the sect people.

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,670
The Xu Zong Sect's massacre could never be their doing.

47
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,990
Not to mention, a few days ago Jin Xiu came to me.

48
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,260
I also know what Jin Xiu has been saying.

49
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,970
Phoenix Mountain's dynamics have been obscure lately.

50
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,760
The matter of the Xu Zong Sect has truth intermingled with lies.

51
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,820
I'm only afraid that Jin Xiu's prediction came true.

52
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,260
If Jin Xian has perpetrated slaughter,

53
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,810
that is a catastrophe for the Immortal Sect.

54
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,770
Cangling, go investigate again in the Xu Zong Sect.

55
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,740
The truth must be found.

56
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,260
All right.

57
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,380
Tonight, the stars are so beautiful.

58
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,810
I still remember that time in the Library Pavillion.

59
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
I can't reach.

60
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,280
Master.

61
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,060
Master.

62
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,190
Master, I can't reach.

63
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,980
Take it.

64
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,650
When I first recruited Mo Qing into the Wan Lu Sect, I found a master for him.

65
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,270
Could it be that the master was a Taoist priest practicing immortality

66
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,400
or a monk practicing Buddhism?

67
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,370
That's why his behavior is like this?

68
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,880
Or maybe he doesn't like my direct flirting?

69
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,220
Master!

70
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,960
Your eyes are pretty! They look like the brightest stars filling the dark night.

71
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,920
Time goes so fast. It seems like it happened yesterday.

72
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,950
But looking back, it feels like it's been very long.

73
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,110
Yesterday, Seventeen came back; she's become quiet.

74
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,010
I suppose it's because these last few days she's had a lot to think about.

75
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,740
Qin Qianxian sought virtue and achieved his Great Way.

76
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,950
Just as he said,

77
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,460
everyone comes empty-handed,

78
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,900
leaves empty-handed.

79
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,640
and, in the end, turns to dust.

80
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,270
That is Qin Qianxian's Way; it isn't yours.

81
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,540
Your Way is me.

82
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,730
Every instant in this world, I want you to spend it with me.

83
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,010
I'm sleepy. I'll sleep a bit.

84
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

85
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
- Sect Leader, what is it?
- Sect Leader, what's going on?

86
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Sect Leader?

87
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,900
Sect Leader?

88
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader, have mercy.

89
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader, spare him!

90
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,100
Sect Leader...

91
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Quick, leave!

92
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Quick, leave!

93
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,300
Sect Leader, have mercy! Sect Leader,

94
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,200
Sect Leader, have mercy!

95
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Sect Leader, spare me! Sect Leader!

96
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Sect Leader, spare me!

97
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,900
Sect Leader, spare me!

98
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
- It's fine.
- Sect Leader...

99
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
- Sect Leader... Sect Leader...
- Sect Leader.

100
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Don't be scared.

101
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
I won't hurt you.

102
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,000
It's fine.

103
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

104
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
I won't hurt you.

105
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
It's fine.

106
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Mo Qing!

107
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
Mo Qing.

108
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,300
You...

109
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,400
Zhaoyao, it wasn't me.

110
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,100
It wasn't me...

111
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,800
I didn't get anything from the Library Pavillion.

112
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,200
Have you two found any other way to seal off Mo Qing's Demon Essence?

113
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,200
I asked a few elders about it,

114
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,900
but they didn't know anything.

115
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Demoness, say, what if tonight Li Chenlan--

116
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Mo Qing wouldn't lie to me.

117
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,500
He said it was the Wanjun Sword that did it. It must have been it.

118
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,300
I believe him.

119
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Zhaoyao, as soon as possible you'll have to prepare for the worst.

120
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,500
You're awake?

121
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,710
I had not slept so peacefully in a long time.

122
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,980
Is it because you suppressed your Demon Essence, or because I was with you?

123
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,620
Let's go for a walk.

124
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,800
Ziyou? Where's your boss? How come he's not in today?

125
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,800
What are you doing?

126
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
Lin Ziyou of the Dark Guards salutes the Sect Leader.

127
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,300
Thank you, Sect Leader, for the grace of saving my life years ago from the Xuesha Sect.

128
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,000
- You...
- Today, I went and looked in the Mirror of Past Memories.

129
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,400
My real name was Lin. I'm the younger brother of Dark Guard Lin Ziyu.

130
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,800
That year I was also a petty official under your command.

131
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,300
They all say that the Dark Guards are loyal.

132
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,200
It accounts for the Wan Lu Sect's growth in the last few years.

133
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,800
It can be said that Dark Guards' loyalty won't go unnoticed.

134
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,500
But, unexpectedly, Li Chenlan was in power for 5 years

135
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,000
and someone harbored treason.

136
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,600
You, a loyal servant, have changed masters three times.

137
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Is Li Chenlan's command not strict?

138
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,800
Although all the Dark Guards are people whose life was saved by Lu Zhaoyao,

139
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,900
loyalty is ideal.

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,100
As for Li Chenlan,

141
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,600
he appears strict, but in truth, he's kind at heart.

142
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,100
The son of the Demon King, kind at heart. Nonsense.

143
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,400
Then if Lu Zhaoyao saved your life once,

144
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,000
you betrayed your life savior.

145
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,900
Don't you feel any guilt?

146
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
The Wan Lu Sect.

147
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,600
In the art of subduing people's minds, they are truly apt.

148
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,900
Sect Leader, is it that you forgot?

149
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,500
So many years have gone by, why remember this?

150
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
Where did Zhu Ji go?

151
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Boss went to look at the Mirror of Past Memories and then disappeared without a trace.

152
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
I don't know where he went, either.

153
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
He disappeared again?

154
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,600
- It's nothing.
- Everyone in Jianghu says

155
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
that Lu Zhaoyao is good at manipulating people's minds.

156
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,300
But I know that the reason the Dark Guards are dead loyal

157
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,100
is not at all that Sect Leader employed any trick.

158
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,400
It's because Sect Leader treats people with a sincere heart.

159
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Sect Leader was true to me. I must protect her with a true heart.

160
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,100
Outside there's some news

161
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,300
that my sister Ziyu did something disloyal.

162
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,300
Sect Leader, my sister was an extremely faithful person.

163
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,400
If she did this, she must have had a reason.

164
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,500
I hope Sect Leader can consider our bond in the Land of Sojourn

165
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,100
and, when the time comes, spare my sister's life.

166
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,600
All right. For your sake, I agree.

167
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
Many thanks, Sect Leader!

168
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,900
Get up, quick.

169
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,800
Since you remembered the past, would you follow me back to the Wan Lu Sect?

170
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Let's leave it. Going back only adds to the pain.

171
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
Why is that?

172
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,000
I have no clinging feeling.

173
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
I can't go through the water of the Cleanse Spring,

174
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
and I've spent all my money.

175
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,100
In the upcoming time, I'll stay in the Land of Sojourn and slowly forget all of it.

176
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,500
In the end, I'll forget myself. I won't exist anymore, either.

177
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,900
Then, where will you go?

178
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,230
I don't know.

179
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,910
The people who forget everything in the Land of Sojourn all disappear in the end.

180
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Mountains and waters sooner or later meet again.

181
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,100
Yes, in the end, everyone will meet again.

182
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,960
I'd never have thought that an accidental access to the Land of Sojourn would bring such an opportunity.

183
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,310
Sect Leader! There's...

184
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,060
This person is very strange.

185
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,700
He came out of the Forbidden Area. He said he wanted to see Sect Leader.

186
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,420
I... I had no idea, and I brought him here.

187
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,480
Master Zhu Ji?

188
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,250
Before, when you said you wanted to go see a relative in the Land of Sojourn,

189
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,740
you meant...

190
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,370
Zhaoyao, this is my father.

191
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm back.

192
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,190
You two take your time.

193
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,570
Yes!

194
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,990
Son, seeing you again...

195
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,310
it is a great joy.

196
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,870
It truly is a great joy.

197
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,050
- Father,
- Yes?

198
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,670
why have you been in the Land of Sojourn so many years?

199
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,090
That year, after I sealed you in,

200
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,150
I went to get the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

201
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,650
Before I could succeed, I was overthrown by a subordinate.

202
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,280
By coincidence, I fell into the Land of Sojourn.

203
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,720
I know.

204
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,070
I did so many things

205
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,810
that were wrong to you.

206
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,450
For sure, you can't forgive me. Very soon...

207
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,720
Very soon, I'll forget all that I've just remembered.

208
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,710
I only remember making you wait for me.

209
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,020
I wanted to come back and see you. I missed you.

210
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,400
Son, I see... I see you are quite well.

211
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,820
I'm relieved.

212
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,710
I can leave with my heart at peace.

213
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,180
Father, you don't have to leave.

214
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,590
Let me and Zhaoyao have one more family member.

215
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,230
All right.

216
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,360
Father, have some tea.

217
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,000
Young Master Liu...

218
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,590
Father! Father...

219
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,000
Who are you?

220
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,700
He's your son. Have you forgotten again?

221
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,500
Son?

222
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,510
My son is young. He isn't so big.

223
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,290
I didn't expect he'd forget so soon after looking into the Mirror of Past Memories.

224
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:46,690
My son's name... is Li Chenlan.

225
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,550
In the beginning, I turned him into my inner demon.

226
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,440
Later on...

227
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,220
he was my son!

228
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,220
But I...

229
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,090
I did him wrong so many times.

230
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,550
I regret it so much.

231
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,460
He...

232
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,270
He...

233
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,410
He's just five.

234
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:35,040
At five he was controlled by the Demon Essence for the first time.

235
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,590
He wanted to kill someone!

236
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,820
I stopped him.

237
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:52,820
But I... I didn't mean to... I broke his elbow.

238
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,620
I thought when he woke up,

239
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,450
he would certainly cry,

240
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,000
he'd make a scene, he'd blame me.

241
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,110
Instead, this child...

242
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,260
he...

243
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,040
he didn't cry!

244
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,690
He... He woke up and smiled at me.

245
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,580
His other hand... just like this... he grabbed my hand.

246
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,270
He still called me "Father."

247
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,230
My son...

248
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,800
Chenlan...

249
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:08,120
I hope you can go through the dust and waves of the world
(Li="experience", Chen="dust", lan="waves")

250
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,830
without affecting your child-like innocence.

[Pure Wave Palace]

252
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,080
Did you take him back to rest?

253
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,320
If he forgets all of it completely,

254
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,590
what should we do?

255
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,490
Whatever he forgets, he won't forget you.

256
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,700
If we can attack Jiangzhou, then we can proceed in a straight line

257
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,350
and strike directly on the Wan Lu Sect's strategic points.

258
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,790
In Jiangzhou, good and bad people are mixed together; there are intricate forces.

259
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,600
A storm attack would not be easy at all.

260
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,640
Tomorrow, go to the Thousand Dust Pavillion. In the name of annihilating the Wan Lu Sect,

261
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,380
ask Qin Qianxian to lend Jiangzhou.

262
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,820
This... I'm afraid Qin Qianxian won't agree.

263
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,540
What I want is precisely that he disagrees.

264
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,840
Zhaoyao must be worrying about me now.

265
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,750
Go ask her to come here. I have something to tell her.

266
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,440
All right. Then just stay put here.

267
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,000
All right.

[Pure Wave Palace]

Say, what should we do now?

270
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,390
Having Seventeen watch him all the time is no solution.

271
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,390
West Hill Master, you are full of ideas. Think about it. What else can we do?

272
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,700
I really don't know.

273
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,590
Sect Leader!

274
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,810
Didn't I tell you to guard Mo Qing? Why are you here?

275
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,390
Sect Leader, Little Monster says he has something to tell you.

276
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,290
Where is he?

277
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,200
Li Chenlan disappeared?

278
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,760
Disappeared?

279
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,630
But then, he... made me leave on purpose.

280
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,940
Demoness, don't panic. Think, first. Where would he go?

281
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,020
I think I know where he is.

282
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,290
He... is prepared for the worst.

283
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,220
Mo Qing.

284
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,130
Mo Qing!

Mo Qing, I know you're inside.
