[The Legends]

00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,840
[Episode 47]

3
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,800
Sect Leader Jiang, do you really mean to be lenient even to the Wan Lu Sect people?

4
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,510
But after all, he's my junior in apprenticeship.

5
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,940
An apostate! How could there be any tie of friendship? Furthermore,

6
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,640
by now he knows I'm in the Xu Zong Sect.

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,560
If we let him report it to the Wan Lu Sect,

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,510
the Xu Zong Sect will immediately face the threat of annihilation.

9
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,050
Even if you value your past comradeship, you still need to keep him prisoner.

10
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,740
Come, men. Detain Gu Hanguang in the dungeons. He's not allowed any contact with the outside world.

11
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,210
Yes.

12
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,890
Master, why are we imprisoning Senior Hanguang?

13
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,210
Our Xu Zong Sect never paid attention to Jianghu's disputes.

14
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,920
And regarding the fight between Jian Xin and the Wan Lu Sect, we've never stepped in!

15
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,570
Because right now, I need Jin Xian's trust.

16
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,110
Master, as your disciple, I think that Senior, after all, used to be a member of our Xu Zong Sect.

17
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,040
Even though he's in the Wan Lu Sect now, what he does is still save the dying and heal the wounded.

18
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,790
It can't be good to go against Senior because of one word by Jian Xin.

19
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,420
- How about we let him go?
- It isn't possible now.

20
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,210
Let three days pass.

21
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,220
After three more days, that'll be good enough.

22
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,900
It's late. You should go to sleep.

23
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,480
Yes.

24
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,850
I finally did it right.

25
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,550
- It's finally right?
- An Si, you try it, too.

26
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,890
See if it will suit Hanguang's tastes. If it isn't good enough, I can make another batch.

27
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,060
What do you think?

28
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,030
It's really good. This will definitely suit Hill Master's tastes.

29
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,990
That's great.

30
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,450
It's not early anymore. Hanguang should be back soon. He'll arrive just in time to eat.

31
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,810
[Xu Zong Sect]

32
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,960
Don't you agree? I disliked him as soon as I saw him.

33
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,080
- Let's have a drink.
- Here, here.

34
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,880
Here! Let's drink.

35
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,500
Here. Keep drinking.

36
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,360
Here! Let's eat!

37
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,420
You, get me some silver needles and medicinal alcohol.

38
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,000
A prisoner in a cell has demands about this and that?

39
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,760
Here. Let's drink.

40
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,800
Distilled liquor is fine, too.

41
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,370
You want it? I still want to drink it.

42
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,140
How's the feeling of being kicked out of the Wan Lu Sect by Li Chenlan and Lu Zhaoyao?

43
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,980
I left of my own will.

44
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,460
Even if you left of your own will,

45
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,120
Jiang Wu, you even gave your heart to Lu Zhaoyao. You saved her life.

46
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,700
But how does she treat you?

47
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,090
Has she ever cared about you?

48
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,680
From start to finish, she's only cared about Li Chenlan.

49
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,390
What is it that you're trying to say?

50
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,540
I know that the Liuhe Tianyi Sword can hurt you. You want to have it.

51
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,740
You just have to cooperate with me to defeat the Wan Lu Sect and kill Lu Zhaoyao.

52
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,380
This sword means nothing to me,

53
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,620
I can give it to you.

54
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,400
You came to the wrong person.

55
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,900
Even as things stand now, you really don't hate Lu Zhaoyao at all?

56
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,370
I love her. I am willing to spoil her.

57
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,090
Just like you are towards Li Chenlan.

58
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,870
The reason I am not killing you today is because you are so pitiful.

59
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,580
If I find out that you've made one move against Lu Zhaoyao,

60
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,050
I'll take your life.

61
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,160
You don't have to worry about this situation. I'll take care of it in a little while.

62
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,940
Jiang Wu has been going against our disciples every possible way.

63
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,340
Many followers of the Wan Lu Sect have died by his sword.

64
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,630
And there's Gu Hanguang. He should be back sometime today. How come we haven't had any news?

65
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,420
Ah Rong, check again. Is Gu Hanguang still in the Xu Zong Sect?

66
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,950
All right.

67
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,170
Someone! Someone! Water!

68

[Spiritual tablet for Sect Master Jiang He]

69
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Master!

70
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,850
I've cooked the Rebirth Herb according to your instructions.

71
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,450
Should I deliver the medicine to Jin Xian?

72
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,370
Master!

73
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,680
This last dose of Rebirth is for myself.

74
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,490
Master Jiang.

75
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
JIn Xian.

76
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,760
Do you plan to treat me here today?

77
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,190
Exactly. You may leave for now.

78
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,520
Master, I want to stay and watch you so I can learn.

79
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,980
Today's treatment process is extremely dangerous. If you stay here, you'll distract us. Leave.

80
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,630
Yes.

81
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,590
Please come with me, Jin Xian.

82
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,020
Sect Master Jiang,

83
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,160
you look very different today.

84
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,650
This is a decisive moment. I have to take it seriously.

85
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,710
Since it's a decisive moment today,

86
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,860
please let me understand

87
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,820
what this dangerous treatment is exactly.

88
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,140
It's the secret technique of the Xu Zong Sect.

89
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,770
I see.

90
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,660
Sect Leader Jiang, you're daring.

91
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,440
Please this way, Jin Xian.

92
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,310
Please cooperate with me by following the mudras in these diagrams.

93
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,470
As expected of the immortal body.

94
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,960
Only this gold body of yours

95
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,830
can withstand the supreme power of the Jiang Clan.

96
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,260
Jiang He!

97
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,750
Have you been treating me in order to steal my immortal body?

98
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,340
Aren't you a disgrace to your clan and ancestors?

99
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,310
Disgrace? I broke the curse of the Jiang Clan and changed our fate.

100
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,690
My ancestors should be proud of me.

101
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,320
That's a fallacy! How absurd!

102
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,200
Absurd? Back when Lady Changyu killed members

103
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,070
of the Qin Clan to awaken you, why didn't you consider that absurd then?

104
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:55,860
When you killed our sect disciple to keep your secret, why didn't you say it was absurd then?

105
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,180
No! Jiang He!

106
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,240
Because you saved my life, I didn't want to hurt you.

107
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,480
You are a hypocrite.

108
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,930
But you're asking for death!

109
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,140
- What a joke! Who do you think you are?
- Jiang He!

110
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,160
Actually, we're the same.

111
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,450
Even the Immortal Sect's righteous way is dead. Yet you are still alive?

112
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,710
- No. Nonsense!
- What a joke.

113
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,890
My power is back.

114
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,210
There are three treasures in the Xu Zong Sect: the secret medicine, the secret magic, and the sect leader.

115
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,560
I've learned a lot today.

116
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,440
What? The Xu Zong Sect was wiped out?

117
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,630
- Investigate at once!
- Yes.

118
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,840
Jin Xian, I heard that everyone was killed at the Xu Zong Sect. I was worried about your safety.

119
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,810
I'm the one who did it.

120
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,740
In order to live past 30 years old,

121
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,580
Jiang He attempted to steal my immortal body.

122
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,160
He was just pretending to be helpful.

123
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,530
He gained my trust by pretending to treat me. But in the end,

124
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,310
he tried to steal my golden body.

125
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,160
Jiang He... How could he do something so dishonorable?

126
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,680
I was shocked myself.

127
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,210
But in the end, I stole Jiang He's power from his clan's secret technique. He also perished as a result.

128
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,600
He deserved it. But I heard it said

129
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,490
that Jiang He died along with his disciples. I don't know...

130
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,780
The Xu Zong disciples attacked me in a pack.

131
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,490
I was forced to use the power I obtained from Jiang He.

132
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,040
For a moment I failed to control the power

133
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,890
and caused this tragedy. It was all my fault.

134
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,580
Jin Xian, don't be too hard on yourself.

135
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,930
You used the secret technique out of desperation.

136
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,280
Yes, there's a lot going on right now.

137
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,380
The Wan Lu Sect is dominating and bullying the weak. I can only make sacrifices for the greater good.

138
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,190
The Xu Zong Sect helped me restore my power by accident.

139
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,190
I'll take it as that they sacrificed themselves for the righteous way of the martial arts world.

140
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,770
Jin Xian, you fight with your own life to defend justice.

141
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,100
The Immortal Sects are fortunate to have you!

142
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,950
Your nobility is unquestionable, evident to Heaven and Earth.

143
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,120
I shall give my all to serve you!

144
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,090
In the last period,

145
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,410
our comrades in the Immortal Sects must have been subjected to too much injustice.

146
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,930
Now that I've regained my power, I believe we can soon return to the peak period of the Immortal Sects.

147
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,050
Together, we must lead the Immortal Sects to eliminate the Wan Lu Sect.

148
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,980
With your leadership, the glory of the Immortal Sects will surely be restored.

149
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,450
Oh right, Jin Xian.

150
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,350
The Liuhe Tianyi Sword is currently in Mount Phoenix.

151
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,190
Lin Ziyu of the Wan Lu Sect stole it when she defected.

152
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,450
Now, both Lin Ziyu and the sword are on Mount Phoenix.

153
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,980
Lin Ziyu?

154
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,490
Sky burlap.

155
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,030
Dahurian Angelica Root.

156
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,490
Notopterygium...

157
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,520
Consume with warm wine.

I joined the sect much later than you, so I didn't go through all that.

314
00:38:53,120 --> 00:39:00,790
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

315
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:08,180
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

316
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:15,780
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

317
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:26,000
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

318
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:47,270
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

319
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:53,020
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

320
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,720
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

321
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,500
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

322
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:08,120
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

323
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:15,650
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

324
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:22,960
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

325
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,730
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

326
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:37,970
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

327
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:45,730
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

328
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:53,190
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

329
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:00,780
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

330
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:10,450
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
