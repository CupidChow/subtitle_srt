00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,800
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,380
Master,

4
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,020
- do you want to be coaxed?
- No.

5
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,420
I think I have to coax.

6
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,650
How would you do it?

7
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,510
Admit my mistake.

8
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,940
What was your mistake?

9
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,750
I shouldn't have allowed my little sister to take action on her own. I made Master worry.

10
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,630
Aside from that... I didn't do anything wrong...

11
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,470
You...

12
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,350
I worry.

13
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,300
Of course, of course! When I go back, I'll yell at her. How could she make Master worry?

14
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,900
If I worry, it's for you.

15
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,030
What's to worry about me? Rather, Master, how's your wound?

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,130
No harm. I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

17
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Master, I want to bring Liu Cangling back to Wan Lu Sect, too.

18
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,060
You're worried about him?

19
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,260
How could I? How could your pupil be worried about anyone but Master?

20
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,890
I'm just concerned that they'll use him again and cause more accidents.

21
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,480
Wait a few days until my wound is healed, and I'll go with you.

22
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,270
Thank you so much, Master!

23
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,330
Bear in mind: you can't act on your own.

24
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Who's there?

25
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,690
Lin Ziyu?

26
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,150
You... What did you come for?

27
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,810
In two hours, Liu Suruo is going to kill Liu Cangling, unless you go to Phoenix Mountain in exchange for him.

28
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,940
Brother Cangling?

29
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,100
Wrong. Why would I believe what you say?

30
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,900
Believe what you want.

31
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,680
What are you doing?

32
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,110
I... I... I want to go down the mountain, stay a couple of days in the village of Shunan, and do good deeds for you.

33
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,060
Tell the truth.

34
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,670
Liu Suruo wants me to go to Phoenix Mountain in exchange for Brother Cangling.

35
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,620
- You can't go.
- I want to go.

36
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,230
If you go, you're just offering them your blood as a gift. Then all our efforts will be for nothing!

37
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,570
But they say they want to kill Brother Cangling! I can't ignore it!

38
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,570
With the power you have, you couldn't beat the most inept of any sect's disciple. Who do you think you can save?

39
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,060
I...

40
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,770
I learned the Teleportation Technique, I can use it to bring Brother Cangling back with me.

41
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,290
What's the rush? I've already talked about it with Mo Qing. As soon as his wounds are better, we'll save Cangling together.

42
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,910
- I can't wait! They'll kill Brother Cangling in two hours!
- They're lying!

43
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,140
If you don't go, nothing will happen to Liu Cangling anyway!

44
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,420
No way. I don't care.

45
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,170
I told you! You can't go!

46
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,270
I'm sorry, Demoness, I can't risk it.

47
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,210
Qin Zhiyan!

48
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:04,430
Revered Lady, we've waited such a long time. If Qin Zhiyan doesn't come,

49
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,660
what will you do, then?

50
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,870
She will come.

51
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,650
Where's Brother Cangling?

52
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,270
The real and the fake Qin Zhiyan already made a fool of me once.

53
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,380
If you want Liu Cangling, give me proof.

54
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,410
What kind of proof do you want?

55
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,490
Let's try and we'll know.

56
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,720
Today, I was able to come, the same way as I can leave. Bring Brother Cangling out first, I want to make sure he's all right.

57
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,530
Cangling!

58
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,530
Brother Cangling.

59
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,640
Brother Cangling?

60
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,530
Qin Zhiyan!

61
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,260
Blood!

62
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,470
First: promise that if I give you my blood, you'll let us go.

63
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,160
I promise.

64
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,340
Miss Zhiyan!

65
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,970
I've had an injury and can't use the Teleportation Technique. Find someone to take me to Phoenix Mountain.

66
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,970
Phoenix Mountain? Haven't we already stopped the Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sect on Phoenix Mountain?

67
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,160
Cut the crap. I'm telling you to take me there, just do it!

68
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,380
I'll go report to the Sect Leader.

69
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,120
Miss Zhiyan, how did you get hurt?

70
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,110
- I'll report to Sect Leader now and call South Hills Master here.
- No need.

71
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,190
I'm not going anywhere.

72
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,900
Revered Lady, I heard you say earlier that you would only draw blood.

73
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,510
Fine.

74
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,150
Lock them up.

75
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,870
You said you'd let us go.

76
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,640
- Revered Lady...
- I said I'd let them go, but not that I'd let them go immediately.

77
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,100
Liu Suruo...

78
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:04,090
Jin Xian hasn't been awakened yet. In order to prevent any mishap, it's best to lock the two of them up.

79
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,470
As things are now, we must avoid the smallest risk when we are at a hair's breadth from success.

80
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,720
A miracle! You actually came on your own for the change of your dressing.

81
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,540
An Si, come help me here.

82
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,440
This is... a new medicine ingredient?

83
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
Yes. And it is extremely rare.

84
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,260
Do you need a servant to test it?

85
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,900
No need. Don't I have someone ready just in front of me?

86
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,120
- Go on, let's apply the medicine.
- You want to test it on me?
- Are you honored?

87
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,340
As I see it, this wound you have can't be healed in a short while.

88
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,710
I'm just adding some Rebirth. Let's watch its prodigious effects.

89
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,130
- An Si, brew it.
- Yes.

90
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,110
Isn't this medicine for external use?

91
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,860
Didn't we say we are testing it? I have to put external application and oral administration together to know if it works.

92
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,730
Then, what if it's lethal?

93
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,360
What are you afraid of? Didn't you say early on that you were always prepared to die?

94
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,310
Brother Cangling, you must be fine.

95
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,230
- Father!
- Don't come here!

96
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,840
- Pavillion Master Tang.
- Pavillion Master Tang.

97
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,750
- I'm here to verify Qin Zhiyan's identity.
- Yes!

98
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,300
Brother Cangling, you will be all right.

99
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,310
Mingxuan, I've endeavored for so many years.

100
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,970
I can finally see you!

101
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,070
That aisle that you walked me down to, that year... I've been looking forward to your awakening

102
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,470
to walk to it with you once more.

103
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:04,450
Great Way of death. Sky falling. Earth in darkness.

104
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:25,080
Void of light. Universe within.

105
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,880
Hunger deep and obscure craving.

106
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,180
Motionless. Break away!

107
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,760
Everyone, I'm rejoicing. I have now found the person meant for me.

108
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,520
The person I'm willing to grow old with.

109
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,630
As of today I, Luo Mingxuan, am pledging to Liu Suruo

110
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,820
to spend a lifetime together.

111
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,660
- Felicitations, Jin Xian! Felicitations, Revered Lady!
- Felicitations, Jin Xian! Felicitations, Revered Lady!

112
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,430
I guessed right! I guessed right!

113
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,290
"Guessed"?

114
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,160
At first, I was afraid this medicine may cause you some rejection.

115
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,430
I didn't expect it would be so fitting.

116
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,070
Before I used the medicine, I still wondered

117
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,290
whether trogopterus dung or cuttlebone matched it best.

118
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,090
Or maybe Phoenyx root, mangosteen...

119
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,240
Shoud I kill you? I asked myself that, a lot of times.

120
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,860
Or maybe loropetalum, hairyvein agrimony, eclipta...

121
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,200
Anyway, in the end, I guessed right.

122
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,320
I really am a prodigy!

123
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,010
- Hey, look at the sky!
- What is it? What is it?

124
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,560
What's going on?

125
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,210
You just got better! Don't go showing off!

126
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,370
- Small!
- Big, big, big!

127
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,880
Three, three, two. Eight dots. Small! Give money, give money!

128
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,940
You've won all morning. Are you tricking us?

129
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,540
Am I that kind of person? If you don't have money to play, just go!

130
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,680
If you have no money, what are you playing at?

131
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,720
- With no money you still want to bet?
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait! Sit.

132
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,920
Let's do this: I'm staking here all my winnings from the last few days.

133
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,460
You lot, shake the dice. Fair enough?

134
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,640
Fine. Stake it!

135
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,730
- Small!
- Big! Big! Big! Big!

136
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,420
One, one, three. Five dots. Small!

137
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:27,420
Wait, wait! It's big! It's big! We won!

138
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,980
What was that blasted wind?

139
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,470
I'm asking you all, where is she?

140
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,970
This subordinate doesn't know.

141
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,430
Sect Leader!

142
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,450
- Where's Qin Zhiyan?
- Miss Zhiyan last night wanted to be taken to Mount Phoenix.

143
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,030
Then she said there was no need. When I came here, both Misses Zhiyan were gone.

144
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,150
The Dark Guards at the door said

145
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,210
that they think they heard fighting inside last night.

146
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,750
Sect Leader?

147
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,600
What was that blasted wind? It doesn't count! It doesn't count!

148
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,090
Sect Leader!

149
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,100
S-Sect Leader!

150
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,600
Lu Zhaoyao! I know you're here!

151
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,580
Zhaoyao! Lu Zhaoyao!

152
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,190
Lu Zhaoyao!

153
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,730
Lu Zhaoyao!

154
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,290
If there's anything, you can talk to me!

155
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,420
So you already knew.

156
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,580
Whatever you're planning, you can tell me. We can discuss it together.

157
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,520
If Luo Mingxuan didn't wake up, everything's easy to say.

158
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,740
If Luo Mingxuan woke up, there's nothing to talk about.

159
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,100
This score is between me and him. No one is allowed to help. And no one is allowed to stop me.

160
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,970
Even if I'm dead, I'll crawl out from hell

161
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,100
and use my carcass and my dry bones

162
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,230
to make Luo Mingxuan's Golden Body go to waste!

163
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,800
[Land of Sojourn]

164
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,390
You must not be alone.

165
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,250
You've worked so hard.

166
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,690
For this moment, any hardship was worth it.

167
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,260
- Make way! Make way!
- What's with her? She's crazy!

168
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,000
- Make way!
- Slow down!

169
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,720
Make way!

170
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,320
Sister!

171
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,850
Sister,

172
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,950
what's with the rush? If you have anything to say, just talk.

173
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,490
Buy a few Empty Pills for me.

174
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,630
And here I wondered what the urgency was.

175
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm minding my own business here, were you afraid I'd run?

176
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,850
I don't have money now. Buy it for me. I'll pay you back later.

177
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,610
This... I... You want me to buy the things in my own shop?

178
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,760
Will you do it or not?

179
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,180
This... This... I'm afraid there's no way...

180
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,790
Sister, it's not that I don't want to help you.

181
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,130
Even though I'm the one who opened the shop,

182
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,210
I have my own difficulties.

183
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,590
I'll make it short. You must let me finish; otherwise, really no one can help you.

184
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,790
First, my real name is not "Ziyou."

185
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,230
Whatever it was, I forgot it, too.

186
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,540
So if you want to repay me, it's impossible.

187
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,440
Second, in our Land of Sojourn we have a rule of steel:

188
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,290
I can buy things for you,

189
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,400
but the condition is that we must have a family relationship.

190
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,230
You've thinned so much.

191
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,920
You don't like me anymore?

192
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
How could that be?

193
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,150
I've kept good care of all your things

194
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,770
because I was sure that sooner or later you would come back.

195
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,540
Slow down!

196
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,120
As a blood sacrifice to Phoenix Mountain, I'll wish you happiness with your own life!

197
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
Just hearing it, I feel joyous.

198
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,150
Now you are finally back.

199
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,270
We can complete the wedding we left unfinished.

200
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,860
If it weren't for that Lu Zhaoyao, we would have become man and wife long ago.

201
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,330
Fortunately, she's dead now. There's no one to bother us again.

202
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,140
Lu Zhaoyao died?

203
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,500
A few years ago, she wanted to get the Wanjun Sword.

204
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,920
She died in the Sword Tomb.

205
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
How has the Immortal Sect been doing?

206
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,900
Ever since you were sealed off, the Immortal Sects have been disunited like grains of sand.

207
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,640
They are not of one mind as they used to be.

208
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,450
But it is fine. We can still hold our own with Wan Lu Sect.

209
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,590
SInce Lu Zhaoyao is dead,

210
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,280
Wan Lu Sect's Hill Masters

211
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,190
shouldn't have been strong enough to fight us.

212
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,630
Why did we get such a result today?

213
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,580
With just a few Hills Masters, of course, she could not have achieved such a success.

214
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,370
But the current Wan Lu Sect Leader has many tricks.

215
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,220
Mingxuan, I suppose you'll remember who he is.

216
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,720
Who?

217
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,790
The Son of the Demon King. Li Chenlan.

218
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,130
Where is Chi Tianming at present?

219
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,230
He's waiting in the Phoenix's Song Hall with the other sect leaders.

220
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,490
They're waiting for you to come out and discuss matters, presiding over the meeting.

221
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,560
Fine. I'll go and have a look.

222
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,250
Young lady, I see your figure is upright.

223
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,740
Lady, what are you doing?

224
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,450
Your butt is tight, too. You may as well tell me your birthdate and horoscope;

225
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,350
let's see if it's a good match with my son's horoscope.

226
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,840
Lady, I think I'm not fitting for your son.

227
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,410
Consider it again. If you agree, I can give you anything.

228
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,080
No, no!

229
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,810
Girl! Girl! Don't go! Don't go!

230
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,690
I'm willing to get married to your son. We can have the wedding right now.

231
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,960
But I have one condition: you have to give me the Empty Pill as dowry, immediately.

232
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,210
Girl, your figure's upright.

233
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,210
Your butt is tight, too. Fine! It will be you!

234
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,190
We'll have the wedding right now. We'll sign the contract.

235
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,220
I'll present the Empty Pill to you right away.

236
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,870
I want the most expensive.

237
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,290
As long as my son likes you, any price is fine.

238
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,850
No need for the horoscope?

239
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,180
I have a bunch of horoscopes. What else do I want?

240
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,140
I have a daughter-in-law!

241
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,550
I have a daughter-in-law!

242
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,320
I have a daughter-in-law! Son, come, quick!

243
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,770
Mother has found you a good wife.

244
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,440
My son is timid.

245
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,790
From now on, you two are a family. Don't be mad at him.

246
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,340
Why are you standing there? Hurry up and sign the marriage contract.

247
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,020
Once the contract is signed, we'll go buy the dowry.

248
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,560
Son, don't you like her?

249
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,120
Sign!

250
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,360
Say you do.

251
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,650
I... I like her.

252
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,080
As long as you like her, everything is fine!

253
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,450
Hurry up, sign!

254
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,430
Quick, sign! Your bride is even more in a haste than you!

255
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,810
Quick, sign! Come on, here!

256
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,140
Here, sign! Sign!

257
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,420
Wonderful! Wonderful!

258
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,500
I have a daughter-in-law!

259
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,350
Wonderful!

260
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,330
[Wu'e Hall]

261
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,590
Reporting to Sect Leader. We have news that Jin Xian came back to life.

262
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,090
I know I should not have come to Wu'e Hall on duty.

263
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:34,550
It's only because Qin Zhiyan betrayed Wan Lu Sect and donated her blood to Liu Suruo, thus reviving Jin Xian,

264
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,920
- ...so I reckon...
- Why are you certain that Qin Zhiyan betrayed Wan Lu Sect?

265
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,560
Qin Qianxian's whereabouts are also unknown.

266
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,100
Why don't you doubt it's him?

267
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,240
I'm guessing, too.

268
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,420
You're hiding something from me.

269
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,240
Captain...

270
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,960
Sect Leader! Please, Sect Leader, calm down.

271
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Step aside!

272
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,560
Sect Leader, your eyes...

273
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:48,850
Come, people! Lock Lin Ziyu in the dungeon!

274
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,890
Sect Leader! The Captain's devotion is obvious to all.

275
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,920
Until the whole truth is revealed, Sect Leader, please reconsider.

276
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,390
Shut up!

277
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,390
If you plead for her again, you'll be held with her!

278
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,860
Sect Leader!

279
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,300
What do you think your devotion is worth?

280
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,540
You're nothing but a dog under Li Chenlan's command.

281
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,180
Envoy the Dark Guards as back-up on Phoenix Mountain.

282
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,600
Yes.

283
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,230
Are you awake? How's your wound? Let me see.

284
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,520
East Hill Master, I'm indebted to you for your care.

285
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,590
We actually came to this place.

286
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,100
You know where this is?

287
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,760
A recess in Sushan's maze.

288
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,600
Then, what's the difference from that place before?

289
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,760
It's even harder to get out.
