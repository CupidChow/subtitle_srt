[The Legends]

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,930
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,940
Little Monster, when were you able to tell me apart from Zhiyan?

4
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,290
When you took the blow from Yuan Jie in order to save Liu Cangling. I knew, then.

5
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,480
Only you have such a look and imposing manner.

6
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,260
Once you were sure, you gave me this?

7
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,040
What is it? Back then, you put this on me at the mountain gate. Now, you put it on me again.

8
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,440
Is this something important?

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,480
You knew about that?

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,830
I recalled some past memories when I was in the Land of Sojourn.

11
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,220
Tell me first. What is this? Why should I wear it?

12
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,980
This is a Heart Prying Mirror.

13
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,010
Heart Prying Mirror?

14
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,730
I'd had it on me since I was young. I don't know its function either.

15
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,040
After our encounter at the mountain gate, I wanted to give you something.

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,180
But I had nothing else on me, so I gave you this.

17
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,100
Only then, did I find out why it's called "Heart Prying Mirror."

18
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,700
Why?

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,090
It's because it can pry into a person's heart.

20
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,380
It allows me to see what you're up to all the time.

21
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,200
- Little Monster, I didn't know you were that kind of person.
- No!

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,030
I only found out its effect after I gave it to you.

23
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,710
I did feel awkward, too.

24
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,380
Awkward? If so, why didn't you take it back?

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,280
I wanted to take it back, but how could I explain to you why this Heart Prying Mirror was on you?

26
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,130
To tell the truth...

27
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,360
it was really not easy.

28
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,410
Forget about it. I've had it on for so many years.

29
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,990
After so long, I'll just wear it then.

30
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,240
Let's not bring up the past.

31
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,960
Let's go.

32
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,390
Demoness!

33
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,190
Demoness!

34
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,540
Demoness, this... this is for you.

35
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,500
Hurry to get good seats. The storyteller is at the tea parlor...

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
There's a new story. It'll be too late if we take any longer!

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,200
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

38
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,730
Little Monster, let's go listen to the storytelling.

39
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,440
All right.

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,910
Can I... go with you?

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,060
Your legs are with you. I can't stop you.

42
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,270
This is a must-tell story about Qin Qianxian and Lu Zhaoyao.

43
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,010
Today, we've come to the finale.

44
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,040
All right.

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,620
Everyone, listen to me. I'll explain in good order.

46
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,640
It's said that Qin Qianxian kept Lu Zhaoyao in an ice cavern.

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,860
He kept her for five years.

48
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,920
Is that true? Lu Zhaoyao is too pitiful.

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Of course, it's true. It was for five full years.

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,090
In these five years,

51
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,150
Lu Zhaoyao endured Qin Qianxian's stare day after day.

52
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,600
However her body was frozen, and she couldn't move.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,760
So she could only endure being peeped at by this evil gaze.

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,260
Never did I expect that Qin Qianxian would behave so immorally.

55
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,960
He looks pure and noble. But actually, he's such a pervert.

56
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,740
He actually did such a thing to Lu Zhaoyao.

57
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,010
Did Qin Qianxian actually do anything to Lu Zhaoyao?

58
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,080
How can they...

59
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,600
slander my uncle in such a manner?

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,530
It was Qin Qianxian who took you away from the Sword Tomb? And he even hid you away.

61
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,630
Why do people always talk about me?

62
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,750
And they paint me like I have no power or prestige!

63
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,260
As for the details, listen to me

64
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,220
and I'll slowly tell it to you.

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,360
Don't let me hear this rumor again

66
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,360
within 100 miles around Chenji Mountain.

67
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,580
All right. It's late.

68
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,300
Let's head over to Qianjin's for hotpot.

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,380
Let's go.

70
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,430
They are gone.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,420
Why didn't you go out to have some fun?

72
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,440
I heard that there's a night market, and it's very lively.

73
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,770
Sect Leader doesn't want me anymore. So, I...

74
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,950
In that case, East Hill Master, would you like to go moongazing with me?

75
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,000
Moongazing? What is the point of that?

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,820
Looking at the scenery, you won't feel so upset.

77
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,300
All right then! Let's go take a look then.

78
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,910
It's such a beautiful scene. It can help solve the unresolved matters in your heart.

79
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,590
I think the moon isn't beautiful. It's just a yellowish round thing hanging in the sky.

80
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,490
But... you under the moon look good.

81
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,410
Beautiful.

82
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,360
Why is there a dark vapor coming out of your wound?

83
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,390
It's fine.

84
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,100
Truly?

85
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,740
East Hill Master, you carry drumsticks along with you?

86
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,780
Shen Qianjin had invited everyone over to have hotpot tonight.

87
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,890
But I didn't feel like going. So, I brought the drumstick along.

88
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,620
Why didn't you go?

89
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,960
I don't want to see that Little Monster with my sect leader. It's annoying.

90
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
For me?

91
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,630
Thanks.

92
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,240
You're welcome.

93
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,190
Right now, we're having drumsticks here.

94
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,190
I wonder what my sect leader is up to.

95
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,020
I really like my sect leader.

96
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,130
But why?

97
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,600
The one keeping her company is that Little Monster...

98
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,970
But I really want to be with Sect Leader.

99
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,370
When I think of this, I even lose my appetite for the drumstick.

100
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:48,010
East Hill Master, living in the world, unsatisfactory events...

101
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,900
will occur eighty to ninety percent of the time.

102
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,580
That's not right.

103
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,310
Since I like Sect Leader so much, I should be with her all the time.

104
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,500
It wasn't easy for her to return. I can't waste time.

105
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,490
Let's go and have hotpot all together.

106
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,550
Come on. Let's go together.

107
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,090
Let's go!

108
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's go! Hurry up!

109
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,730
Hurry!

110
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,530
Sect Leader, I'm here to have hot pot!

111
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,790
Pavillion Leader Qin.

112
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,460
Uncle!

113
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,180
Pavillion Leader Qin.

114
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,050
- If it is a bother...
- No bother, no bother.

115
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,970
Here, come.

116
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,520
Sit down. Sit down!

117
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,350
Wow! So many foods. Aren't you eating?

118
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,520
It's rare to have everyone together. How about a drinking game?
(Game: each speaks in turn, according to the theme).

119
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,070
Sect Leader Shen, where did you get that wine?

120
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,010
In the kitchen's cellar. I took it when passing.

121
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,650
This is a medicinal liquor that Hill Master has been treasuring for many years.

122
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,200
- Only two pots in the world. It's priceless. To drink it on hot pot...
- You talk too much.

123
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,710
All right. What kind of game?

124
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,780
You drink as a penalty. Say a sentence of five characters. Whoever can't keep the chain, loses.

125
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,130
Enough, pour a little less.

126
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,600
Good! I'll go first.

127
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,740
But... What's the theme?

128
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,610
You just have to say a sentence about wine.

129
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,840
I - just - love - drinking - wine.

130
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Heaven - may - not - love - wine.

131
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,570
Earth - may - not - love - wine.

132
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,850
No - wine - star - in - Heaven.

133
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,260
No - wine - spring - on - Earth.

134
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,110
- Um - ah - hey - ern - huh.
- Good!

135
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,200
You lost. Drink.

136
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,860
This wine is good. There's no harm in losing several times.

137
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,990
Then this time let's start from Pavillion Leader Qin.

138
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,730
How about, "clouds"?

139
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,470
Fine.

140
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,490
"Flourishing fragrant beauty on Wushan,

141
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,020
after rain and clouds, heartbreak."
(Quote from a poem about a king's encounter with a nymph)

142
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,080
"After exploring the sea, no water shines. After meeting in Wushan, no cloud appears."
(From Yuan Zhen's poem, means "only you hold interest for me")

143
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,850
"Clouds resembling your dress; flowers, your face,

144
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,570
dew-glittering peonies in the Spring breeze."
(From Li Bai's poem, in the "Pure and peaceful tune" collection)

145
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,790
Head in the clouds!

146
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,360
Good! Good!

147
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,530
Good!

148
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,730
All right, all right! I'll drink!

149
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll drink for you.
(Note: it's a sign of submission and respect)

150
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,330
You'll drink every time I lose?

151
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,860
Fine. This time... Where do we start?

152
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,920
My turn! "Loving melons"!

153
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,430
I - want - to - eat - melons.

154
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,610
I - do - not - eat - melons.

155
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,720
I - so - love - eating - melons.

156
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,660
I'll drink for you.

157
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,990
Huh... this... that...

158
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,640
Next. Pavillion Leader Qin, please. Pavillion Leader, go on.

159
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,610
Ah, what are you all saying?

160
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,940
Zhiyan, you can't drink anymore. From now on, I'll drink for you.

161
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,520
No need!

162
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,760
Pearls to swine. What a pity!

163
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,450
I'll drink, too!

164
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,620
Pavillion Leader Qin, please, take Seventeen back.

165
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,770
No need for Teleportation. Let's walk back.

166
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,270
Let's go.

167
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,180
Demoness.

168
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,440
Demoness!

169
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,720
Demoness!

170
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,790
Demoness!

171
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,360
Demoness! Demoness!

172
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,020
Demoness...

173
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,050
Lu Zhaoyao, stop there!

174
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,630
You...

175
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,130
you've been mad for too long!

176
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,810
How can you... you...

177
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,220
How can you be so hard to coax?

178
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,140
I know you're ignoring me on purpose. Made me drink wine.

179
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,560
But, you know,

180
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,170
the time when you disappeared,

181
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,150
I felt so guilty. I was so worried about you!

182
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,140
You were always fierce to me, all the time.

183
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,950
But in my heart, I knew!

184
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,890
I knew you were good to me!

185
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,620
You taught me to be strong,

186
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,460
how to survive in this cold world.

187
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,250
That day...

188
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,570
That day, actually, I was hurting, too.

189
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,860
I couldn't not save Brother Cangling,

190
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,350
but I didn't think I would harm you like that.

191
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,630
I was wrong.

192
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,690
I really know I was wrong!

193
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,180
Don't leave me, all right?

194
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,610
I... had prepared for you

195
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,730
an Earth-shattering amazing gift to apologize to you.

196
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,620
But... then I thought it wasn't good enough for you.

197
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,450
This... I've been embroidering it carefully for a long time.

198
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
For you.

199
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,630
These two ducklings are quite unique. I like it.

200
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,190
Aren't these... Mandarin Ducks?

201
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,390
What do you know?

202
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,590
These are phoenixes.

203
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,680
Fine. Regarding the past, we'll turn a new leaf. Whoever mentions it again will get a beating.

204
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,910
You're the best!

205
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,210
But... what was that Earth-shattering amazing gift you bought for me?

206
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,210
White jade... Madiao.

207
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,450
Let's take her back to Gu Hanguang's.

208
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,920
Let's bring her back to Cleanse Dust Palace.

209
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,730
Before, when I was in Immortal Sect, I'd never have thought

210
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,880
that in Wan Lu Sect there could be something like this.

211
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,910
A bunch of infamous villains just sharing a hot pot together.

212
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,060
Compared with the Immortal Sect, this bunch of villains

213
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,330
are the ones with real feelings.

214
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,700
Sect Leader Shen, do you have any worry?

215
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,010
I crippled my own power. I can't hold the post of sect leader in Rain View House any longer.

216
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,520
I feel guilty towards my sisters. It's my own unrest.

217
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,640
Sect Leader Shen, do you regret it?

218
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,750
I feel guilt, no regret.

219
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,400
Sect Leader Shen, you are very clear.

220
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,870
Given the situation, for the future of Rain View House, Sect Leader Shen,

221
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,350
I suppose you'll have to make arrangements.

222
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,560
Cangling, this time you have really matured. You show your father's style.

223
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,500
Speaking of, I heard that Sect Leader Liu is also recovering in Wan Lu Sect's courtyard.

224
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,020
What plans do you have for the future?

225
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,440
I've seen my father. His health is good.

226
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,010
The two of us are planning

227
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,230
to return to Jianxin Sect in a few days.

228
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,050
Along with Miss Zhiyan?

229
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,820
[Xu Zong Sect]

230
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,010
Jin Xian, your injury is almost healed.

231
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,040
Time goes so fast. Today, it's the Qixi festival again.

232
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,230
Qixi?

233
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,630
Great Miss, it's this man who stole the fish from the pond.

234
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,020
What did you steal the fish for?

235
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,150
My mother is ill. We have no money to cure her.

236
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,960
I loaned all the money I could. I was really desperate, otherwise...

237
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,420
Then somebody told me

238
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,750
that the fish in the sect pond could be sold for money, so I...

239
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,380
I know I was wrong, Great Miss. I know I was wrong.

240
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,410
It's pardonable. But I still have to punish you.

241
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,590
Great Miss, I only did it because I was really desperate!

242
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,760
Great Miss, I really know I was wrong.

243
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,220
I really know I was wrong.

244
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,440
I'll punish you because you did wrong.

245
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,770
You stole something that didn't belong to you.

246
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,560
Not punishing you would be against the rules.

247
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,300
After your punishment, go to the accountant and get 40 pieces of silver.

248
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,070
Cure your mother.

249
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,010
Thank you, Great Miss! Thank you, Great Miss!

250
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,300
Thank you, Great Miss!

251
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,050
- Take him away.
- Yes.

252
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,750
Mingxuan!

253
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,510
In the few days I haven't seen you, Suruo, you've become more decisive.

254
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,780
Is it a compliment, or are you saying I'm too stern?

255
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,600
Of course, it's a compliment.

256
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,990
What did you come here for, today?

257
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,370
Today, it's Qixi. I'll take you to light lanterns.

258
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,890
Jin Xian... Jin Xian?

259
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,070
I have been asking Jin Xian a question for a while, but there was no response.

260
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,960
I wonder if you feel any physical discomfort.

261
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,180
Nothing. It's only that I just recollected some past things.

262
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,460
I wonder how Jin Xian is feeling these days.

263
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,490
Sect Leader Jiang, your medical skills are excellent.

264
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,670
Now, by and by, I can use some power.

265
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,560
How can Jianghu's scandalous gossip slander our Pavillion Leader to this point?

266
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,600
Pavillion Leader is now at the Wan Lu Sect having his wound treated. I fear it will incite even more misunderstandings.

267
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,140
It's all my fault. I didn't think it through. Had I known at the time, I should have brought Pavillion Leader back myself.

268
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,010
I'll depart for Wan Lu Sect immediately, get Pavillion Leader to come back, and clarify the matter.

269
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,830
- Yes!
- Yes!

270
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,170
It looks like Brother Cangling's sword mastery has become formidable.

271
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,890
Thinking back, I think the last time I sparred with Brother Cangling

272
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,500
was still on my 16th birthday.

273
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,170
That day you thought I'd forgotten your birthday. When you hit, you showed no mercy.

274
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,020
Back then I was short-tempered.

275
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,690
Compared to then, you are so much more sensible now.

276
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,100
So many things have happened.

277
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,690
How could I be the same as before?

278
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,130
You really have grown sensible, and stronger than before.

279
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,090
Zhiyan, I'm planning to leave.

280
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,370
I want to go back to Jianxin Sect

281
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,490
and take my responsibility.

282
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,720
When are you leaving?

283
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
Tomorrow.

284
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,290
Brother Cangling,

285
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,230
you must be well.

286
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,160
I lost so many times, now I've finally won!

287
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,810
Ah Wu, there's big news.

288
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,560
I was just informed. There was strife inside the Wan Lu Sect. Yuan Jie's dead.

289
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,160
Lin Ziyu ran. It's all around Jianghu.

290
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,750
A good thing.

291
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,060
The Wan Lu Sect this time suffered a great loss.

292
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,720
This is just the right time and place. If we ally with Lord Jin Xiu again

293
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,070
and make a new scheme, you think we can't occupy Wan Lu Sect?

294
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,210
I'm afraid it's not that easy. Lu Zhaoyao returned to Wan Lu Sect.

295
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,390
Lu Zhaoyao returned to Wan Lu Sect?

296
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,600
How did she come back?

297
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,650
How else could she have come back? Walking!

298
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,650
I hear she walked into Wu'e Hall drenched in rain like Asura
(Note: from Indian mythology, malevolent spirit in deep ocean)

299
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,120
and under everyone's eyes, she kissed Li Chenlan.

300
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,160
Li Chenlan didn't oppose it?

301
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,980
Why would Li Chenlan oppose it?

302
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,890
Right now, the whole of Jianghu's saying that Lu Zhaoyao bristled in anger for her man

303
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,490
and killed the traitorous Yuan Jie. Now in Wan Lu Sect, up and down,

304
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,520
no one dares question Li Chenlan's position as sect leader.

305
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,090
Didn't Li Chenlan love Little Beauty?

306
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,570
How did he set eyes on someone else?

307
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,320
This thing isn't clear.

308
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,400
Qin Qianxian is in Wan Lu Sect, too.

309
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,670
I'll go to Wan Lu Sect and have a look.

310
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,660
Did you get back in time to spend Qixi wih Yuezhu?

311
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,420
Luckily, I came back early; otherwise, I'd have missed it.

312
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,620
Ah Rong, I need you to check something for me.

313
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,220
Just say it.

314
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,790
Lin Ziyu fled in the confusion.

315
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,400
I hope you can find her whereabouts and bring her back.

316
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,620
You... aren't willing to let her go?

317
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,320
She must be disposed of.

318
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,390
Chenlan, this matter...

319
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,710
I want to discuss it with you in person.

320
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,020
- Little Monster!
- All right.

321
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,760
Little Monster, you stress too much as Sect Leader. You never take a rest.

322
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,670
How's your wound's recovery coming along?

323
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,690
Do you feel bored?

324
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,050
And you've also learned to change the subject.

325
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:13,860
In Wu'e Hall, you looked like you were possessed by the devil.

326
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,260
Don't worry. I'm really all right.

327
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,350
The wounds I had are almost healed, too.

328
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,620
Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

329
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,200
Sect Leader, I missed you!

330
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,750
All right!

331
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,240
Thank you for everyone's care these few days.

332
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,220
Wan Lu Sect's library pavilion surely deserves its reputation.

333
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,920
I took great benefit.

334
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,380
Did you find what you wanted?

335
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,030
This time in Wan Lu Sect, I've procrastinated for several days.

336
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,520
Today, I'm here to bid my farewell to all of you.

337
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,690
What happened to you?

338
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,730
It's no concern.

339
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,930
- Pavillion Leader! Pavillion Leader!
- Beautiful One! Beautiful One!

340
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,670
Call Gu Hanguang here!

341
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,280
Pavillion Leader!

342
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,520
[Wan Lu Sect]

343
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,650
Brother Cangling...

344
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,660
Brother Cangling.

345
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,100
Take care.

346
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,540
One day I hope to see Jianxin Sect

347
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,340
rise once more, unchanged in its immortal spirit,

348
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,380
reflecting the pure heart of the world.
(Note: "Jianxin" means "to reflect the heart")

349
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,290
Young Master Liu, goodbye for now.

350
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,970
Take good care of yourself.

351
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:11,400
♫  One night like a dream, there’s a curse inside my heart ♫

352
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:19,300
♫  One word flies by, suddenly forgetting past worries ♫

♫ a lifetime's stake... ♫

362
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,370
How did he get this wound?

363
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,720
It was inflicted by Jiang Wu.

364
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,670
Li Chenlan, his wound appears almost the same as yours.

365
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,240
Then, is it serious?

366
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,180
No matter. He'll be fine after resting a few days in the sect.

367
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,180
You two, get out.

368
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,600
- Why?!
- Why?!

369
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,840
You're too loud.

370
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,670
Hold him up and take him to rest.

371
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,480
Take it easy, Seventeen.

372
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,530
Li Chenlan,

373
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:13,970
that dark vapor you had in the past, was it because you'd taken some beating from New Mountain's Jiang Wu?

374
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,630
If you didn't suffer at his hands, then it's related to an inner demon.

375
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,020
Do you still want to keep it from me, now?

376
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,580
Fine. I guess it's my bad luck.

377
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,320
The Nine Heavens Spell has depleted your inner energy.

378
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,690
For now, you must not use your power. Otherwise, even the gods won't be able to save you.

379
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,510
I know what I'm doing.

380
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,560
This thing must not go back to Zhaoyao. I'm afraid she'll worry.

381
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,980
Even now, you still have room to worry about others?

382
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,240
Take care of yourself!

383
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,790
Come, people!

384
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,800
- Sect Leader.
- I want to go to Jiangzhou. I'll go first.

385
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,300
Have someone follow me to use Wind Ride Spell.

386
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,590
Qingrong, from now on the Rain View Sect is in your hands.

387
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,430
Sect Leader, Immortal Sect has had heavy losses, it's a time of crisis.

388
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,300
You want to resign as Sect Leader and stay in Wan Lu Sect?

389
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,420
How will Rain View Sect hold a place in the Immortal Sects?

390
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,260
Sect Leader, you can't abandon all the sisters without care.

391
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,760
Please, Sect Leader, reconsider.

392
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,950
My cultivation is destroyed. I now have no more power to protect Rain View Sect.

393
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,170
You remembered?

394
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,360
You've always known?

395
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,250
When our teacher was still among us, I heard something from her.

396
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,720
Senior, how can you abandon all the sisters from Rain View Sect for your personal interest?

397
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,980
I failed Rain View Sect. Please, Sister, fulfill this wish.

398
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,830
I'll take this sword.

399
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,470
You, Shen Qianjin, from now on will have no more ties with Rain View Sect.

400
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:34,140
Chenlan, you ordered the Dark Guards to hunt down the surviving traitors. This was never your style.

401
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,860
Lin Ziyu holds bitter hatred for Zhaoyao. Zhaoyao came back after endless hardships.

402
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,030
There can be no lurking danger around her.

403
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:49,040
After the Nine Heaven Spell, your inner demon

404
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,530
has been troubling your mind?

405
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,600
For the moment, it is nothing serious.

406
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,920
All right. I'll pass the order to go check on Lin Ziyu's whereabouts.

407
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,140
But I hope that this decision wasn't pushed by your inner demon.

408
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,670
Ah Rong!

409
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:20,010
Zhaoyao is back now. How about you come back to Wan Lu Sect with me and stay for a few days?

410
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,230
No. Yuezhu is still here.
