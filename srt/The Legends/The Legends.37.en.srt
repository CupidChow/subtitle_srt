3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,140
Ah Rong,

4
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,080
the sect leader made you unhappy?

5
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,820
Chenlan's personality has nothing to make people unhappy.

6
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,220
I'm just worried that if he continues this way...

7
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,050
Little Pig, look. Ah Rong looks so ugly when he frowns.

8
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,610
Little Pony, Ah Rong is our friend.

9
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,920
If he's unhappy, we should try to make him smile.

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,530
Then, how do we make him smile?

11
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,710
Every time he tells us a story,

12
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,690
he always smiles!

13
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,460
Ah Rong, look. Little Pony and Little Pig are also waiting to hear the rest of the story.

14
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,230
Yuezhu!

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,580
Yuezhu!

16

[To save Yuezhu, come to South Moon Order]

18
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,420
South Moon Order!

19
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,450
I get it now! It must be that Little Horse

20
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,010
swept in like a hero with the damsel and saved Little Pig.

21
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,460
From then on, Little Pony and Little Pig

22
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,750
lived happily ever after. Right?

23
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,950
Am I right, Ah Rong?

24
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,060
No.

25
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,580
No? Then, what happened after?

26
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,410
Little Pig died.

27
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,330
"Today, he left for a distant place. I won't ask when he'll return.

28
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,940
I'll just ask for the next life."

29
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,140
What about the next life do you want to ask him?

30
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,190
I want to ask, "Will I have a chance with Brother Cangling in the next life?"

31
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,000
Little Beauty, long time no see.

32
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,950
Lu Zhaoyao?

33
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,120
It's you, little red hair, again!

34
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,090
Little girl, I don't have time to play with you today.

35
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,860
Seventeen!

36
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,140
The Qin Zhiyan from before was you?

37
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,790
I've seen you in the ice cave.

38
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,820
The angry expression you have right now

39
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,340
is the way I love you best.

40
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,210
Little Red Hair, Wan Lu Sect is not a place for you to fool around.

41
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,550
It really is you.

42
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,390
I didn't come to fool around today. I just wanted to see

43
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,500
what the real Lu Zhaoyao looks like.

44
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,960
Seventeen!

45
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,990
Lu Zhaoyao, remember, you belong to me, Jiang Wu.

46
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,350
Sect Leader!

47
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,270
Reporting to Sect Leader. Jiang Wu scouted Wan Lu Sect tonight. We are currently searching for his location.

48
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,200
Zhaoyao, are you all right?

49
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,850
I'm fine.

50
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,790
Sooner or later, I'm going to kill that red hair devil!

51
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,500
How dare he molest my sect leader?

52
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,660
Molest?

53
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,390
Attempted to molest. But do you think I'd let him?

54
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,940
All right, stop being mad.

55
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,510
Are you all right?

56
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,760
Brother Yi! Brother En! What should we do?

57
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,680
Ah Wu

58
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Boss, please save my brother.

59
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,290
What happened to his brother?

60
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,020
He said his brother fell into an unusual cave.

61
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,410
Leader, your powers are great! Please save him!

62
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,400
Today, I'm in a good mood. I'll go check it out with you. Let's go.

63
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,570
- Sect Leader.
- Sect Leader.

64
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,010
Sect Leader, look.

65
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,250
Dig the cave open.

66
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,070
Sect Leader, this cave is not easy to dig.

67
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,300
The mountain rocks are tangled. We can't use our powers to dig.

68
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,970
If we're not careful, the cave will collapse.

69
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,100
Then use your hands to dig.

70
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,390
Yes.

71
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,960
After numerous twists and turns,

72
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,850
Lu Zhaoyao returned to Wan Lu Sect.

73
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,070
To untie the knot requires the one who tied the knot.

74
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,160
As soon as Lu Zhaoyao appeared,

75
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,390
this internal disorder immediately settled.

76
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,140
It was thought that Lu Zhaoyao would certainly fight to the death with Li Chenlan, who took her position!

77
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,030
But, unexpectedly,

78
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,640
this demoness, who went through years of battle,

79
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,570
couldn't escap the smile of a beauty.

80
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,930
She actually offered the sect leader position,

81
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,390
with both hands outstretched, to Li Chenlan.

82
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,300
Good!

83
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,340
The story goes... Why did Lu Zhaoyao

84
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,550
offer the sect leader position to Li Chenlan?

85
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,520
To know what happened next,

86
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,060
we'll listen to the explanation

87
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,410
next time.

88
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,070
She's gone! Give chase!

89
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,580
- Chase!
- Yes!

90
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,240
- Found her?
- No!

91
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,710
That way!

92
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,820
This one.

93
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,010
It's your turn.

94
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,430
Don't worry! no one will care here.

95
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,990
My Wu'e Hall doesn't have that many formalities.

96
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,230
South again?

97
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,970
Eighty thousand.

98
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,670
I won!

99
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,890
Self-drawn all one suit, plus three.

100
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,900
- Hurry! Pay up, pay up!
- Here, Sect Leader.

101
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,340
What? She blew up?

102
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,260
Sect Leader is indeed extraordinary.

103
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,100
Have you heard of the Land of Sojourn?

104
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,170
I heard that from Qin Zhiyan.

105
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,680
It is a place only those who have experienced near-death may go into.

106
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,150
There's an entrance, in the Forbidden Area in the Red Stone Forest, where my burial plot is located.

107
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,280
Inside there are many kinds of shops selling all kinds of pills with mysterious effects.

108
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,680
There's one called Empty Shop, that sells...

109
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,500
the Empty Pill which can make a person recover their power.

110
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,260
I took some Empty Pills and recovered some of my power.

111
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,690
But it caused my body to be invisible during the daytime.

112
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,410
This time I took their limited edition Empty Pill

113
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,150
and it gave me back my peak power.

114
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,260
Come to think of it, being unable to gather my power

115
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,380
might be the side effect of this limited edition Empty Pill.

116
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,180
Absolutely not. Ninth Heaven Spell extensively exhausts the mind of the caster.

117
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,780
In your current condition, if you use Ninth Heaven Spell,

118
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,650
you'll barely escape from death!

119
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,000
It's just lucky that I've had that experience of near-death.

120
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,720
What's this? Why did I explode again?

121
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,420
This is already the second time.

122
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,490
This black market shop! What exactly is going on?

123
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,650
I'd already told you clearly when you bought it.

124
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,210
This extreme edition Empty Pill has other effects.

125
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,100
Once it's sold, you're responsible for the consequences.

126
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,620
You didn't think clearly when you ate it and now you're trying to argue with me?

127
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,410
- I...
- Sister!

128
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,470
- Sister!
- What are you doing?

129
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,270
Sister, calm down!

130
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,600
If you hit someone, you'll be arrested and imprisoned.

131
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Let go!

132
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,440
Sister, what is making you so mad?

133
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,190
I ate that extreme edition Empty Pill, reverted back to my original face,

134
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,670
I'm also not invisible during the day anymore.

135
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,610
But why am I inexplicably exploding?

136
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,730
It's the extreme edition Empty Pill; of course, there will be an extreme reason.

137
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,750
I think you just need a good beating!

138
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,480
Sister! Sister! Calm down, calm down.

139
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,730
Calm down first. Actually, in the time you've been gone,

140
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,260
the shopkeeper has already discovered the hidden effects of the extreme edition Empty Pill.

141
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,160
- What is it?
- Ziyou, shut up!

142
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:49,790
[Land of Sojourn]

143
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,820
May I ask. How do I get to the Empty Shop?

144
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,080
Keep walking straight down this road.

145
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,590
Thank you.

146
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,600
Shut your mouth. Ziyou, continue what you were saying.

147
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,680
Since the first time you exploded, you'll explode a total of five times.

148
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,870
The time interval will gradually decrease and you will become weaker and weaker.

149
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,980
After exploding for five times, you'll... you'll...

150
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,870
What?

151
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,410
Will receive a myriad's people worshipping bows.

152
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,890
Speak human language!

153
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,580
You will conclude the cycle of life and death.

154
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,080
We have a patron.

155
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,490
How did you get here?

156
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,240
You heard it all?

157
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,290
If you people can come up with such a deadly snare, don't you have the skill to solve it?

158
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,730
Of course, we have the skill to solve it.

159
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,490
But research also requires time.

160
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,390
Today, don't raise a fuss anymore. Give me some more time. When we've found a solution,

161
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,740
of course, we'll get in touch with you.

162
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,800
Wait for you to get in touch with me? I say you're just stalling.

163
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,620
What kind of medicine did she buy?

164
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,990
Empty Pill, Extreme Edition.

165
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,920
I want one, too.

166
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,790
Are you crazy? If you eat it, you'll become like me!

167
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,550
But you probably don't have the money to buy it.

168
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,510
A major account! Dear patron, please wait a moment.

169
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,220
- I'll get it for you right now.
- How come you're so rich?

170
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,080
Hey, wait a moment. Why's that? Your Land of Sojourn...

171
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,390
If you do many good things, of course, you have more money!

172
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,590
Now, can you think of a solution as quickly as possible?

173
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,410
Stop there! Stop there! Starting today,

174
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,260
you all focus completely on developing a cure for the Empty Pill Extreme Edition! As soon as possible! Hurry!

175
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,830
Why are you standing still?

176
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,800
When you get to it, you're no less implacable than me.

177
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,720
But why would you be richer than me?

178
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,860
Sister, maybe the things he did... are more than you did.

179
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,200
Let's go.

180
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,570
Why are you so rich? It's not fair!

181
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,180
Mo Qing, how did you find the Land of Sojourn?

182
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,590
You didn't experience near-death. Is it because of the Nine Heavens Spell?

183
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,800
I still have three times to explode. Next time I disappear again,

184
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,370
just stay put and wait for me to come back. Don't torment yourself anymore, I'll feel sorry.

185
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,660
Zhaoyao,

186
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,720
there was someone who made me wait before,

187
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,560
but he never came back. I'm afraid you won't come back, either.

188
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,750
Don't be afraid. I will come back.

189
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,390
I won't let anything happen to you.

190
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,530
I promise I won't let anything happen to me, either.

191
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,790
So, Little Monster, you must care for yourself, too.

192
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,680
Zh-Zh-Zhao-Zhaoyao! Zhaoyao!

193
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,150
What are you shouting for?

194
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,820
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you these past days.

195
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,960
Turns out, you have a new sweetheart!

196
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,910
Don't forget, my son's engagement hasn't been broken off yet!

197
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,760
Engagement?

198
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,570
I'll explain to you later.

199
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,680
- Let's go!
- Mother.
- Don't leave!

200
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,430
- Mother!
- Return my money!

201
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,500
- Hurry!
- Let go!
- Mother!

202
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,990
- Let go!
- Let's go!

203
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,260
- Mother!
- Stop right there!

204
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,730
"Mother" what? Foolish son!

205
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,500
Foolish son! All because of you!

206
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,270
Hey! That... I can explain!

207
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,300
I had no other choice.

208
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,620
Fine, it's true. The marriage was real.

209
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,200
But this isn't punishable by death, is it?

210
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
Marriage?

211
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,310
I can explain everything.

212
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,010
When Luo Mingxuan woke up, I couldn't just stand by and watch.

213
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,060
But my power was weak and I had to rely on the powers of the Empty Pill.

214
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,840
But the price of the Empty Pill was outrageously high, so I had to find someone to buy it for me.

215
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,260
But that place only allows people with a family relationship to buy things for each other, so I-

216
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,660
- ...Sold yourself!
- No!

217
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,390
Fine, I guess I half-sold myself.

218
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,620
But I promise, it was a marriage in name only.

219
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,520
Once I've paid back all the money I owe him, I'll break off our marital relationship.

220
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,940
Marital relationship?

221
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,530
Are you really angry?

222
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,180
What can make you earn a fortune in the Land of Sojourn?

223
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,400
Doing good deeds.

224
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,460
[Wu'e Hall]

225
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,880
By decree of the Sect Leader!

226
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

227
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,860
From this day forth, all Wan Lu Sect disciples,

228
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,080
stop everything you're doing

229
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,880
and do good deeds in the name of our former sect leader, Lu Zhaoyao.

230
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,900
They must be carried out for the welfare of the common people.

231
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,590
Save people in emergencies. Solve people's difficulties.

232
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,680
North Hill's disciples instead will do good deeds in the name of a man called Cao Ning.

233
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,470
Make no mistakes.

234
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,990
Yes, Sect Leader.

235
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,390
- Yes, Sect Leader!
- Yes, Sect Leader!

236
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,670
Captain, why are you so calm?

237
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,540
Am I calm?

238
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,540
How can a normal person understand Sect Leader's thoughts? I'm already used to it.

239
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,900
Whatever the Sect Leader says, we'll just do it.

240
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,660
Then, how do we do good deeds?

241
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,720
Let's go. We'll ask Miss Zhiyan.

242
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,900
There are two main ways to do good deeds.

243
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,190
One is to punish the evil, the other is to uphold the good.

244
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,180
- That's right.
- Write it down.

245
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Punishing the evil is when you encounter someone bullying the weak,

246
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,960
and those who lie and cheat.

247
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,140
You need to punish them and teach them a lesson.

248
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,640
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Stop hitting me!

249
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,450
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

250
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,320
The other way is to uphold the good.

251
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,690
For this, there are even more methods.

252
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,830
For example, you can help the farmers tend the fields.

253
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,640
This...

254
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,040
- This...
- What are they doing?

255
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,620
And donate clothes to the beggars.

256
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,240
Sir...

257
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Thank you!

258
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,220
Also... you can help resolve conflicts.

259
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,700
What did you say about me?

260
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,930
I'm talking about you! Get out!

261
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,340
What are you saying?

262
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,100
Do you have the nerve to do that?

263
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,280
This upholding of good is so difficult.

264
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
Indeed!

265
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,770
- That's right.
- Seems like we're better at punishing evil.

266
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,430
Yes!

267
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,290
The most important part is, once you're done with a good deed, you must tell them:

268
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,890
"I'm doing good deeds for Lu Zhaoyao from Chenji Mountain."

269
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,160
Miss Zhiyan, it's been so tough on you!

270
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,880
Yes!

271
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,950
Write it all down.

272
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,730
Pavilion Master.

273
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,540
- Why did you come to Chenji Mountain?
- Leader, when do you plan to return to Thousand Dust Pavilion?

274
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,320
- Is there anything urgent?
- No.

275
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,120
Just that there are many speculations in the Immortal Sects.

276
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,300
They say Pavilion Master is a leader of an immortal sect, how can you dwell in the Wan Lu Sect?

277
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,330
No need to take heed of it. Once my business here is done, I will return.

278
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,230
The Immortal Sects also said,

279
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,980
that the Pavilion Master has some affection toward Lu Zhaoyao.

280
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,790
Pavilion Master, you may not care,

281
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,030
but the Immortal Sects are not the same as before.

282
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,690
Other Sects have been blaming Thousand Dust Pavilion as traitors to the Immortal Sects.

283
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm afraid those with ulterior motives will take advantage of this situation.

284
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,970
This would make things even worse for Thousand Dust Pavilion.

285
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,390
I earnestly request Pavilion Master to return as soon as possible.

286
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,460
All right. In ten days to half a month at the latest,

287
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,500
I will return.

288
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,910
Yes.

289
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,760
The story of Qin Qianxian and Lu Zhaoyao

290
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,480
has already widely spread throughout Jianghu.

291
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,810
Your goal has been achieved.

292
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,070
This is far from enough.

293
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,560
I want to ruin Qin Qianxian,

294
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,530
and also ruin his Thousand Dust Pavilion.

295
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,490
I agreed to go against Qin Qianxian,

296
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,570
but I didn't say I'd go against others.

297
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,020
Does this mean you're disagreeing?

298
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,830
Although I've long disliked Qin Qianxian,

299
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,080
I respect his master, the Immortal Zidan.

300
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,350
Thousand Dust Pavilion was founded hundreds of years ago; you cannot shake it.

301
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,400
I'm going to shake that foundation of hundreds of years. What can you do to me?

302
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,970
You're threatening me?

303
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,820
You came aboard my ship, can you still go back?

304
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,030
Lord Jin Xiu, you've been in the Immortal Sect for so many years.

305
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,560
Ahead, you have Jianxin Sect and Thousand Dust Pavilion.

306
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,740
Behind, you have Phoenix Mountain Deacon Chi Tianming, and that brute, Xiong Tian.

307
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,490
Although their reputation is not as high as yours, they are close in relations with Luo Mingxuan.

308
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,170
They've been riding roughshod over you.

309
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,000
And now that Luo Mingxuan is dead, Jianxin Sect is ruined,

310
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,490
the only one in your way is Thousand Dust Pavilion.

311
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,810
You really don't want to ruin it?

312
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:16,360
But... Thousand Dust Pavilion's disciples are innocent.

313
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,400
I said, I want Qin Qianxian to lose everything.

314
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,810
I'll leave the Thousand Dust Pavilion's disciples for you to handle.

315
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,760
How will you go against Qin Qianxian?

316
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,070
I want you to hold an immortal sect meeting.

317
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,140
Convince the other sects to go against Qin Qianxian.

318
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,090
Once Thousand Dust Pavilion changes masters, I'll lend you a hand.

The world of the Immortal Sect

320
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,710
will belong to you, Tian Xuan Sect.

321
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,830
You have to consider it thoroughly.

322
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,570
[Xu Zong Sect]

323
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,820
Jin Xian's body is indeed powerful.

324
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,050
You sustained such severe physical injuries and they're almost all healed.

325
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,950
Sect Leader Jiang's medical skill is excellent.

326
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,420
You flatter me. If my medical skills were really excellent,

327
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,340
Jin Xian wouldn't be burdened by the aura of the seal.

328
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,220
Master, Lord Jin Xiu sent a letter.

329
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,950
- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

330
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,130
Please attend the Immortal Sect meeting...

331
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,120
What is it that has Sect Leader Jiang so worried?

332
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,420
Nothing serious. Lord Jin Xiu has always loved to look good.

333
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,000
This time he's asking how to preserve his beauty.

334
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:11,150
It's been so many years but Jin Xiu's love for beauty has never changed.

335
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,530
Indeed. It's been so many years.

336
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,740
Time passes by so quickly.

337
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,400
The situation of the Jiang clan, I've heard your father mention it.

338
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,450
Heaven and Earth have no end,

339
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,890
human life is like the morning glow.

340
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,820
Compared to Heaven and Earth, whose life

341
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,220
doesn't pass in the blink of an eye?

342
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,690
This Immortal Sect meeting...

343
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,650
when did it ever fall on Lord Jin Xiu, this contemptible buffoon, to be the host?

344
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,630
Then... I'll inform Lord Jin Xiu,

345
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,430
that Sect Leader has something to do and can't attend.

346
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,000
Wait!

347
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,970
Tell him I'll be there.

348
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,320
I want to see what kind of things he can say.

349
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,110
Six sect leaders,

350
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,010
how come there are two still missing?

351
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,080
Sect Leader Jiang said he is unwell, that's why he is unable to attend.

352
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,940
Jiang He, he's almost 30 years old.

353
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,850
He won't be alive for much longer.

354
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,810
Rain View House's Sect Leader rejected the invitation on the grounds that she is not at the palace.

355
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,210
- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

356
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,200
Fine, let's not wait for them anymore.

357
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,390
Jin Xiu, what is the reason you were so anxious to have us all come here?

358
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,650
I believe that everyone knows.

359
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:02,210
During the Grand Meeting, Qin Qianxian was saved by the hand of the East Hill Master from Wan Lu Sect.

360
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:06,370
After the battle on Phoenix Mountain, he stayed inthe Wan Lu Sect and hasn't returned.

361
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,050
As a leader of the Immortal Sects, he brags about being indifferent to worldly concerns,

362
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,640
but he colluded with the Wan Lu Sect and took sides with the enemy.

363
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,730
How can we let him get away with that?

364
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,140
- Jin Xiu, these words seem to be a little overboard.
- Right.

365
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,660
Overboard?

366
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,320
Everyone in the Immortal Sects knows that you've been envious of Pavillion Leader Qin for a long time.

367
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,440
It's rumored in Jianghu that Lu Zhaoyao has a complicated relationship with Qin Qianxian.

368
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,240
Everyone knows of it.

369
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,580
Should we wait until they commit illicit affairs and taint the Immortal Sects' reputation

370
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,660
before you take it seriously?

371
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,840
What do you want to do then?

372
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,060
Attack Thousand Dust Pavilion and elect a new Leader.

373
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,410
Expel Qin Qianxian from the Immortal Sects.

374
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,760
Jin Xiu, how can you have such thoughts?

375
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,250
Why not?

376
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,930
Is a mere Qin Qianxian worthy of Immortal Sect's hundreds of years of reputation?

377
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,960
That's absurd!

378
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,920
Not to mention that this matter has not been concluded yet.

379
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,110
Even if Pavillion Leader Qin had committed a trespass,

380
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,690
this matter should be discussed in his presence.

381
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,690
I don't see any point to this meeting.

382
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,460
Jin Xiu!

383
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,960
Jiang Wu?

384
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,300
You've been chatting so long and you still didn't find a deal.

385
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,330
Can you do it or not?

386
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,930
I'll just ask you people one question.

387
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,200
Do you want to get rid of the Wan Lu Sect?

388
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,380
So long as Qin Qianxian loses everything, I'll get rid of Li Chenlan for you.

389
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,800
It's a fair deal.

390
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,190
This is our business. What does it have to do with you?

391
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,240
You must be Tang Yun.

392
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,020
You are quite tough.

393
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
- Jiang Wu!
- Don't move.

394
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,270
Take your hand off her.

395
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,660
- Jin Xiu.
- Jin Xiu,

396
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,580
don't you mess up my plans because of a woman.

397
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,630
I'll take care of this woman for you for a few days.

398
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,320
Jin Xiu,

399
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,110
let's discuss Thousand Dust Pavilion after you've rescued Chief Tang.

400
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,790
[Xu Zong Sect]

[Sect Leader Jiang Dong's memorial plaque]

402
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:54,240
[Chronicle of Xu Zong]

403
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,450
The leader of Xu Zong Sect can't survive past the age of 30.

404
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,860
We don't know the reason.

405
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,540
A thousand years ago, the first patriarch of our family,

406
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,100
in order to seize the power of Heaven,

407
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,980
killed countless innocent people,

408
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,290
Although he managed to seize the power, he also received the curse of Heaven and Earth.

409
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,950
Our family members will never live a long life, for all eternity.

410
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,990
There is a powerful force in our blood.

411
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:32,080
The power will grow to its peak when we reach the age of 30.

412
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,640
But no ordinary mortal flesh can withstand such power.

413
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,500
This is also the reason why all generations of Xu Zong Sect's leaders have never lived beyond the age of 30.

414
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,640
But this power will not disappear.

415
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,010
It will be passed on in the blood to future generations.

416
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:55,220
Just this way, like a vessel that carries power,

417
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
it came to me

418
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,910
and it will also come to you.

419
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,220
Father, so you and I will...

420
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:10,480
Don't be afraid. Our ancestors have been researching on the method to lift the curse all along.

421
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,610
And I've achieved a small accomplishment.

422
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:19,310
Hanguang is the most talented disciple I've ever seen in so many years.

423
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,740
In the future, let him work with you to find the solution.

424
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,820
If it's successful then there's a chance to turn things around.

425
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:35,610
And you need to learn to control your power as soon as possible. Also, keep it in mind.

426
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,930
Don't ever let anyone know

427
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:44,310
that Xu Zong Sect has such power, so as to prevent any fatal disaster.

428
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,180
