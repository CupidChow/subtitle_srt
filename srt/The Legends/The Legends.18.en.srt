Are you still busy?

Are you getting bored?

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,910
Chat with me.

What should we talk about?

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,630
Tell me a story.

Miss, are you all right?

15
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,630
My kite is stuck in the tree.

My mom left that for me.

17

I will get it for you.

- Here is your kite.
- Thanks.

19
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,590
But you tore your clothes.

20
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,080
Why don't you let me mend it for you?

21
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,840
- No need.
- I can't accept that.

22
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,440
You helped me with the kite. I will be very quick.

23
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,000
I can mend it really quickly and return it to you soon.

24
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,430
Right, what is your name?

We've been walking for a while and there's no vital energy here.

As yet unknown. But they don't have good intentions. Proceed with caution.

86
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,510
Could it be Southern Moon Order's leftover rebels are still holding grudges against him?

87
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,370
It can't be.

88
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,860
Master, I heard that West Hill Master back then was entrapped by the Southern Moon Order.

89
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,720
But it seems to me that the West Hill Master is indifferent to trifles and clear-headed in all things.

90
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,920
Was it... a trap by a woman?

91
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,600
A woman from the Southern Moon Order named Yuezhu first came to seduce Ah Rong.

92
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,910
She intended to kill him, but unexpectedly fell for him and couldn't bring herself to do it.

93
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,390
Hence, she was recalled to Southern Moon Order

94
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,120
to be punished as a traitor.

95
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,380
Ah Rong went to the rescue.

96
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,560
He fell into a trap and his legs were broken.

97
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,670
He had to rely on Yuezhu's desperate help to take him out of the Southern Moon Order.

98
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,210
Then... Yuezhu...?

99
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,060
She died.

100
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,770
Careful.

101
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,470
Per Sect Leader's command! Those not on duty must go to Jiangzhou, the West Hill Master's residence. Go!

102
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,960
Yes!

103
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,240
What happened in Jiangzhou?

104
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,910
West Hill Master's compound was attacked. Many brothers are dead or wounded.

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,620
No!

168
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,380
He... Does he actually...

169
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,380
His feelings for me...

170
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,260
That's impossible. Something must be wrong with Mount Lingting.

171
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,980
This must be an illusion! Can't be.

172
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,010
It's really an illusion.

173
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,560
Can't be.

174
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,370
Can't be.

175
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,300
Mount Lingting.

176
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,050
The mountain where lives come to rest. It's indeed full of strange energy.

177
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,970
Where are you going? Come back!

178
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,370
Let's go.

179
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,350
I need to find Sima Rong quickly before he falls into the trap.

180
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,890
Sima Rong!

181
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,120
West Hill Master.

182
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
West...

183
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,180
Yuezhu, you grew up in South Moon Order.

184
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,920
Master and your seniors never mistreated you.

185
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,930
We trusted you with important tasks.

186
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,310
Yet, you... betrayed the South Moon Order.

187
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,700
Wan Lu Sect has done a lot of bad things. Sima Rong assisted in their evil deeds.

188
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,170
How many people from our order did he hurt in helping Lu Zhaoyao?

189
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,970
And you are in love with him now!

190
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,100
You know, your moment of weakness towards Sima Rong

191
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,260
has had huge repercussions on our great plan!

192
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,650
Sima Rong is not a bad man. I can't kill him.

193
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,760
Demon teachings are evil! Everyone is a fiend in Wan Lu Sect.

194
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,520
Yuezhu, how long have you spent with Sima Rong?

195
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,160
And you'll help him to this point.

196
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,950
You're even willing to die for him. Is it worth it?

197
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,920
I'm following my heart.

198
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,790
This is my joy.

199
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,240
What joy? You are confounded!

200
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,530
Master wants to kill you. Do you know that?

201
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,160
I know. Since the day I was caught,

202
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,550
I was already dead.

203
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,630
Yuezhu, if you are willing to make amends and go kill Sima Rong,

204
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,270
maybe there's a chance to make up.

205
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,130
I won't kill him.

206
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,160
Yuezhu,

207
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,090
if that's the case, don't blame me

208
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,640
for obeying Master's will.

209
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,360
Ah Rong!

210
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,070
Who would have thought that the lie I once told you about betraying my order,

211
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,650
would now be the truth.

212
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,750
I've saved you every time. This time I won't let you get hurt either.

213
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,400
Yuezhu, let's go.

214
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,340
Why did you come for me?

215
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,760
I lied to you.

216
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm following my heart.

217
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,570
Let's go.

218
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,260
"I'm following my heart."

219
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,570
When she was alive, Little Round Face was a willful girl.

220
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,180
I'm very happy that you came for me,

221
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,150
but if you take me away, there is no way to make it out alive.

222
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,330
Not to mention, our Immortal Sect people have already set the trap in the Sword Tomb.

223
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,670
They're waiting for Lu Zhaoyao to take the Wan Jun Sword

224
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,150
and then they'll catch the whole Wan Lu Sect in one sweep.

225
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,400
Don't mind me. Hurry there!

226
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,740
Hurry! Hurry!

227
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,590
First, I'll take you away.

228
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,320
This mountain cave... how long until the end of the road?

229
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,030
Oh, Little Beauty?

230
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,460
Really, I can go through hell without finding you and then you appear.

231
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,520
Boy! Boy!

232
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,780
What kind of place have you taken the South Moon Order for?

233
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,760
Come and go at will?

234
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,710
Stay by my side.

235
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,650
I came by my skills, of course, I'm also leaving by my skills.

236
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,450
Attack!

237
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,560
Watch out!

238
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,770
Ah Rong!

239
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,670
It's all right. Let's go.

240
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,390
Those weapons are poisoned. If you use magic, your fighting power will get destroyed.

241
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,340
Catch him!

242
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,390
He's hurt by the poison, he can't go far. Give chase!

243
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,650
You must take him down. He's Lu Zhaoyao's right-hand man.

244
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,150
Yes!

245
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,740
That's how it happened?

246
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,170
This is how Sima Rong's legs were crippled?

247
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,000
What was I doing then?

248
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,520
Okay, okay. Don't move!

249
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,070
So you fell into the dreamland, too.

250
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,870
Not good. Someone's here!

251
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,190
Little Beauty!

252
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,400
Little Short Hair, you're the one who abducted Sima Rong.

253
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,290
That's right. I abducted him. So what?

254
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,600
What did you take him for?

255
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,360
He was gathering information for Li Chenlan, of course, I took him to kill him.

256
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,140
What about it? You want to protect him?

257
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,500
Yes. I want to protect him.

258
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,370
You like him?

259
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,790
Right. I like him.

260
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,820
He looks good, his temper is good, he's good to me. Is it odd that I like him?

261
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,810
Just as I appreciate your personality and I like you, the same way.

262
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,920
You're pretty apt at flirting.

263
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,190
Just telling it like it is. Only, he's on my side and I'll protect him, while you are not on my side.

264
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,430
What if I still want to touch him?

265
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,170
By all means, try.

266
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,650
Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

267
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,200
Li Chenlan faced death to take it for you. You're good.

268
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,730
Now I like you better and better.

269
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,860
Me, too.

270
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm set on him today. Not even you can stop me.

271
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,470
It won't do. If we keep fighting like this, Lingting Mountain will collapse in no time.

272
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,800
Ah Rong! You must be in such pain!

273
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,700
Don't worry. I'll take you out of here for sure.

274
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,420
There's blood here. Chase in that direction.

275
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
Let's go.

276
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,900
Stop!

277
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,090
- Stop! Stop!
- Don't run!

278
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,990
Yuezhu, if you still have strength left,

279
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,730
take wind and leave.

280
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,130
- Yuezhu!
- You're awake.

281
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,670
I am... dying?

282
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
No.

283
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:07,910
I wasted your rescue. And I even got your legs hurt.

284
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,040
But you came for me,

285
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,570
for that, I'm really happy.

286
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,970
Crabapples are so beautiful.

287
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,500
Just like the first time

288
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,550
I caught you falling from the crabapple tree.

289
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,330
That was a scam.

290
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,940
I'm so good at fighting,

291
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,700
how could I fall down from a tree?

292
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,510
I know.

293
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,600
Coming close to you... it was all to fool you.

294
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,180
I know.

295
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,570
But my feelings for you

296
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,640
are true.

297
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,670
I know.
