Zhaoyao! Run!

4
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,660
Sect Leader!

5
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,430
Sect Leader...

6
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,410
A demon is a demon!

7
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,610
You all who were born as demons must be extinguished!

8
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,710
Brother Cangling.

9
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,010
We've been saved.

10
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,770
Yes.

11
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,640
We've been saved.

12
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,790
Against all predictions, the time for some Immortal Sects to join hands again,

13
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,260
it was to face such a situation.

14
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,390
Obsession will turn a man into a demon.

15
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,720
This poor world! How many have perished again!

16
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,550
I'm not wrong.

17
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,880
The ones in the wrong are all of you.

18
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,010
Grandpa,

19
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,960
Gu Hanguang, Jiang Wu,

20
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,200
and every innocent soul that Luo Mingxuan killed,

21
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,290
I've avenged you all.

22
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,180
Mo Qing!

23
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,830
Mo Qing!

24
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,380
Mo Qing, what's happening to you?

25
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,210
Mo Qing!

26
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,610
Mo Qing! Wake up!

27
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,410
Mo Qing!

28
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,230
- Mo Qing!
- Don't touch me!

29
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,280
I won't let anything happen to you.

30
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,420
The same place.

31
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,500
In the end, we're still at sword's point.

32
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,650
As soon as you get out, you'll be killed by Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

33
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,740
If you die, you'll have nothing more.

34
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,980
Grasp it.

35
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,100
Join your mind and strength with me, we'll break the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

36
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,210
From now on, you'll never fear death again.

37
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,040
There'll be nothing in the world you can't obtain.

38
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,290
Sect Leader.

39
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,510
Sect Leader!

40
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,660
You'll become the lord of the world.

41
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,760
If the price to become the lord is to plunge people in misery and suffering,

42
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,510
I won't have it.

43
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,550
What do the lives of the world have to do with you?

44
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,660
Millions of people are just millions of me and Zhaoyao.

45
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,420
I love her and love this world.

46
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,980
I don't want some great power,

47
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,740
nor do I want to become the lord of the world.

48
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,360
The only thing I want to control is my own fate.

49
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,720
Only power will allow you to control your own fate.

50
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,990
As for the people you love, their ruin or salvation will be a blink of thought for you.

51
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,030
The people never needed anyone to save them,

52
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,660
and I've never feared death.

53
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,070
If I lost myself, then I'd truly have nothing.

54
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,560
Foolhardy!

55

You cannot defeat me.

You cannot defeat us.

85

All who take Heaven's Sword must die by Heaven's Sword.

86
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,400
The importance of life is not in living or dying.

87
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,070
Beyond life and death, what can be of any importance?

88
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm willing to perish for my madness, even if I'm burned to ashes.

89
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,550
I never thought that by extracting the sword I would actually meet you.

Zhaoyao... this isn't destiny.

In my lifetime,

111
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,650
many years were spent alone in the darkness.

112
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,170
My life and soul were still like dead water.

113

Until one person said

114
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,590
she saw a starry sky in my eyes.

115

Maybe she doesn't know

116
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,070
in my eyes there's only darkness

117
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,350
and she is all the shining things in my world.

118

Let's go back. To Wan Lu Sect.

119

Save me... I still have my wife, children, and parents.

I don't want to die. Save me!

121

Success or failure,
