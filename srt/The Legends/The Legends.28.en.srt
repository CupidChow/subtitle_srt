[Episode 28]

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,020
All of you Sect Leaders have your concerns. I can understand.

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,710
Even if I only have my own strength,

5
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,330
I must revive Jin Xian.

6
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,710
Everyone, I'm aware

7
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,760
that my method is a little brutal.

8
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,770
But if it can awaken Jin Xian and restore the Immortal Sect,

9
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,910
I'm willing to accept any blame for it.

10
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,090
Everyone, if you still have an objection,

11
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,820
you may leave now. I will not stop you.

12
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,510
Revered Lady, what words are these?

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,860
The Immortal Sects are all branches of one tree. If one fails, the others are ailing.

14
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,200
I, Chi Tianming, will never commit such treason.

15
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,780
All the fellow sectmen

16
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,010
will surely support you, Revered Lady Changyu.

17
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,160
Count me in, too.

18
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,780
Revered Lady Changyu, please don't speak in such low spirits.

19
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,320
I only hope that after Jin Xian awakens,

20
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,010
you won't forget our contributions.

21
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,570
I dare ask, Revered Lady, is there any other way to revive Jin Xian?

22
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,030
Where am I?

23
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,000
Wan Lu Sect.

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,930
Wan Lu Sect? Why am I here?

25
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,160
Qin Zhiyan saved you.

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,770
Right. Miss Zhiyan and I

27
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,360
were trapped on Phoenix Mountain.

28
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,090
May I know... who you are, Lord?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,170
Wan Lu Sect's physician.

30
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,090
Forgive me for my rude question,

31
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,210
but, Lord, have you met me, Qianjin, before?

32
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,840
No.

33
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,590
- An Si.
- Master.
- When the medicine is ready, bring it here.

34
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,330
Twice a day. Keep her meals light.

35
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,730
Yes.

36
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,940
Sect Leader Shen.

37
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,720
You think you can trap me so easily? You're joking.

38
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,270
If Jiang Wu hadn't popped up

39
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,350
and intercepted us on the way to Wan Lu Sect, we would have been back by now.

40
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,130
What happened between you and him? Why is he after your life?

41
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,590
Jiang Wu is the result of my momentary lapse.

42
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,810
A momentary lapse? What does that mean?

43
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,190
He's my inner demon.

44
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,320
Why would a beautiful man like you have an inner demon?

45
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,350
I've only heard that us wanderers, when training,

46
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,330
can become obsessed and develop inner demons.

47
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,240
Are you really from the Immortal Sect?

48
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,590
Every man in training

49
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,400
is as if on the edge of a deep abyss. The slightest mistake can cause evil temptations.

50
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,810
The more you pursue peace, the more impurities grow in your heart.

51
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,820
Members of the Immortal Sects are no exception.

52
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,660
What will happen when you get an inner demon?

53
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,040
Like a spirit controlling the mind, like a pest possessing the heart.

54
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,370
What does that mean?

55
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,800
That means you'll do a lot of terrifying and unreasonable things.

56
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,180
Then Liu Suruo must have an inner demon.

57
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,500
She's quite unreasonable. Right?

58
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,200
She... is too obstinate.

59
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,470
Beautiful One, aren't you quite strong?

60
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,800
Can you teleport?

61
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,740
I was entrapped by Jiang Wu. I can't teleport now.

62
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,950
It's okay. We can walk back.

63
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,410
East Hill Master Lu, let's get some rest for now. We will continue in a bit.

64
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,500
All right.

65
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,010
Sect Leader Jiang.

66
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,570
Revered Lady.

67
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,940
You were particularly quiet during the Grand Meeting.

68
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,110
Xu Zong Sect is devoted to the study of medicine.

69
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,370
We don't partake in conflicts in Jianghu.

70
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,360
Since you've decided to stay out of this matter,

71
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
I'll be counting on you

72
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
to look after our Jianxin sect's young master.

73
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,420
Young Master Cangling is physically and mentally hurt. He needs to recuperate in peace.

74
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,070
There's so much going on right now.

75
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,790
Cangling is entangled at the center of this situation. He can't rest in quiet.

76
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,690
As a member of the Immortal Sects,

77
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,740
shouldn't you do your best to help Immortal Sects as well?

78
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,490
I'm but a physician.

79
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,830
I won't make a difference in Revered Lady's grand plan.

80
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,550
Moreover, I'm busy with the affairs of Xu Zong Sect.

81
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,560
Sect Leader, please allow me to return.

82
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,010
All right.

83
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
I won't force you, Sect Leader Jiang.

84
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,380
Revered Lady, you don't have to see me off. I bid you farewell.

85
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,300
Sect Leader Jiang, take care.

86
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,940
[Phoenix's Song Hall]

87
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,960
Revered Lady.

88
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,000
Deacon Chi,

89
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,440
there are two more days left for Mingxuan to wake.

90
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,740
I only have one last idea.

91
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,860
What plan do you have, Revered Lady?

92
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,510
I'm afraid you might need to be at risk.

93
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,720
If Jin Xian can wake,

94
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,540
even if I need to use my life, it's not a problem.

95
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,820
I need you to go to go Wan Lu Sect and deliver a message.

96
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,230
What message?

97
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,310
Tell Qin Zhiyan,

98
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,640
if she doesn't come to Phoenix Mountain tomorrow night,

99
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,610
I'll have to kill Liu Cangling.

100
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,980
This...

101
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,100
Thank you for your trouble.

102
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,520
So you're here.

103
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,210
Are you done exercising?

104
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,960
Jiang Wu is about to get here. We need to leave this place.

105
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,740
Oh, all right.

106
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,560
How did you just faint like that?

107
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,360
Wake up! You can't sleep here, Beautiful One!

108
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,520
Beautiful One? Beautiful One?

109
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,360
Can you not sleep now? Point me in the right direction.

110
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,240
I don't know the road! Hey, Beautiful One!

111
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,580
Beautiful One, wake up!

112
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,960
[Xu Zong Sect]

113
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,810
You're dismissed.

114
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,280
Master, this is the answer from Uncle Senior Gu for this year's question.

115
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,050
[...2 of motherwort, 3 root of red-rooted salvia, 1 of mugwort, 3 fruit of magnoliavine, 1 of prunella vulgaris...]

116
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,450
Good. This is great!

117
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,360
He indeed is King Yama's Scourge!

118
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,040
Master, you're so happy because Senior Uncle's answer is good?

119
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,310
I remember my father said before he passed,

120
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,830
"In the future, as for achievements in the medical theory,

121
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,320
no man will be my Junior's match."

122
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,670
At that time, I wasn't convinced.

123
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,390
I didn't expect that father's words

124
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,580
would all come true.

125
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,780
If that's the case, Senior Uncle won again this year?

126
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,740
Of course.

127
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,850
Thinking back to when I refused his request for help and forced him to leave,

128
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,320
it counts as our Xu Zong Sect's greatest loss.

129
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,930
Then... Master, this year what will you award Senior Uncle with?

130
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,260
So be it. I'll consider this new medicine I concocted this year

131
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,520
as the price to be awarded to the winner.

132
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,800
Master... you painstakingly concocted this new medicine--

133
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,380
A healer should put patients in the first place. Giving him a portion

134
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,960
won't be a waste of this medicine.

135
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,090
South Hill Master is here alone; perhaps you mind is troubled?

136
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,790
I'm always like this.

137
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,890
Sect Leader Shen, no need to overthink.

138
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,460
Since that's the case, Qianjin will stay with South Hill Master and have a chat.

139
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,940
No need. I have many things to do.

140
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,220
I'll leave this place to you, Sect Leader Shen.

141
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,960
South Hill Master...

142
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,790
It was my trespass. For my momentary impertinence,

143
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,200
I'll ask you to forgive me, South Hill Master.

144
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
It was no harm.

145
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,890
I hear that South Hill Master isn't only excellent in medical arts, but also extremely skilled at chess.

146
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,580
Could I, Qianjin, entreat you to teach me a little?

147
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,100
I hear that there's a disciple in Xu Zong Sect who is not only a one-in-the-world talent in medicine,

148
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,390
but also extremely skilled at chess.

149
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,130
Meeting you today, I wonder if I, Qianjin, can ask you for the honor of teaching me a little.

150
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,610
Sect Leader Shen, since you have such a refined interest-

151
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,580
Sect Leader Shen, there are people from your sect here. I've brought them over.

152
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,390
Sect Leader, are you injured?

153
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,940
I'm fine now. Thanks to South Hill Master.

154
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,850
Many thanks, South Hill Master.

155
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,190
No need to thank me. It's a healer's duty.

156
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,400
With this, I'll take my leave.

157
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,470
Jin Rong, do you know this South Hill Master?

158
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,050
No, how would I know someone from Wan Lu Sect?

159
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,980
Sect Leader, let's hurry away from this place. Now that the Immortal Sects are in chaos,

160
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,160
people in Jianghu are saying that at the Grand Meeting you took sides with the Wan Lu Sect.

161
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,950
They are criticizing the Rain View Sect.

162
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,550
That's Liu Suruo trying to win the people's support.

163
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,760
She wants to use Thousand Dust Pavilion Master's blood

164
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,540
to remove Jin Xian's seal. This completely goes against Immortal Sects' morals.

165
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,590
Because I expressed my objection,

166
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,790
she became enraged and resorted to slander.

167
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,440
Since that's the case, please hurry back to our sect to handle the matter

168
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,990
and also to silence people in Jianghu.

169
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
There are still things I haven't figured out.

170
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,460
Jin Rong, return to the sect and manage affairs for me first. If guests from the Immortal Sects come,

171
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,590
use the excuse that I'm not at the sect to turn them away.

172
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,970
Sect Leader, how can you linger here?

173
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,000
Why can I not linger here?

174
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,820
Jin Rong, do you know something?

175
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,600
How could I?

176
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,650
I've been suffering from the Cold Poison for years; yet, I don't remember how I got poisoned.

177
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,450
Are you hiding something?

178
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,920
I only know that someone poisoned you during an ambush.

179
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,830
If I knew anything more, how could I hide it from Sect Leader?

180
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,370
Enough, you all go back first.

181
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,380
When my injury is healed, of course, I'll return.

182
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,770
Yes, Sect Leader.

183
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,560
Sect Leader Shen.

184
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,970
[Rain View Sect]

185
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Sect Leader, someone sent medicine.

186
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,590
This knot is so odd.

187
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,620
Sect Leader Shen.

188
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,140
Sect Leader Shen?

189
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,610
An Si, did you tie this knot?

190
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,000
This was made by the Hill Master. It's such a complicated knot that I've never managed to learn it.

191
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,970
Sect Leader Shen, I need to measure some herbs. Please help yourself.

192
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,390
My medicine!

193
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,760
Who are you?

194
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,730
How did you get in here? You made me spill my medicine!

195
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,290
Tell me! Are you a thief from Shunan Town? Pay me back my medicine!

196
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,210
Let go! Why would I steal this stuff you have?

197
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,100
Don't deny it!

198
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,530
Isn't this kid the disciple of Xu Zong Sect's Jiang He? Why did you come here?

199
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,130
X-Xu Zong Sect? Someone from the Immortals Sects?

200
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,120
Did you hear that? I'm a proud disciple of Xu Zong Sect.

201
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,470
Sect Leader Shen is my witness.

202
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,090
Why would I steal your junk?

203
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,790
- Stop denying.
- What's this ruckus?

204
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,750
Sect Leader Shen is here as well?

205
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,450
Hill Master, I was weighing the medicine and this kid suddenly appeared.

206
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,320
And he's someone from the Immortal Sects.

207
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,720
I see he's suspicious. He must be a spy from the Immortal Sects

208
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,860
sent to check on our Wan Lu Sect!

209
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,310
Who's suspicious? Who's a spy?

210
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,870
Don't you just throw mud on me!

211
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,490
If you're not a spy, why did you barge into our yard?

212
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,690
Please excuse us. We've embarrassed ourselves. I need to educate my disciple.

213
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,570
It's nothing, I'm not bothered.

214
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,010
Why did you come here?

215
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,080
That's right. Master said you solved his question.

216
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,390
According to the rules, he told me to give this to you.

217
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,420
Also, my Master named this herb "Rebirth."

218
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,190
He managed to grow it?

219
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,610
[Memorial Tablet of Xu Zong Sect's 15th Leader, Jiang Li]

220
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,620
[Memorial Tablet of Xu Zong Sect's 15th Leader, Jiang Li]

221
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,320
What are you laughing at?

222
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,940
Don't you think the Immortal Sect

223
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,830
is no better than wanderers?

224
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,210
Why did you suddenly say this?

225
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,480
As soon as father passed,

226
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,460
so many people came to mourn for him.

227
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,120
But just a few were sincere.

228
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,270
Look at how empty the hall is.

229
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,990
It's so quiet that it makes you feel restless.

230
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,230
Immortal Sect. Wanderers. They're just people.

231
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,860
After my father passed away, the other sect leaders came immediately.

232
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,340
The first thing they said wasn't about father's funeral,

233
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,220
but to tell me how to be a good sect leader,

234
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,050
how to determine right and wrong, and to teach me what they think is justice.

235
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,100
It's just ridiculous.

236
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,010
Since you were born in the Immortal Sect, then be a good sect leader.

237
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,540
This is your responsibility.

238
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,310
Responsibility? This is my cursed fate.

239
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,360
What are you afraid of?

240
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,310
It is too difficult to extend the bloodline of the Jiang Clan.

241
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,790
The unrivalled power we obtained... drains our lives at the same time.

242
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,990
We don't live to 30 years old.

243
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,290
On his deathbed, my father told me to have children as soon as possible.

244
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,900
But I want this sad fate to end with me.

245
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,700
Senior, you mean...

246
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,230
I want to find a way to lift the curse.

247
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,860
Hanguang, out of all the disciples, you're the most talented.

248
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,130
My father trusted you the most.

249
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,240
He once attempted to cultivate a herb with your assistance.

250
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,470
Will you help me?

251
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,030
Master tried to fight against his fate, too.

252
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,230
He wanted to cultivate a kind of herb

253
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,320
that could draw out the energy in one's blood.

254
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,310
It's a pity. Before he could achieve it, he...

255
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,830
Senior, you know, I love solving problems.The more difficult the problem, the more I enjoy solving it.

256
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:05,920
, Of course, I'm willing to help you find a solution to the curse.

257
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,560
Hanguang, you might be the only person I can trust in my life.

258
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,280
Rebirth. What a good name.

259
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,820
Go back and tell your master, I understand.

260
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,430
I'll give him an answer later.

261
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,760
No, it was so difficult for me to come out.

262
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,060
I want to have fun before I go back.

263
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,890
Where did he come from?

264
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,180
Throw him out.

265
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,570
Yes, Hill Master.

266
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,730
Hey! What are you doing?

267
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,000
- Go!
- Let go!

268
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,100
I'm so hungry.

269
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,210
If you're hungry then go get something to eat.

270
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,630
I'm scared.

271
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,710
Scared of what?

272
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,600
Scared of Li Chenlan.

273
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,830
You've been at Wan Lu Sect for so long and you're still scared of him?

274
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,070
Disciples who've been in Wan Lu Sect for ten years are still scared of him!

275
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,360
If I'm scared of him, it's very normal. Is it not?

276
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,720
How did I get a disciple like you?

277
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,180
You're so weak and cowardly.

278
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,090
Who says I'm a coward?

279
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,480
That day we went to the Grand Meeting, we stood against the Immortal Sects together.

280
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,920
Is that something to be proud of?

281
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,140
I fought them alone back then... and still won.

282
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,730
You were just running, you haven't fought yet.

283
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,900
But, then again,

284
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,120
Liu Suruo is planning to remove the seal I put on Luo Mingxuan.

285
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,540
She really is an unrepenting snake.

286
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,570
Demoness, can I ask why you must kill Luo Mingxuan?

287
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,440
Is it just because you're Wan Lu Sect and he's Immortal Sect?

288
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,720
I, Lu Zhaoyao, have always drawn the line between kindness and resentment.

289
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,480
You think I'd just seal him for no reason?

290
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,450
Then, what's the reason?

291
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,650
Of course, it's because of a mortal grudge.

292
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,230
What do you mean, a mortal grudge?

293
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,060
Back then I was too naive.

294
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,690
I believed his sweet words.

295
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,130
Based on what he said, I wanted to be a good person.

296
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,790
Then I did a good deed, and instead, I was trapped and questioned.

297
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:09,200
When I was on the point of dying under torture, my only relative came to my rescue.

298
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,320
I was saved.

299
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,130
But my grandfather was killed by Luo Mingxuan.

300
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,170
Say, how could I spare Luo Mingxuan?

301
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,810
If my father hadn't been killed by them,

302
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,590
I would have never believed that they were bad people.

303
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,030
Bad?

304
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,850
How can "bad" ever be enough to describe them?

305
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,180
Demoness, I'm not worried about anything else, but Brother Cangling is still in their hands.

306
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,530
By now, I'm clear about the whole story; Brother Cangling had no part in it.

307
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,050
Although there is no way I can go back to the way he and I were before,

308
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,960
I still can't just stand and watch him in this situation without doing anything.

309
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:00,180
I understand, too. When Little Monster has recovered a little, we'll bring Liu Cangling back to Wan Lu Sect.

310
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,760
But how do we make him go rescue Brother Cangling?

311
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Seeing his look today, I felt terrified.

312
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,660
Not to mention, he's always detested Brother Cangling.

313
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,020
I'll go test the waters.

314
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,700
If you want to see him just say so...

315
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,870
Stop!

316
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,230
People from the Immortal Sect sneaking around on the premises of our Wan Lu Sect.

317
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,010
What is this?

318
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,980
- Chi Tianming?
- The Captain of the Dark Guards, Lin Ziyu.

319
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,660
Captain, why are you not standing guard at Wu'e Hall,
but patrolling the mountain here?

320
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,920
Might it be that you were demoted for some reason?

321
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,810
In Jianghu, they say that ever since Qin Zhiyan came to Wan Lu Sect,

322
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:24,720
Captain Lin was repeatedly crossed in front of Li Chenlan and was demoted several times.

323
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,600
One can assume that for Qin Zhiyan you feel bone-deep hatred.

324
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,920
How I do in Wan Lu Sect is no concern of other people.

325
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:43,390
Captain Lin, I have a piece of news that might help relieve your spleen.

326
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:50,000
Tonight at midnight, unless Qin Zhiyan comes to Phoenix Mountain and offers her blood,

327
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,290
Liu Cangling's life may be cut down.

328
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,780
This isn't my idea. It's the Revered Lady Changyu's intention.

329
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:07,360
We only want Qin Zhiyan. We won't cause any loss to Wan Lu Sect.

330
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,280
Captain Lin, you only need to turn a blind eye.

331
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,300
As for what happens next, it will have nothing to do with you.

332
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,510
How can we have you people from the Immortal Sect roam freely in the palaces of our Wan Lu Sect?

333
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,900
You'd best vanish quickly, before I raise my hand.

334
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,080
Regarding your piece of news, I'll deliver it myself.

335
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,360
Well, then, many thanks, Captain Lin.

336
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,520
Master!

337
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,910
Chenlan, your little disciple is looking for you.

338
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,160
West Hill Master!

339
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,380
Send more people. We must find Seventeen.

340
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,740
Seventeen? What happened to Seventeen?

341
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,470
Didn't she run off carrying Qin Qianxian?

342
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,030
She didn't come back? She got lost again?

343
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:17,190
Young Apprentice, it appears you are well acquainted with our Wan Lu Sect's East Hill Master.

344
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,950
Just a little hearsay.

345
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,860
So... Master... were you the one who called Lu Seventeen back?

346
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,220
Where did she go before?

347
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,150
She was seeking Resurrection Grass for the previous sect leader.
(T/N: mythical herb to resurrect the dead in ancient times)

348
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:36,330
Ah Rong, even though this operation thwarted Liu Suruo's plan,

349
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,680
we still have to find a way to solve it once for all.

350
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,470
Send a unit to verify Liu Suruo's movements.

351
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,360
Understood. That Liu Suruo is staying dormant in Phoenix Mountain.

352
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,750
So we need to get Qin Qianxian back as soon as possible

353
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,730
and keep the Qin family's blood under watch, before we plan the rest.

354
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,690
Hey, Young Apprentice.

355
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,100
Your actions today were extremely dangerous, indeed.

356
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,290
You made your Master unhappy. So you have to find a way to coax him.

357
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,830
Master...

358
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,410
- Do you want to be coaxed?
- No.

359
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,850
I think I have to coax.

360
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,730
How would you do it?

361
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,800
Admit my mistake.

362
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,870
What was your mistake?

363
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,930
I shouldn't have allowed my little sister to take action on her own.

364
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:38,980
I made Master worry. Aside from that... I didn't do anything wrong...

365
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,700
You...

366
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,650
I worry.

367
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:55,500
Of course, of course! When I go back, I'll yell at her. How could she make Master worry?

368
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,110
If I worry, it's for you.

369
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,850
What of me is there to worry about?

370
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,190
Rather, Master, how's your wound?

371
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,240
No harm. I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

372
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,130
Master, I want to bring Liu Cangling back to Wan Lu Sect, too.

373
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,470
You're worried about him?

374
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,600
How could I? How could your pupil be worried about anyone but Master?

375
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm just concerned that they'll use him again and cause more accidents.

376
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,350
Wait a few days until my wound is healed, and I'll go with you.

377
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,730
Thank you so much, Master!

378
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,540
Bear in mind, you can't act on your own.
