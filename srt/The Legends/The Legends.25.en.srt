[Episode 25]

3
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,540
Do I regret it?

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,900
Without the Liuhe Tianyi Sword, she's not the powerful one.

5
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,250
Guard Leader, we can't lay a hand on Lady Zhiyan. Everything needs to wait for Sect Leader—

6
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,020
Ah Da, Sect Leader has been befuddled by this devil woman. We must clean house today.

7
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,960
- But—
- Shut up. Capture him.

8
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,050
Step aside!

9
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,590
Lady Zhiyan! Run!

10
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,360
You... what do you want? I'm Sect Leader...

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,560
- I'm Sect Leader's disciple.
- Keep being noisy and we'll kill you right now.

12
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,490
Lin Ziyu, you're so bold.

13
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,100
You move and I'll kill her.

14
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,360
Demoness, stay calm. Don't forget.

15
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,180
All right. You win.

16
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,290
Put down the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

17

[No Evil Palace]

18
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,380
Qin Zhiyan.

19
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,290
You fooled us all for a long time.

20
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,900
Do you admit to your crimes?

21
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,020
Admit to crimes? What crimes did I commit?

22
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,800
You pretend to be Qin Zhiyan,

23
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,600
infiltrate Wan Lu Sect, get close to Sect Leader with ulterior motives!

24
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,870
Are all these not crimes?

25
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,920
What do you mean pretending to be Qin Zhiyan?

26
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,610
I am Qin Zhiyan.

27
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,490
This is my twin younger sister.

28
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,040
Ah... yes. This is my twin older sister.

29
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,730
Nonsense! All of Jianghu knows

30
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,600
that the precious daughter in Xuanyu Hall is only one.

31
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,790
Right now, there's another. If you don't believe me, go down there and ask my father.

32
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,330
Qin Zhiyan, ever since you two came to Wan Lu Sect,

33
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,600
you've caused our Sect Leader to be injured many times and ruined our Wan Lu Sect's foundation.

34
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
So no matter what status you two have,

35
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,190
as long as you're a threat to Wan Lu Sect,

36
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,890
the Dark Guard have the responsibility to kill you on the spot.

37
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,500
Yes, that's right!

38
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,250
We should kill her!

39
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,790
Kill her!

40
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,500
Guard Leader Lin, these two have disturbed my North Hills many times,

41
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,160
and have caused a rift between myself and the disciples.

42
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,090
Why don't you leave the two of them for me deal with?

43
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,120
Kill?

44
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,610
Deal with?

45
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,530
That's funny.

46
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,360
One, I'm not from North Hills.

47
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,200
Two, I'm not a Dark Guard.

48
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,840
My master is Wan Lu Sect's Leader, Li Chenlan.

49
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,480
Even if I am at fault, whether it's to be killed or tortured,

50
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,890
it's up to my master to deal with.

51
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,990
What gives you the right to determine my fate here?

52
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,920
Everyone in this hall today,

53
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,420
I'll remember each and every one of you.

54
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,450
In the future, I'll definitely settle this score with you all.

55
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,870
Don't think you'll get away with it.

56
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,530
All right. I want to see how you'll settle this in the future.

57
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,900
Are you hurt?

58
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,590
I'm fine.

59
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,820
Sect Leader, Qin Zhiyan's behaviors are suspicious.

60
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,730
She should be an only child,

61
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,790
but a woman with similar appearance infiltrated our sect.

62
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,470
I'm afraid she's a spy from the Immortal Sects. We should evict her from Wan Lu Sect.

63
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,780
Sect Leader, Qin Zhiyan has deceived everyone. She should be punished.

64
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,390
I already knew about this.

65
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,800
Sect Leader, you're the leader of this sect. If you want a disciple,

66
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,980
we won't say anything.

67
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,690
But now that you mention this, it seems you are biased toward the two of them.

68
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,410
Sect Leader behaving this way,

69
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,930
I'm afraid it'll be difficult to convince the public's opinion.

70
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,230
That's right.

71
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,290
- Sect Leader, the two of them caused you to be injured many times—
- My body is fine.

72
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:55,910
Deception of superiors and inferiors, according to sect rules, deserves three blows of the rod.

73
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,580
In that case, my disciple's fault is my responsibility.

74
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,160
For these three blows, I'll put myself in their place.

75
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,200
North Hill Master, will this be acceptable to the public opinion?

76
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,950
All right. Sect Leader will be punished in place of his disciple.

77
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,330
That'll definitely be acceptable.

78
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,820
You dare?

79
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,230
Move aside.

80
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,970
Does the North Hill Master really dare to strike?

81
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,780
This...

82
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,760
Yuan Jie, you really dare strike him?

83
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,300
A subordinate rebelling! Dark Guards, take down the North Hill Master!

84
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,520
- Yes!
- Stop!

85
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,210
North Hill Master is acting on command. There is no need to stop him.

86
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,750
Good. Thank you for your trust.

87
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,790
There are two more blows. I will act freely then.

88
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,370
Yuan Jie!

89
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,980
Li Chenlan really does have a severe injury.

90
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,120
Three blows were dealt. Regarding Qin Zhiyan's matter,

91
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,000
no one is allowed to mention it anymore.

92
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,060
Li Chenlan! That year you trapped Lu Zhaoyao

93
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,100
and survived under the shield of the Wanjun Sword.

94
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,980
Today, it is the same.

95
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,220
Without the Wanjun Sword, you're nothing!

96
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,160
In our Wan Lu Sect, we speak by strength.

97
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,390
Since you can't even take three blows from me, how can you command the Wan Lu Sect?

98
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,980
Li Chenlan, ever since you became Sect Leader,

99
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,530
our sect's standards have turned timid and hesitant.

100
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,570
The followers are not free anymore.

101
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,350
How are we any different than the Immortal Sects?

102
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,770
Today, you even have a woman from the Immortal Sect as a pupil. Protecting these two.

103
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,770
There is no fairness. If you continue this way,

104
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,830
as the leader of the Wan Lu Sect, how can you answer the people?

105
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,640
Demoness, what to do? Should we help Li Chenlan?

106
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,980
Demoness, what are you thinking about?

107
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,570
At this point, you can't still be thinking that you want to kill Li Chenlan?

108
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,780
North Hill Master!

109
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,940
This matter today is amazing indeed.

110
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,530
With your actions, wanting to punish the Sect Leader is a lie,

111
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,800
wanting to grab the chance to murder the sect leader is true.

112
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,200
Previously, you stabbed me and took my blood,

113
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,070
I guess it's because you were in league with the Immortal Sect.

114
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,810
On the deeper reason why you targeted me today, I fear we need to investigate thoroughly.

115
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,710
The person who really wants to hurt Wan Lu Sect and assassinate its leader is here.

116
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,890
You people of the Wan Lu Sect, what are you staring at?

117
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,310
In the Palace of No Evil when is it ever your turn to speak, girl?

118
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,110
Protect the Sect Leader!

119
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,980
Sect Leader, how do we deal with this?

120
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,160
Kill!

121
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,290
Kill me as you will.

122
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,140
Chop me as you will.

123
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,480
This old man has long since wished to go down

124
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
and be with the previous sect leader!

125
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,560
Wait!

126
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,090
Lock him up!

127
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,060
- Sect Leader!
- Lock him in the cells.

128
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,250
The others under him are to be expelled from the Wan Lu Sect.

129
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,230
Yes, Sir.

130
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,330
All dismissed.

131
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,000
Lin Ziyu!

132
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,300
What do you think your devotion is worth?

133
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,990
You're nothing but a dog under Li Chenlan's command.

134
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,990
North Hill Master, worry for yourself before talking about others.

135
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,590
Get people to guard this place well.

136
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,150
Yes!

137
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,940
[No Evil Palace]

138
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,800
Why haven't you left yet?

139
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,100
Master, when did you find out?

140
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,600
Twin sisters? I've long since known.

141
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,420
Why would you help me? Be so good to me?

142
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,480
Where the heart goes, the mind can't control.

143
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,510
Liu Suruo!

144
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,340
Liu Suruo.

145
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,140
You're that widow they talk about in Jianghu.

146
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,540
Jiang Wu from New Mountain.

147
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,890
Qin Qianxian from Thousand Dust Pavillion... do you want to kill him?

148
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,650
You people from the Immortal Sect are straightforward.

149
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,590
I do want to kill him. What can you do for me?

150
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,750
I can lend you a hand.

151
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,330
Yeah?

152
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,100
The Revered One of Changyu actually wants to kill Qin Qianxian?

153
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,230
But you looked for me instead.

154
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,760
Do you know what my relationship with him is?

155
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,460
I don't.

156
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,780
I only know that, with Qin Qianxian's usual way of conduct,

157
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,500
his hot pursuit of you is very abnormal.

158
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,840
And when things are abnormal, there's a ghost.
(Note: "there's a ghost" means "something's fishy")

159
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,820
You really said it right! I'm just his mind's ghost.

160
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,360
He wants to kill me because he fears me.

161
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,750
You found the right person. To kill him, in this world

162
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,250
for sure, I'm the only one who can.

163
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,710
I can strike Qin Qianxian for you, but you must promise me:

164
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,160
you can't strike Qin Zhiyan.

165
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,300
Qin Zhiyan?

166
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,640
She's my woman.

167
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,270
Which Qin Zhiyan are you referring to?

168
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,600
How many Qin Zhiyans are there?

169
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,680
Two.

170
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,560
What are you saying?

171
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,710
I'm saying, there are two Qin Zhiyan's staying in Wan Lu Sect.

172
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,440
Thank you.

173
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,110
Thank you.

174
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,670
So many people again?

175
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,900
You... Who are you?

176
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,430
You forgot me already?

177
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,420
All men are mortal since the dawn of times. Donate some clothes, will you?

178
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,650
Can't do. Can't do.

179
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,320
Who's going to donate clothes if you shout like that?

180
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,590
So that's how it is.

181
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,400
Before I clear that up, you can't touch either Qin Zhiyan.

182
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,020
Fine.

183
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,390
Speak. How do you plan to deal with Qin Qianxian?

184
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,590
I need to get Qin Qianxian's blood for a purpose.

185
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,460
In two days, each of the Immortal Sects

186
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,060
will be compelling Qin Qianxian to donate blood.

187
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,480
If he's unwilling, the people of the Immortal Sect may not rise against him.

188
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,760
If we get to that point, I'll need your assistance.

189
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,370
What are you preparing to take his blood with?

190
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,320
The blade of Ci Sword can draw blood.

191
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,650
Qin Qianxian is not easy to deal with. I'll change that for you.

192
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,930
Revered One of Changyu, you came all this way. By all means, don't lose your wits.

193
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,730
We can only succeed in this matter.

194
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,990
I'll give you a new idea.

195
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,410
Qin Qianxian is benevolent. In your dwellings,

196
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,560
don't you have Qin Zhiyan's fiancé?

197
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,720
Think of a way to make him attack Qin Qianxian.

198
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,230
Why?

199
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,390
Because he's innocent.

200
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
[Zhuochen Hall]

201
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,720
Demoness, what's wrong with you?

202
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,980
How about Li Chenlan? Is he okay?

203
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,780
He's okay for now.

204
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,750
I was almost scared to death today. I never expected

205
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,520
North Hill Master would revolt against Li Chenlan on the spot.

206
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,400
He probably got the idea spontaneously.

207
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,680
He was testing Little Monster's wounds with his first two strikes...

208
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,220
On his third strike, he tried to kill him.

209
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,570
He didn't expect to be stopped by the Wanjun Sword.

210
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,230
Since he failed that, he had to revolt.

211
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,140
But why did he revolt against Li Chenlan?

212
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,390
I think Li Chenlan managed Wan Lu Sect well.

213
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,660
And he's really good to you.

214
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,680
What's there to be good?

215
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,250
He knew early on we were lying to him and he didn't blame us.

216
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,780
And he kept helping us.

217
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,930
That's because your face is pretty.

218
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,310
Demoness, why do I feel like you're intentionally avoiding

219
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,480
and ignoring Li Chenlan being good to you?

220
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,580
I just think he likes

221
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,820
the real person underneath this face.

222
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,140
Even though you're stubborn, I think you're already starting to change.

223
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,550
You're starting to care about him and want to protect him.

224
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,960
What nonsense are you saying?

225
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,570
How could I? I...

226
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,770
I use to think

227
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,750
and trusted very much.

228
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,190
I regarded him as my lifelong pursuit.

229
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,020
But this person injured me, harmed me,

230
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,600
and killed my only relative.

231
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,080
I swore, ever since then,

232
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,560
no one would let me down.

233
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,590
I didn't protect Li Chenlan and I don't care about him.

234
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,170
- Demoness...
- It doesn't matter how I live.

235
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,990
Regardless of how I live, I've lived through all these years.

236
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,290
Ever since then, I've lived well.

237
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,770
So stop telling me things like Li Chenlan likes me. I don't believe it.

238
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,690
You don't believe yourself.

239
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,590
But you deserve to be cared for.

240
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,270
Cared for?

241
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,110
Care about the Wan Lu Sect Leader, Lu Zhaoyao? Who has such a big face (shameless)?

242
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,970
Me. My face is big. I care about you.

243
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,090
But I think Li Chenlan's face is also big because he cares about you.

244
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,370
And his face is probably a lot bigger than mine.

245
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,050
Those who let you down in the past are indeed bad people.

246
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:56,170
But there are still many good people in this world.

247
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,130
Then, right now, I'm a bad person who lets down good people.

248
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,960
- You—
- Enough.

249
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,420
It's been a long day. Let's go to bed.

250
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,370
Sect Leader!

251
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,350
Sect Leader, there's news from the Immortal Sects.

252
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,200
Liu Suruo plans to hold an Immortal Sect's meeting at Phoenix Mountain.

253
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,390
Bring me the Thousand-Mile Mirror.

254
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,760
Yes.

255
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,950
Have another Dark Guard get it.

256
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,620
From now on, you don't have to guard Wu'e Hall anymore.

257
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,390
Yes.

258
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,430
- Ah Da.
- Guard Leader.

259
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,690
Get the Thousand-Mile Mirror... and bring it to Master.

260
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,870
Yes.

261
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,320
Guard Leader, about yesterday...

262
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,900
I did what I needed to do yesterday.

263
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,080
You also did what you needed to do.

264
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,830
Hurry and go. Don't let Sect Leader wait too long.

265
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,260
Yes.

266
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,130
Sect Leader.

267
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,170
In the future, you'll manage the Dark Guards.

268
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,740
What?

269
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,250
Then Guard Leader...

270
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,700
There's only one Dark Guard leader, and that's you.

271
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,200
But...

272
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,090
Yes.

273
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,820
You're dismissed.

274
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,900
Yuezhu?

275
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,420
Ah Rong!

276
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,490
Ah Rong! I turned into the Sect Leader.

277
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,490
Sorry. I haven't used the mirror for a long time.

278
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,460
So, Yuezhu took it to her vanity desk.

279
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,820
I assume you're looking for me in regards to Liu Suruo

280
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,460
calling for the Grand Meeting for Immortal Sects.

281
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,020
Zhaoyao saw Jin Xian's body at Jianxin Sect.

282
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,830
I believe... Liu Suruo hasn't given up on reviving Luo Mingxuan.

283
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,560
As long as Luo Mingxuan's body is still on Earth,

284
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,820
I won't allow anyone the chance to wake him.

285
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,220
They are holding the Grand Meeting so hastily.

286
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,520
I'm sure Liu Suruo has some schemes.

287
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,240
Will Qin Qianxian go to Phoenix Mountain to attend the Immortal Sect's meeting?

288
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,260
I haven't heard if he's rejected the invite.

289
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,120
Are you worried Liu Suruo will make a move on him?

290
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,230
Previously, Qin Zhiyan said her father died because his blood was completely drained.

291
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,440
And then Qin Zhiyan was attacked at Wan Lu Sect by Immortal Sect spies.

292
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,180
It was also to obtain blood.

293
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,930
I think, in order to wake Jin Xian, Liu Suruo definitely needs the Qin bloodline.

294
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,150
It's already been a few days since Liu Suruo obtained Qin Yu's blood,

295
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,650
but Jin Xian is still not awake.

296
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,360
It seems just Qin Yu's blood is not enough.

297
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,160
I'm afraid... Liu Suruo has a hidden agenda in holding the Grand Meeting.

298
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
The drunk's target is not the alcohol.

299
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,200
Qin Qianxian pursues the State of Absolute Purity. He's a wise man.

300
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,420
He might know what Liu Suruo is plotting.

301
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,280
He might not go to this Immortal Sect's meeting.

302
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,880
But after what happened to Jianxin Sect, he might...

303
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,740
Ah Rong, I have a favor to ask of you.

304
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,700
I know. I'll go do it now.

305
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,300
You know what it's about?

306
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,680
Isn't it just to stop Qin Qianxian?

307
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,950
I'll depart shortly for Thousand Dust Pavilion.

308
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,940
Sorry for troubling you and disturbing your peace.

309
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,750
There's no need for thanks between the two of us.

310
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,510
If it's too difficult to persuade him, Lu Seventeen has been out for too long, tell her to come back.

311
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,390
I've sent men to search for her in the Divine Islands.

312
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,150
A few days ago I received news, they've found her whereabouts.

313
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,210
That's good.

314
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,570
Chenlan.

315
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,740
Little Beauty, I was late to Jinzhou City. Were you injured?

316
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,750
Li Chenlan didn't protect you well, so come find me. See you at Shunan Town for Qixi (Chinese's Valentine's Day).

317
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,660
I see. That evil force in the Demon-Shield Ward was Jiang Wu.

318
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
This lecher.

319
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,490
[Little Beauty, I was late to Jinzhou City. Were you injured? Li Chenlan didn't protect you well, so come find me. See you at Shunan Town for Qixi.]

320
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,480
Pluck all the bird's feathers and make some soup.

321
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,780
Yes.

322
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,270
- I... I didn't say anything.
- Tell him I went out.

323
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,040
Sister went out.

324
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,580
Stay here.

325
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,540
Yes.

326
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,310
Did he really come here to catch the bird?

327
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,530
Looks like he's here to catch you in an act of adultery.

328
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,930
I'm going to follow him.

329
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,550
Did something happen?

330
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,590
Nothing happened. Just killed a beast.

331
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,510
Your expression looks unhappy.

332
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,050
I'll leave you with persuading Qin Qianxian.

333
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,390
Guard Ah Da will escort you to Thousand Dust Pavilion.

334
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,970
All right.

335
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,460
Even though he's the Demon King's son,

336
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,980
all he does is work and read.

337
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,340
He's not like a demon at all.

338
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,160
He only looks like a demon when his eyes turn red.

339
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,000
By rights, I would prefer a ruthless man like Jiang Wu.

340
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,860
But for some reason,

341
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,060
Little Monster,

342
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,080
are you really what Zhiyan said? You like

343
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,790
the real me who is underneath her face?

344
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,370
Sect Leader.

345
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,820
Speak.

346
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,800
You were on a training retreat prior to this...

347
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,890
and now I need your instructions for some problems during that period.

348
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,130
All right.

349
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,650
Make a trip to Jiangzhou City and escort Chief Sima to Thousand Dust Pavilion.

350
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,130
Yes.

351
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,720
Master, why is your face red? Are you sick?

352
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,310
Should I tell Chief Gu to come?

353
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,750
No need.

354
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,670
I'm just... just hot inside the pavilion. Go on now.

355
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,170
Yes.

356
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,720
Did I kiss him just now?

357
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,830
Probably not. I dodged quickly.

358
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,210
But we did kiss!

359
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,730
Probably not?

360
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,530
We kissed! I think we did kiss!

361
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,700
But there was no reaction from him.

362
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,890
Why do we suddenly need to escort Chief Sima to Thousand Dust Pavilion?

363
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,600
It probably has something to do with the upcoming Grand Meeting at Phoenix Mountain.

364
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,370
Liu Suruo is holding a Grand Meeting at Phoenix Mountain.

365
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,000
What?

366
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,340
It makes sense. Since Li Chenlan crushed the Demon-Shield Ward,

367
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,190
the Immortal Sects would want to get back at Wan Lu Sect.

368
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,740
Do you think Qin Qianxian will go?

369
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,160
Judging from my uncle's personality, I believe he won't watch from the sidelines.

370
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I think he'll find out the reason behind it.

371
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,680
Where are you going, Demoness?

372
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,670
I'm going to capture him. Liu Suoruo must be planning to force him to give blood in the Grand Meeting,

373
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,490
so that she can revive Luo Mingxuan. I can't let her succeed.

374
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,890
My uncle might not let her win. Don't panic.

375
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,720
Demoness, I want to go to the Grand Meeting.

376
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,020
What? Say it again.

377
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,980
I want to go to the Grand Meeting.

378
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,360
Are you crazy? Your uncle is at least capable of protecting himself.

379
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,790
What can you do there? Deliver your head to them?

380
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,060
Demoness, you've been the one looking after me all this while.

381
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,040
From the Ice Cavern to Cleanse Dust Hall,

382
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,380
you've been the one protecting and looking after me.

383
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,130
You taught me how to face a completely different life.

384
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,860
I'm really grateful.

385
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,350
You also showed me a completely different outlook on life

386
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,110
as well as how a person can be kind and strong at the same time.

387
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,690
Stop flattering me. I won't let you go no matter what you say.

388
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,170
I'm not flattering you. I'm telling the truth.

389
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,080
This time, I want to shoulder my own responsibilities.

390
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,930
I want to take this opportunity...

391
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,230
to tell everyone about what Liu Suruo did,

392
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:45,000
so that everyone sees her true colors.

393
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,420
What a fool. What are the Immortal Sects like nowadays?

394
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,950
They are a pack of desperate wolves. Doing whatever they can to turn the tables around.

395
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:59,580
Once they learn of a way to revive Luo Mingxuan, they'll do so at all cost.

396
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,150
They'd rather sacrifice a few lives

397
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,430
than lose to Wan Lu Sect.

398
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,550
This is their so-called justice.

399
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm the heir of Mystic Jade Hall and a member of the Immortal Sects.

400
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,550
Even though you see me as a weak and foolish girl,

401
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,460
I have my responsibilities to bear.

402
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,130
This time, I must let everyone know that...

403
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,560
Liu Suruo killed my father and I am not crazy!

404
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,370
What do you have apart from your determination?

405
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:54,900
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

406
