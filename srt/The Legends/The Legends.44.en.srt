[Episode 44]

3
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,630
Keep an eye on the former New Mountain disciples. Don't let them commit crimes in Shunan village.

4
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,420
- Yes!
- Yes!

5
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,070
It's fate.

6
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,790
The Wan Lu Sect's pretty good. Up the mountain, there's such a mess

7
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,730
and yet it's not affecting the life of the people down the mountain.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,330
It didn't use to be like this.

9
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,920
Jiang Wu,

10
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,410
the day you gave up Qin Qianxian's power to save me, I was very surprised.

11
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,540
What's to be surprised?

12
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,230
Considering the power you had then, Li Chenlan and I were no match for you.

13
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,260
You had already become the strongest in the world,

14
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,610
but you gave it up.

15
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,730
So you've forgotten everything I told you before?

16
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,040
I told you... I love you.

17
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,920
I can dig out my heart and give it to you.

18
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,130
What is it? Are you enchanted?

19
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,270
Your wound hasn't healed yet?

20
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,680
Of course, it hasn't.

21
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,330
This is a Nine-Cycle Pill. It's good for your wound.

22
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,070
I just knew you cared about me.

23
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,550
It's getting late. Let's go our separate ways.

24
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,110
It's on the way! I'll go with you.

25
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,870
Where do I sleep?

26
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,810
- The Wan Lu Sect is so big. Find any place to sleep!
- Where should I look?

27
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,270
The Wan Lu Sect only has three main palaces. You go back to Cleanse Dust Palace,

28
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,870
the two of us sleep in Pure Wave Palace?

29
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,860
- No way.
- No way.

30
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,240
Hey, you think you're against it? I am against it!

31
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,520
You sick pervert...

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
This way...

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,490
I'll sleep in Wu'e Hall.

34
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,180
It's perfect to reflect my noble status.

35
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,290
That's decided.

36
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,980
You...

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,990
I just want to sleep in the most spacious place.

38
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,120
Why is it you again?

39
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,500
You've begun to change.

40
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,340
Change?

41
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,430
You finally understand how to give up.

42
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,630
You think I need you to natter about what I understand?

43
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,620
What'd you want?

44
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,040
Ah Wu, stop sleeping.

45
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,580
What's to look at?

46
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,390
I said there was no place to stay, I could only sleep in Wu'e Hall.

47
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,370
Y'all have your meeting. I'll sleep a little longer.

48
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,150
What important matter is there in the sect today?

49
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,920
Sect Leaders,

50
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,430
after the Wan Lu Sect's strife and the battle with Sect Leader Jiang,

51
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,600
the fields down the mountains were ruined and most of the harvest was poor.

52
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,420
The taxes collected this year are not as good as in the past.

53
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,040
Moreover, the cost of repair for the houses destroyed in the Wan Lu Sect

54
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,490
is much higher this year. I wonder if the three sect leaders--

55
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,440
If there's no money, go rob it!

56
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,590
There are so many rich people around, you think it's not enough to repair a few shacks?

57
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,620
How can that work?

58
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,700
Or else, this way. Since they can't be repaired, don't.

59
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,660
Anyway, there's no rush to live in those few houses.

60
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,130
Let everyone hold on for now. We'll go back to it next year.

61
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,000
- This...
- "This" what? That's it.

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,310
- Yes, Sect Leader!
- Lower your voice!

63
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,590
Little Red Hair!

64
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,430
So you're bullying my disciples right in my face?

65
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,020
Just playing! Nobody will die.

66
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,100
Want to try?

67
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,080
No matter what you did in New Mountain, here in the Wan Lu Sect, you have to follow the Wan Lu Sect's rules.

68
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,760
You can't bully our sect's disciples.

69
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,900
All right. Then have a match with me.

70
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,010
If you win, I'll do as you say.

71
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,300
Deal. But we can't use living people as targets.

72
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,230
I lost my footing.

73
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,020
You're such a pain! What are you doing?

74
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,270
- For real, you're so annoying! What are you doing?
- Easy!

75
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,450
- Are you competing or not?
- Enough!

76
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,930
- Jiang Wu! Stop there!
- It hurts!

77
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,490
So annoying! You're a pain!

78
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,350
- What are you laughing at?
- Are you cleaning up after them?

79
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,810
Sect Leader. West Hill Master.

80
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,640
About the expenditures beyond income discussed today in the hall, I've thought of a countermeasure.

81
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,330
Sell the utensils and provisions stored in the Wan Lu Sect,

82
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,030
and merge the rooms for use. Save unnecessary expenses.

83
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,870
But taxes cannot be increased.

84
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,170
Remember. Restrain the new disciples; they are not to harass the people.

85
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,380
Yes, Sect Leader.

86
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,500
- Sect Leader...
- What? Is there anything else?

87
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,690
Sect Leader Jiang and Sect Leader Lu gave these to me.

88
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,140
They both wanted me to do as they said. Whose orders should I follow?

89
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,550
[...cut down on meat expenses...]

90
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,480
[Rob]

91
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,400
In the end, each according to their style.

92
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,970
[Sect Leader's Response]

93
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,780
Do as I said.

94
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,900
Yes, Sect Leader.

95
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,540
Little Monster!

96
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,550
It's so late. Why are you here?

97
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,970
I came to have some romance with you.

98
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,390
Let's go! Let's take a trip to the Land of Sojourn.

99
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,560
I just don't believe that little Red Hair can follow us there.

100
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,670
Let's go.

101
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,880
[Empty]

102
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,220
Ziyou!

103
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,880
Sister! Brother-in-Law.

104
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,370
Sister, the effect of the Empty Pill on you...

105
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,130
- It's solved.
- It's solved? That's great!

106
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,330
It's solved? How did you solve it?

107
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,160
The Diamond Hexagram.

108
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,670
The Diamond Hexagram?

109
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,710
There actually was such an art!

110
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,890
Pity. Pity!

111
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,440
How is it that you get all the best things?

112
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,100
Sister, you're really lucky. If you had to go with the shopkeeper's method

113
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,220
and had to keep relying on the Land of Sojourn pills to neutralize the chronic effects,

114
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,210
it would have been hard for you.

115
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,330
Why?

116
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,530
Brother-in-Law, you don't know. The things from our Land of Sojourn,

117
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,490
if you have them for a long time, it becomes difficult to stop.

118
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,000
Once you've had a certain amount, there may be no more chances

119
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,520
to leave our Land of Sojourn again.

120
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,820
I remember when Sister wanted to leave this Land of Sojourn,

121
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,550
she didn't hesitate to dive into the Cleanse Spring and wash out her blood,

122
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,590
but she had to swallow a lot of pain.

123
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,800
Wash out blood?

124
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,730
Most people in the Land of Sojourn would sooner die rather than go to that place.

125
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,100
...It's nothing. Am I just an ordinary person?

126
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,970
How weird.

127
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,190
The two of them clearly went in from here.

128
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,420
Are you so great? I don't believe it.

129
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,760
Mo Qing, thank you for these last few days.

130
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,610
Why are you suddenly saying this?

131
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,170
Though I founded the Wan Lu Sect, I know nothing about management.

132
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,610
Through all these years, I have to thank you for managing it so well.

133
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,560
And there's also the matter of Jiang Wu. I know you've been enduring all along.

134
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,610
He saved your life. Even though I don't like him,

135
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,850
I'm still grateful. Besides,

136
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,170
I'm not the only one who's been enduring.

137
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,000
Jiang Wu, what a brat! What's he doing now?

138
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,460
- How did you come out?
- Who told you to chop the tree down?

139
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,970
I want to fell it! When I see you two together, I'm unhappy!

140
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,270
We said we'd be three sect leaders, then you two go to a place by yourselves.

141
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,680
That's too unfair!

142
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,000
What do you want to do?

143
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,770
I'll chop the tree down.

144
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,060
Chop what down? Did I authorize you to do it?

145
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,970
I can also not chop it down. As long as you two promise me

146
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,720
that from now on you won't come here again.

147
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,630
Jiang Wu, don't go too far.

148
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,590
Back when you begged me right here to save her, your attitude wasn't like this.

149
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,570
If you don't promise me, tomorrow I'll come and chop it down.

150
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,820
In the future, unless the situation demands it, Zhaoyao and I will not come here.

151
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,740
This is my last concession. Don't take it too far.

152
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,440
Now, this is the right attitude.

153
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,810
You're very pretty today.

154
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,770
Haven't you just left? How come you're back again?

155
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,380
Give me an Empty Pill.

156
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,190
Young Lord, your account holds considerable assets. One trifling Empty Pill is not worth much money.

157
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,290
Would you like to add a few more?

158
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,540
I want 10.

159
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,850
Young Lord, you're on a grand scale!

160
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,730
What are you carrying?

161
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,170
This is a soup that Sect Leader Lu made for Sect Leader Li.

162
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,610
Lu Zhaoyao made it?

163
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,790
Tastes good indeed.

164
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,640
Tell Li Chenlan that Lu Zhaoyao sent him a bowl.

165
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,750
Sect Leader, as you predicted,

166
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,660
I passed by the entrance carrying the soup and said that Sect Leader Lu had made it for you.

167
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,670
That Jiang Wu drank it down to the last drop.

168
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,530
As long as he drank it.

169
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,730
Sect Leader, allow me one question.

170
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,130
- That medicine...
- Not lethal. It'll just let him into the place he wants to see.

171
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,710
All right, then.

172
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Ah Wu, what's wrong?

173
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,510
My bowels have been upset since this morning.

174
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,840
- Go to the doctor.
- No need. It's nothing.

175
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,820
I'll take a trip to the loo.

176
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,120
- Do you have paper?
- No!

177
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,030
Go get it!

178
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,280
Master, the solution you wrote for our problem last time worked completely.

179
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,110
It's going to be another good year for our Wan Lu Sect.

180
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,630
All right.

181
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,570
These are the documents received from our men.

182
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,010
Leave them for now.

183
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,660
What reaction did Jiang Wu have after he drank the soup?

184
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,690
According to our men, Jiang Wu has been running to the bathroom all day. He's also looking pale.

185
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,810
I'm afraid he's not feeling well.

186
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,590
Should we summon South HIll Master?

187
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,100
- He's only having diarrhea?
- That's right.

188
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,960
Let him take this left-over, too.

189
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,550
Yes.

190
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,500
Eat slowly. No one is fighting with you for it.

191
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,800
It's all your fault, Sect Leader! You ordered to cut down our expenses on food...

192
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,420
and I starved for days.

193
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,670
So, it's my fault now?

194
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:54,450
Demoness, aren't you worried about Jiang Wu taking over the Wan Lu Sect?

195
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,280
- He's not capable of doing that.
- Why?

196
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,850
Jiang Wu might seem aggressive,

197
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,510
but Little Monster has quietly kept actual power over the sect.

198
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,770
I was away for so many years and he did manage to lead the Wan Lu Sect so well. He's pretty good.

199
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,660
Is Little Monster that good?

200
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,730
Would I fall for an incompetent man?

201
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,100
Lu Zhaoyao! Come out!

202
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,470
That Little Red Hair dares use Sect Leader's name!

203
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,560
How can we allow him to act like a boss in the Wan Lu Sect?

204
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,370
Don't worry. Your two sect leaders aren't stupid.

205
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,520
I only have one sect leader.

206
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,210
Fine. Just one.

207
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,820
They are waiting.

208
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,020
Waiting for what?

209
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,340
Jiang Wu is so eccentric and unrestrained. He certainly can't get used to this life.

210
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,740
Once he's fed up, of course, he'll leave.

211
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,580
- Will he?
- He will. Wait for it.

212
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,430
Little niece,

213
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,600
why do I feel like you know everything now?

214
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,060
Why do you always call me your little niece?

215
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,240
Lu Zhaoyao.

216
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,670
What is the matter with you?

217
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,410
What did you put into the soup you cooked for Li Chenlan?

218
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,070
Soup? What soup?

219
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,680
I get it now. It was from Li Chenlan.

220
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,570
I have a question. Why do you like him?

221
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,610
Is it because he's nice to you? I can, too.

222
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,740
- You can't.
- Why?

223
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,850
Because when you met me, you had already lost.

224
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,590
What does that mean?

225
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,000
What does that mean?

226
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,870
I'd already lost when I met her?

227
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,460
What exactly does that mean?

228
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,820
Ah Wu, are you feeling better?

229
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,180
Much better. What is the matter?

230
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,030
By now they've stopped reporting important matters of the Wan Lu Sect to Wu'e Hall.

231
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,770
They just send the reports directly to Li Chenlan.

232
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,700
I was just wondering

233
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,160
aside from breeding cattle, farming lands, and fixing houses,

234
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,230
how could there be no major issues in the Wan Lu Sect?

235
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,100
So, Ah Wu,

236
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,220
you need to find a way to strengthen your position in the Wan Lu Sect.

237
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,050
That's easy. Lu Zhaoyao lost her Liuhe Tianyi Sword, right?

238
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,840
Go track down Lin Ziyu's whereabouts.

239
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
- What does this have to do with the Liuhe Tianyi Sword?
- Strengthen my position.

240
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,950
Li Chenlan got the Liuhe Tianyi Sword for Lu Zhaoyao back then.
I can do the same now.

241
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,010
I didn't mean to make you strengthen that position.

242
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,750
What I'm talking about is just this matter. Get to it.

243
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,000
Go.

244
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,430
[Pure Wave Palace]

245
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,570
You're here just at the right time. Share some of the burden with me.

246
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,500
You used to be busier, but you never needed help.

247
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,560
She wasn't around back then. Each day felt like a year.

248
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,600
Now that she's back,

249
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,090
time seems to be flying.

250
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,270
I never thought that one day I could see on your face

251
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,930
such an elated expression.

252
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,300
If you speak of "elation,"

253
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,340
that will only apply once Jiang Wu leaves.

254
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,030
I heard from my scouts that Jiang Wu's trusted aide, Xiao Yi, went out.

255
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,770
Seems he's looking for Lin Ziyu.

256
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,720
We ran into him in Jiangzhou City today.

257
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,710
Is Lin Ziyu in Jiangzhou?

258
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,270
She was spotted in Jiangzhou.

259
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,630
Ah Rong, review the rest of the documents for me. I need to go out.

260
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,000
Those two went out together?

261
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,350
Sister Ziyu, what should we do next?

262
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,970
Jiang Wu has joined the Wan Lu Sect. They are the strongest sect now.

263
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,010
Even though Chi Tianming doesn't like me,

264
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,690
as long as I hold in hand the Liuhe Tianyi Sword,

265
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,310
I believe they'll beg for our help.

266
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,580
Do we still head to the Immortal Sects' territory?

267
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,830
We can't give them the sword so easily.

268
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,130
Otherwise, once we're useless to them,

269
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,600
our lives will be in danger.

270
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,400
No need for all these complications. Just give me your life and it's over.

271
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,070
You've held this sword for too long.

272
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,380
It should be returned to its master.

273
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,420
Today, this sword is mine.

274
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,930
How meddlesome.

275
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,030
What are you two doing?

276
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,500
I prepared a surprise for you, but he ruined it.

277
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,910
We found Lin Ziyu.

278
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,190
- Where is she then?
- She ran.

279
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,190
Chase her!

280
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,660
Give up the sword.

281
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,480
I'll help you.

282
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,090
Mo Qing!

283
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,860
Mo Qing!

284
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,150
Jiang Wu, what do you want to do?

285
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,220
Kill him.

286
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,740
I said I wanted to kill Li Chenlan, seize the Wan Lu Sect and take his place.

287
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,290
At the time you even said you liked me.

288
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,570
Do a good deed.

289
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,610
I want to kill Li Chenlan, seize the Wan Lu Sect

290
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,940
and take his place.

291
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,340
That was then.

292
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,480
Now, it's the same.

293
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,730
- Jiang Wu...
- Bring it on!

294
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,510
Stop!

295
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,230
Treating the wound is most urgent. Let's go back to the Wan Lu Sect.

296
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Let's go!

297
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,560
How is he?

298
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,090
He won't live long.

299
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,920
Won't live long?

300
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,410
If he won't live long, it's great!

301
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,130
I'm telling you, Jiang Wu!

302
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,930
If the Little Monster dies, don't think you'll be fine.

303
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,970
All right. If he dies, I'll be sad with you.

304
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,080
- You--
- Get out.

305
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,820
You have to get out!

306
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,120
You, too, get out. You're deadly loud.

307
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,690
Help me up. Help me up.

308
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,260
Why are you so anxious? That little wound can't be lethal.

309
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,490
Little wound?

310
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:08,080
If something like today happens again, I won't go easy on you.

311
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,420
What's your act now?

312
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,150
I'm hurt, too.

313
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,790
He's awake.

314
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,920
I'm wounded, too. Treat me as well.

315
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,790
Mo Qing!

316
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,560
You're awake. How are you feeling?

317
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,170
No harm.

318
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,110
What "no harm"? I'm still here.

319
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,870
Now you have no right of speech regarding your health.

320
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,160
Li Chenlan, I'm telling you!

321
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,810
In your body there are now two forces, tearing at each other.

322
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,750
I have painstakingly suppressed one of them for you.

323
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,370
You'd best control your state of mind.

324
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,200
Don't make me do it again.

325
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,290
So is he fine or not?

326
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,550
At the moment, there's nothing serious.

327
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,290
You, come here for treatment.

328
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,670
For you two, I can only treat your superficial wounds.

329
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,920
The rest is up to yourselves.

330
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,440
- What is it? Their bodies have something different?
- Of course, they're different.

331
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,120
I can only treat people. I can't treat demons.

332
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,100
Demons? Li Chenlan, who'd have thought you were just like me.

333
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,680
You're ridden in demon essence, too.

334
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,820
Whether I am or not, what's that to do with you?

335
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,480
Gu Hanguang, from now on, you don't need to treat me again.

336
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,810
Mo Qing!

337
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,580
What's there to hide? And how long can you hide it?

338
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,930
You're allowed to hide your illness, and I'm forbidden from diagnosing it.

339
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,070
Once he caught the demon essence, his temper gets worse and worse, too.

340
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,430
You leave, too. I'm tired.

341
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,360
You don't fear Heaven or Earth. You don't even fear me.

342
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,300
South Hill Master, you're quite interesting.

343
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,060
Leave!

344
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:33,430
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

345
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:39,300
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

346
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,710
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

347
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,920
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

348
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,400
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

349
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,860
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

350
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:09,280
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

351
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,850
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

352
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:24,110
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

353
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:30,580
♫ so what?  ♫

354
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:48,470
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

355
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:54,370
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

356
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,690
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

357
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,900
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

358
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:09,340
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

359
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:16,870
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

360
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:24,290
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

361
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:31,830
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

362
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:39,360
♫ This uproar hasn't settled.  ♫

363
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:46,840
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and Earth are shaken  ♫

364
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:54,340
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

365
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:01,930
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

366
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:12,940
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
