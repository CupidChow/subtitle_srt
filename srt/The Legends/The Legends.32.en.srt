[Episode 32]

3
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,670
Good job on burning it !!

4
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,600
Sect Leader, you're drunk.

5
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,040
I came just for you.

6
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,980
Sect Leader, you're drunk.

7
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,240
Why are you hiding?

8
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,940
I... I'm afraid to scare you.

9
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,190
How are you scary?

10
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Your eyes are so pretty...

11
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,020
like the stars in the sky.

12
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,930
What is this?

13
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,680
Oh my! That!

14
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,500
Don't look anymore! Everyone leave!

15
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,800
What kind of person...?

16
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,700
Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

17
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,500
Sect Leader!

18
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,370
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader!

19
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,580
Sect Leader!

20
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,340
- Men, carry the Sect Leader back to Wu'e Hall.
- Yes!

21
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,760
Sect Leader, you wouldn't have forgotten what happened half a month ago, would you?

22
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,140
What should I have remembered?

23
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,110
You broke down the barracks and set Teasing Moon Peak on fire.

24
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,100
And maybe you did some wild things that I do not know of.

25
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,640
- I'm that great?
- Great?

26
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,520
Here, look, who knows who you stole that thing from.

27
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,300
When the time comes, won't you have to return it?

28
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,390
You're talking about this?

29
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,970
It's quite pretty. Who cares who it belongs to.

30
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,650
If it's on me, it's mine.

31
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,840
West Hills Master, don't mind these things.

32
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,740
We should look forward, and continue our journey.

33
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,110
Luo Mingxuan is dead. From now on

34
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,680
I want both good and evil to belong to me.

35
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,140
The Wanjun Sword is finally entering the world.

36
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,360
Stop!

37
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,600
Let go! The Wanjun Sword can only know one master!

38
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,260
Zhaoyao... Zhaoyao...

39
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,420
Zhaoyao... Zhaoyao...!

40
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,780
Lu Zhaoyao... Lu Zhaoyao!

41
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,130
Where did you go?

42
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,500
Why did Qin Qianxian save me?

43
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,800
- Take a look!
- ... and nothing happened!

44
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,830
Miss, I also can't bear to watch it.

45
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,620
Seeing the depth of your significant other's affection for you,

46
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,920
you shouldn't stay married to me.

47
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,080
You are right. I almost forgot.

48
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,890
The Wan Lu Sect under Little Monster...

49
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,980
is built based on my initial vision.

50
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,200
When I gave up on this objective because of various reasons...

51
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,760
and then I suddenly came to know...

52
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,220
that someone continued this for me.

53
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,880
It's like... the strings attached to my dreams,

54
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,350
even after being broken,

55
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,780
that someone was conquering through odds and secretly weaving it into a shirt.

56
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,720
Thank you. I'll definitely pay you back. I am going now.

57
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,300
I've made him wait for too long. I can't let him wait any longer.

58
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,270
That fool will be so worried now.

[Land of Sojourn]

60
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,640
What are you doing here?

61
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,060
Ziyu, why can't I leave here?

62
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,560
Previously, I was able to leave easily with just one bump.

63
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,500
Did you stay here too long?

64
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,030
Did you eat too many foods here and drank too much of the water?

65
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,150
You've gotten used to the scents here.

66
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,240
The harder for you to leave.

67
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,770
What?

68
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,140
This is an important matter. Don't you know about it?

69
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,420
No one told me.

70
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,940
We've stayed here for too long.

71
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,720
We're used to it and will also forget.

72
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,800
Those who first came to the Land of Sojourn, can come and go freely.

73
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,730
Just like how you were before.

74
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,310
But once you can't leave you can never leave again.

75
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,540
Why can the trees here move?

76
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,630
There is an array that will conceal the road we take.

77
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,350
We might... never walk out.

78
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,530
How are you? Can you continue?

79
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,950
You look so cold...

80
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,290
Will you freeze to death?

81
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,620
You stand back. I'll protect you.

82
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,260
Who dares touch him?

83
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,450
How is it? Are you warmer?

84
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,190
Very warm...

85
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,700
That's good.

86
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,030
Hey, don't sleep, big beauty! Wake up!

87
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,280
Wake up! Hey!

88
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,110
If there's no road ahead, I'll open one for you.

89
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,790
Don't be scared! You won't be cold soon.

90
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,280
They're outside.

91
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,420
- You walked out.
- You're awake?

92
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,290
I blew down the ice wall that stood in the way.

93
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,220
You could have told me sooner that it was so easy to come out.

94
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,470
Qin Qianxuan... I want to see...

95
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,030
when people in Jianghu will know that your heart isn't the purest and holiest anymore.

96
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,450
Let's see what they will do to you.

97
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
Pavillion Master...

98
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,010
Pavillion Master, this maze is freezing cold. Please follow me quickly back to Thousand Dust Pavillion for treatment.

99
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,450
No! My sect leader told me I had to bring him back to Wan Lu Sect.

100
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,160
Miss, can you first follow us to Thousand Dust Pavillion and then make plans there?

101
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,440
Won't do! The sect leader speaks once, not twice! Can't change one syllable!

102
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,890
In short, Qin Qianxian must come with me to Wan Lu Sect.

103
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,600
- But...
- If you say another word,

104
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,190
I'll hit you!

105
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:11,080
- Pavillion Master...
- Suyan... then let's just follow her back to Wan Lu Sect.

106
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,880
Inform the other disciples that we've found Pavillion Master and we'll escort him to Wan Lu Sect.

107
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,580
Yes.

108
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,410
Ah Wu, you're finally awake!

109
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,720
How long did my puppet last this time?

110
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,440
- A full three days.
- Three days?

111
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,700
I've actually stayed in the maze for three days?

112
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,740
Maze?

113
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,500
I chased all the way after Qin Qianxian and got into the maze of Sushan.

114
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,620
There's no day or night in the maze.

115
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,980
Then, did Qin Qianxian die?

116
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,630
No.

117
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,780
How could we miss him?

118
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,870
- He drank too much.
- Ah Wu!

119
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,130
Enough, I know. Don't talk about this again.

120
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,810
I thought of something even more interesting than killing Qin Qianxian.

121
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,320
What?

122
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,410
I'll tell you later. Did anything happen during these few days?

123
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,940
The weather has changed in Jianghu...

124
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,280
Jin Xian woke up, Lu Zhaoyao came back to life.

125
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,770
Lu Zhaoyao came back to life?

126
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah! And she went wielding the Liuhe Tianyi Sword

127
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,420
along with Li Chenlan, and killed Jin Xian and Liu Suruo.

128
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,130
Lu Zhaoyao wielding the Liuhe Tianyi Sword...

129
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,490
I told you two to investigate on Qin Zhiyan, what did you find out?

130
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,690
Qin Zhiyan said she had a twin sister.

131
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,990
When they were found out, they went to trial in the Wan Lu Sect. Nothing came of it.

132
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,830
On the contrary, they arrested the North Hills Master.

133
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,150
Then Qin Zhiyan was brought to Phoenix Mountain, and apparently gave some sort of blood.

134
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,710
Then, Jin Xian woke up and Lu Zhaoyao came afterward.

135
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,770
And then after, Li Chenlan came, too.

136
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,270
And after that, Luo Mingxuan died right after waking up.

137
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,220
Say, isn't Jin Xian a joke?

138
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,790
About the other one... there hasn't been any more news.

139
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,380
So that's how it was.

140
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,020
Where's Lu Zhaoyao right now?

141
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,890
It is said that after sealing Phoenix Mountain, she exploded into fireworks and disappeared.

142
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:17,960
I just drank some wine, and so many interesting things have actually happened?

143
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,540
Didn't Lu Zhaoyao die already?

144
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,020
Why did she suddenly come back to life?

145
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,150
Ah Wu, what are you planning next?

146
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,760
First, wait for the right moment to kill Qin Qianxian.

147
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,580
Why am I here...

148
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,270
You fell under Liu Suruo's Manipulation and she took you to Phoenix Mountain.

149
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,680
You also lent her a hand in reviving Jin Xian.

150
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,920
What? Revive Jin Xian?

151
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,490
Luo Mingxuan died. Lu Suruo also died.

152
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,500
Qin Zhiyan couldn't rest easy about you

153
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,580
and brought you back to the Wan Lu Sect.

154
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,780
Where's Zhiyan?

155
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,870
She went looking for Lu Zhaoyao.

156
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,270
Lu Zhaoyao...?

157
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,410
For any other questions, ask other people who have nothing to do.

158
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,350
Wait a minute.

159
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,020
South Hills Master...

160
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,150
Where's my father?

161
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,390
Your father was cured by Jiang He, he didn't suffer much harm.

162
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,450
He is already awake now.

163
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:55,760
But he was extremely scrupulous about some Immortal Sect rule and refused to stay in the Wan Lu Sect.

164
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,160
So, Li Chenlan picked somewhere else to accommodate him.

165
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,820
It seems like... he isn't against me saving you.

166
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,150
I just can't figure out that stiff nerve you people have in the Immortal Sects.

167
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,020
Why are you here?

168
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,130
For you.

169
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,900
I wonder if the South Hills Master is interested in holding a game of chess with me.

170
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:01,270
It seems like the South Hill Master isn't only excellent at medicine, but also chess.

171
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,760
It is presumed that the things of the world must have an interchange.

172
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,020
Only the calm and wise can walk to the end.

173
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,000
People are always people. No matter how calm and wise,

174
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,930
there's always a moment when one goes off track.

175
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,800
Just like this board of chess,

176
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,390
often with one wrong step, the whole game is lost.

177
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,530
I heard that the South Hills Master comes from the Xu Zong Sect.

178
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,150
How did you find yourself in the Wan Lu Sect and stay for over 10 years?

179
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,590
And why so loyal to Lu Zhaoyao?

180
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,620
It may be assumed that she once helped you?

181
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,970
She didn't help with anything.

182
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,480
I stole a secret book from my school and betrayed Xu Zong Sect.

183
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,520
There's no crime I haven't committed; unpardonable crimes.

184
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,220
I have no place other than Wan Lu Sect to go.

185
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,950
Sect Leader of Rain View Sect, if you don't pay more attention, you're going to lose.

186
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,320
Lost is lost,

187
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,570
but the South Hill Master isn't like what you described yourself as.

188
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,790
Gu Hangguang is a gentle man.

189
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:59,100
Sister, it's nothing. Our Land of Sojourn is pretty good.

190
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,340
There's everything. After you've lived here for a while, you'll get used to it.

191
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,360
If you're worried about having no money in your account, you can work in our tavern.

192
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,780
This way you won't worry about having any money.

193
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,160
I need to leave.

194
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,410
Boss, you've been in the Land of Sojourn for so long,

195
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,830
you have seen everything. Do you think there's any way to help Sister?

196
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,260
There's a way.

197
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,900
What way?

198
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,210
The price for the method is too high.

199
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,690
I suggest you don't try it.

200
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,160
No matter the price, I'm willing to try as long as I can leave.

201
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,500
Even death?

202
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,860
Death won't do. Half-dead or almost dead is fine.

203
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:01,330
All right. Follow me. Have a look and then decide.

204
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,560
What is this?

205
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,600
The Cleanse Spring. To shed the dust of the world.

206
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,290
You have to forget joy and sadness.

207
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,960
Forget about the past.

208
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,030
If you want to leave from this Land of Sojourn, you must first wash away the traces of this land.

209
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,480
Then, you can find the exit.

210
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,670
That's to say, she can get out just after a bath?

211
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,720
There's such a good thing?

212
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,870
Why have I never heard of it before?

213
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,720
You can try.

214
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,390
Good! Then I'll try it first for Sister!

215
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,100
Rash!

216
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,060
I'm not making you wash your body.

217
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,560
Then what?

218
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,750
The water of this Cleanse Spring has the effect of washing blood.

219
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,970
But before the cleansing, you must draw a knife over the five parts of the body.

220
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:27,120
Here, here, here, and here.

221
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,480
The four points connecting the limbs and the blood vessels to the heart. And then also here:

222
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,790
you have to let out at least half of your blood.

223
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,300
Changing blood, the pain is still secondary.

224
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,930
If you aren't careful you may well lose your life.

225
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,510
It's so terrible!

226
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,340
No wonder this Cleanse Spring is so clean and fresh and yet no one dares come.

227
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,220
Sister, why don't you just stay in the Land of Sojourn?

228
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,720
Away from the mortal world, you'll forget its matters.

229
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,820
After a while, you won't remember any love or hatred.

230
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,400
There's no need

231
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,200
to go through the hardship of Cleanse Spring and the pain of washing blood.

232
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,060
I'll try it.

233
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,630
The pain of this cleansing spring's blood wash is the deepest and most dangerous.

234
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,160
Ordinary people can hardly endure it. Even if you're able to survive it,

235
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,690
the loss of vigor is huge.

236
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:34,840
- In spite of that...
- In spite of that, I must go out.

237
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,870
Why persist?

238
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:47,350
Because I have a deep love that I can't let down.

239
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,930
Sect Leader, the Nine Heavens Spell is overbearing, extremely consuming on the mind.

240
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:19,320
Of all those who try, nine out of ten die. Please, Sect Leader, reconsider!

241
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,110
Just as well. As long as I can bring her back.

242
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,320
Please, Sect Leader, take care of your health.

243
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,610
West Hills Master, try and convince the Sect Leader!

244
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,430
Summon the Dark Guards to provide protection for me.

245
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,370
Sect Leader...

246
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,640
This is the Sect Leader's command!

247
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,360
Yes, obeying the Sect Leader's command.

248
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,190
Ah Da, you're here at the right time. Quickly, try and convince the Sect Leader!

249
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,430
What happened to the Sect Leader?

250
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,610
He's bent on trying the Nine Heavens Spell to go look for the previous sect leader.

251
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,460
In his state of health, I'm afraid his life will be in peril.

252
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,870
Le-Leader Li.

253
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,860
Sect Leader Li, she will come back for sure.

254
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,920
You must take good care of yourself and wait for her return.

255
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,050
I know what I'm doing. You don't need to say anymore.

256
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,930
You... always knew she was Lu Zhaoyao?

257
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,040
In my heart,

258
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,490
there is no other like her.

259
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,960
[No Evil Palace]

260
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,130
It's all my fault.

261
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,090
It's all my fault!

262
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,640
You both must be well.

263
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,820
If the Sect Leader uses the forbidden Nine Heavens Spell, the odds of dying are surely nine against one.

264
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,940
Ah Da, why didn't you tell the Sect Leader that this was really too dangerous?

265
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,470
- Exactly!
- Why?

266
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,470
Yes, after we put down the Immortal Sect, why would he take such a huge risk?

267
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,430
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

268
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,750
This is Sect Leader's command! What's our duty as Dark Guards?

269
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,120
It is absolute obedience and loyalty!

270
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,320
The Sect Leader needs our protection now.

271
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,170
All of you, as the elite of the Dark Guards, should strive for more together.

272
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,730
No mistakes are allowed!

273
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,690
- Yes! We will accept Sect Leader's command!

274
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,410
What did you say? Sect Leader wants to try the Nine Heavens Spell? Why don't you stop him?

275
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,930
We can't stop him!

276
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,200
This must be Heaven watching from above!

277
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,420
Li Chenlan using the Nine Heavens Spell is like digging his own grave.

278
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,510
Why would you dissuade him? Just as they say, "Heaven's upholders prosper,

279
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,100
Heaven's defiers die." He's courting his own death.

280
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,140
It couldn't be better.

281
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:28,870
Li Chenlan never held you in his heart. Even less from now on.

282
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,740
You can only rise above him

283
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,950
for him to notice you.

284
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,050
Do you understand?

285
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,320
Bring me the Thousand-Mile Mirror.

286
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,840
Yes.

287
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,670
Have another Dark Guard get it.

288
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,910
From now on, you don't have to guard No Evil Palace anymore.

289
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,160
Lock Lin Ziyu in the dungeons!

290
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,140
Sect Leader!

291
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,230
Sect Leader! The Captain's devotion is obvious to all.

292
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,460
Until the whole truth is revealed, Sect Leader, please reconsider.

293
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,780
Shut up!

294
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,170
If you plead for her again, you'll be held together!

295
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,650
I'll ask you again for the last time.

296
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,450
You want to be an outcast dog behind bars all your life,

297
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:58,540
or will you climb to the top of Wan Lu Sect together with me

298
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,360
and be the master of No Evil Palace?

299
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,730
What do you want me to do?

300
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,370
Deliver this to the North Hills Sect disciple Zhou Bai.

301
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,130
Sister Ziyu.

302
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,420
For this day,

303
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,260
I've been waiting too long indeed.

304
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,800
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

305
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,800
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,280
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

309
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:05,340

310
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:12,730
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

311

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:12,840
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

318
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:20,360
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

319
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:27,770
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

320
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:35,320
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

321
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:42,770
♫ This uproar hasn't settled.  ♫

322
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:50,310
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and Earth are shaken  ♫

323
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:57,800
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

324
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:05,370
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

325
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:15,610
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
