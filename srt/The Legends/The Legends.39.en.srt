[Episode 39]

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Speaking of that, Pavilion Master Qin once said

4
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,200
that the Xu Zong Sect has a valuable medicine.

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,700
It was a great help to him when he was pulling out his inner demon.

6
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,750
Hanguang, do you know this medicine?

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
You're dismissed.

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
Yes.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Did you see? What my father just received

10
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,600
is one of our Xu Zong Sect's three treasures: a seed of Rebirth Herb.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,000
I've always been curious to see what this Rebirth Herb looked like.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,500
Say, this "Rebirth", "Rebirth"...
[Note: the name literally means "bone replacement"]

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,800
what bone is it made of?

14
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,200
What's in your brain? You think that "Rebirth" is a bone itself?

15
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
You've never seen it either, have you?

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,200
How do you know that it isn't made of bone?

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Let's go. Have a look.

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,600
- But...
- "But" what? Hurry, let's go.

19
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm opening it!

20
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,200
Hurry up! Don't keep me hanging.

21
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
This... is the seed of "Rebirth"?

22
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
Take this.

23
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,200
It will be inside.

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,900
Who let you in?

25
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
You two are so impudent!

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
It was me! It was me! It's all my fault. I brought Junior Brother here.

27
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,600
You know what's in here?

28
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
In the future, the length of your life will completely depend on this!

29
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,900
How dare you mess around?

30
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Get up!

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,700
Go!

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
You two will kneel here until tomorrow.

33
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,000
You are not allowed to eat. If you don't reflect clearly on yourselves,

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you'll know the consequences!

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Are you all right? Why did you take all the responsibility?

36
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,400
As a senior, of course, I'll protect my junior brother.

37
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,000
But, say, why did my father have to be so heavy-handed?

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Am I not his trueborn son?

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,400
With you, instead, my father can't even bear to touch you.

40
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,000
It looks like he cares for you even more than he cares for me.

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,200
It's because he beat you until his hand hurt,

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,100
so he couldn't move it anymore.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,700
Ouch! Ouch! It hurts!

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Ouch!

45

[16th Leader - Jiang He - Memorial Tablet]

48
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,500
Hanguang?

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you asking about that herb?

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Since back then, Pavilion Leader Qin used that herb

51
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
to cast out his inner demon. I'm thinking

52
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
this medicinal herb should be beneficial to Chenlan, too.

53
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,600
I've long since left the Xu Zong Sect. I have never heard of this.

54
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
With Li Chenlan's condition,

55
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,200
at present, I can only stabilize him. There is no cure.

56
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,400
But if he carefully nurses his health day by day, it will not be life-threatening.

57
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
But if you refuse to come to your senses and aggravate your condition,

58
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,200
I am not sure what will happen when your illness gets worse.

[Qingyin Sect]

60
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,800
You want me to send disciples to besiege the Thousand Dust Pavillion?

61
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,400
You don't have to look at me with that expression.

62
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,900
I'll feel hurt.

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Jin Xiu, stop the pretense.

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,800
What you are doing now is not even worthy of the Wan Lu Sect.

65
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's say I misjudged you before.

66
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,000
You didn't misjudge at all. The Wan Lu Sect has Li Chenlan and Lu Zhaoyao.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What does our Immortal Sect have?

68
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,400
Revered Changyu is dead. Jin Xian vanished.

69
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
The Immortal Sects are now a pile of sand.

70
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,250
If the day comes

71
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,200
that the Wan Lu Sect decides to wipe out our Immortal Sects

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
how will you stop them?

73
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,000
You'll count on them suddenly finding a conscience?

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes, these past years Li Chenlan never engaged in slaughter.

75
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,390
But people's minds can change.

76
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,200
If we don't borrow Jiang Wu's strength to kill them now,

77
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm afraid that later on our Immortal Sects

78
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,700
will hardly get a day of peace.

79
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
But Qin Qianxian...

80
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,600
He called it upon himself!

81
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
First, he cooperated with the Wan Lu Sect. That was already not pure.

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,700
And then he hindered the reviving of Jin Xian.

83
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,300
I guess his sense of justice is long gone.

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Even so,

85
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,800
he doesn't deserve to die.

86
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,490
Of course, I also have my selfish motives.

87
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,240
You're just jealous of his beauty.

88
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,960
If I'm asking you for a few dozen disciples today,

89
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
that I know in your heart you'll always have obstacles you can't overcome,

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
but I just want to tell you. Give me men.

91
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,800
By the time we besiege the Thousand Dust Pavillion,

92
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,000
you can also order your disciples

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to secretly help the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

94
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,800
You...

95
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm not going there to exterminate the Thousand Dust Pavilion.

96
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,500
A few days ago there were plenty of rumors in Jianghu

97
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,000
about the matter between Qin Qianxian and Lu Zhaoyao.

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Many disciples left the Thousand Dust Pavillion

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and defected to Wangxing Sect and Sunan Sect.

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
At the right time,

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,400
I myself will let Chi Tianming and Xiong Tian take charge for those disciples.

102
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
No matter what,

103
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,200
when brothers see brothers, they won't be able to fight ruthlessly.

104
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,500
Fine.

105
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
I'll give you 100 men.

106
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Little Yunyun, I haven't loved you so many years in vain.

107
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,800
Jin Xiu, at any cost, don't disappoint me.

108
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
My body is such a disappointment.

109
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,320
Whatever.

110
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll be counting on Little Monster from now on.

111
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,800
If the two sect leaders are reluctant,

112
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,000
why don't I give you an idea?

113
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,700
What idea do you have?

114
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,400
Some time ago, many disciples from the Thousand Dust Pavilion

115
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
transferred to your two sects?

116
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,900
Why don't you make them fight among themselves?

117
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,200
The internal strife in the sect itself will have nothing to do with you.

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Jin Xiu, you're pretty ruthless.

119
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,200
You flatter me.

120
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Recently, there's been several rumors about me.

121
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,000
There are true ones and there are also false ones.

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
At the Sword Tomb, I brought Lu Zhaoyao away.

123
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
That is true.

124
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,600
Master!

125
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,300
I've practiced the State of Absolute Purity for many years.

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I thought I was pure in my heart.

127
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,200
But I didn't know that in the depths of my heart,

128
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,240
the distractions of the mundane world could still chain me down.

129
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
That year,

130
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Lu Zhaoyao locked me in the dungeon for a day and a night.

131
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Because of that, it messed up my practice. The demon in my heart started to grow.

132
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Inner demon? How is that possible? Why?

133
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,800
Hence, five years ago, I brought back Lu Zhaoyao

134
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
and hid her in the Maze of Mount Su.

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
I meditated every day

136
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,100
and finally broke through the obsession.

137
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,260
But the cycles of karma: virtue has its reward, evil its retribution.

138
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,800
Even if the inner demon was pulled out of my body,

139
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,200
it still lives in this world.

140
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,500
By absorbing the world's cruelness, it became today's Jiang Wu.

141
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,200
Jiang Wu?!

142
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm ashamed to face the late master.

143
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm ashamed to face the Thousand Dust Pavilion.

144
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm ashamed to face those innocent people who were hurt by Jiang Wu.

145
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,790
This time, I came back

146
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,200
to atone for my sin. I'm willing to abdicate my position as the master...

147
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,800
and choose a new sect leader among you.

148
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
A new sect leader?

149
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Please think twice.

150
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,000
We're all the same human beings. Men are not saints. How can they be free from faults?

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,500
Please retract this statement.

152
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,400
Please retract this statement!

153
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,980
It's the malice I personally planted,

154
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,500
I need to bear it myself.

155
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,200
The ones left here are people who believe in you.

156
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,100
No matter the evil consequences, we're willing to bear it with you.

157
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,400
Master, please don't leave us.

158
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,500
Master, please don't leave us!

159
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,770
Ah Wu!

160
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,380
Master Jin Xiu sent us a letter saying that Qin Qianxian is back at the Thousand Dust Pavilion.

161
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,840
Also, the people from the Immortal Sects have prepared themselves to go up against him.

162
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,990
Qin Qianxian,

163
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,720
finally, you and I will settle this once and for all.

164
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,200
Has there been any news of Jiang Wu these days?

165
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,300
Someone saw him appear at Jiangzhou, and there's been no news after that.

166
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,380
I spent a life-long effort,

167
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
but couldn't kill my inner demon.

168
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm afraid Jiang Wu will become more arrogant from now on.

169
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Master, don't say that.

170
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,300
Retrieve my Lotus Heart.

171
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,000
Ever since late Master's passing, you've sealed the Lotus Heart.

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why today?

173
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,100
I want to save someone.

174
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,800
[Gate Vew Gazebo]

175
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,580
One flower and one world.

176
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,200
One leaf and one bodhi.

177
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
One mind and one quietude.

178
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,600
The heart like blossoming lotuses.

179
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,700
The heart like blossoming lotuses...

180
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,400
Su Kong Brother,

181
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
what is "the heart like blossoming lotuses"?

182
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,000
It means that if your heart is at peace,

183
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,800
it's as beautiful as the blooming of lotuses.

184
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Then... what is the blooming of lotuses like?

185
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Look! What is that?

186
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Quick! Let's go!

187
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Quick! Report to the sect leader!

188
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
Let's go.

189
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
Don't move.

190
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Qin Qianxian, I‘m going to count to three. If you don't come out,

191
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
I'll kill.

192
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,400
One.

193
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,800
Two.

194
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
Three.

195
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,100
You're too late.

196
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,200
Brother, what is this situation?

197
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Darn it. They're taking advantage of our small troop.

198
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Everyone don't panic. With Master here, we'll be safe.

199
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
Cast the Defensive Spell.

200
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,700
Yes.

201
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,000
There are many of you who were originally from the Thousand Dust Pavilion.

202
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Remember.

203
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Keep in mind that we're not here to humiliate your former fellow disciples but to restore order in the Thousand Dust Pavilion,

204
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,400
and not to be ruined in the hands of a person like Qin Qianxian.

205
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes!

206
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,200
Who can break this formation outside of the pavilion?

207
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,600
We're willing to exchange pointers with our former associates.

208
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,500
Qin Qianxian, we finally meet.

209
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
True body?

210
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,000
I've heard that Qin Sect Leader has a compassionate heart.

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,700
Today, let's play something interesting.

212
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Don't panic, everyone.

213
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,700
What is this situation?

214
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Jiang Wu, don't hurt your own people!

215
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Despicable!

216
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,300
Are you going to die,

217
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,300
or are you going to let them die? Choose.

218
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,400
Close your eyes.

219
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Meditate, and then open your eyes.

220
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,100
Yes, Se-Sect Leader.

221
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Eyes can't save you either.

222
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,600
Qin Qianxian, come out!

223
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,600
It looks like you are ready to let other people die.

224
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,100
They are innocent.

225
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,800
Nobody is innocent.

226
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,200
You are no exception, either.

227
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,600
Am I not your momentary mistake?

228
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Come!

229
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Su Yan, attacking the Thousand Dust Pavillion was never my true intention.

230
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
It's Jiang Wu who sowed discord.

231
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,800
We in the Immortal Sect only want to bring Qin Qianxian to trial, we never meant to hurt innocent people.

232
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Now, Jiang Wu wants everyone to die here.

233
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,300
The Immortal Sects should fight united against outsiders.

234
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,000
Break this formation and cooperate with me; let's solve Jiang Wu's dark vapor first.

235
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What do you think?

236
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,600
Senior Su Yan, this absolutely can't be. Jin Xiu is shamelessly cunning. He can't ever be trusted.

237
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Everyone, lower your weapons!

238
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,000
Lower our weapons? Should we let the dark vapor take over?

239
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
Resisting this dark vapor with only our strength

240
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
will only lead to our death. It will be the same for the people of the Thousand Dust Pavillon.

241
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
Only if we enter the Thousand Dust Pavilion and help Qin Qianxian slay Jiang Wu,

242
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
then maybe we'll get a gleam of hope to survive.

243
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,400
Su Yan! We from Immortal Sect have already put our weapons down. It's life or death. If you hesitate more,

244
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,000
you're helping the evil side invading the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

245
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,100
Disperse. Let's cut down Jiang Wu's demon essence first.

246
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Thousand Dust Pavillion disciples, create the earth symbol to repel Jiang Wu together!

247
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,400
You can kill me now,

248
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,760
but myriads of lives are all in my hand.

249
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I only need to tighten my hold a little.

250
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,600
All the people in and out of Thousand Dust Pavillion will die.

251
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
Have you thought well about it?

252
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Pavilion Leader!

253
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,400
Pavilion Leader!

254
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,600
Pavilion Leader!

255
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,400
Qin Qianxian, your power as a master is now mine.

256
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,600
From now on, you will never be able to bring slaughter again.

257
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,300
I already got what I wanted.

258
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm leaving the rest to you.

259
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Su Yan, you must deliver this heart lotus to the Wan Lu Sect.

260
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Pavillion Leader, don't worry.

261
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,800
Pavillion Leader! Pavillion Leader!

262
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,800
Thank you, Pavillion Leader for sparing our lives!
Thank you, Pavillion Leader for sparing our lives!

263
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,200
From this day on, our Thousand Dust Pavillion will have no more ties with the Immortal Sects!

264
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,000
Jiang Wu, didn't we agree that I'd take the Immortal Sect disciples in first,

265
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,800
only for intimidation? How could you stoop so low?

266
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Not only did you massacre the Thousand Dust Pavillion disciples,

267
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,200
you almost harmed the lives of our Immortal Sect disciples, too.

268
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,300
Now my reputation in Immortal Sect is tattered. You...

269
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,100
Hacking you to shreds would not be enough for the hatred I feel.

270
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,400
If you frown upon it,

271
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,360
come kill me.

272
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,500
But you aren't that good. Who's to blame for it?

273
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,400
Enough. Don't be so mad.

274
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,000
Anger won't make you look good.

275
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,600
Besides, in the end, it was all right. Wasn't it?

276
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,100
That was a mad gamble! What if Qin Qianxian had not given up?

277
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,200
Then, I'd have killed until he did.

278
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,990
You are a smart man. Don't keep fussing about the means.

279
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The result was fine, that's enough.

280
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,200
Didn't you want the position as head of the Immortal Sect?

281
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll give it to you.

282
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,600
What do you mean by this?

283
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,200
Even if your reputation now is tattered,

284
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,600
I can also make the people who look down on you, bow down at your feet.

285
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
As long as you behave and do as I say,

286
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll make them salute you as a lord.

287
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,220
Ah Rong, no need to fix me anymore.

288
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,200
Urgent! Urgent!

[Jiang Wu crippled Qin Qianxian in the Thousand Dust Pavillion]

290
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,200
What is it? You're so edgy.

291
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,600
Today, my right eyelid keeps fluttering. I feel so nervous.

292
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,400
I have the feeling that something's going to happen.

293
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,700
What can happen?

294
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What did you say? Qin Qianxian was attacked?

295
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
Jiang Wu threatened Qin Qianxian with the lives of all the disciples in the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

296
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,700
In order to save the disciples, Qin Qianxian is now in a coma.

297
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Is this true?

298
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
This won't do. I have to go save my uncle!

299
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Wait!

300
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,400
Is Jiang Wu still at the Thousand Dust Pavillion now?

301
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,400
He's long left the Thousand Dust Pavillion, after Qin Qianxian fell unconscious.

302
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Jiang We seemed to have no intention of fighting the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

303
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,190
He came for Qin Qianxian.

304
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He'll be all right.

305
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,800
Send people to the Thousand Dust Pavillion; see if they can lend any help.

- Dem-
- If you want to go, I won't stop you.

But you have to take Seventeen and let her protect you.

308

That is all we can do for now.

[Spirit tablet of Twelveth Sect master, Jian Yu]

311
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's late. Why aren't you resting yet?

312
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,400
Is it because of any discomfort?

313
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,500
I slept too much during the day. I can't sleep at night. I would like to take a stroll around.

314
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,000
Somehow, it brought me to the ancestral hall and I ran into you.

315
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,600
I also dreamed of my father in the middle of the night,

316
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
so I came here to burn a stick of incense for him.

317
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,200
Back then your dad was a highly respected person in the Immortal Sects.

318
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,910
It's a shame.

319

I've heard that the Xu Zong Sect has a secret manual.

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,600
If one practices it, he will receive supreme power.

321
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,100
Perhaps, it can break the curse of the Jiang clan.

322
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,400
You aren't aware.

323
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Although we pass it down to the next generations, no one dares to practice it.

324
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,600
Why is that?

325
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Most of the records in the manual

326
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,400
are against the Immortal Sects' path of righteous practice. It is very violent.

327
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Also, it's extremely difficult to control it.

328
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,600
What a shame then.

329
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,400
It's a shame that you're a benevolent person.

330
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,800
You saved many people in the world, but you couldn't save yourself.

331
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,660
A physician can't cure himself.

332
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm indebted to you. But I have no way of repaying you.

333
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,800
I feel so ashamed of myself.

334
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,300
You just need to nurse yourself back to health.

335
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,000
We need you back to the Immortal Sects,

336
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,100
Return quickly and manage the situation for public good.

337
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,400
Thank you very much, Jiang Sect Leader.

338
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
Here.

339
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Okay.

340
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Although we pass the secret manual down through to the next generations,

341
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
no one dares to practice it.

342
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,200
It looks like it's true that the Xu Zong Sect has a secret hidden manual.

343
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,400
If I am able to practice it, I might be able to regain my powers.

344
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,500
I won! I won!

345
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,600
I won!

346
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,200
I won! I won!!

347
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,500
Ah Wu, what is it?

348
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Ah Wu!

349
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,900
You're the one who stopped me?

350
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,400
I said, from now on,

351
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,100
you can never carry out massacres.

352
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,200
You can't manage me.

353
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,200
These lousy powers of Qin Qianxian

354
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,500
won't even let me kill a person.

355
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,700
Ah Wu, the people from the Immortal Sects are here.

356
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,700
Lock him up.

357
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
I won!

358
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Isn't the last surviving person allowed to live?

359
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,300
Here.

360
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,650
For the bright future, let's have a drink.

361
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,700
I know you guys don't like me,

362
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,400
and I don't like you guys either.

363
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,800
But it doesn't matter,

364
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,300
as long as our purposes are the same.

365
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,600
You guys want to break the Wan Lu Sect, I do, too.

366
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,900
You guys want to kill Li Chenlan, I do, too.

367
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,000
But with your current strength,

368
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,320
so today should be the day we form an alliance.

369
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,900
I advise you guys

370
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,900
to drink this glass of wine.

371
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,800
I can't drink this shameful wine.

372
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,700
I ask you to drink this glass of wine and you don't drink it,

373
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,600
then go drink the Lethe water!

374
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,360
I'll drink this glass of wine for her!

375
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,600
I am a little appreciative of you now.

376
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,400
From now onward, Jin Xiu will call the shots on the affairs in the Immortal Sects.

377
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,600
And as for the world,

378
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,370
I'm in charge.

379
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Do you guys all understand?

380
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:20,000
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

381
