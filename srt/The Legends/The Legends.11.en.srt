[Episode 11]

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,170
- Sect Leader....
- This matter is already decided.

4
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,230
Who's there?

5
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,810
North Hills Master, you're too anxious.

6
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,220
Please, Sect Leader, accept my apologies.

7
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,560
Sect Leader!

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,350
No harm. You're all dismissed.

9
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,520
Yes.

10
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,020
Sect Leader, if you are bent on consorting with the Immortal Sect

11
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,400
forgive our North Hills disciples for not following.

12
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,330
Immortal Sect girl.

13
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,720
Oh, I'd forgotten.

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,490
My North Hills Master hates the Immortal Sect to death.

15
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,520
Before joining the Wan Lu Sect he was from the Immortal Sect.

16
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,860
Wife...

17
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,420
Wife!

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,380
Wife...

19
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,150
My son!

20
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,340
Wife!

21
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,190
My son...

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,380
Wife!

23
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,710
There's nothing I despise more than a multitude bullying a few

24
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,740
especially if they're bullying women and children.

25
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,000
Yuan Jie, I'll help you.

26
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,020
Ah Da, take the head away.

27
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Yes, Sect Leader.

28
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,960
At night you're rather bold,

29
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,640
you even dare to eavesdrop. Why do you not follow your daytime rules?

30
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,360
Master, everyone knows I'm your beloved disciple.

31
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,500
Furthermore, rules are made just to be broken.

32
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,030
Then, why is it that you don't fear me like you do during the day?

33
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,420
Master... I'm just scared silly.

34
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,690
Testing me again.

35
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,400
Master, today I took a nap. Lu Zhaoyao came back to my dream.

36
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,780
What was she like in your dream?

37
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,920
Nothing special, she was just standing.

38
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,890
But Master, I think always having her in my dreams is not the way.

39
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,150
She's well concealed, while you're in the open.

40
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,030
No matter what, you've already lost the advantage.

41
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,230
How about we call her out?

42
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,730
You can also call her out?

43
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,230
At the moment I can't, that's true.

44
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,490
But... if I could access some books for reference,

45
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,400
perhaps I may find some ancient methods.

46
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,630
Tell me how she appears.

47
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,900
What sort of look and posture?

48
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,300
Just... Just like that. No special expression.

49
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,230
Why is he asking for so many details?

50
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,510
There's nobody else here. Why is he pretending to miss me so much?

51
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,690
Good! It's exactly the taste I like.

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,760
Am I not great?

53
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,590
Blagh! What is this fruit? It's so sour!

54
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,880
This is wrong! Why am I dodging?

55
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,190
So, she...

56
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,320
Tomorrow, at the Thousand Blades Cliff Library Pavillion, help yourself to the search.

57
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,660
This Little Monster... why would he have such a look? What's with him?

58
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,770
Sister Ziyu, that woman from the Immortal Sect is exceedingly arrogant.

59
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,400
In the No Evil Palace she acts so freely, like she owns it.

60
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,550
Last time I saw her, she was not like that.

61
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,550
Can someone's personality really change so quickly?

62
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,200
Xiao Ai, tomorrow I'm going to Jiangzhou. Watch her for me.

63
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,790
Yes.

64
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,850
But I heard that many brothers who went to Jiangzhou never came back.

65
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,990
Sister Ziyu, you must come back.

66
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,290
Don't worry. Jiang Wu won't have my life so easily.

67
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,550
This stinky wench.

68
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,760
She was in the No Evil Palace a moment ago, and now she's here. She's fast.

69
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,630
Miss Zhiyan, your current status does not befit visiting Liu Cangling in the cells.

70
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,570
Otherwise, there would be too many rumors making it hard for the Sect Leader.

71
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,640
Just going for a little?

72
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,340
Is it you?

73
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
Ah Wu, are you okay?

74
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Leave quickly.

75
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,400
Xiao En, leave quickly.

76
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
- Ah Wu!
- Ah Wu!

77
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,000
Ah Wu, your wound...

78
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,200
What's the name of the chief of Thousand Dust Pavilion again?

79
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,500
- Qin Qianxian.
- Qin Qianxian.

80
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Just wait and see.

81
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,690
Demoness. Demoness!

82
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Demoness, Li Chenlan is not allowing me to see Brother Cangling anymore.

83
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
Find another way for me, all right?

84
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Have you passed the pills to your Brother Cangling?

85
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,200
If so, it's settled then. Your Brother Cangling won't die.

86
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,100
Keep dragging it out until they forget about him.

87
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
You still have the mindset to worry about others?

88
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
You need to stay focused and do two things for me instead.

89
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,600
First, quickly practice so you can reach a higher level of power.

90
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,400
Second, find people to perform good deeds for me.

91
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,300
You need to train your body better.

92
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,200
If not, given your current strength, even a dog can bully you.

93
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,000
I heard that you ran into the North Hill Master in the No Evil Palace.

94
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,400
I heard this when I was young: rather meet Lu Zhaoyao than the North Hill Master.

95
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
- Is he really that fierce?
- Yes.

96
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,370
But he's extremely loyal to me.

97
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,400
It's a shame I couldn't find a chance to reveal my identity to him.

98
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
If I could get his help,

99
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
the task of killing Li Chenlan would be halfway completed.

100
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
You still intend to kill Li Chenlan?

101
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
Why not?

102
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,800
Rely on you to seduce him and get him to abdicate his position to you?

103
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,500
Why are you talking about seduction again?

104
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
Actually, I think Li Chenlan is a good person.

105
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,900
It's pretty easy to be a good person in front of you.

106
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,000
No. Do you remember?

107
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Those disciples of Wan Lu Sect who bullied me have been assigned to do farming at the foot of the mountain.

108
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,600
I think such an arrangement is much better than those harsh punishments.

109
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,400
How is it better?

110
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,700
Li Chenlan is too merciful and lenient. By keeping these people alive, they will later turn into scourges.

111
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Those accepted into Wan Lu Sect are vicious people.

112
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Back then, when they joined Wan Lu Sect,

113
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,900
they swore a lifetime oath of loyalty to me.

114
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
As the sect leader,

115
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,600
I had shown grace by risking universal condemnation when I took them in.

116
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,400
I showed righteousness when I took them under my wings. All I needed in return was their loyalty.

117
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
If they couldn't even do this...

118
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,000
that makes them ungrateful people.

119
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Those who have no sense of righteousness and no loyalty,

120
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,900
when I encounter such people...

121
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,400
they'll be killed. This is my moral principle.

122
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Now you think it's good that Li Chenlan ordered them to do farming.

123
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Let's wait and see.

124
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,780
Let's see how things will turn out for him,

125
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,400
when he shows mercy to these kinds of people.

126
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,870
Let's see how he will end up defeated by me...

127
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,400
because of a moment of kindness.

128
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,200
I'll snatch everything from him.

129
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,300
It's getting late. I'm going to the Library Pavilion.

130
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,400
"Three days after he breathed his last, Shu Er sat up in the coffin."

131
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,200
"He looked the same as when he was alive."

132
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,200
"His expression and manner of speaking, though, were entirely different from before."

133
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Who exactly are you?

134
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,400
"He said he'd entered the land of immortals, very similar to the mortal world."

135
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,800
"The people there behaved normally and had the elixir of life for food."

136
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
- "Alchemy... "
- The land of immortals really exists in the world.

137
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,400
How long has he been in here? I didn't talk nonsense, right?

138
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,600
Master dear, when did you come?

139
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Is there a sequel to that immortal land story?

140
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,700
Continue it.

141
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,800
There's no sequel.

142
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,200
I looked through many of them but they are all just bizarre stories.

143
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I guess the stories of supernatural beings are just illusions.

144
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,760
If supernatural beings are illusions...

145
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,700
what's the point of me keeping you around?

146
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,600
Master dear, you're good at joking.

147
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,500
Speak properly.

148
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,000
There are so many books here. Let’s search them slowly.

149
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,200
I'll look through the others.

150
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,910
Master, you're interested in these books, too?

151
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,180
I want to find her more than anyone else.

152
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,030
Find me? And get rid of me once and for all?

153
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,600
I can't reach.

154
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
Master.

155
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,600
Master.

156
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,400
Help me get it.

157
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,900
Take it.

158
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
When I first recruited Moqing into Wan Lu Sect,

159
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
I found a master for him.

160
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Could it be that the master was a Taoist priest practicing immortality or a monk practicing Buddhism?

161
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,600
That's why his behavior is like this. Or maybe he doesn't like my direct flirting?

162
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
Let's try another way.

163
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,100
Master!

164
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,010
Your eyes are pretty! They look like the brightest stars filling the dark night.

165
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,500
What are you afraid of? Your eyes are so beautiful.

166
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,810
They look like the brightest stars.

167
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,970
So, that's what you like.

168
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,290
Master, I think I have been captivated by your eyes.

169
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,940
What's going on?

170
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,070
Didn't he just look besotted by my seduction?

171
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,010
Forget it. That's enough flirting for today. I can start with requests.

172
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,400
Master, I have a request.

173
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,460
Speak.

174
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,920
I've been practicing my strength, but it never feels up to standard.

175
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,050
It's probably lack of body energy.

176
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,730
Master, do you have any pills that can improve my energy?

177
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,350
Master, you are the best to me!

178
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,050
Little Monster...

179
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,220
Turns out you're all hot on the inside.

180
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,910
When someone flirts with you or praises you, you don't show any reaction.

181
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,650
But, in actuality, your heart is silently shaking with excitement.

182
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,800
It seems I have to change tactics from now on.

183
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,970
- Did you see that?
- We can't speak of it.

184
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,060
Lift it up.

185
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,540
Yuan Jie? What is he doing here?

186
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,560
Perfect timing for a talk.

187
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,260
North Hill Master!

188
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,750
Served on a silver platter.

189
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,150
North Hill Master, I want to...

190
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:38,400
- What are you doing?
- An Immortal Sect child, daring to roam free in Wan Lu Sect?

191
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,550
Old man, why are you acting like this again?

192
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,210
I'm your Sect Leader, Lu Zhaoyao.

193
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,750
Then, I'm Lu Zhaoyao's father.

194
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,640
This sword doesn't belong to you.

195
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,170
Who's making a ruckus?

196
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,190
Who is it?

197
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,930
That's weird. I heard some noise over here.

198
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,250
You are saying Yuan Jie attacked you?

199
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,060
Why did he attack you?

200
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,200
Other than your arm, did you get hurt anywhere else?

201
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,760
If I'm not mistaken, that sword is one of the Male-Female Double Swords.

202
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,750
Even swords have genders?

203
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,520
Does it hurt?

204
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,600
It's only a minor wound. Nothing to fuss over.

205
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,450
Give me a cup of tea.

206
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,720
Demoness, are you going to report this to Li Chenlan?

207
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,010
No. I know full well Yuan Jie's loyalty to me.

208
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,300
He simply mistook me for you.

209
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,060
I need his help to get rid of Li Chenlan.

210
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,020
Are you that determined to usurp the sect leader position?

211
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,510
How do you mean, "usurp?" The sect leader position was mine!

212
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,290
Fine. Fine. You are always right.

213
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,310
What I worry about is Yuan Jie being in league with the Immortal Sect.

214
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,510
It's double-crossing and forgetting his principles.

215
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,510
What happens if he forgets his principles?

216
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,030
None of your business.

217
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,350
Medicine for you.

218
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,070
Take one a day. This pill is different from the ones you had before.

219
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,700
Take it and meditate properly. Your power growth depends on it.

220
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,340
Okay.

221
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,920
Yuan Jie came for Qin Zhiyan's blood.

222
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,430
What on earth is he up to?

223
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,010
- Ah Da! Ah Da!
- Ah Da! Ah Da!

224
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,670
- How long has he been sleeping?
- Don't know.

225
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,300
Ah Da doesn't have to keep an eye on Miss Zhiyan anymore?

226
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,070
He does. But he fell asleep when he stepped out.

227
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,010
I thought watching over an Immortal Sect girl was an easy job. Lucky it wasn't me.

228
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,890
I agree. Let's go. Don't mind him.

229
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,800
Let's go have a drink.

230
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,730
[Dawn]

231
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,400
Look. Ah Da is still sleeping here.

232
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,100
Let him sleep.

233
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,760
Let's go.

234
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,420
[Jian Xin Sect]

235
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,900
Honored guest, please follow me to the main hall.

236
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,480
Main hall?

237
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:59,180
Your master is doing pretty well single-handedly maneuvering Jian Xin Sect.

238
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,800
North Hill Master, you have a sense of humor.

239
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,580
Get out of my way. The whiff of you people from the Immortal Sect is revolting.

240
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,200
Yes.

241
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,230
Please.

242
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,590
North Hill Master, are you here today...

243
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,890
because there's a new development in the matter I entrusted to you?

244
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,880
Qin Zhiyan's blood?

245
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,880
I do what I promise.

246
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,720
From today onward, there's nothing between us.

247
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,220
Finally.

248
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,590
This is only the beginning of our relationship.

249
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,240
Besides Lu Qi's life, maybe you want something else.

250
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,580
We may be able to help you with it.

251
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,960
Perhaps, it's the leader position at Wan Lu Sect.

252
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,910
It's understandable that you will need time to think it over.

253
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,740
Would you please wait here for a little while

254
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,260
as you carefully consider my offer? You have time to answer me.

255
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,900
That old man Yuan Jie! How dare he try to fool me.

256
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,710
- A moment ago you mentioned the sect leader position...
- The sect leader position...

257
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,480
With your credibility, even if you get it,

258
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm afraid you won't keep it more than a few days.

259
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,100
What do you mean?

260
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,190
As a dignified Hill Master

261
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,860
you actually tried to deceive me with fake blood.

262
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,070
You have the nerve to speak of the Wan Lu Sect Leader position.

263
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,660
I should've demanded that you return Lu Qi's life.

264
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,790
Widow, are you crazy?

265
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,680
This old man broke his promise. Make him return Li Qu's life.

266
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,900
A bunch of fools from the Immortal Sects like you

267
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,320
think you can get cocky with me?

268
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,970
North Hill Master, this is Jian Xin Sect in the Immortal Sect's territory.

269
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,040
If you make a big fuss over here, it won't look good when you return to Wan Lu Sect.

270
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,540
Fine. For this humiliation...

271
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:57,330
I will definitely make you pay another day.

272
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,110
How much longer do I need to wait for you to wake up?

273
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,960
Sect Leader, I heard Yuan Jie was just here.

274
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:24,200
He did come, but the blood he brought was useless.

275
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,380
Did Yuan Jie lie to us?

276
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,630
I thought so at first, too.

277
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,000
But when I saw his expression earlier, it didn't look fake.

278
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
Then...

279
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,550
Perhaps Qin Zhiyan's blood does not have an effect.

280
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,910
How could that be? All of them are from the Qin family.

281
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,010
Maybe the blood necessary to wake Mingxuan has to be from a male member of the Qin family.

282
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,650
Then, what should we do now?

283
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,560
Our plan for now,

284
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,050
we can only put all our eggs in one basket.

285
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,180
Find a way to get Qin Qianxuan's blood.

286
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,630
But Qin Qianxuan's power is unfathomable. His prestige in the Immortal Sect is also extremely high.

287
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,360
If we want to make a move on him, I'm afraid it'll be very difficult.

288
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,490
We can't worry about that.

289
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,810
No matter the consequences, I must get Qin Qianxuan's blood.

290
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,460
If we can't get it secretly,

291
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,840
we'll take it publicly by force.

292
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,060
Revered Lady, you mean...

293
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:50,200
Immortal Sect has been peaceful for many years. It's time to stir up some storms to wake everyone up.

294
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,830
Zhiyan, wait for me.

295
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,040
Hurry! The Immortal Sect prisoner escaped from the dungeon and is running toward the Teasing Moon Peak. Let's stop him!

296
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,250
- Hurry up!
- Let's go!

297
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:46,020
He... ran... ran away. What to do?

298
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,800
Stop right there! You still want to run?

299
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,900
No, I need to go save him.

300
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,510
Stop right there.

301
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,680
Where's the medicine I gave you?

302
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,960
I don't know.

303
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,300
Don't know?

304
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,990
Then, I'll ask you. How did Liu Cangling recover his inner energy in such a short time?

305
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:01,000
Based on his little level and those few pills you gave him before, he was lucky to keep living,

306
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,030
let alone escape from prison. And he even wanted to attack Teasing Moon Peak?

307
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,120
I'm asking you again. Where's the medicine?

308
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm sorry, Demoness!

309
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,880
I gave the medicine to Brother Cangling! It's all my fault!

310
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,650
Aren't you so smart now? And you even dare to lie to me?

311
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,800
Not bad! In the short time you've been with me, you've grown a nerve!

312
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,420
I was just afraid he'd die.

313
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,150
If he dies, that's his lot!

314
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,530
But he came here because of me.

315
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,830
If he really died, I would never be able to forgive myself.

316
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,240
That's enough.

317
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,760
It's my fault. I'll take care of it. I'll go save him.

318
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,200
Stop.

319
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,250
"Save him," again? Do you know how to save him?

320
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,870
Teach me how to save him, all right?

321
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,160
Stand up.

322
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,300
Wipe your tears away.

323
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,290
First, let me hear you admit your wrongdoing. Twice.

324
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,980
I'm wrong, I shouldn't have lied–

325
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,900
Twice!

326
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,560
I was wrong, I was wrong... I was wrong!

327
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,490
I'll never dare lie to you again. I'll tell you everything!

328
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,660
What else?

329
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,660
Also, could you please tell me how to save Brother Cangling?

330
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,370
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

331
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:22,400
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

332
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,760
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

333
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,930
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

334
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,750
♫ The wind's rising ♫

335
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:37,300
♫ Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

336
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:44,930
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

337
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:52,300
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

338
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:59,900
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

339
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:10,400
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

340
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,400
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

341
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,390
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

342
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,720
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

343
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,940
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

344
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,500
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

345
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:59,830
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

346
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:07,300
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

347

♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

348
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:22,400
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

349
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,820
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

350
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:37,200
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

351
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,900
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

352
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:55,600
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
