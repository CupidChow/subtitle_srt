Mermaid yarn, it's impenetrable!

What's wrong?

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Nothing.

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,300
Master, this mermaid yarn you're wearing is very soft. I can't help but stroke it a little.

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,600
Stroke it.

10
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,410
My power!

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Master, you must be tired. Why don't you put me down?

Miss, this is not like the other places in Chenji Mountain.

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Since you'll be staying here from now on, I hope–

16
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,900
Stop. I know the rules here.

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,110
I listen to him.

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,610
And you have to listen to me.

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,400
That's enough. I'm tired. You can go now.

20
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,200
Captain, was I not right? This girl, Qin Zhiyan, is not easy to deal with.

Fine, Little Monster.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Don't think I can't see how fishy the placement of the bed is!

24
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Isn't your bed in Pure Wave Palace right next to this wall? If we take away this wall,

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm more or less sleeping in the same bed as you.

Your evil designs are plain as daylight.

Since I'm in a favorable position, if I don't teach you a lesson,

28
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,600
won't I be letting down your good intentions?

29
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Demoness, what's up? Did anything happen? Did anyone bully you?

30
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,900
Who'd dare bully me?

Where is Cleanse Dust Palace?

34
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Behind the Wu'e Hall, next to the Pure Wave Palace. From now on, you'll be living there.

I've recently taken up an interest in deathly traps. I learned a new tactic that I was just trying out.

I didn't hurt you, did I?

You're a quick study. Just missing some bite.

Demoness, what has been wrong with you lately?

96
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,800
First, you make soup; then, you set traps.

If you keep this up and Li Chenlan gets peeved, what are we going to do?

What can we do? When the time comes, I'll just push you out and he can cut you down.

Demoness, you're so evil.

101
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,420
Demoness, do you really have to kill Li Chenlan?

- No other way but kill?
- No other way but kill.

103
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,490
But at present, you have neither the fighting power nor North Hill Master's support.

104
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,760
Even if you rose up to Sect Leader, it would not last long.

105
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,270
What Lu Zhaoyao wants, who dares to take away?

106
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,450
Plus, this sect leader position was mine anyway.

107
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,700
Since I'm back now, getting back the sect leader position,

108
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,860
everyone else can forget about casting me down.

109
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,350
But Li Chenlan stole that position from you.

110
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,100
What does he have? He just has a Wanjun Sword for protection!

111
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,680
I feel like I missed out on one sword,

112
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,930
and I missed out on the entire world.

113
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,390
Wanjun Sword? It's been so long and you're still thinking about that?

114
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,520
Demoness, I think, in this world,

115
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,860
there must be another weapon that's similar to the Wanjun Sword. It might even be more powerful!

116
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,450
Good sister, you're finally useful for once!

117
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,290
Demoness complimented me.

118
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,630
Master!

119
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,960
Come in.

120
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,070
Master, the moon is beautiful tonight. Your pupil would like to invite you to enjoy the moonlight together.

121
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,280
I wonder if your tasks are complete for now.

122
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,240
Teasing Moon Peak's pergola should provide the best view. Let's go.

123
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,030
Master is the best!

124
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,600
Master, the moonlight is very beautiful. Right?

125
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,690
Today, I watched the guards do drills. They are all formidable. It seems everyone has a special weapon.

126
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,700
That Ah Da has sledgehammers, Lin Ziyu's whip is very pretty, too.

127
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,910
The other day North Hill Master came at me with his blue steel stick.

128
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,420
I heard that South Hill Master's acupuncture needles besides saving people can also kill without a trace.

129
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,560
But I don't have any weapon on me for protection.

130
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,360
Master...

131
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,730
Within the four seas, is there a weapon you have your eyes on?

132
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,380
I like the Wanjun Sword, will you give that to me?

133
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,160
I heard that on the Immortal Island of Liuhe beyond the seas there is a treasured sword

134
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,320
that was a steel stone on the mountaintop, polished by thunder and frost, day after day,

135
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,760
and thus, became a precious sword. That is–

136
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,940
The Liuhe Tianyi Sword.
(Liuhe Tianyi = "unifying all the world together")

137
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,610
You have good taste.

138
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,490
Then... Master.

139
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,940
I'm busy today. I'll get it for you another day.

140
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,490
I heard that this sword also has a holy beast guarding it.

141
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,690
The Immortal Island has hidden traps; for thousands of years, countless warriors have perished there.

142
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,540
Master, you're not scared...

143
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,810
Is tonight's moonlight beautiful?

144
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,590
- It's beautiful.
- Do you like it?

145
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,540
I like it.

146
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,880
As long as you like it, it's enough.

147
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,410
What are you jumping for? Is this also a side effect of the Empty Pill?

148
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,690
You're so useless! You can't even handle one word of love.

149
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,270
I plan to leave Chenji Mountain for 2-3 days.

150
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,320
In my absence, the Dark Guards will see to all sect matters for me.

151
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,680
If there are any problems, we will discuss them when I'm back.

152
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,220
Yes.

153
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,860
All dismissed.

154
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
- Ah Da.
- Here.

155
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,650
Protect Qin Zhiyan.

156
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,620
Yes, Sect Leader.

157
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,100
Sister Ziyu, Sect Leader rarely leaves the mountain. Why is he leaving this time?

158
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,890
Sect Leader has his own plans. The next few days he'll be gone, we all need to be more alert.

159
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,330
Yes.

160
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,310
Also, keep an eye on Cleanse Dust Palace.

161
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,880
Okay.

162
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,410
Where did you get this? It looks exactly like the one from Li Chenlan.

163
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,720
In Wan Lu Sect, there are plenty of ways. Wear it well, where it can be seen.

164
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,400
That way Li Chenlan will feel how important he is to you.

165
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,180
Right, Demoness, did you know? Li Chenlan is setting out from Chenji Mountain today.

166
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,330
I reckon he is probably going to get a sword for you.

167
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,840
Hey, why don't you look happy?

168
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,450
It is said that the old Demon King, 1000 years ago, going after the Liuhe Tianyi Sword,

169
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,160
was seriously wounded and died from inner injuries.

170
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,260
So you're worried about Li Chenlan, right?

171
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,240
What nonsense are you saying?

172
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,360
- Master.
- Let's go out for a walk.

173
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,420
Okay, let's go!

174
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,100
If he keeps coming here without notice at any moment, my life's going to be cut down by so many years.

175
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,380
Shortly, I'll be setting forth beyond the seas towards the immortal island, Liuhe Island,

176
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,000
to take the sword. The Teleportation Technique will be impeded.

177
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,080
Maybe, I'll be back in 2 or 3 days.

178
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,020
Oh.

179
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,260
What's wrong?

180
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,220
In the interval of my absence, if you want anything, simply tell the Dark Guards.

181
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,700
Oh.

182
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,450
You don't have anything you want to say to me?

183
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,350
Oh!

184
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,390
Master, you have to be careful. Don't get hurt and come back soon.

185
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,300
I'll miss you.

186
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,030
I will. If there is anything the Dark Guards cannot solve,

187
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,740
leave everything until I come back.

188
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,970
Okay.

189
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Demoness, are you feeling guilty?

190
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Shut up.

191
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I really think Li Chenlan is good to you.

192
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,400
Also, when I looked at his eyes a moment ago,

193
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,200
it looked like this person has been lonely for a long time

194
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
and he finally saw someone he likes.

195
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Little girls can only think of such nonsense all day.

196
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,500
That little monster just thinks your face is pretty.

197
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,830
He didn't have this reaction when he saw me during the day.

198
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,270
He only reacts this way when he sees you.

199
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I think... why don't you tell him everything?

200
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,200
What if he still has deep feelings when he finds out that you're Lu Zhaoyao?

201
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Naive.

202
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
All men in this world like women who are not a threat to them.

203
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
For example, you.

204
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
They loathe women who will take away status and position that belongs to them.

205
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,900
For example, me.

206
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,200
Even if I put my heart in it and give it all I have.

207
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
- Demoness,
- Enough.

208
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Tomorrow, I'm going with you to do good deeds in Shunan village. Let's rest.

209
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,800
Ah Wu, appearing here and flaunting our way through the market is a little too ostentatious.

210
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,000
The more ostentatious, the more I like it.

211
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,800
Didn't Li Chenlan make an alliance with Thousand Dust Pavilion against me?

212
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,900
I just want to raise a ruckus under his eyes to the point that he can't sit still.

213
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Thank you. Thank you!

214
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Thank you. Thank you.

215
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,370
You are really too good.

216
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,800
- Thank you, thank you.
- Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

217
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Thank you!

218
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,170
Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

219
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
- Thank you.
- Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

220
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,600
- Thank you, you're so kind!
- Lu Zhaoyao...

221
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,400
- Thank you.
- Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

222
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,300
Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

223
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
Thank you, thank you!

224
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Little beauty.

225
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,980
- Thank you!
- It's fate!

226
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

227
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Lu Zhaoyao told me to donate this.

228
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Let's go! Let's go!

229
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
So many people again?

230
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,800
You're donating clothes for Lu Zhaoyao. Is she paying your wage?

231
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
You. Who are you?

232
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
You forgot me already?

233
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,200
This Jiang Wu's attitude has a lot of my demeanor from back in the day.

234
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,300
If I could make use of it, it would make for a good move.

235
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,800
Since we're on it, I can use my current identity

236
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,600
and cut a deal with him; make him my ally

237
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
in getting rid of Li Chenlan.

238
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
You are too brazen!

239
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,600
If I'm brazen, it is a gift from the heavens to me.

240
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Who is that?

241
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Little Beauty, it looks like you're doing pretty well in Wan Lu Sect.

242
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Not bad! Pretty nimble.

243
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But he needs to change the habit of hitting my people in Wan Lu Sect.

244
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,500
Is it fun?

245
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,700
Miss Zhiyan, hurry back to Chenji Mountain. I'll hold him back for you.

246
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Still want to play?

247
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Little Beauty, come have a drink with me.

248
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
Zhiyan!

249
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,000
Little short hair, you dare to touch my person?

250
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,300
You're in danger now.

251
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,100
Her hands are so small.

252
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,500
[Su Residence]

253
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Wards?

254
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,800
No, I need to try from another direction.

255
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,200
These wards are laid quite sturdily.

256
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,600
It looks like I have to call in reinforcements.

257
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,000
Hi.

258
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,060
Little Beauty, have a drink first.

259
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,500
Me?

260
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,400
Quick! March on! Behave!

261
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,600
Hurry on! Behave!

262
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,400
Don't move!

263
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,300
Hurry and drink. It's good.

264
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,400
I drank a lot already. You just need to have one.

265
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Here, here.

266
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,000
It tastes good!

267
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
- What's the situation?
- What's the situation?

268
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
- Come here!
- Coming!

269
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
You pass out after one drink and you have the guts to drink with a stranger?

270
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,200
- Did you poison her?
- Did you poison her?

271
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,800
I wouldn't dare! How could a servant have the nerve to take such an initiative?

272
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,300
With such poor alcohol tolerance, you have the nerve to come out and drink?

273
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,800
With such poor alcohol tolerance, you have the nerve to come out and drink?

274
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,900
You...

275
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Ah Da, who hurt you?

276
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,900
Lady Zhiyan...

277
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,100
was captured. Save...

278
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,200
Sister Ziyu, what happened to Ah Da?

279
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,700
He didn't say anything and just fainted.

280
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,090
What are you standing there for? Take him away.

281
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,720
[Su Residence]

282
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,900
Lame.

283
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,930
Not good.

284
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,200
What if this Jiang Wu is a lecher

285
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,670
and takes advantage of Zhiyan's being drunk to make a move?

286
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,520
How can I stop him in this invisible state?

287
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,700
Or should I... stand and watch?

288
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,200
Silky and soft.

289
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,630
You're starting even before going inside? If you really do something, I...

290
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,660
Where did the mosquito come from?

291
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,660
It looks like seeing or not makes no difference.

292
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:48,090
"Lashes like a fan of feathers"
(Note: recurrent simile in poetry)

293
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,720
For real. Zhiyan does have a pretty face.

294
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,960
No wonder the Little Monster was so easily seduced.

295
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,930
What are you doing? What are you doing?

296
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,840
You are going to start right now?

297
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,030
"Look not at impropriety"
(Note: Confucius's instruction, Lun Yu)

298
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,610
What can I do?

299
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,800
Ah Wu!

300
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,030
What did he come for?

301
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,570
Done for! Done for!

302
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,590
He's going into the room.

303
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,890
Little Yi, this woman is really something.

304
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,130
Everything about her is that interesting.

305
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,790
What difference does she have with any other women?

306
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,970
Aren't those girls in the Pleasure Parlor all the same?

307
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:10,130
Far from it. Even when they sleep by my side, they're all quivering.

308
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,830
- She was just shivering a moment ago.
- Not the same.

309
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:18,090
Last time I saw her, her little self was very alluring.

310
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,550
- Ah Wu, you wouldn't be falling for her?
- Hey, not yet.

311
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,230
But whatever I like, I want to keep it by my side.

312
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,170
Ah Wu, don't underestimate this Li Chenlan.

313
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:39,630
He's the legendary Son of the Demon King; he holds the Wanjun Sword. He's not the type to mess with.

314
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:45,560
This Qin Zhiyan, I hear, is his pupil. She's generally well taken care of, with affection.

315
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,840
At the moment, we certainly don't need a direct confrontation with Li Chenlan.

316
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,570
After he joined hands with the Thousand Dust Pavillion to bother me, I still haven't settled the score.

317
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:02,270
When I seize Wan Lu Sect, everything he now has will belong to me.

318
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,890
Little Short Hair, you really can boast!

319
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:10,720
If you have the strength, you can be arrogant. If you don't, that means you don't have the measure of things.

320
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,100
This Little Short Hair needs to be watched.

321
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,240
Cutting deals with him is too dangerous. It appears I shouldn't stay here anymore.

322
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,340
But the surrounding area is all warded. I can get out, but what about the little girl?

323
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:32,400
If I also make an appearance at nightfall, won't that be troublesome?

324
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,280
Ah Wu, caution is best in all things.

325
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,680
Your injury also needs more treatments.

326
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,360
Let's go.

327
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,960
Liuhe Immortal Island. Just as it was rumored, it is hard to summon power here.

328
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:42,000
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

329
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,050
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

330
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,520
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

331
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,670
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

332
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:03,030
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

333
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:10,570
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

334
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:17,860
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

335
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:25,630
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

336
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:36,570
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

337
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:57,090
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

338
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:03,100
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

339
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,560
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

340
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,530
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

341
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:17,940
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

342
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:25,450
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

343
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:32,980
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

344
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:40,540
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

345
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:47,940
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

346
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:55,530
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

347
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:03,000
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

348
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,510
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

349
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:21,660
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
