[Episode 21]

3
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,050
You're not writing a letter to the girl on Chenji Mountain today?

4
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,180
Not writing anymore. Even if I did, it'd fall into the hands of that pervert.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,510
I think the relationship between the woman from the Immortal Sect and Li Chenlan is not that simple.

6
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,760
Last time, on Lingting Mountain she just wanted to leave.

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,990
What exchange of information?

8
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,270
I think she was intentionally fooling you.

9
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,210
Indeed. I also think the relationship between that woman and Li Chenlan

10
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,450
is not as hostile as she claims.

11
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,390
They seem to be protecting each other.

12
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,100
They even seem to have some feelings for each other.

13
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,500
Did I ask for your opinions?

14
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,210
Ah Wu, I'm being serious.

15
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,520
Don't believe that woman's words.

16
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,270
People from the Immortal Sect were always good at reversing black and white and spouting lots of nonsense.

17
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,150
In order to live, they'll say anything.

18
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,510
I know how to deal with that woman.

19
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,130
You two, follow me.

20
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,320
Your proposition... sounds pretty interesting..

21
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,520
It's just to bad that I'm nobody's woman.

22
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,650
I'm only myself.

23
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,610
Ah Wu!

24
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,890
Ah Wu, what are you doing?

25
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,160
I'm making a puppet to find someone.

26
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,770
Find who? That Immortal Sect woman?

27
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,500
I want to see her.

28
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,800
And I can't wait one more second.

29
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,410
- Hi.
- Hello.
 - Candied hawthorn!

30
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,020
Yummy candied hawthorn!

31
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,280
Come have a look! Yummy candied hawthorn!

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,060
What are you doing?

33
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,720
Hello, this is for you.

34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,120
When did you take it? How come I didn't know?

35
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

36
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,250
If you want it, I'll just buy it for you. Isn't that all right?

37
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,720
It's for you.

38
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,950
It's for me?

39
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,030
Candied hawthorn!

40
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,350
It's yummy!

41
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,620
Little Short Hair? Why is he here?

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,750
It's indeed yummy!

43
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,780
It's mine.

44
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,970
- Little Beauty, do we still need to split mine from yours?
- Inform Sect Leader at once. Jiang Wu is at Shunan Town.

45
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,380
Yes.

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,850
Sect Leader. Jiang Wu appeared in Shunan Village and ran into Miss Zhiyan.

47
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,240
This candied hawthorn is as sweet as you.

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,900
This Little Short Hair is quite flirty.

49
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,220
If you like it, you can have it all.

50
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,120
What I like, is not just this candied hawthorn.

51
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,830
Little Beauty, why are you so afraid of me today?

52
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,990
Did you do something that has wronged me?

53
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,140
I... I'm not... I'm not afraid of you.

54
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,850
You're shivering like this and you said you're not afraid? Do you think he's blind?

55
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,880
Come, learn from me.

56
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,820
I'm not afraid of you. I just think you're wise and handsome.

57
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,720
Just seeing you makes me feel refreshed and calm.

58
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,190
I'm not afraid of you. I just think you're wise and handsome.

59
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,690
Just seeing you makes me feel calm and fresh... huh... refreshed and calm.

60
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,460
Do you really think that?

61
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,660
Why do I feel like you're a little weird today?

62
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,350
Don't be scared of me. No matter what, I'll always like you.

63
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,320
Sick pervert, you again?

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,360
You miss me that much? You can have this to eat.

65
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,590
Li Chenlan, are you angry? But you can't kill me.

66
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,280
But you better remember, in the near future,

67
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,130
everything you own will be mine!

68
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,600
Little Monster really looks mad.

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,550
No matter what, don't say anything.

70
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
Don't tell me he can see me.

71
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,220
Return to Cleanse Dust Palace.

72
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,920
Yes.

73
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,190
Let's go. Let's go!

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,660
Ah Wu, you're back. Why are you so happy?

75
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,700
Seeing Li Chenlan angry,

76
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,740
it was so enjoyable!

77
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,250
Trying to steal my woman? In your dreams.

78
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,410
This feels great!

79

[Xu Zong Sect]

80
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,660
Has anyone solved my puzzle today?

81
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,340
No.

82
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,700
The puzzle this time is quite complicated.

83
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,690
Enough to give Gu Hanguang a headache for a few days.

84
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,330
Sect Leader, you have a guest.

85
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,630
All right.

86
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,240
Pavilion Master Qin.

87
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,870
I reported to you a moment ago. You said to let him in.

88
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,750
Sect Leader Jiang is still the same. How have you been lately?

89
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,820
I am fine right now.

90
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,160
But I'm sure I can't escape the fate of the Xu Zong Sect's clan.

91
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,590
I'm not like you. Prepare tea for Pavilion Master Qin.

92
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,490
Sect Leader Jiang need not worry so much.

93
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,570
The world is so vast, there must be a solution.

94
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,170
Thank you for your concern.

95
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,990
I have benefited greatly from Pavilion Master Qin.

96
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,730
But who in the world can really say

97
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,420
they can win against fate?

98
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,330
I wonder if Pavilion Master Qin came today for something urgent?

99
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,360
I do have something to ask you.

100
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,540
Has Sect Leader Jiang ever seen this image?

101
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,430
If I'm not mistaken,

102
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,860
this image should be the mark of the Manipulation Technique.

103
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,800
I feel like I got beat up.

104
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,490
Did Li Chenlan hit you? Did Jiang Wu hit you?

105
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,480
They didn't even touch your fingers!

106
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,730
But I'm mentally exhausted!

107
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,960
When will you be back to normal?

108
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,670
When can I live a normal life?

109
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,540
Do you think I don't want to?

110
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,520
[To Qin Zhiyan]

111
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,310
- Demoness, I need to go to Jianxin Sect.
- Are you crazy?

112
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,960
- Where did this letter come from?
- Brother Cangling wrote to me.

113
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,360
He said he saw my father at Jianxin Sect.

114
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,320
Do you believe what he said? This letter is suspicious. It might not be from him.

115
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,820
I recognize it! This is Brother Cangling's writing. And he wouldn't lie to me.

116
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,700
Demoness, can you come with me to Jianxin Sect?

117
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,490
You're not allowed to go.

118
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,990
Why won't you let me go?

119
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,400
Come with me.

120
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,500
No, I have to go.

121
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,120
Stop right there. I said you're not allowed to go!

122
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,070
If you want to go, you go by yourself. I'm not taking the bait with you.

123
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,050
What are you doing!

124
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,640
If you don't let me go, I'll kill myself.

125
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,460
I hate people blackmailing me.

126
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,420
I dare you to kill yourself in front of me. Let's see who yields first!

127
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,210
Demoness, it's my fault. I shouldn't have blackmailed you.

128
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,420
I know I should handle my own problem.

129
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,370
I also know this letter came suddenly and it might be a trap.

130
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,260
But in regards to my father, even if it's just a thread of hope, I still want to fight for it.

131
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,000
Because I really miss my father.

132
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,340
When my father was alive, I didn't cherish him.

133
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,970
Every day I would think of ways to see Brother Cangling.

134
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,060
If possible, I really wish I could see my father again.

135
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,890
If you can stop your tears,

136
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,010
I can force myself to consider taking you to Jianxin Sect.

137
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,670
All right!

138
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,220
But if you go to Jinzhoug just with your skills, you're sure to be reduced to bones.

139
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,670
So to be safe, we need to bring along one person.

140
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,070
Who?

141
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,730
Li Chenlan.

142
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,020
Him? Why would he agree?

143
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,260
Why wouldn't he agree?

144
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,850
Didn't he just get in an argument with you?

145
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,100
Why don't you coax him first?

146
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,000
Coax?

147
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
What's "coax?" I don't know how.

148
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,960
How do you not know how to coax someone?

149
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,850
It's the same as making a child happy.

150
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,810
You can make something he likes to eat and bring it to him at night.

151
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,410
And then say something nice, have a chat with him, apologize to him.

152
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,640
Like a sweet companion tenderly lingering in the night.

153
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,200
That's kid's play.

154
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,510
Today, I'll show you what it really means to coax someone.

155

[Pure Wave Palace]

156

Miss Zhiyan, Sect Leader is asleep. Please come back tomorrow.

157
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,820
How do you know he's asleep?

158
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,570
Are you sleeping with him? Or did he write a letter to tell you that?

159
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,630
Regardless if Sect Leader is asleep or not, he didn't say you can go in.

160
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,010
Move aside.

161
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,880
- You can't go in!
- Miss Zhiyan!

162
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,180
Sect Leader, Miss Zhiyan barged in. We couldn't stop her.

163
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,800
Master, I'm here for my declaration.

164
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,030
I like you.

165
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,070
Master, I know you mistakenly thought that I was colluding with Jiang Wu.

166
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,860
But I was forced in that situation. I had to say that to save West Hill Master.

167
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,000
I really have no feelings for Jiang Wu.

168
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,450
Master, the one I love with all my heart is you.

169
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,750
How much love?

170
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,860
More than eagles love the sky, more than horses love prairies.

171
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,360
In short, I don't love Jiang Wu.

172
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,010
You're all dismissed.

173
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes.

174
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,840
Tell me. What do you want this time?

175
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,730
Master, I want to go to Jinzhou City and investigate the real reason behind my father's death.

176
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,560
But going alone is too dangerous. I want you to come with me.

177
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,910
Go back for now.

178
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,550
Yes.

179
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,410
What? You just directly told him like that?

180
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,430
You just blatantly used Li Chenlan?

181
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,070
It's over. Li Chenlan must be angry.

182
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,000
You said you're normally very courageous. I've also heard of all the bold things you've done.

183
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,970
I can't believe you're still like this.

184
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,500
Li Chenlan definitely won't go to Jianxin Sect with us.

185
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,240
Our bodies also interchange at night. What do we do?

186
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,420
The one I love with all my heart is you.

187
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,440
How much love?

188
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,620
More than eagles love the sky, more than horses love prairies.

189
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,740
I think Little Monster was convinced.

190
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,020
Demoness, you're so confident.

191
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,930
Just wait.

192
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,890
- Wait for what?
- Wait for Li Chenlan.

193
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,180
Sect Leader, forgive us. We didn't do a good job and couldn't stop Miss Zhiyan.

194
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,080
Good. You did very well.

195
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,190
Send someone to inform Sima Rong. Tell him to hurry and prepare the thing I want.

196
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,750
I'm going to get it myself tomorrow.

197
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,230
Yes.

198
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,500
[Xu Zong Sect]

199
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,630
Pavilion Master Qin is saying that

200
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,260
not only did the Manipulation Technique appear again in Jianghu,

201
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,950
but it appeared in the Jianxin Sect of Immortal Sects.

202
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,930
This is a serious matter that involves many parties.

203
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm afraid it's even more complicated and twisted underneath.

204
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,910
Pavillion Leader Qin, you've always known that our Xu Zong Sect is content in its land;

205
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,970
we don't concern ourselves with worldly affairs. About this matter,

206
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,010
you need not tell us more, Pavilion Master Qin. Jianghu's matters,

207
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,380
I don't want to know and I can't help either.

208
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,540
In my opinion, Revered Changyu is behind Jianxin Sect,

209
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,310
Xiong Tian and Chi Tianming will also be involved.

210
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,400
Your younger brother's death is indeed odd.

211
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,540
In addition, Jianxin Sect currently...

212
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,580
This matter is too entangled, any movement would affect all involved.

213
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,570
Our Jiang family descendants cannot live for very long;

214
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,730
we just want a carefree life.

215
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,260
So, about these things of Jianghu,

216
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,990
Pavilion Leader Qin, I'm afraid you're asking the wrong person.

217
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,000
If the heart is unmoved, man won't move rashly.
(Buddhist quotation)

218
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,210
No movement leads to no injury.
(Buddhist quotation)

219
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,380
You are indeed wise, Sect Leader Jiang.

220
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,410
Ah Rong, try the tea I prepared.

221
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,550
Ah Rong, it's been so long since you told me a story.

222
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,200
Ah Rong! Ah Rong!

223
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah Rong... Ah Rong!

224
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,030
Yuezhu, be good. I'm almost done with the sword scabbard.

225
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,430
Look. These are the Little Horse and Little Pig I made. How is my craftsmanship?

226
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,060
Good.

227
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,990
Ah Rong, they're also very curious about what happened in their story.

228
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,990
Without noticing, we walked here.

229
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,800
This is where we first met.

230
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,750
Yes. These crabapple flowers are blossoming beautifully.

231
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,260
Yuezhu.

232
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,550
Let's just go back.

233
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,930
You haven't completed your task. If you run away now, aren't you leaving things halfway?

234
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,300
So you already knew about it.

235
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,730
Before you got close to me, you should've known what I'd do.

236
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,700
I received the secret command from the South Moon Order before you did.

237
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,380
The content of the secret command was for you to kill me.

238
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,710
Why aren't you making a move?

239
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,550
Here. Take it.

240
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,760
You really think I dare not kill you?

241
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,150
You're right. I can't kill you.

242
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,280
From now on,

243
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,210
we're like this robe.

244
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,220
We're fine and uninjured like this robe?

245
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,130
This dagger isn't sharp at all, a kite is more effective than this!

246
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,960
Yuezhu, don't make it hard for yourself.

247
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,190
Stay with me.

248
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,130
And then, Little Pig received a secret order

249
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,090
to assassinate Little Horse.

250
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,890
And then?

251
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,770
Little Horse and Little Pig... they...

252
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,130
Put them in the box, I'll continue the story next time.

253
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,390
Ah Rong!

254
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,430
Why are you in such a hurry?

255
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,760
Just good timing. Jinzhou's Jianxin Sect was already suspicious.

256
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,390
Concern leads to confusion. Don't be too anxious.

257
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,700
Also, you must beware of Jianxin Sect's Demon-Shield Ward.

258
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,600
That's what got Zhaoyao that year.

259
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,340
I know.

260
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Thank you. She'll definitely like it.

261
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,080
[Cleanse Dust Palace]

262
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,780
Stay focused. Do you want to get revenge or not?

263
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,770
I'm so worried. If Li Chenlan doesn't go with us to Jinzhou City,

264
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,800
the security there is so strict. What if something happens to us?

265
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,530
And if I really do see my father...

266
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,890
Isn't it good if it's your father? Don't you want to see him?

267
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,720
Of course, I want to!

268
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,240
But I don't even have the confidence to avenge him right now.

269
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,730
He must blame me.

270
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,520
How could he blame you?

271
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,650
Stop stressing. I'll do whatever I can to make Li Chenlan go with us to Jinzhou City. Don't worry.

272
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,670
You... don't do whatever you can.

273
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,180
Last time, you confessed to him, you almost scared me to death!

274
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,030
Who coaxes someone like that? He certainly wasn't coaxed.

275
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,790
Let's go.

276
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,920
You're not going to Jinzhou City anymore?

277
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,150
My god, he really agreed? Do these things actually happen?

278
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,680
What are you waiting for? Are you going or not?

279
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,230
Go.

280
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,800
Remember to hold his hand and say, "Master is the best."

281
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,430
Oh.

282
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,160
Thank you, Master.

283
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,020
Tell him to prepare a carriage.

284
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,990
Can you... Can you...

285
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,830
Let's take a horse carriage.

286
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,760
The scenery along the way must be beautiful.

287
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,470
- Lin Ziyu.
- Yes.

288
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,170
- Prepare a horse carriage.
- Yes, Sir.

289
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,740
What's with you?

290
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,540
I'm scared.

291
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,990
I really don't know what you're scared of. What's there to be scared of?

292
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,380
Weird. Why am I so nervous?

293
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,490
I, Lu Zhaoyao, have been through so much through the years,

294
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,680
what handsome young man have I not seen? Wasn't it just a look?

295
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,880
Didn't the Little Monster think it was weird?

296
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,040
Forget it. Just pretend I didn't say anything.

297
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,360
That day in the West Hill Master's yard,

298
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,660
I saw the Captain's whip was on the verge of lashing out;

299
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,200
and in the blink of a moment,

300
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,390
Miss Zhiyan appeared and stopped the Captain.

301
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,430
Holding down that Little Black Ball's cloak she said:

302
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,840
"I'll skin whoever tries to disrobe her."

303
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,870
That pose could have matched our Previous Sect Leader.

304
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,880
It's weird. It's been a while since that Little Black Ball came to Wan Lu Sect,

305
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,980
but we've never seen her face.

306
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,380
What do you all think she looks like?

307
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,170
In our Wan Lu Sect, there are three things we can't touch. We need to add another thing now.

308
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,640
First, you can't touch Sect Leader's sword.

309
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,320
Second, you can't touch South Hill Master's board.

310
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,760
Third, you can't touch North Hill Master's beard.

311
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,440
And now fourth, you can't touch Miss Zhiyan's maid's cloak.

312
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,190
We definitely cannot touch these four things.

313
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,720
You're right.

314
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,520
You're all quite idle!

315
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,920
There's nothing for you to do, right?

316
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,060
Run twenty laps around the mountain. Don't come back until you finish!

317
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,800
Yes.

318
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,310
Sister Ziyu, why don't we think of a way to get rid of Qin Zhiyan?

319
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,290
What idea do you have?

320
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,510
Let's poison her.

321
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,130
You think it's that easy?

322
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,690
But...

323
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,520
Rather, I can push our Sect Leader to be fed up with her.

324
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,590
How can we push Sect Leader towards being fed up with her?

325
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,260
Infidelity and fickleness.

326
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,170
How should we do that?

327
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,390
Isn't there one ready for use at Jianxin Sect?

328
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,980
Captain!

329
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,900
What is it?

330
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,380
News from Wu'e Hall: Qin Qianxian from Thousand Dust Pavillion is here.

331
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,950
Pavillion Leader Qin, welcome, this far from home.

332
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,330
I wonder what matter brought you here today.

333
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,090
Do you know where Zhiyan is at the moment?

334
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,430
Miss Zhiyan went to Jinzhou.

335
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,490
Then may I see Sect Leader Li?

336
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,350
Sect Leader went with her, he is also not at Wan Lu Sect.

337
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,830
Then, sorry for troubling you. I'll take leave.

338
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,190
Pavillion Leader Qin, at your ease.

339
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,990
Why did he come here?

340
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,160
Seems like we don't need to do anything. Someone will take Qin Zhiyan away.

341
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,770
[Jinzhou City]

342
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,490
At vespers, Jinzhou is under curfew.

343
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,140
Why are so many people from Jianxin Sect still here?

344
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,560
Let's find an inn to stay at for now. We'll enter the city tomorrow morning.

345
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,180
Find the closest one. I'll be visible soon.

346

[Jinzhou City]

347
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,830
Guests, enjoy.

348
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,700
How much was it?

349
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,430
Innkeeper, please give me two rooms with a skylight.

350
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,670
- Waiter!
- I'm coming!

351
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,860
It's unfortunate, we only have one room with a skylight left.

352
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,130
There's only one? What about regular rooms?

353
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,990
What about regular rooms?

354
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,520
We don't have any regular rooms left.

355
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,390
This entire inn only has one room left?

356
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,980
This entire inn only have one room left?

357
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,460
Yes.

358
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,190
I'm out of time. I'm leaving first.

359
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,530
Check again.

360
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,350
Then... I'll check again.

361
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,190
There is... There's another one.

362
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,990
Master, you're drinking alone?

363
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,020
I'll drink with you.

364
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,680
The martial law in Jinzhou lately is stricter and stricter.

365
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,690
We have the Demon-Shield Ward. What's the Jianxin Sect afraid of? They're making people nervous.

366
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,080
Where's the Immortal Sect's majestic composure?

367
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,070
Right! That Demon-Shield Ward is unrivaled.

368
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,200
Back then, when the former Sect Leader of Wan Lu Sect, Lu Zhaoyao, attacked Jianxin Sect,

369
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,650
she was so formidable and yet she couldn't break through the 10,000 swords.This Demon-Shield Ward, now,

370
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,830
is recreated on the basis of that 10,000 sword formation.

371
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,530
We can say it is the peak of demon-shielding formations.

372
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,700
Let's not talk about the deceased Lu Zhaoyao. Even if the old Demon King, Li Xiu, crawled back from hell,

373
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,230
he still wouldn't be able to force his way in.

374
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,180
These lowlifes only know how to badmouth me.

375
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,300
Thinking back on the battle of Jianxin Sect, I got all the way to the core,

376
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,040
and on the way back I even happened on the most beautiful man in the world.

377
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,400
Qin Qianxian.

[Wan Lu Sect]

379
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,280
Welcome back, Sect Leader.

380
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,140
These last few days, thank you for guarding the place.

381
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,150
Sect Leader, this is...

382
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,010
I snatched him on the way back from Jinzhou. I heard he's the most beautiful man in the world.

383
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,230
Hey, Little Monster. Come help me carry him.

384
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,530
Let's go.
