[Episode 31]

3
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,960
Mingxuan! Mingxuan!

4
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,090
Luo Mingxuan, I do what I say.

5
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,120
Today,

6
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,720
you must die.

7
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,720
Suruo...

8
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,290
Mingxuan... Mingxuan...

9
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,380
- Mingxuan...
- Suruo...

10
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,830
You are my husband.

11
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,730
My wife...

12
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,800
Zhaoyao!

13
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,480
Mo Qing,

14
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,940
this life has never followed my wishes.

15
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,180
Unlike you.

16
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,350
What is it?

17
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,660
My time's over.

18
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,420
Don't cry!

19
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,670
- Sect Leader Li.
- Sect Leader.

20
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,870
Where's Lu Zhaoyao?

21
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,830
I... I don't know.

22
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,790
Where could she have gone?

23
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,870
She... I don't know where she'd go, either.

24
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,710
Where could she have gone?

25
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,080
She...

26
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,460
She would go back to Wan Lu Sect!

27
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,620
Ah Da, I want to keep searching a little longer.

28
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,890
Can you please have the Dark Guards take Brother Cangling and Liu Wei to get treatment?

29
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,320
What do you want to search for?

30
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:11,410
Also, what's with the Sect Leader mentioning the Previous Leader?

31
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,850
It's a long story. I'll tell you later, all right?

32
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,960
Why do I feel like I've been here before?

33
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,270
Lu Zhaoyao, the inner demon born of you is finally extinguished through you.

34
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,540
Lu Zhaoyao?

35
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,010
I was born of you in the first place!

36
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,090
Qin Qianxian, if the world knew that your heart was moved like any man's,

37
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,560
what would you do?

38
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,650
What's wrong?

39
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,860
Nothing.

40
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,230
Miss Zhiya!

41
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,450
Have you found him?

42
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,470
What about Brother Cangling?

43
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,960
He's been taken to the South Hills Master's residence for treatment. The Dark Guards reported that Liu Wei is fine.

44
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,740
Liu Cangling may have to be tended to for some time.

45
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,980
- Sect Leader.
- I searched up and down Chenji Mountain.

46
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,880
I also searched the Cleanse Dust Palace. She's not anywhere.

47
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,140
She can't disappear.

48
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,530
She can't disappear.

49
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,460
- Sect Leader Li!
- Sect Leader!

50
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,430
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader Li!

51
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,160
Men, come here! Quick, ask South Hills Master to come here!

52
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,110
Zhaoyao...

53
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,880
You're awake!

54
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,980
How did I end up back here?

55
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,930
Of course, you must come back. Otherwise, who'd give me the money?

56
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,630
What money? Haven't I paid already?

57
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,930
You don't know. A moment ago you went overtime.

58
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,360
Though it wasn't much money, our shop doesn't allow credit.

59
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,280
Based on your worth,

60
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,750
one way or the other we still need ¥13,000.

61
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,700
It's robbery! The time I delayed wasn't even enough to take a breath.

62
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,960
Not to mention, when I bought this Empty Pill, wasn't it to use it?

63
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,700
If I could delay the time that means I'm that good.

64
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,960
What's the logic of asking me to compensate? I won't.

65
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,980
Can't you be reasonable?

66
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,890
Reasonable?

67
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,950
This rotten pill of yours made me explode!

68
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,800
If I get any physical damage, how will you repay me?

69
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,380
"When the time is over,

70
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,400
it will explode."

71
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,480
Where are you going? Are you paying or not?

72
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,290
If you don't pay, the money from your good deeds in the future will be even less.

73
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,790
Purchases will be even more expensive!

74
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,770
The pill was bought by Mrs. Zhou. Go ask Mrs. Zhou.

75
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,050
Since I'm her daughter-in-law you, should put it on them.

76
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,350
Put it on Mrs. Zhou's bill?

77
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,270
Where are they?

78
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,120
Who?

79
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,400
My husband and mother-in-law!

80
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,720
I don't know. Before they left, they said that while you weren't there,

81
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,460
they'll take your birthtime and horoscope

82
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,750
and make an assessment of your past life.

83
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,220
My past?

84
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,600
I wonder if they'll get scared off.

85
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,760
- I'm sorry.
- Make way!

86
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,920
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- Speak! Why did you do it?

87
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,280
Isn't it just ¥13,000? It shouldn't be a big deal to you.

88
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,870
There's no need to get so mad.

89
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,120
In a while I'll return all the money on your bill, isn't that enough?

90
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,770
What?

91
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,260
You also put the bill on my account?

92
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,600
Weren't you talking about this? Then, what are you angry about?

93
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,150
Why did you lie to me?

94
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,040
I've been searching in the Land of Sojourn for decades

95
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,630
just to find a virtuous wife for my son.

96
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,990
And you used such a trick to fool me!

97
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,020
If you aren't happy, let's just hurry up with the divor--

98
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,990
- Let's go!
- Mother! It's absolutely impossible!

99
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,950
What's impossible?

100
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,420
Son, with your deep morality,

101
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,660
you deserve the best girl in this world.

102
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,170
Why would you pick this... this...

103
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,650
Son! Your mother's been looking so many years for you,

104
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:37,560
how could you set your eyes on such a dissolute lying seductress?

105
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,820
Hey, old woman, the people who dare speak ill gossip of me in my presence

106
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,560
by now must all have gone through several reincarnations.

107
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,920
Even if now you are in the Land of Sojourn, you have to watch your mouth.

108
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,300
What should I watch?

109
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,470
Look for yourself. Look! Lu Zhaoyao,

110
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,160
in which year, month and day, where and with whom was doing what?

111
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,950
It shames me to read it out loud! Look for yourself!

112
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,290
In the year of the metal buffalo, tenth month, 3rd day, on Chenji Mountain, under the archway to Wan Lu Sect,

113
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,320
Lu Zhaoyao... wh-what?

114
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,790
and with Li Chenlan... crude acts... wild motion...

115
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,060
This... This... What is this? Name of... What crime?

116
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,890
What?

117
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,590
With whom? Did what all night?

118
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,550
And crude and wild? What's that word at the end?

119
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,700
What's this thing? Huh?

120
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,260
If you call me, Lu Zhaoyao, for murder or arson, I'll admit to any of that,

121
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,400
but what is this now?

122
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,880
Me with Moqing? What's this rubbish? Gossip?

123
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,990
Who recorded this? Are you teasing me?

124
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,890
- Mother!
- I didn't!

125
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,060
- I'm smashing this thing!
- Let go! Let go!

126
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,860
Good going, you all! You even dare steal things from my shop!

127
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,590
Give it!

128
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:03,880
And you, Lu Zhaoyao! You dare peep into the details of your own past?

129
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,810
¥100,000! One cent less, I'll drag you to the justice and get you locked up forever!

130
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,580
Robbery! I have no money!

131
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,950
Arrest them! Arrest them!

132
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,660
What's this? What are you doing?

133
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,660
- You... You... You caught the wrong person.
- Let go of me!

134
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,100
Daring to steal my things!

135
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,520
- Shameless!
- You people, let me go! Let me go!

136
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,770
Let me go!

137

[Pure Wave Palace]

138
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,030
Did you find her?

139
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,160
Not yet.

140
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,700
Zhaoyao... Zhaoyao, come back...

141
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,770
It's enough to make him sleep all night.

142
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,400
South Hills Master, I heard that Brother Cangling is also...

143
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,750
Yes. Every one of you is so careless.

144
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,990
Can you leave me in peace a little?

145
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,100
Looking at his wounds. His father had already been cured by Jiang He.

146
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,310
There's no great damage.

147
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,070
If you want to see him, follow me. I'm just going there.

148
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,050
All right. All right.

149
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,030
Right, you must take good care of your sect leader.

150
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,020
If you don't, when the Demoness comes back, she'll be grieved.

151
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,310
Yes!

152
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,380
When did this happen? Wasn't it Miss Zhiyan?

153
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,230
How did it become the previous sect leader?

154
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,270
What a mess.

155
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,800
Zhaoyao... Zhaoyao...

156
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,120
Where are you?

157
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,780
Where are you...

158
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,720
Zhaoyao...

159
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,360
You liar!

160
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,990
- You damn liar!
- Mother!

161
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,460
- Enchantress!
- Enough.

162
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,760
- You're really heartless!
- Mother...

163
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,290
- You enchantress!
- Don't be mad.

164
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,760
- You damn witch!
- Mother...

165
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,030
The year of the metal buffalo, tenth month, 3rd day...

166
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,790
I'm very familiar with this date

167
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,220
Because around that time, ten days before, the ninth month, day 23,

168
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,030
it was the day I killed Luo Mingxuan for the first time.

169
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,720
In that battle I sealed him and immediately put him to sleep.

170
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,640
I was carried back to Wan Lu Sect by the Dark Guards.

171
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,370
I grappled with King Yama a few times, but in the end I got lucky.
(T/N: Yama, King of Hell. Means she grappled with death)

172
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,600
It took seven days and seven nights to Gu Hangguang to save my life.

173
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,220
After realizing my revenge, I was so utterly pleased.

174
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,940
I didn't care how Gu Hanguang scolded me.

175
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,560
I held a banquet in Wan Lu Sect...and feasted magnificiently for three days and nights.

176
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,890
I got so drunk that I was unconscious for half the month.

177
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,920
They said I burned down the Summit of Teasing Moon that night.

178
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,790
I became a drunk maniac whom everyone feared.

179
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,200
Could it be that night?

180
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,820
Don't worry. The Chief of South Hills has excellent medical skills. He'll be fine.

181
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,300
Do you know your uncle's whereabouts?

182
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,990
I don't know where he is right now. I haven't heard from him for a long time.

183
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,120
Liu Suruo and Jin Xian are dead.

184
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,190
The Immortal Sect needs to face the consequence of this incident. Also, to regroup and purge those involved.

185
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,710
Zhiyan, do you intend to return to the Qin family to manage affairs?

186
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,580
Right now, my senior sect brothers are handling the affairs. It should be fine.

187
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,750
I don't know when Brother Cangling will regain consciousness.

188
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,680
I can't leave Wan Lu Sect yet.

189
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,110
Shen Master,

190
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,720
since you're still worried about the Immortal Sects, why aren't you returning to Rain View Pavilion?

191
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,460
At least the Rain View Pavilion still holds a position in the Immortal Sects.

192
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,820
Get me the needles.

193
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,430
Thanks.

194
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,190
Physician Gu has the heart of a healer.

195
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,510
I'm not a benevolent physician. I only treat the people who I want to treat.

196
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,640
If I fall sick, will you treat me?

197
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,440
I'll surely will do everything in my power.

198
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,960
Hot water.

199
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,550
I'll get it.

200
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,550
Zhiyan, I will go.

201
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,370
You stay here and watch over Liu Cangling.

202
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,090
[Phoenix's Song Hall]

203
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,840
- Here.
- Thanks.

204
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,260
This plaster patch is too ugly. I won't put it on.

205
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,910
It's up to you. Look around you.

206
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,070
You're still being so picky.

207
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,620
Being good looking is what I chase after for my whole life.

208
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,430
A brute like you wouldn't understand it.

209
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,380
- Say that one more time.
- Enough!

210
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,360
We haven't found Jin Xian. The two of you...

211
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,810
are fighting over such a trivial matter.

212
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,620
Never did I expect that Lu Zhaoyao would actually come back to life.

213
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,430
With Lady Chang Yu and Jin Xian dead...

214
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:58,220
I'm afraid Wan Lu Sect will lord it over the world from now on.

215
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:04,530
If you put in a bet, you need to concede defeat. This time they've won.

216
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,550
No.

217
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,000
Jin Xian has a gold body for protection. Surely the Flame of Phoenix will not kill him.

218
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,640
I will surely find Jin Xian.

219
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,250
The Flame of Phoenix can burn thru anything in the world.

220
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,580
Deacon Chi, you should stop deceiving yourself.

221
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,060
Not true, as per Deacon Chi,

222
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
Jin Xian will surely not be easily burned by the flame.

223
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,840
I want to see his body, be it dead or alive. Let's go.

224
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,610
Sect Leader Jiang, now that Jin Xian is dead,

225
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,910
if we want to contain Wan Lu Sect, I'm afraid only Xu Zong Sect's Forbidden Spell can do the trick.

226
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,730
I wonder if Sect Leader Jiang is willing to offer the Forbidden Spell?

227
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:03,680
If Sect Leader Jiang is willing to do it for a just cause, I'll surely nominate you for our leader.

228
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,450
It's getting late.

229
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,560
You and Sect Leader Tang need to get some rest. I will take my leave.

230
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,260
Let's go.

231
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,290
You were being too direct. Don't you know the Forbidden Spell is a taboo for the Xu Zhon Sect?

232
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,980
I only wanted to test him and see if the rumored Forbidden Spell...

233
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,380
was real or not?

234
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,780
What did you find out?

235
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,480
He avoided my question. He's trying to keep it a secret.

236
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,940
I'm quite sure that the Forbidden Spell does exist.

237
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,300
It's hard to survive the noble path. To eliminate evil and be a defender of the righteous way.

238
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,350
It's a long journey ahead of us.

239
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,040
From the looks of it...

240
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,300
Jin Xian is really gone.

241
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,080
How much more longer is he going to keep us locked up?

242
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,920
Zhaoyao!

243
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,790
Don't be scared.

244
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,980
We didn't do anything bad, they wouldn't give us a hard time.

245
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,460
We just need to pay some fees to get free.

246
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,200
If you don't have money, I will pay for it.

247
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,760
Pay with your big head.

248
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,410
Forget that she lived off you and lied to you. You even got locked up here.

249
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,810
You still want to pay her fees?

250
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,800
You are fox enchantress who deserves to die.

251
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,390
The money you owe our family,

252
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,820
- pay it back!
- Mother!

253
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,170
After all, fate brought us together.

254
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:44,030
Fate?

255
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:51,120
How about this? Help me to pay for the fees first. When we get out, I will sign the divorce papers.

256
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,950
I will find someone to do good deeds for me and return the money I owe you.

257
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,370
Don't worry, I don't want others to owe me.

258
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,730
Naturally, I also don't want to be in other people's debt.

259
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,020
Get out? It's such a big world out there, how can I find you?

260
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,410
Then, what do you want to do?

261
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,280
Don't sign the divorce papers yet. Return the money first.

262
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,870
I need the marriage license in order to find you again.

263
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,640
That will do.

264
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
Hey, two of you...

265
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,590
Once you pay the fees, you can be released. Stay locked up for a few more days if you don't have money.

266
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,970
We have it. She is still my wife.

267
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,680
Put her fees on my account.

268
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,540
- Please release all of us.
- Please release us.

269
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,190
Release us.

270
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,380
Thank you, prison guard.

271
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,280
Miss Lu!

272
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,370
Miss Lu!

273
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,610
What's your name?

274
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,930
I'm Cao Ning, first name Mingfeng.

275
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,970
Wait for it. I'll find people to do good deeds for you.

276
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,680
I'll clear all those debts with you.

277
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,450
Miss Lu!

278
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,700
Actually, it's okay even if these debts aren't paid.

279
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,790
I'll speak to my mother myself.

280
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,900
Also, even if you don't sign this paper...

281
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,390
No, green book (divorce papers) needs to be signed, the money also needs to be returned, I won't miss a single coin.

282
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,550
I have someone else I want to marry.

283
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,970
Just that before this, can you help me with one more thing?

284
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,420
Wh-What?

285
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,560
Can you lend me some more money?

286
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,840
You're awake.

287
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,540
Ah Rong...

288
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,160
Chenlan, you need to quietly recuperate right now.

289
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,690
Ah Rong, do you know the Land of Sojourn?

290
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,560
Land of Sojourn?

291
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:46,280
I heard it was a secret place. Regardless of your status and powers,

292
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,200
it only accepts those who have fate to go there.

293
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,590
Although there are rumors in Jianghu,

294
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,020
but most are hearsay.

295
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,470
Most are just to embellish the story.

296
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,520
Those who personally have gone and seen,

297
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,610
are very few.

298
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,420
Are there any methods for me to enter the Land of Sojourn?

299
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,570
You think Zhaoyao went to the Land of Sojourn?

300
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,590
But this Land of Sojourn only allows those who are fated.

301
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,620
Yet on this world, only fate

302
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,800
is something you can't obtain by your efforts.

303
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:36,460
You should relax, perhaps we'll hear from her in a few days.

304
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,540
I can wait for anything, except for anything about her.

305
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,320
She better be safe and sound in Land of Sojourn,

306
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,700
or else, even if I have to go to the Ninth Heaven (highest heaven),

307
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,330
and dive into Nine Springs (underworld), I'll find her.

308
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,890
You want to use the Ninth Heaven Skill?

309
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,330
Absolutely not.

310
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,540
Ninth Heaven Skill extensively consumes one's state of mind.

311
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,040
With your current state, if you use Ninth Heaven Skill,

312
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,010
you'll barely escape from death!

313
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,730
Ah Rong, no one else understands.

314
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,590
Do you also not understand?

315
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,740
We've been fellow apprentices for many years.

316
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,600
Although you were born in the sect, how many times

317
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,560
we talked all night, your feelings toward Zhaoyao,

318
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,760
how can I not understand?

319
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,480
But today,

320
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,170
if you use Ninth Heaven Skill to find her,

321
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,600
that's risking your life!

322
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,010
How can you ask me to just watch you do that?

323
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,960
I'm sorry, Ah Rong.

324
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,730
I shouldn't have worried you with this issue.

325
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,130
But it concerns her, so I have no choice.

326
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,370
Boss, I want to see my previous life.

327
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,020
100,000 coins.

328
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,720
It's that expensive?!

329
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,350
If you think it's expensive, you don't have to see it.

330
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,090
Yes, I'll see it.

331
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,320
Shopkeeper, I'll pay.

332
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,140
You'll pay?

333
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,140
Thank you.

334
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,670
Don't be scared. I'll take you away.

335
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:30,260
♫  Near the candle flame someone's tears flow like rain ♫

336
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:36,830
♫  Raise the cup to your slight sorrow, in drunk memories  ♫

337
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:42,750
We'll call you Mo Qing. Mo Qing, Mo Qing. It rolls off the tongue and easy to remember!

338
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,320
- Mo Qing.
- How is it? Do you like it?

339
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:53,630
♫  Close my eyes, the face in the mind is the same  ♫

340
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:00,960
♫  When butterflies and flowers fly, swords are swayed like lightning  ♫

341
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,280
♫  But the figure resembles a young swallow  ♫

342
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,340
♫  Endless night, flickering wind, dawn will bring a new rebirth ♫

343
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,560
Was it from that time,

344
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,030
Little Monster started...

345
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:36,280
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

346
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,360
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

347
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,790
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

348
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,870
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

349
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:57,190
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

350
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:04,800
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

351
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:12,190
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

352
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:19,800
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

353
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:30,980
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

354
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:51,320
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

355
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,320
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

356
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,750
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

357
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,830
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

358
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:12,350
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

359
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:19,730
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

360
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:27,140
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

361
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:34,740
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

362
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:42,200
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

363
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:49,770
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

364
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:57,320
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

365
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:04,780
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

366
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:16,000
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
