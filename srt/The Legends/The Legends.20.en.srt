00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,840
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,800
Is it really because of the Wanjun Sword?

4
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,350
Ah Rong.

5
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,610
Ah Rong, you are awake.

6
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,330
Yuezhu...

7
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,840
Yuezhu, I'll gather the tools and repair you later.

8
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,390
It's all right. Don't worry about me. It doesn't hurt.

9
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,060
East Hill Master.

10
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,370
- Help me up.
- Yes.

11
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,270
What is it?

12
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,150
We received a letter from Jiangzhou City.

13
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,220
- I got it.
- Yes.

14
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,760
Ah Rong, who's the sender?

15
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,520
It's from Rain View Sect.

16
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,140
Another letter for South Hill Master?

17
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,300
But he never writes back.

18
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,900
He has a reason for not writing back.

19
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,390
There's a reason behind every obsession in this world.

20
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,050
When you can't forgive and can't let go, you'll be in agony.

21
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,890
When you can forgive but can't let go, you'll also be in agony.

22
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,560
It's all right. I'll buy some candies for you.

23
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,730
Ah Rong, tell me a story.

24
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,820
Where did we get to last time?

25
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,640
Little Pig's kite got stuck on a tree...
(Note: in Chinese "Pig" is "Zhu")

26
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,640
and Little Horse retrieved it for her.
(Note: in Chinese "Horse" is "Ma")

27
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,560
What happened after that? How did they become friends?

28
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,250
Remember to look meaner later.

29
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,640
Don't worry, Miss.

30
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,140
We're famous for our acting. It'll definitely look real.

31
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,900
We're just worried about hurting you.

32
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,280
Don't worry. You won't have to take responsibility for that.

33
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,770
If you do a good job, I'll hire you guys again the next time.

34
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,390
All right.

35
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,060
Get ready. He's coming.

36
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,810
Let's go.

37
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,370
- It's you.
- Stop right there!

38
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,980
Stop! Don't run!

39
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,690
- What's going on?
- This is South Moon Order's business!

40
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,380
You should know your place and stay out of our way!

41
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,550
This is my friend.

42
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,560
I actually do need to mind her business.

43
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,930
So you want it the hard way? Go, brothers!

44
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,990
Leave.

45
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,850
Try this.

46
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,520
You're a pretty good cook.

47
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,290
If you like it, I can cook for you every day. What do you think?

48
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,550
I thought you went back to South Moon Order. Did you get chased out by them again?

49
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,530
My master sent me to kill someone, but I don't want to do that. So I fled.

50
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,830
Ah Rong, you saved me twice.

51
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,700
Since I have nowhere to go now,

52
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,160
why don't you do me one more favor and let me stay here?

53
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,370
And then?

54
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,920
Did Little Horse take in Little Pig?

55
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,090
He did.

56
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,710
I knew it.

57
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,560
I bet Little Horse slowly falls in love with Little Pig. Right?

58
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,750
Yes, he did fall in love.

59
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,180
If Little Horse realizes that Little Pig has been lying to him,

60
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,600
what will happen then?

61
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,640
The truth is, Little Horse

62
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,560
knew that she was lying to him all along.

63
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,420
But even though he knew that she had a secret...

64
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,120
and that she did all those things on purpose,

65
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,220
he couldn't help... still wanting to get close to her.

66
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,590
Eventually, he was the one that got trapped.

67
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,010
That's all for today.

68
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,570
I've looked it up on many manuals. The magic power that my father was practicing

69
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,570
wouldn't render him unconscious for so long. What exactly is the reason?

70
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,330
That's the case, Revered One.

71
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,020
Did you contact him again?

72
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,280
Revered One, he's a man with a bad temper.

73
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,130
He said he doesn't want to have contact with us anymore.

74
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,570
We sent two men to talk to him. He killed one

75
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,360
and released the other to return here.

76
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,100
What are Aunt and Deacon Chi planning?

77
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,180
Why haven't they mentioned anything previously?

78
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,310
Revered One, to lure Qin Zhiyan to Jianxin Sect,

79
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,550
we'll just have to make it known that Qin Yu is here.

80
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,400
We don't have to go through so much trouble to contact Yuan Jie.

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,750
If the word gets out that Qin Yu is in our Jianxin Sect,

82
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,740
imagine Qin Zhiyan not coming, while Qin Qianxian coming first.

83
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,750
How would you deal with him?

84
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,740
Since Qin Zhiyan is the one we want to bait, the news should reach Qin Zhiyan alone.

85
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,790
But now, Wan Lu Sect is on guard.

86
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,130
Li Chenlan killed all the spies I sent.

87
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,770
Qin Zhiyan is also protected by the Dark Guards.

88
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,130
If we want the news to reach her alone,

89
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,750
Yuan Jie is the best candidate for the job.

90
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,160
Who is there?

91
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,030
It's probably just the wind. Let's go.

92
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,760
If we lure Qin Zhiyan here and capture her,

93
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,360
Li Chenlan will surely show up. Once he attacks our Jianxin Sect,

94
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,760
then he'll be the one breaking the peace in Jianghu.

95
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,920
Once the peace is broken,

96
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,040
I will have a reason to hold a Grand Meeting.

97
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,570
Liu Wei is already under my Manipulation Technique.

98
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,370
By then, I will use him to force Qin Qianxian to contribute his blood.

99
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,830
There shouldn't be a problem.

100
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,730
Once I obtain Qin Qianxian's blood, you will be awake.

101
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,740
Once the Gold Deity returns,

102
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,060
our glory will be restored to the righteous sects.

103
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,120
I need to go to Wan Lu Sect to warn Zhiyan.

104
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,340
I was just saying that this child came back at a bad time.

105
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,650
Hill Master, will Jianxin Sect seek revenge on us for killing their men?

106
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,150
I don't know what that widow

107
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,020
Liu Suruo is planning exactly.

108
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,530
But since she came to me, she must want something from me.

109
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,340
I'd like to find out what she's up to.

110
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,960
Does it have something to do with Sect Leader Li Chenlan?

111
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,990
I heard that Sect Leader went to Jiangzhou not long ago.

112
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,080
After that, he summoned Gu Hanguang for treatment.

113
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,250
It must be a severe injury.

114
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,780
That's Jiang Wu's deed.

115
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,340
Jianxin Sect has nothing to do with it.

116
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,830
That widow in Jianxin Sect...

117
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,190
must be targeting Qin Zhiyan.

118
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,830
As for Li Chenlan, I'll go and check on him.

119
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,570
If he is severely injured,

120
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,520
the master's seat he is on...

121
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,810
needs to be switched to a new owner.

122
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,340
Three, four.

123
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,110
Demoness, Li Chenlan hasn't come to see you in so many days.

124
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,920
Are you sure you don't want to apologize to him?

125
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,340
When can the two of you make up?

126
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,820
What's the matter? Do you miss Li Chenlan?

127
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,110
As I said, if you want to apologize, do it yourself.

128
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,120
I didn't make him angry.

129
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,800
Besides, you said something so mean.

130
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Don't you feel guilty at all?

131
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,340
Did I forget to tell you to come to my place today to change the dressing...

132
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,510
or did you intentionally...

133
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,750
Why is it like this?

134
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,430
Your injury isn't easy to treat at all.

135
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,660
You rarely hold a brush.

136
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,130
What are you writing?

137
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,440
I haven't heard from Little Beauty for many days. I'm writing a letter to her.

138
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,300
Ah Wu, I'll say something you won't like to hear.

139
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,660
In my honest opinion, Qin Zhiyan was just trying to buy time.

140
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,140
Maybe she doesn't really...

141
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,280
I know what she's thinking.

142
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,200
I like her witty ways.

143
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,820
The two of you give me some suggestions.

144
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,620
What should I write...

145
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,220
to make myself look cool and impressive

146
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,120
while expressing my fondness for her

147
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,760
without sounding desperate?

148
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,960
Writing a letter is so hard. It's harder than killing people.

149
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,400
If you want it to be less obvious,

150
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,410
why don't you write poems?

151
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,160
Don't women from the Immortal Sects love those things?

152
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,810
Poems? Come here and write one.

153
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,040
Lin Ziyu, I have something important to discuss with the Sect Leader.

154
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,630
Sect Leader is training in isolation. He ordered us to leave him alone for three days.

155
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,730
North Hill Master, please come back on another day.

156
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,170
Lin Ziyu, you have gotten in my way several times...

157
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,070
and I can forgive you for that.

158
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,280
But this time, I've urgent business on hand.

159
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,990
If you don't let me pass,

160
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,180
I'll have to be rude.

161
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,490
The Dark Guards only obey the Sect Leader. I'm following orders.

162
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,390
What's the ruckus outside?

163
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,920
If you insist on intruding,

164
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,990
- Someone wants you dead.
-...we'll have to be rude!

165
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,930
Your injury comes with lightning lesions because of the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

166
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,000
Now, there's another dark energy coming out of your wounds.

167
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Explain. What's going on?

168
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,470
I don't know the actual cause,

169
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,950
but I believe your injury is related to your Wanjun Sword.

170
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,210
If you want to live longer, stop using the sword...

171
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,460
and recuperate properly for a month.

172
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,600
The days I'm living are stolen. I dare not consider the future.

173
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,150
If I save him again, I'll chop off my hand!

174
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
What's so urgent, North Hill Master?

175
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,590
Sect Leader, I recently investigated and found out

176
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,080
the Immortal Sect led by Jianxin Sect

177
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,100
seems to be plotting against our Wan Lu Sect.

178
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,590
What kind of plotting?

179
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm still investigating the specifics.

180
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,070
What kind of urgent business is this?

181
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
Sect Leader, I recently found out

182
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,110
you were injured due to matters related to Qin Zhiyan.

183
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,240
I am very worried. Qin Zhiyan is a disciple of the Immortal Sect.

184
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,860
Ever since she came to Wan Lu Sect, the Immortal Sect has been on the move. I'm afraid...

185
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,330
No worries, I will handle the Immortal Sect.

186
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,800
Although Qin Zhiyan was a member of the Immortal Sect, she is now my disciple.

187
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,650
Do not talk about things in the past. This is my last warning.

188
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,700
All right. Since the Sect Leader wants it this way,

189
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,290
that's it. I'll take leave.

190
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,560
You can go back to your work.

191
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,790
Yes.

192
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,400
Sect Leader!

193
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,740
Is there something else?

194
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,570
There have been many things happening lately, please take good care of yourself.

195
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,280
Hill Master, you are back.

196
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,270
What is this?

197
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,580
It's a letter from West Hill Master.

198
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,090
It was sent from the Rain View Sect.

199
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,900
It's not yet time to send the medicine this month,

200
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,300
why is the Rain View Sect sending a letter?

201
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,650
I am very grateful for your continued care for so many years.

202
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,710
Today, an expert examined my pulse,

203
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,050
studied your prescription, and gave a few suggestions. The expert said

204
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,040
if he were to provide a prescription,

205
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,580
he would set two coins less of pipewort and three coins more of glossy privet fruits,

206
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,650
that way the medicinal effect would improve. Hereby writing

207
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,130
to report it to my benefactor, in the hopes that it may be considered.

208
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,590
Why is she listening to a quack's nonsense?

209
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,550
Hill Master...

210
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,520
[Cleanse Dust Palace]

211
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,500
Letter for Little Beauty!

212
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,760
That kid really sent me a letter?

213
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,290
"That kid." Which kid?

214
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,030
New Mountain's Jiang Wu.

215
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,220
You... You're really planning to cooperate as an insider?

216
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,200
Open and read it.

217
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,370
Little Beauty, it's been many days since we've seen each other, I miss you.

218
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,700
I've written a poem below as a representation of my feelings.

219
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,670
"Gray clouds fill the sky, the rain falls like silk."

220
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,330
"Missing you like the lightning that streaks across the sky."

221
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,620
What is he saying?

222
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,040
It's probably that he misses you.

223
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,500
You can understand him, you respond to him.

224
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,810
Don't tell him anything. Just brush over it and make him happy.

225
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,540
Oh, all right.

226
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,970
[Rain View Sect]

227
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,550
Palace Leader, he's responded!

228
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,400
What?

229
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,950
That mysterious person responded.

230
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,510
Do not listen to the quack's nonsense.

231
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,060
The prescription is already the most effective, it cannot be changed.

232
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,920
All these years of exchanging medicine and letters, he's never replied.

233
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,310
His reply this time was certainly in competition with the Xu Zong Sect Leader.

234
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,520
He must be someone who is very confident in his medical skills.

235
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,860
The messenger is still outside. Will you respond? We can have him take it back.

236
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,220
I won't respond to this letter.

237
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,260
He must have been angry when he wrote this. If I reply,

238
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,420
he might find us nosy and bothersome.

239
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,370
- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

240
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,420
One's writing reflects one's character. It seems like

241
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,120
he is a critical person.

242
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,050
[Rain View Sect]

243
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,240
[Let's not write love letters or poems, with this plain paper I express my feelings. Feelings can be read this way or that, missing you whichever way. ]

244
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,030
Ah Wu.

245
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,300
Look!

246
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,350
Little Beauty replied?

247
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,890
"Let's not write love letters or poems.

248
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,980
With this..."

249
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,760
How do you read this?

250
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,740
Plain paper.

251
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,310
"Plain paper I express my feelings.

252
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:25,280
Feelings can be read this way or that,

253
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,930
missing you whichever way."

254
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,620
What does this mean?

255
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,660
Probably telling you not to worry, she won't disappoint you.

256
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,830
No other meaning?

257
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,290
Probably... nothing else.

258
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,230
So many words and just that one meaning?

259
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,990
Little Beauty is even more indirect than me.

260
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,180
Miss Zhiyan's embroidery of this duck is nice.

261
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,160
You like it? I'll give it to you then.

262
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,960
Really?

263
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,550
I'm already sick of this kind of game.

264
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,460
If she keeps playing around with me,

265
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,700
then she's not taking me seriously.

266
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,290
Sect Leader.

267
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,740
[Little Beauty (...) see you at the waterfall.]

268
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,230
Why are you here?

269
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,110
Don't tell me it was you who's been writing back to me?

270
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,950
So what if it was me?

271
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,050
You're so disgusting!

272
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,310
You impersonated her and wrote romantic poems! Are you sick?

273
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,900
What of it?

274
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,380
I got it now.

275
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,050
You're worried that Little Beauty might fall head over heels for me and run off with me.

276
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:52,400
So, you used that despicable method to stop me.

277
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,730
Are you worried that Little Beauty will go with me in the end?

278
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:02,560
She won't care for you anymore. You're jealous and angry, but you dare not confront her.

279
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,600
So you started sending romantic poems to me.

280
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,980
Or maybe... I'm the one you like.

281
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,830
I know you want to kill me now.

282
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,480
But I'm just a shell puppet. Even if you kill me, it's useless.

283
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,270
Let's make a bet.

284
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,760
No betting.

285
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,970
Li Chenlan.

286
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,010
You are a pervert.

287
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,530
Yes.

288
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,150
Hill Master, Jianxin Sect's messenger came again today.

289
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,900
This is the letter.

290
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,250
What's the letter about?

291
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,830
A problem that has been bothering me.

292
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,130
These sly foxes of the Immortal Sects...

293
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,160
Demoness,

294
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,470
why did you want to come out with me today?

295
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,280
I went to the Land of Sojourn to check my account yesterday. My money is increasing too slowly.

296
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,060
So, I decided to monitor you today and see if you're doing your task properly.

297
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,840
- Please help us.
- Demoness!

298
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,960
I work so hard every day to do good deeds for you.

299
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,250
How can you wrong me like this?

300
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,340
Miss Zhiyan? Miss Zhiyan, you're back again.

301
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,040
You have the heart of Buddha; wind and rain can't stop you.

302
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,190
No, no. I just saw that although it's warm during the day,

303
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,640
it is still very cold at night so I brought some more clothes,

304
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,860
- to prevent the cold.
- Thank you, Lady!

305
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,030
No need to thank me! Just remember,

306
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,530
I'm doing good deeds for Lu Zhaoyao.

307
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,130
Thank you, Miss Zhiyan!

308
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,180
- Thank you!
- This is for you, take it.

309
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,470
Grandma, let me help you.

310
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,890
- Sister, goodbye.
- Do you need to go there?

311
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,140
I'll take you over there.

312
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,370
- Thank you.
- Let me help you.

313
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,060
Let's go slowly.

314
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,740
She is indeed genuine and dedicated.

315
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,680
She's almost Shunan village's live goddess.

316
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,010
It is not easy to meet North Hill Master.

317
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,840
Before this, there were some misunderstandings between North Hill Master and Revered Changyu.

318
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,120
I came to explain.

319
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,900
I am willing to join hands with you,

320
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,430
only to overthrow Li Chenlan.

321
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,560
Our exchange is just to benefit each other. There's no friendship.

322
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,180
If we meet again the next time, it will still be a battle to the death.

323
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,130
What do you want?

324
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,390
We just want North Hill Master to bring a letter to Qin Zhiyan.

325
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:33,350
Qin Zhiyan was a member of the Immortal Sect. North Hill Master probably also thinks she should come back.

326
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,280
And now, Li Chenlan is smitten with Qin Zhiyan.

327
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,160
If we can lure her back to Jianxin Sect...

328
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,220
You want to kill Li Chenlan at Jianxin Sect?

329
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,240
Although we can't guarantee to the killing of Li Chenlan,

330
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,560
to severely injure him is not difficult.

331
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,120
As for what happens after that, it's up to North Hill Master.

332
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,820
Qin Zhiyan will not go to Jianxin Sect.

333
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:06,090
That's our problem. North Hill Master just needs to deliver the letter.

334
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,010
All right.

335
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,740
[Cleanse Dust Palace]

336
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,430
[To Qin Zhiyan]

337
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,850
Why would Yuan Jie come to Cleanse Dust Palace?

338
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,110
I don't know. Should we report this to Sect Leader?

339
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,000
- There is no need for now.
- But Captain...

340
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,640
Yes.

341
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,970
Ah Wu.

342
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,750
You're not writing a letter to the girl on Chenji Mountain today?

343
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,950
Not writing anymore. Even if I did, it'd fall into the hands of that pervert.
