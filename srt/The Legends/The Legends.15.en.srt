3
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
Enough!

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
All of you listen.

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,000
We, the Dark Guards, obey the sect leader only.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
The captain can be anyone.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,400
From now on, you are not to comment on this matter privately. You can't disappoint Sect Leader again.

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Do you guys know?

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,300
Yes, Captain!

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
You guys may leave.

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Xiao Ai, is there something else?

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sister Ziyu, the young man from the Immortal Sect who escaped from the dungeons a few days ago,

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
I heard he's Qin Zhiyan's fiancé.

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
He's also the young master of Jianxin Sect.

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm afraid that Qin Zhiyan's and his motive isn't that simple.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
Let's go to Shunan Village and have a look.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,620
The temperature dropped significantly this month.

19
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,280
The cold air can easily enter one's body.

20
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Rain View House was built by the water.

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,500
We have to be extra careful.

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
An Si,

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,700
follow this prescription and take it to Rain View House.

24
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,800
All right.

25
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,510
Sect Leader.

26
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,390
What kind of injury is troubling Sect Leader Li to come and find me?

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
A small injury.

28
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,800
You would come and find me for only a small injury?

29
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Sect Leader Li, you're so amazing. You call this a small injury?

30
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
You're quite good at enduring.

31
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,600
You should come and be my lab rat and let me test my medicine on you.

32
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,000
Look at what you've become.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,200
What kind of femme fatale did you get yourself involved with?

34
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,100
- If it was Shen Qianjin, what would you do?
- You...

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
How long have you known that woman from the Immortal Sect?

36
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,700
Qianjin and I are different.

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,160
If it was calculated by time...

38
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,500
Forget it. This isn't something that should be calculated by time.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,100
I'll treat you up to here today. Come back tomorrow.

40
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,800
Remember, that during this period you are not to use your powers.

41
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,500
It's all right if you die but don't ruin my reputation.

42
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

43
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
If you have someone you care for then you'll have a weakness.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,900
You're the leader of the Wan Lu Sect. You cannot have a weakness.

45
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
She's my only weakness

46
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,400
and the reason for my strength.

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
You never learn anything,

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,200
yet you learned to be a deeply affectionate man.

49
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
God is merciless.

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,700

Why is there a slight change to the medicine flavor today?

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
The person who sent the medicine said the weather is a bit humid lately,

54
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
so his master added a few more ingredients.

55
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,200
Thank him for his hard work and effort.

56
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,600
I am grateful for your care these past few years. I want to express my deepest gratitude.

- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

Back from Liuhe Tianyi Immortal Island, you came straight to save me.

69
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You must be tired.

70

Master, why are you still working? Why aren't you resting? You haven't slept for many days.

It's fine. It's not troublesome to work.

72
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
It's not as exhausting as catching up with others.

73

Let's go. Come back to Wan Lu Sect with me.

74

Wait.

I haven't seen Uncle in a long time, I want to catch up with him.

They're relatives! He really loves her so much that he's lost his mind.

80
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,590
But let's let it pass. After all, the Liuhe Tianyi Sword is in his hands.

81
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,000
- Master.
- You were captured by Jiang Wu. How did Qin Qianxian know where you were?

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,600
I caught an opportunity to notify him.

83
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,700
You didn't ask for the Wan Lu Sect's people?

84
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,300
Forget it. It was my negligence.

Master, my heart hurts.

I thought I was going to be taken away and I'd never see you again.

Say it.

96

When you came to save me,

97
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,300
you looked so powerful and handsome.

98
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,300
You were full of righteousness, ready to shake Heaven and hell.

99
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,200
Master, when you came, in my heart and eyes,

100
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,000
it was like a god coming from my dreams treading on dust.

101
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,200
You saved me from iron and fire, filling me with fascination.

102
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,800
I know that in this world, there's nothing else that can threaten your position.

103
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,000
There's only that pesky Lu Zhaoyao who lingers around; she's the thorn in your eye, isn't she?

104
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
A thorn in my eye?

105
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
That's right. I do good deeds for Lu Zhaoyao because I want to be on good terms with her.

106
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,200
I can find out how she intends to harm you.

107
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
This way, I can protect you, Master.

108
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Then, how does she intend to harm me?

109
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
She initially didn't intend to harm you.

110
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,600
But a while ago, you took Wanjun Sword to her grave to show off.

111
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
She just wants to seek you for revenge now.

112
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,600
But then she found out you removed all her previous formations,

113
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
removed all those altars and pillars.

114
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,500
So she wanted to come back and reclaim the sect leader position.

115
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
Tell Lu Zhaoyao on my behalf,

116
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,400
that if she can return, I'll offer this sect leader position

117
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
back to her with both hands outstretched.

118

You're injured?

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Are you worried about me?

121
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,800
I was worried,

122
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,200
but you're so powerful. There probably isn't anything that can harm you in this world.

123
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Master, do you want to compete?

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Compete?

125
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,400
I'll use the Liuhe Tianyi Sword, and you'll use the Wanjun Sword.

126
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Let's compete.

127
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,500
A real and serious competition.

128
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,300
Master, can you really defeat me without using Wanjun Sword?

129
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,540
Let's go.

164
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,800
Go where?

165
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
To Jiangzhou.

166
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
What?

167
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,160
You lack a matching sword scabbard.

168
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,400
Wait...

169
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,200
- This...
- They are gone!

[Pure Wave Palace]

171
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,300
- Where is he?
- He...

172
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,800
Where is he?

173
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,600
Where is Sect Leader?

174
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,180
He didn't come back.

175
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Where did he go?

176
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
I don't know.

177
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
Forget it. If he won't listen to a physician's words, it's better for him to just die.

178
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,500
Is Sect Leader badly injured?

179
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,600
South Hill Master, do you really not care?

180
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
South Hill Master. South Hill Master!

181
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,050
South Hill Master!

182
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
What kind of injury does Sect Leader have?

183
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
I don't know.

184
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,700
Why do you not know anything?

185
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Forget it, forget it.

186
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,800
I can't blame you for this. Ever since Miss Zhiyan came...

187
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,000
What is happening?

188
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Where is he?

189
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,400
Let's go.

190
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Who is here?

191
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,000
The young master of Jianxin Sect is still in the mood to sit here in meditation.

192
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,600
Did you know that Qin Zhiyan, who has a marriage agreement with you, has left Wan Lu Sect?

193
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
Zhiyan?

194
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,170
Where is Zhiyan?

195
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,400
She's in Jiangzhou.

196
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Quickly find her and take her away.

197
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,000
Wan Lu Sect is not a place for the two of you to stay.

198
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
Wait.

199
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,300
A bearer of gossip is nothing but a busybody.

200
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,900
What is your motive?

201
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
You just need to know what you should do and that's enough.

202
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,100
No need to ask about anything else.

203
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,190
Look at that sword! It's so pretty!

204
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,950
You're right.

205
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,090
You can easily tell that it's a precious sword.

206
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,970
There are so many people!

207
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,390
- Grilled skewers!
- This Jiangzhou is so lively!

208
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,030
Hurry and come! Have a taste!

209
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,810
Grilled skewers!

[Sima Residence]

211
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,150
This wooden figurine is quite agile.

212
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,640
Hello, who are you looking for?

213
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,740
Sima Rong, tell him Li Chenlan is here.

214
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,440
What's up? You know him?

215
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,490
No, I don't know him.

216
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,140
How could I not know him?

217
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,520
Sima Rong, my West Hill Master who managed all the intelligence.

218
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,670
He was my true right-hand man.

219
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,580
He lives here?

220
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,130
I didn't even know that.

221
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,500
How did his legs get broken? Who did it?

222
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,120
Chenlan, how did you have time to come?

223
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,620
What? Chenlan?

224
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,030
He called him so intimately!

225
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,490
When did their relationship become so close?

226
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,940
How come I didn't know?

227
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,770
I need your help making a sword scabbard.

228
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,720
Sword scabbard?

229
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,560
It's over, it's over. My West Hill Master no longer manages intelligence and is now a blacksmith?

230
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,450
Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

231
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,990
May I take a look at it?

232
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,540
All right.

233
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,750
Oh.

234
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,650
What's this situation?

235
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,620
My West Hill Master learned mechanisms here,

236
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,540
and started doing blacksmith work?

237
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,490
How did his legs get broken?

238
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,830
Perhaps someone broke them?

239
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,000
This is a serious matter.

240
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,470
Someone broke my right-hand man's legs.

241
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,340
That means someone broke one of my fingers.

242
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,090
This is indeed the legendary Sword of Heaven.

243
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,590
Of ten parts of sword spirit, it bears three parts of murderous energy,

244
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,700
three parts of soul energy,

245
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,140
and several portions of righteous energy.

246
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,780
It definitely lives up to its reputation.

247
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,810
I remember...

248
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,110
Zhaoyao mentioned this sword in the past.

249
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,270
But she considered the road to the Immortal island too far and getting the sword too time-consuming.

250
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,150
So she never tried.

251
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,950
And now that you've retrieved this sword

252
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,660
and kept it within Wan Lu Sect,

253
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,220
consider it as fulfilling her wishes.

254
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,610
That's right. This is...

255
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,970
My disciple. The sword was retrieved for her.

256
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,230
Turns out you retrieved it for someone else.

257
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,260
But that's the right thing to do. This great sword

258
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,610
would be wasted if it was just stored.

259
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,190
Come in and talk.

260
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,360
I was bored so I made them for fun,

261
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,590
to sooth the feeling of missing the past. You're all dismissed.

262
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,390
If you miss Chenji Mountain, you can just come back.

263
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,070
The position of West Hill Master has always been reserved for you.

264
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,050
No, even if I missed it there,

265
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,830
what I can't leave behind is here.

266
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,610
Furthermore, I stayed at Mount Chenji to repay Zhaoyao's kindness.

267
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,490
Now that Zhaoyao is no longer there,

268
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't have another reason to stay there.

269
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,100
You're managing Wan Lu Sect very well.

270
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,290
With my disability, it is not convenient for me to move around.

271
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,730
One day, even when you ascend to the royal palace, I'm afraid I won't be able to come.

272
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,420
I'll congratulate you here in advance.

273
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,360
It's just a rumor.

274
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,520
Tell me. What kind of sword scabbard do you want me to make?

275
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,150
After all, I was in mechanics for a few years; if I make you a scabbard,

276
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,260
it shouldn't disappoint you.

277
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,330
Sima Rong, Sima Rong.

278
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,890
You won't disappoint me by making a sword scabbard,

279
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,600
but why did you disappoint me as the West Hill Master?

280
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,730
With me gone you didn't fight at all?

281
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,020
With the love and care I gave you before,

282
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,530
with your reputation and prestige in Wan Lu Sect,

283
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,760
you didn't think about dragging Little Monster down and becoming the Sect Leader yourself?

284
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,230
You should take a look at Jiang Wu, an outsider.

285
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,740
He's even more ambitious than you.

286
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,700
I have things to discuss with West Hill Master. You're dismissed.

287
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,210
Okay, Master.

288
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,400
It's rare for you to bring a girl to my place.

289
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,270
Who is she?

290
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,310
If I said she's Zhaoyao, would you believe it?

291
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,420
She... is Zhaoyao?

292
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,400
But she's not entirely Lu Zhaoyao.

293
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,370
What do you mean?

294
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,080
I can only say she sometimes is,

295
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,680
or that she is at night.

296
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,900
Ah Rong, do you think that in this world

297
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,530
there is such a thing as being revived in a new body?

298
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
Matters of ghosts are nothing but an illusion. They can't be taken for real.

299
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,000
Matters of ghosts are nothing but an illusion?

300
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,620
What about a demon essence?

301
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,900
Demon essence? You mean, the "Inner Demons" in Jianghu's rumors?

302
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,590
No.

303
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,910
In this world, whoever pulls out Liuhe Tianyi Sword

304
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,160
can take it away. Except for you.

305
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,360
Demon essence is in your heart.

306
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,130
This matter of "inner demon"... It's not the first time I've heard about it.

307
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,640
Jianghu rumored that back then Qin Qianxian, because of Zhaoyao,

308
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,750
harbored an inner demon.

309
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,530
You can't believe Jianghu rumors.

310
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,610
Let's not even talk about Lu Zhaoyao.

311
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,950
Over the years, the rumors about us have also been numerous.

312
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,360
That's right. You and I, you and Hanguang.

313
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,020
Even ones about you and Yuan Jie, they're all nonsense.

314
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,590
I've heard many of them.

315
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:32,730
Yet, these Jianghu rumors may be as groundless as wind and shadows, and may not be taken seriously;

316
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,150
but out of ten, there is still one part truth in it.

317
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,150
It needs careful digging.

318
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,990
Many rumors are not at all just hollow tales.

319
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,810
About this matter of the demon essence,

320
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,770
when the time is right, I will ask Pavilion Master Qin about it.

321
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,090
But a while ago you and Qin Qianxian sent an expedition after Jiang Wu.

322
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,920
Did you discover something after being in contact with him?

323
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,930
Qin Qianxian is indeed what people say. He does not care about worldly affairs.

324
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,550
But he is very decisive.

325
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,500
In killing resolve, he's second to no one.

326
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,320
Furthermore, Zhaoyao is a bit afraid of him.

327
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,400
Zhoayao is afraid of him?

328
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,420
Can Lu Zhaoyao be afraid of someone?

329
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,000
Maybe it's because he's good looking.

[Jianxin Sect]

331
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,600
Revered One, this horse is old in age.

332
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,300
I'm afraid it can't be healed.

333
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,400
If it can't be healed,

334
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,000
I will have to kill you and find another person to cure it.

335
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,500
Revered One, spare my life!

336
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,900
Spare my life.

337
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,210
Let me ask you one last time.

338
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,400
Can you cure it?

339
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
Yes, I can.

340
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,350
I can.

341
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,930
Revered One...

342
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,300
Brother.

343
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
I've prepared all the scrolls from the Heavenly Sects in our study.

344
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,000
You've worked hard.

345
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
If we check the history of every sect's and school's fighting power,

346
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,200
could this be of help in Qin Yu's case?

347
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,880
Brother Qin Yu's case

348
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,000
has yielded no leads nor do I have any clues.

349
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,400
We only know what Zhiyan said, that his blood was sucked dry.

350
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,200
But his body is nowhere to be found so it is hard for us to determine.

351
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,400
We can only start investigating from here.

352
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Brother, you've worked hard.

353
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,400
Have you heard from Cangling?

354
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,600
I heard that Cangling was recently spotted near Wan Lu Sect.

355
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,000
I've already sent people to search.

356
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Wan Lu Sect? This child really spares me no worry!

357
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,300
I'm going to capture him myself.

358
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,000
Brother, Cangling's whereabouts are still uncertain.

359
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,400
It's not too late to go when your body's recovered.

360
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,950
Suruo,

361
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,800
I feel like you've recently had a lot on your mind.

362
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,000
If you're too tired, just let go of Jianxin Sect's affairs and rest for some time.

363
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,980
Brother, do you feel that I'm not managing appropriately?

364
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,700
How can that be?

365
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,650
I just see you with a lot on your mind.

366
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,860
It's because Windchaser is ill.

367
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,700
I'm a bit worried.

368
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,410
So many years have passed. Windchaser grew old, too.

369
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,000
Rest well, Brother. I'll take my leave.

370
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,180
Go.

371

[Thousand Dust Pavillion]

372
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,200
Pavilion Master.

373
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,900
Suyan, have your wounds recovered?

374
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,800
Thank you for your concern, I feel better now.

375
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,400
The Jianxin Sect Leader Liu sent a secret invitation

376
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,300
to meet you out at the Sushan maze today at 3/4 past chou hour
(Note: 2:30 am)

377
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,100
Sect Leader Liu? Did he say what it is about?

378
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,000
The letter did not mention, but it was sent secretly.

379
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,800
I didn't see the paper. I only saw a streak of spiritual energy in front of me.

380
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,200
After revealing the content of the letter, the energy disappeared.

381
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,800
Okay, I'll go meet with him.

382
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,200
Pavilion Master, could this be a trap?

383
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,900
If it were a trap, Leader Liu would not invite me to the Sushan Maze.

384
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,600
Perhaps, he's discovered clues regarding Qin Yu's death.

385
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
If he behaves thusly, it is because he has his own reasons that can't be revealed.

386
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Pavilion Master, please be careful.

387
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,400
Mingxuan, Windchaser is ill.

388
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,840
It's very ill.

389
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,800
It probably doesn't have much time left.

390
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,710
I hope it can hang on until you wake up.

391
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,620
Liu Wei seems to know something.

392
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,120
My brother is good in every aspect,

393
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,600
except that he's too old-fashioned.

394
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,300
He doesn't know how to be flexible.

395
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,200
And he was too close to Qin Yu.

396
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,990
He was under the control of the Manipulation Technique.

397
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,500
It might harm his body.

398
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,190
I really don't want to do that.

399
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,800
But I can't wait any longer.

400
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,400
Don't worry.

401
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
As long as you can wake up,

402
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,700
I'll try any kind of method.

403
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,200
Actually, not knowing anything,

404
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,300
not remembering anything,

405
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,400
is also pretty good.

406
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,770
Revered One.

407
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,400
What is it?

408
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,100
I've just been informed that Qin Zhiyan was carried away by Jiang Wu of New Mountain.

409
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,000
When Qin Qianxian went to her rescue, he ran into Li Chenlan.

410
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,100
They joined forces and saved Qin Zhiyan.

411
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,900
Who would have thought

412
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
that Qin Zhiyan, a little fledgling of a girl,

413
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,900
actually obtained the warm favors of the Demon King's Son.

414
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,050
I've underestimated her.

415
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,000
But who is this Jiang Wu from New Mountain?

416
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
He's the rising leader of the New Mountain Sect.

417
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,600
I heard he's ruthless and unpredictable.

418
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,200
He killed the previous sect leader and took over.

419
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Someone who requires both Qin Qianxian and Li Chenlan to join forces to deal with,

420
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
he must really have some skills.

421
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,170
Deacon Chi,

422
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,000
send more men and keep a close eye on Qin Qianxian's movements.

423
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,400
Yes.

424
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,800
Right now, we even need to keep a close eye on our own people.

425
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,240
