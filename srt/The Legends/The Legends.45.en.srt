Mo Qing!

4
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,720
Stop right there!

5
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,090
Li Chenlan! You stop right there!

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,310
I want you to stop! Did you hear me?

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,340
Why are you running?

8
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,480
Did you already know that... you were affected by evil vapor?

9
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,540
Were you planning to hide it from me forever?

10
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,440
I didn't want to hide it from you.

11
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,210
I just...

12
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,310
I just didn't know how to tell you.

13
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,440
What is there between us... that can't be talked about?

14
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,990
This feeling is like...

15
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,300
when I had the blue mark on my face.

16
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,470
It makes me feel ugly.

17
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,610
I was afraid that you would leave me behind.

18
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,640
Very often, even though you're just standing right before me,

19
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,220
I'll still feel like I'll lose you anytime.

20
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,450
Mo Qing!

21
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,200
Remember this.

22
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,540
I'll never leave you again.

23
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,600
Even if it's the end of the world, you must still remember that.

24
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,530
Understand?

25
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,870
Ah Wu, you were the one helping Lu Zhaoyao to get the Liuhe Tianyi Sword back.

26
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,820
But because of Li Chenlan's intervention, now you're the one that gets the blame.

27
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,770
Now that Li Chenlan is injured, everything you did for her won't impress her anymore.

28
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,710
Shut up, both of you!

29
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,100
Very annoying.

30
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,680
Ah Wu, I must say this even if it annoys you.

31
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,060
You've no idea that we're ostracized in the Wan Lu Sect.

32
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,550
They treat us as outsiders.

33
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,080
Our men can still bear with it,

34
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,140
but you're one of the sect leaders!

35
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,520
Yet, they only report to Li Chenlan.

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,280
We didn't get any benefit from this situation at all.

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,990
Xiao En is right.

38
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,750
Ah Wu, even though Lu Zhaoyao is powerless just like you,

39
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,460
at least everyone in the Wan Lu Sect does acknowledge her.

40
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,160
That's right.

41
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,750
We've nothing much to do with the Wan Lu Sect.

42
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,520
Why don't we just return to New Mountain?

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,290
We're free to do whatever we like there. It's so good.

44
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,780
- Not good.
- Which part isn't good?

45
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,620
Here, I get to see Lu Zhaoyao every day.

46
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,780
Do I get to see her at New Mountain?

47
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,600
You're putting up with them here just for Lu Zhaoyao?

48
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes! Just so I can see Lu Zhaoyao.

49

Enough. The two of you don't meddle in.

Lin Ziyu of the Wan Lu Sect is asking to see you.

52
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,620
What is she coming here for?

53
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,120
Lin Ziyu claimed that she is here about the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

54

You want to use the Liuhe Tianyi Sword so to stay with the Immortal Sects?

The Liuhe Tianyi Sword is my bargaining chip.

In this collaboration, while you know my stake, but I don't know your actual plan.

You said that you plan to join hands with Jin Xiu and that you're just waiting for an opportunity.

I just want to know exactly who is giving you the opportunity that you are waiting for.

Miss Lin, why are you guessing in such a manner?

Everyone covets the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

77

I can see that Jin Xiu wants it, too.

162
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,240
On this... we haven't reached results yet.

163
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,510
But don't be anxious!

164
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,220
Tell us your requirements, we'll start researching immediately.

165
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,260
You can come back when we have an outcome; isn't that just fine?

166
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,940
Fine.

167
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,490
Wait a minute.

168
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,670
We have never heard about Demon Essence.

169
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,310
But... we have a person here who is well-traveled and of wide experience.

170
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,200
He might know.

171
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,360
Boss, this young sir is looking for you.

172
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,200
My name is Li Chenlan.

173
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,100
I once asked you for directions, Old Sir.

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Oh right! Look at my memory. You looked familiar.

175
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,820
Come, sit.

176
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,240
Sit.

177
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,670
Pour some wine.

178
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,630
Young Lord,

179
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,880
this sword is a good sword.

180
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,870
It's called Wanjun.

181
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,020
Have you seen it before?

182
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,400
Wanjun?

183
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,790
I can't remember... Here, let's drink.

184
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,590
This wine of mine can't be bought with 1,000 gold pieces.

185
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,820
Could it be that you dislike it?

186
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,990
It's not like that.

187
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,600
Only, I heard that if one eats too many things in the Land of Sojourn they can't leave the land again.

188
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,110
There's still someone waiting for me outside.

189
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,840
Such a familiar phrase... who said it?

190
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,500
Zhaoyao.

191
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,750
Right, Zhaoyao also said that.

192
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,800
It's only one cup of wine. It can't imprison you.

193
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,940
Brother-in-Law,

194
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,480
our boss's Remembrance Wine and Oblivion Tea are subliminal in the Land of Sojourn.

195
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,930
Don't turn down his kindness.

196
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,260
Remembrance Wine... Oblivion Tea...

197
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,460
By the names, they sound like they can make one remember the past or forget a lifetime.

198
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,960
What is the past? What is a lifetime?

199
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,990
After living long in the Land of Sojourn,

200
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,910
all past events pass with the wind.

201
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,070
Everything will be forgotten.

202
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,190
Remembering again is just like a fantasy.

203
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,790
Wait until I come back!

204
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,000
This wine is magical.

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,070
Wine seeks the right person.

206
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,090
If you like it, drink some more.

207
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,080
Waiter, bring another pot of wine!

208
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,670
Coming!

209
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,220
What are you here for?

210
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,820
Have you ever heard of Demon Essence?

211
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,000
Why are asking about that?

212
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,780
To tell you honestly, I've been recently disturbed with Demon Essence.

213
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,160
If you had come to me a few years earlier, perhaps I could have told you more.

214
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,660
Right now, I just remember that

215
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,400
there used to be two people that got rid of their Demon Essence.

216
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,710
One of them was called Qin Qianxian.

217
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,150
The other...

218
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,730
the other one...

219
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,400
I don't remember.

220
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,940
I think that the people around him called him the Demon King.

221
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,120
Son, I have no other way. I can only imprison you here.

222
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,760
Don't be scared.

223
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,510
Stay put here. Wait for me.

224
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,760
Wait until I come back.

225
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,240
Father...

226
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,460
- Wait until I come back!
- Father!

227
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,720
The Demon King...

228
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,130
Who made you mad?

229
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,180
Who else could it be? Jianghu's physician!

230
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,080
Just because he holds three needles, he looks down on everyone in the world.

231
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,280
Did you already know the fact that Mo Qing had Demon Essence inside him?

232
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
He mentioned it to me.

233
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,680
As expected, this Ugly Monster conceals everything from me.

234
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,050
Chenlan only wanted me to look for a solution for his Demon Essence.

235
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,380
Did you find it?

236
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,490
For now, we only know that the Xu Zong Sect Leader gave Pavilion Leader Qin an herb to help him expel the Demon Essence.

237
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,560
What herb? I'll go ask for it. If they don't lend it, I'll buy.

238
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,870
The name's unknown.

239
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,680
But it must certainly be precious to be gifted by the previous Leader of the Xu Zong Sect.

240
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,470
I think that Hanguang should know something about it.

241
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,520
But...

242
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,300
I knew this brat was hiding something from me!

243
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,960
West Hill Master...

244
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,410
Fine, I'll go.

245
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,670
[Xu Zong Sect]

246
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,710
Master.

247
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,730
Was the medicine for Jin Xian taken?

248
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,850
Yes.

249
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,950
Today is Jin Xian any better?

250
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,030
Much better than previously.

251
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,250
Oh right, Master. Today, Jin Xian suddenly asked me a question.

252
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,150
What did he ask you?

253
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,020
He asked whether our Xu Zong Sect's secret art has any connection with Sect Leader's family's clan.

254
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,620
Did you tell him every detail?

255
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,220
Yes!

256
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,920
Master, don't be angry. Jin Xian said

257
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,390
he wanted to see whether he could help Sect Leader

258
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,250
overcome your family's illness and repay your kindness.

259
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,110
Enough. What is said, is already said.

260
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,510
Sooner or later he'd have learned anyway.

261
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,920
You're dismissed.

262
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,520
Yes.

263
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,090
Here comes the spokesperson again.

264
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,380
Though it was Zhaoyao who sent me, I do have something to talk about.

265
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,070
You don't need to say it. I know what you came for.

266
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,210
I can't beat you with words,

267
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,100
I'll just tell you plainly:

268
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,300
I won't give treatment for Li Chenlan's Demon Essence.

269
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,930
Is it because of that herb in the Xu Zong Sect...

270
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,300
is hard to ask for?

271
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,300
How do you know about that herb?

272
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,320
Pavillion Leader Qin mentioned it to me when he was still conscious.

273
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,380
Senior, in the future, I want to be the best healer in the world.

274
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,290
I'll make everyone escape King Yama's grasp.

275
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,300
Junior, you have high ambition.

276
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,870
But my aspiration is not so great.

277
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,610
My aspiration is just to manage and produce the genuine Rebirth,

278
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,890
to make my father and myself live beyond age 30.

279
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,040
Don't worry, I will help produce Rebirth together with you, Senior.

280
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,920
This Rebirth requires 30 years to bloom.

281
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,050
One plant only has 2 stalks.

282
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,460
The previous Master cultivated this herb.

283
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,990
One plant was for personal use; but it had no effect.

284
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,240
The other plant was gifted to Qin Qianxian.

285
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,060
Pavillion Leader once said that when he cast out his Demon Essence

286
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,390
he relied entirely on the herb donated by the previous Xu Zong Sect Leader.

287
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,720
For this year's medicine contest, Jiang He granted me a stalk of Rebirth.

288
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,540
I've used it to cure Li Chenlan.

289
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,970
How else do you think he could have recovered?

290
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,020
Now, Li Chenlan's Demon Essence has only worsened.

291
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,760
But my senior brother is 30 already. His life is at a critical stage.

292
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,460
If you make me go to him at such a time,

293
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,060
it's not asking for medicine, but pressing him to die.

294
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,310
How do you expect me to agree?

295
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,680
So it's like this.

296
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,940
Suppressing Chenlan's Demon Essence now seems to be extremely dangerous.

297
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,200
If it isn't treated in time, I'm afraid he can't take it.

298
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:01,180
As long as he follows his doctor's advice, I guarantee he can make it safely until the next plant of Rebirth blooms.

299
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,820
The next plant of Rebirth?

300
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,300
You mean that you can grow a new Rebirth?

301
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,940
Five years.

302
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,380
I only need 5 years. And then I can grow the next plant of Rebirth.

303
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,710
What else do you think I'm doing, bustling in the dispensary every day?

304
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,380
Go back and tell Lu Zhaoyao.

305
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,210
If he obediently does as I say, I will help him solve his problem with the Demon Essence.

306
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,870
All right.

307
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,260
This matter completely depends on you.

308
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,820
I'll humbly toast you once more, Jin Xian.

309
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,930
I had not thought in my remaining years, I could have rendered a service to Jin Xian.

310
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,650
This is truly an honor for our Xu Zong Sect.

311
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,110
Sect Leader Jiang, this is far from the truth.

312
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,940
I could be rescued by the Xu Zong Sect at a time of misfortune.

313
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,130
Were I to die the cruelest death in promise to repay you, it wouldn't be enough.

314
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,150
No need to repay.

315
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,380
Anyway, I can't live long.

316
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,350
Sect Leader Jiang, there's no need to be so pessimistic.

317
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,250
You haven't reached the great limit of 30 years, yet.

318
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,430
There's still a margin to recover everything.

319
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,570
I've stopped giving importance to live long ago.

320
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,840
And I don't know how my ancestors came to have this heavenly strength.

321
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,410
Fortunately, I have no sons.

322
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:57,140
I'll just let this cursed fate end with myself.

323
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,270
I'll have no chance to use this heavenly strength.

324
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,310
No chance to use it!

325
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,230
- Ah Wu.
- I'm not dead, yet. You want to bury me already?

326
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,090
Ah Wu, come! Have a drink.

327
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,720
After searching so long, have you found it?

328
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,210
Then, why are you eating and drinking?

329
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,620
It's not that, Ah Wu. What's written in these books is not clear.

330
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,920
All those "ere, 'tis, sayeth"... I'm at a loss from just looking at them.

331
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,020
You're really useless. In the end, it's still up to me.

332
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,310
You've come up with an idea?

333
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,820
I understood one thing!

334
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,950
Lu Zhaoyao doesn't love me now because she's already in love with Li Chenlan.

335
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,110
If I want her to fall for me,

336
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,920
I must first destroy her love for Li Chenlan.

337
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,550
Got it?

338
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,970
Listening to you, it does make sense.

339
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,830
What do you want to do?

340
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,920
Come, come.

341
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,020
We'll do it like this...

342
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,910
[Library Pavillion]

343
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,430
I remember back when I was Sect Leader there weren't so many affairs to deal with.

344
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,690
How come now that it's you, there are so many things to do?

345
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,450
- Sect Leader.
- There's more?

346
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,310
Mo Qing, you rest a bit.

347
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,990
Leave these other ones to me.

348
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,120
Sect Leader, you are at ease letting Sect Leader to take care of those matters?

349
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,190
For now, pass on these orders.

350
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,320
We'll see about the rest later.

351
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,920
Yes.

352
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,290
Take care of these documents.

353
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,710
Documents?

354
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,320
All of these are the Wan Lu Sect's daily business. Learn how to deal with them.

355
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,520
Why should I learn to deal with them?

356
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,610
To relieve Mo Qing of some responsibility.

357
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,610
So you're giving this responsibility to me?

358
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,810
The Wan Lu Sect doesn't keep freeloaders.

359
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,750
Your power isn't getting anything done.

360
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,260
If I let you out, you can't fight.

361
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,590
If you don't learn to tend to business, do you want to be kicked out as a freeloader?

362
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
All right.

363
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,190
The grain harvest this Autumn was 20%. The total number was 60 tons.

364
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,440
The total demand of provisions per Hill in the Wan Lu Sect seems to be even higher...

365
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,550
Then, what do we do about that?

366
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,480
Do as you please.

367
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,510
This says that the cattle in the meadows turned in 150 head,

368
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,910
but now we are still five months away from the end of the year and the beginning of Spring.

369
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:38,280
In the meantime, excluding daily consumption amounting to 80 heads, we have 70 heads left.

370
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,510
If we divide that for the use of each Hill, it's 35 heads.

371
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,550
Then, if we also have to leave the ones used for plowing next Spring, that's 60 heads more.

372
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,760
It's still not enough!

373
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,490
Seventy-three...

374
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,960
Thirty-five...

375
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,400
Just do as you please!

376
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,880
Demoness, this...

377
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,210
What did I tell you to do? I told you to deal with it,

378
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,060
not ask me every question!

379
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,220
But Li Chenlan already took care of these...

380
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,550
I really don't know how you became the Sect Leader.

381
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,100
By my martial arts.

382
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,360
Do you want to try it out?

383
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,310
Hurry up, everyone! Don't dawdle.

384
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,600
Pack all you have to take away. Don't leave anything behind!

385
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,630
- What's the fuss out there?
- Sect Leader!

386
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,090
Sect Leader!

387
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,310
The bunch from New Mountain are packing up now!

388
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,280
- What?
- What?

389
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,760
They're finally leaving!

390
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,730
Little Niece, I'm so happy!

391
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,920
Quick! Put the stuff down!

392
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,150
Xiao En, what are you all doing here?

393
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,420
Here. Lend a hand.

394
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,190
Ah Wu has had enough playing around.

395
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,380
We're going to go back to Fengmo Mountain.

396
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,910
What? You're leaving just like that?

397
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,870
When are you setting out?

398
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,460
Tonight.

399
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:08,150
Right, Ah Wu wants to say farewell to you at the Mountain Gate, Sect Leader Lu.

400
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,640
Why doesn't he tell me personally?

401
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,460
His feelings are hurt right now.

402
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,050
He feels that after he went through all the pain to get the power and he used it to save you, Sect Leader Lu,

403
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,740
In the end, Li Chenlan took advantage of it. It's such a pity.

404
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,290
Fine.

405
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,300
Consider it Lu Zhaoyao's failure to Little Red Hair.

406
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,330
And it's a wonder he came to terms with it.

407
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,440
If he's decided to leave; of course, I'll have to say a farewell with him.

408
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,690
Not only me, but the whole Wan Lu Sect can also do so.

409
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,330
Just forget it the whole Wan Lu Sect.

410
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,410
After all most of them are casual acquaintances

411
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,480
with little friendship.

412
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,090
Rather, Sect Leader Lu, you can come and say goodbye by yourself.

413
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,390
Ah Wu said that in the entire Wan Lu Sect, he only likes seeing you.

414
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,670
Now, we're all leaving. Don't make it difficult for him.

415
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,420
Deal.

416
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,520
Ah Da, you're dismissed.

417
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,780
Sect Leader, this brat has malicious intentions. You have to guard yourself.

418
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,090
Even if I'm harboring malicious intentions,

419
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,520
- what can you do?
- You!

420
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,890
It's fine, go ahead.

421
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,340
Yes, Sect Leader.

422
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,470
If you have anything to say, hurry up.

423
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,260
It's nothing really.

424
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,500
But there's some stuff I have to spell out for you.

425
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,520
Between you and me, is there anything we didn't spell out?

426
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,400
Lu Zhaoyao!

427
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,960
Li Chenlan, right now not only are you completely powerless,

428
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,750
your Demon Essence can't be controlled either.

429
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,180
Do you really think Lu Zhaoyao isn't fed up with you?

430
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,860
She complained to me long ago

431
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,320
and said that you're too tiresome and, in general, you don't talk much,

432
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,940
you'll only sign off documents and stuff all day long.

433
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,120
Also, sometimes you think you're all that.

434
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,050
Yes, she did say she loved you.

435
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,900
But that's to repay you. Didn't you save her a few times?

436
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,380
So that's not real love.

437
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,800
- Are you done?
- No, there's more. You want to listen to some more?

438
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,560
Go away.

439
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,830
Don't get angry. Careful not to turn demonic!

440
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,150
1.75 ton grains...

441
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,980
1.25 ton...

442
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,230
You've spent all day reading these?

443
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,440
I-It's the Demoness, uh, Zhaoyao who made me read them.

444
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,440
She said to share the tasks in the sect and not be a freeloader.

445
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,340
Where's Zhaoyao?

446
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,110
Huh, she and Jiang Wu went to the Mountain Gate--

447
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,880
to say farewell.

448
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,220
Okay, I'll stop here.

449
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,730
In the future, in the whole wide world, let's not meet again.

450
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,360
Don't come and disturb us at the Wan Lu Sect if you have nothing.

451
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,720
Don't! If I think of you, I still want to come back to play with you.

452
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,460
Forget it. You'll only annoy Mo Qing.

453
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,870
It's best if we just live each our separate lives.

454
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,040
When you're back on New Mountain call a few girls and you'll forget me in no time.

455
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,300
Whether I can forget or not isn't up to you.

456
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,990
Are you really not going to consider being my woman?

457
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,950
It's so much more interesting than staying here.

458
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,960
- You're not going to consider it?
- No.

459
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,590
Come on, consider it.

460
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,660
Zhaoyao!

461
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,450
Remember, I'll think of you!

462
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,090

♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

476
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:11,560
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

477
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:19,120
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

478
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,560
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

479
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:34,050
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

480
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:41,580
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

481
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:49,080
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

482
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:56,710
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

483
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:04,190
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

484
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:14,930
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
