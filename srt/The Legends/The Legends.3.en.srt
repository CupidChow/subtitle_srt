00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,820
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,400
The wise are afraid of the source, and the fools are afraid of the outcome.

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:47,600
Mortals are blinded by false wishes, only a few can see clearly.

5
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,940
Qianxuan, you've inherited my teachings.

6
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,470
in the future, Thousand Dust Pavilion will need to rely on you.

7
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,700
Thank you, Master, for believing in me.

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,800
But right now, how should we deal with Lu Zhaoyao and the Demon King's son?

9
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,800
When the white lotus bears fruit, they are aware of their own joys and sufferings.

10
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,480
Qianxuan, if, in the future, there is an obstacle in your heart,

11
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,220
you can go to Su Mountain ice cave to meditate.

12
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:59,820
Su Mountain ice cave is the place where the leader of Thousand Dust Pavilion cultivates. I can't overstep boundaries.

13
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,540
Did they... catch up?

14
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,640
Everyone, I've heard of what happened a few days ago. This situation occurred because of me,

15
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,240
so I will first apologize to everyone here.

16
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,420
A few days ago, I alone went up to Fengmo Mountain trying to kill the Demon King's son.

17
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,200
But I fell inside the seal of Demon King Li Xiu and was severely injured.

18
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,680
I missed the chance to kill the Demon King's son and he escaped.

19
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,770
I'm ashamed.

20
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
Jin Xian, don't blame yourself. Li Xiu has always been cunning.

21
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,040
The layout of the seal was very tricky and eccentric. Insidiously sinister.

22
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,220
Jin Xian, for the sake of justice, risked his life alone.

23
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,090
This already put us to shame.

24
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,650
It's just... To be unable to kill the son of the Demon King, it really is–

25
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,020
We could have killed that little demon.

26
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,400
We just didn't expect a witless young girl to show up halfway.

27
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,550
That young girl only won because we were caught off guard,

28
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,020
and let her squeeze through the vacancies of our sects.

29
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,440
She was lucky to take the Demon King's son away.

30
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,810
That girl's moves were ruthless. I can't tell which sect she's from.

31
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,260
Ever since Li Xiu died from the people's rebellion, the Demon Sect has been like a plate of scattered sand.

32
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,540
But suddenly she showed up.

33
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,100
I'm afraid this time the Demon Sect will resurrect.

34
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,500
This Lu Zhaoyao, has nobody ever heard her name before?

35
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,790
I know of it. When I was healing my wound at Fengmo Mountain,

36
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,740
Lu Zhaoyao took care of me for a while.

37
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,890
According to my understanding of her,

38
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,720
she doesn't know the danger of the Demon King's son.

39
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,560
It was unintentional.

40
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,000
Since Lu Zhaoyao was from Fengmo Mountain,

41
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,900
presumably, she is the seal's protector on Fengmo Mountain.

42
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,540
With her position, how could she not know the danger of the Demon King's son?

43
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,460
I think she came specifically to protect him.

44
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,210
The danger she poses is probably just as significant as the Demon King's son's.

45
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,610
What Sect Leader Zhang Yu said makes sense.

46
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,410
Only, right now, our first priority is to eliminate the Demon King's son.

47
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:39,770
If Lu Zhaoyao resists, we will capture them together.

48
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,120
Capture?

49
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,780
Yes.

50
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,540
I will question Lu Zhaoyao myself.

51
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,380
Selling fish! Fresh fish! Selling fish!

52
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,280
Selling fish! Fresh fish!

53
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,980
Selling fish!

54
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,040
Look. It's that stinky boy again.

55
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,540
Watch me beat him to death today.

56
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,890
Give me warm water.

57
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,640
Okay.

58
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,280
In a bit, we'll do the same thing as last time.

59
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,360
Stinky boy, you still dare to return? You didn't get beaten enough last time?

60
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,330
We're asking you, lift up your head!

61
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,810
He killed someone!

62
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,180
He must be here to exact revenge.

63
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,480
- Don't come near!
- Don't come near!

64
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,610
Give me the food.

65
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,290
Don't come here!

66
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,000
- Here.
- What's all the noise?

67
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,280
Someone brought food for us.

68
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,900
It's sweet!

69
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,210
Here.

70
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,440
It's yummy! It's the taste I like.

71
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,500
So yummy!

72
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,910
Mingxuan.

73
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,340
Suruo, what brought you here?

74
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,410
I came to see your wound.

75
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,400
It's fine now.

76
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,830
How come I never heard you say before

77
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,770
that on the Mountain of Sealed Evil it was Lu Zhaoyao who saved you.

78
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,030
It was not an important matter.

79
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
But I rather feel

80
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,500
that towards this Lu Zhaoyao you are somewhat protective.

81
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,000
When she saved me, she took care of me every day.

82
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
I do hold some gratitude for her.

83
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,400
But as of now,

84
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,260
that Lu Zhaoyao saved the son of the Demon King

85
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,100
and also hurt so many of our sect pupils.

86
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,530
In the name of that gratitude, are you willing to spare her?

87
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Sure enough, I do not wish to kill her.

88
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,800
When she saved me she was very pure-minded,

89
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,500
not at all like a person with sinister thoughts.

90
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,000
But if she still refuses to come to her senses

91
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,600
and persists shielding the son of the Demon King, for sure I will not let her go.

92
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,800
If she brings harm to the people

93
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
and you capture her,

94
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,800
will you keep her under watch or execute her?

95
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,200
I will pull her towards good.

96
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,100
What if she doesn't lean towards good?

97
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,960
I'll kill her personally.

98
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,570
It is late. Go back and rest.

99
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Hanyue. Xinting. Go find information about Lu Zhaoyao.

100
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

101
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,300
Stop! Stop!

102
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Go.

103
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Stop!

104
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
You! Turn your head.

105
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Why would I?

106
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,100
Grab her! Don't let her run!

107
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,900
Did I say I want to run? You're the ones who should run.

108
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,200
You want to bully him again!

109
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Are you hurt?

110
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,300
Get up. Let's go.

111
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Madam, do you have wine?

112
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,100
Yes. Hold on.

113
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,200
Little Monster, what are you smiling at?

114
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,600
You're a pretty weird guy.

115
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,800
We've been traveling for days and I still don't know your name.

116
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,600
It doesn't matter if you don't tell me. I'll just pick one for you.

117
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,400
Come. Let me see...

118
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
I'll call you Mo Qing!
(Note: literally "ink blue")

119
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,800
Mo Qing... Mo Qing... It's also easy to remember.

120
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
Mo Qing.

121
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
How is it? Do you like it?

122
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
I do.

123
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,900
Here's the wine.

124
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,000
Guests, enjoy the food and drinks.

125
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
Thank you, Madam.

126
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,300
I say, little monster... huh...

127
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Little Mo Qing! In the future, if anyone wants to bully you,

128
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,400
try to fight back at least. Don't just let it happen.

129
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Fight back?

130
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Yes! Resist. Don't yield.

131
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
If people bully you, you must bully them back.

132
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Especially when you have me to back you up.

133
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Let me tell you. Next time you meet someone who wants to grab you like they did today,

134
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
you poke their eyes,

135
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,100
lock their throat, kick their crotch!

136
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,690
I'm teaching you. Did you hear?

137
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
Come! Let's try it together.

138
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Now I'll grab your neck and you lock my throat. Okay?

139
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,500
Here I come!

140
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I told you to lock my throat. Resist!

141
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,100
I... I have no way to fight you.

142
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,600
Why can't you fight me?

143
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,400
Because... it's you.

144
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,200
What about me?

145
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,700
If I wanted to kill you, you wouldn't resist then?

146
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,000
That's because I'm a good person.

147
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,200
I wouldn't kill you. But the others are different.

148
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Next time, you can't be like this; letting others take advantage of you.

149
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
You are not like the others.

150
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm especially good. Aren't I?

151
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,500
Especially good.

152
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
Here. Drink!

153
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,100
This wine's good.

154
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,100
Again.

155
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,300
One more bowl.

156
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,900
Here.

157
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,100
Fill it up.

158
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Come, bottoms up.

159
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Luo Mingxuan...

160
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,500
Luo Mingxuan...

161
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,600
Chenlan, wait for me here.

162
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,000
Wait until I go to Liuhe Island, I'll come right back for you.

163
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
Be patient.

164
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Father!

165
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Listen to me.

166
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Father! Father!

167
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
- Father...
- Wait till I come back!

168
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,400
Father!

169
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,400
Water...

170
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
What are you afraid of?

171
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Your eyes are so beautiful.

172
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,000
They look like the brightest stars.

173
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,070
Let's go.

174
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,450
Let's go!

175
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,640
Hurry.

176
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,780
What is it? Let's go!

177
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,890
Quick.

178
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,930
Come, hurry little monkeys!

179
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,840
Look!

180
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,650
Look at our clever little monkeys!

181
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,400
Good!

182
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,800
Good boy!

183
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,320
A short while ago, an extraordinary young girl appeared in Jianghu.

184
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
She alone defeated warriors from all ten immortal sects.

185
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,770
Those pretentious characters from the official sect

186
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,800
were completely overwhelmed. Serves them right!

187
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,390
Isn't that right? Ever since Lixiu died,

188
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,440
we freemen have not had anyone able to stand up to an immortal sect.

189
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
For so many years, we've let Jin Xian from an immortal sect

190
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,770
beat us like thunder, now we finally have someone to avenge us.

191
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,220
Here!

192
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,250
I'll tell you a piece of good news.

193
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,260
At present, the person those Jianghu sect affiliates want to kill is not you anymore.

194
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,620
They switched their target on me. Am I not great?

195
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,400
So, following me now would be even more dangerous for you.

196
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,670
Besides, I'm going to have to leave soon.

197
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,410
From now on, while wandering alone in Jianghu, you must be careful.

198
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,520
If you meet strong people, don't play tough; if you can't fight, run;

199
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,410
if you can't run, there's nothing wrong with yielding.

200
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,460
I'll wait for you here.

201
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,090
You can't wait for me here. I'm going to look for Luo Mingxuan.

202
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,230
Remember?

203
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,620
If you can't run, yield! Saving your life is the right thing.

204
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,820
Wh-What's the right way to yield?

205
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,420
Look.

206
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,730
Young Master, Sir, this little woman willingly admits defeat.

207
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,570
Young Master...?

208
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,470
Young Master?

209
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,020
Young Master...

210
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,650
Young Master, you have quite the pride!

211
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,650
I surrender.

212
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,200
Regarding Lu Zhaoyao, what are your plans?

213
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,350
What plans would you suggest?

214
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:17,550
This woman is abrupt and arrogant, hard and stubborn. She ought to be executed.

215
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,250
I still want to find out the whereabouts of the son of the Demon King from her.

216
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,680
What if she'd rather die than tell you?

217
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,360
She wouldn't.

218
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,420
Green fruits again?

219
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,700
Without me, you won't get any meat.

220
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,530
You're leaving?

221
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,790
Of course. I can't always stay here.

222
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,060
I have someone I need to find.

223
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,250
The person you need to find is Luo Mingxuan, right?

224
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,530
Yes! You know about him?

225
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,650
You've spoken his name while dreaming.

226
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,100
Little Monster, let me tell you.

227
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,510
Luo Mingxuan is the best man I've met in the world.

228
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:00,030
He told me I had to be a good person, that only caring for the world has meaning.

229
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,220
I know. You told me, on that night you were drunk.

230
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
I've thought about it. When I find him,

231
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,630
I'll tell him that I saved someone;

232
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,730
and in the future, I'll save even more!

233
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,630
I also want to start my own sect.

234
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,980
I want my pupils to be good to the people.

235
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,760
I'll make them farm and provide for themselves

236
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,650
and completely revolutionize people's opinion of us.

237
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,860
All right.

238
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,570
Here.

239
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,500
Then...

240
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,560
Then, can I join your sect?

241
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,910
Of course!

242
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,860
When you join my sect, I'll make you my special assistant.

243
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,180
Then, the two of us will bring benefit to the whole of Jianghu!

244
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,930
Eat!

245
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,370
Zhaoyao!

246
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,610
Zhaoyao!

247
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,630
I'm leaving. Go back!

248
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,200
Don't wait for me!

249
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,630
♫ Light through the paper window casts an oblique shadow  ♫

250
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:11,270
♫  Near the candle flame someone's tears flow like rain ♫

251
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:17,430
♫ Raise the cup to your slight sorrow, in drunk memories  ♫

252
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:23,500
♫ The outline looks like the bright moon  ♫

253
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,310
♫  Past desire looming near the surface ♫

254
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:35,980
♫ Close your eyes: the face in the mind is the same  ♫

255
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,980
♫ When butterflies and flowers fly, swords are swayed like lightning  ♫

256
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,300
♫ But the figure resembles a young swallow  ♫

257
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:52,540
♫  Midnight, flickering wind, dawn will bring a new rebirth ♫

258
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:59,300
♫ Face to North, eyes tearing up, no return  ♫

259
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,220
♫ A pot of wine in a snowstorm, brow furrowed in empty gloom, pensiveness locks the heart.  ♫

260
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,270
♫ After a thousand glasses I'm still sleepless.  ♫

261
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,730
Hold! Who's there?

262
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,870
Lu Zhaoyao. Quick, report to Luo Mingxuan

263
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,840
that I, Lu Zhaoyao, kept my promise and I came to see him.

264
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,430
Reporting to Jin Xian and to all the sect leaders. There is a woman who calls herself Lu Zhaoyao, asking to see Jin Xian.

265
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,740
Lu Zhaoyao?

266
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,370
This girl is so brazen, daring to come to the sect by herself.

267
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,290
Arrest her.

268
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,370
Let her in.

269
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,010
Yes, sir.

270
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,450
Luo Mingxuan!

271
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,800
Impudence!

272
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,650
The one I beat is here, too!

273
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,830
You don't know. These guys in your absence were bullying a kid! How shameful! Luckily, I was there!

274
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,930
Lu Zhaoyao, do you know who the youth you saved is?

275
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,170
Isn't he just a kid?

276
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,970
The son of the Demon King. Where is he now?

277
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,300
You want to kill him, too?

278
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,570
Why? He didn't do anything.

279
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,280
He hasn't done anything yet.

280
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,480
That's because he doesn't yet have the power to do evil.

281
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,420
If he's left unchecked and one day brings harm to the people, will you bear responsibility?

282
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,530
Is it what you think, too?

283
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,400
Do you want to capture and kill Mo Qing now, too?

284
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,190
Yes.

285
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,730
Yes.

286
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,540
Yes.

287
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,180
You have yet to encounter black and white, how can you differentiate good and evil?

288
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,070
Only by living to bring peace to Jianghu, our entire life can be meaningful.

289
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,430
Your eyes tell me you're a kind girl.

290
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:50,330
You can't choose your birth, but you can choose how you live.

291
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,810
Choose to be a good person, live to bring peace to Jianghu.

292
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,270
I know. I will be a good person.

293
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,680
You are so different from the Luo Mingxuan I met before.

294
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,890
You wish to leave?

295
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,310
Tell us the whereabouts of the son of the Demon King. Otherwise, you won't get to leave our Feng Mountain.

296
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,650
And yet I'm leaving. Nobody can stop me!

297
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,410
Luo Mingxuan!

298
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,770
Even on our Feng Mountain, you dare such impudence!

299
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,240
Lock her up.

300
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,760
Let me go! What right do you have to lock me up?

301
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,870
Let go of me! Luo Mingxuan!

302
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,250
So you're the one who snatched away the son of the Demon King from us.

303
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,780
"Snatched?" I took him away with my skills.

304
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,170
Silly little girl. Yet your words are so big.

305
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,830
Mingxuan generally loathes small independent wanderers like you more than anything else.

306
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:39,640
If you are clever, you should reveal quickly the location of the Demon King's son.

307
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,110
Perhaps we can still spare your life.

308
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,420
"We?" You? By what right?

309
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:57,250
By the right that I'm his future wife.

310
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:07,790
I can stand by his side, while you can only be his shackled prisoner.

311
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,470
Even if you're unwilling to reveal the location of the son of the Demon King, it is no matter.

312
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:23,040
Sooner or later we shall find him. And then we'll kill him.

313
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,750
Luo Mingxuan... Luo Mingxuan...

314
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,930
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

315
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,560
[Thousand Dust Pavilion]

316
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,540
Senior Brother, we have news from Feng Mountain. Lu Zhaoyao was caught.

317
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,300
Jin Xian has notified every sect about it, to placate them.

318
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,940
The eldest senior is discussing a matter with the master, so report this later.

319
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,520
Master.

320
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:27,560
All people meet their death. You need not mind excessively.

321
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,600
My only regret

322
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:39,080
is that I spent my life exploring the realm of perfecting the spirit,

323
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:45,640
but I still haven't comprehended its essence.

324
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,650
In this life, it will be hard to attain for me.

325
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,740
My regret

326
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,430
is now left to you.

327
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,930
Your pupil will not fail the task.

328
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:21,860
To perfect the spirit, first mend the heart, then mend the body.

329
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:32,970
Qianxuan, do not act with undue haste.

330
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,160
Your pupil understands.

331
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,910
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

332
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,880
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

333
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,360
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

334
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,460
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

335
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:00,860
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

336
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:08,370
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

337
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:15,830
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

338
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:23,370
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

339
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:34,160
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

340
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:54,940
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

341
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,860
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

342
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,370
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

343
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,400
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

344
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,880
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

345
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,360
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

346
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,810
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

347
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:38,280
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

348
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:45,870
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

349
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:53,310
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

350
00:41:53,310 --> 00:42:00,820
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

351
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:08,420
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

352
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:19,000
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
