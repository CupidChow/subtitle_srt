[Episode 1]

3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Many years ago,

4
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,600
the Demon King, Li Xiu, to unify Jianghu,

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
practiced a secret skill.

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
Carelessly, he allowed it to become demonic

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,200
and accidentally wounded his son, Li Chenlan, in the process.

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,000
The secret skill was evil. Once it entered Li Chenlan's body,

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,600
the demon essence grew day by day.

10
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,000
To prevent the demon essence from overpowering Li Chenlan,

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Li Xiu sealed his son inside a mountain

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and ordered his subordinate, Lu Shi Yi Mai, to guard the seal in the mountains.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Outsiders were not allowed to enter the mountain,

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
and those inside the mountain could not leave

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
until the day he returned.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,440
Li Xiu risked everything

17
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,200
and went overseas alone

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
to find a way to eliminate the demon essence.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,400
But he did not expect to disappear without a trace.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
The seal stayed put.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Miasmas scattered all across Fengmo Mountain, no trees or grass ever grew.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Mortals referred to this mountain as Mountain of Sealed Evil (Fengmo Mountain).

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
80, 81,

24
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,330
82, 83,

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,400
84, 85, 86,

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,200
87, 88, 89,

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
90, 91, 92,

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
93, 94,

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,800
95, 96, 97,

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
98, 99, 100!

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm so bored!

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,000
Every day is the same!

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
There's not even a mosquito to bite me.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,300
Little girl, why are you so noisy in the morning?

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Old man! Help me catch a pig!

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
I want it alive!

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Slow down!

38
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,000
Where did it go?

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
I saw it running this way.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,000
If we killed it earlier, it wouldn't be able to run.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,440
If we killed it, how could I raise it?

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,800
I just want to raise a living animal.

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,660
On this mountain, other than you, old man,

44
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,800
we rarely see any other living thing.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,400
When you die, I'll still have to be here alone.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Watch how you're speaking, you stinky girl. No respect.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Did I say something wrong?

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,200
I just want a living thing to accompany me.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
A living thing?

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Those things will die in ten, twenty years.

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a matter of time for people to be alone in this life.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,400
You must learn and experience loneliness.

53
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
I won't let myself to be lonely.

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
It's there!

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Stop! Don't run!

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,500
Stop running!

57
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,810
Stupid seal!

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Little girl, come back!

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Grandpa.

60
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Pay your respects and apologize.

61
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Pay what respects?

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Other than to not let us off the mountain, what else can this seal do?

63
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm not paying respects. I hate this seal.

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
We have an agreement.

65
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll listen to you for everything else,

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
you must listen to me on this!

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,900
- Guarding the Demon King's seal is our lifetime duty.
- Guarding the Demon King's seal is our lifetime duty.

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Why is there an echo?

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,700
I already memorized it and can recite it.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Okay now?

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Old man, this seal that we've been guarding our entire lives,

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,200
do you think the Demon King's son is really still in there?

74
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
It's been so many years.

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
If he had some power, he would've escaped

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
just like my parents.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
As long as Fengmo Mountain's seal is still intact,

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Demon King's son will not be able to escape.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Then, what has the Demon King's son been doing in there all these years?

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
Does he not eat?

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,600
Doesn't want to chat with people?

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Does he not feel uncomfortable?

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
You talk too much.

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,800
When the Demon King's son comes out, you can ask him!

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,830
Ask him?

86
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,230
Wait for me! Hey!

87
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Old man, the roast pig is ready!

88
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Didn't you say you wanted a living thing to accompany you?

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Why did you kill it in one day?

90
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,200
It's too noisy. Next time, I will raise something quiet.

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Don't blame me. Who told you to be so noisy that I couldn't sleep at night?

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,600
Why are you so picky even with what you chose to raise?

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
When I was raising you, I couldn't be picky!

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Am I a piglet?

95
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,900
The livestock was easier to raise.

96
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
What's going on, Grandpa?

97
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I think someone broke through the seal.

98
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,200
I'll go check. Don't go anywhere!

99
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Grandpa!

100
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
He ran so fast.

101
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,000
Demon King's son,

102
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,700
go and die!

103
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,200
Where... am I?

104
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,300
Someone actually broke the seal.

105
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
My family's mission...

106
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,600
has finally ended!

107
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
Greetings Zhang Yu Sect leader.

108
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Deacon Chi, no need to be so polite.

109
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Mingxuan and you went to Fengmo Mountain together. How come you came back alone?

110
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,000
You can all leave first.

111
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Yes.

112
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,200
Did something happen to him?

113
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Jin Xian and I traveled to Fengmo Mountain near Demon King's seal, but the seal's formation was too complex.

114
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,200
I couldn't go near, so Jin Xian went in alone.

115
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I waited until today. I felt the formation fall into chaos for a second, then it got strong again.

116
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,300
I couldn't go in so... so...

117
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,200
With my strength only, there was no way for me to get inside the Sealed Evil. So I came back to report this matter with you, Sect Leader,

118
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,700
hoping we can quickly come up with a plan to rescue Jin Xian.

119
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,000
How many days left till Thousand Dust Pavilion's Immortal Zi Dan comes out of seclusion?

120
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Thirteen days.

121
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
We can't wait any longer. You go prepare.

122
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
I must pay Thousand Dust Pavilion a visit.

123
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,600
No matter what, we will beg them to rescue Mingxuan.

124
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes.

125
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Mingxuan, you better be all right.

126
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Making me stay and wait here every day, I’ll become a mushroom at this rate.

127
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,300
Finally, something happens, how can I not get involved?

128
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,200
What is that thing?

129
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,440
It's a person!

130
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
What a pretty person.

131
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Don't worry.

132
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Just for your pretty face, I won't let you die like this.

133
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
I said...

134
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,600
for you to stay at home.

135
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,200
Where did you go?

136
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
I went out for a walk

137
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,200
to check if anything happened with the seal.

138
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Speaking of which, old man,

139
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
there was such a big movement today.

140
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,400
What exactly happened?

141
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,100
The Demon King's son left the mountain?

142
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,790
Let's say the Demon King's son left the mountain.

143
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,400
What are you going to do?

144
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
What am I going to do?

145
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't do anything.

146
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,410
He left.

147
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,500
I still have to live with you, Grandpa.

148
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,840
This girl certainly knows how to coax me.

149
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
I went up the mountain to check.

150
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,400
The land cow probably turned it's body over.
(There was probably just an earthquake)

151
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
It didn't affect the seal,

152
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,200
not much happened.

153
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,600
You, just stay at home at ease.

154
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Don't go messing around everywhere.

155
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Okay. Then Grandpa, if there's nothing else, I'm going to sleep.

156
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
Go.

157
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,900
Pretty person, I brought you something to eat!

158
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,610
He's still alive.

159
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
Don't blame me for not taking you somewhere better.

160
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
I don't have a choice.

161
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Yesterday, even though my grandfather said it was just the land cow turning over,

162
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,000
which land cow could turn in a way that creates a beautiful person like you?

163
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,500
It's not like the Earth deity turned over.

164
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I think it definitely had something to do with you.

165
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
I don't know who you are and I can't carry you home.

166
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
You're awake!

167
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,700
Who are you?

168
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,600
You're even prettier when you open your eyes.

169
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,700
Don't move! Your wound isn't healed so keep lying down.

170
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Who exactly are you?

171
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Why is your martial arts so advanced at such a young age?

172
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm your life savior.

173
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,000
My surname is Lu and my full name is Zhaoyao.

174
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You can call me–

175
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Lu Zhaoyao.

176
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,600
It's quite an ostentatious name.
(Note: Ostentatious is the meaning of her name, Zhaoyao)

177
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,800
My grandpa said

178
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,000
that life is short and bitter so you have to live an ostentatious life.

179
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,200
How about you? Who are you?

180
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
Why did you end up on Fengmo Mountain?

181
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Was the earthquake from yesterday related to you?

182
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I was accidentally injured so I ended up here.

183
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Luckily, I was saved by you, Miss.

184
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
I cannot repay this debt of saving my life. In the future...

185
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,100
Then you can repay me with your body!

186
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Miss, you must be joking.

187
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm being real!

188
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I've never seen someone as pretty as you.

189
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
You stay here. I'll raise you.

190
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay?

191
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,680
Thank you for your good intentions, Miss, but...

192
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
I can't agree to that.

193
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
Because I have many things to take care of,

194
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,500
I must leave once my wounds are healed.

195
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Fine.

196
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Then you need to tell me what your name is, or else what do I call you?

197
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,800
I am Luo Mingxuan.

198
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Luo Mingxuan.

199
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
Your name is pretty, too!

200
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,800
It's cold at night. If you think it's cold, then cover yourself more.

201
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
I brought you many good foods!

202
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Eat first. I'll bring more tomorrow.

203
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Rest well. I'm leaving now.

204
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Thank you so much, Miss.

205
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,160
See you tomorrow.

206
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,880
Please be merciful! Please be merciful!

207
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,220
Please be merciful!

208
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,060
Please be merciful!

209
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,010
Please be merciful!

210
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,660
Have mercy! Have mercy!

211
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,250
Mercy! Thank you!

212
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,460
You must be new. Do you know the rules in our territory?

213
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,580
- Get up. We're asking you a question.
- Can you even hear?

214
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,610
Get up!

215
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,930
What are you doing?

216
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,730
Get up!

217
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,640
So ugly! You're scaring me!

218
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,500
Give a little!

219
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,670
Here, split up all these buns amongst yourselves.

220
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,100
What are you guys doing?

221
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,400
Let me see who dares to move.

222
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,670
From now on it belongs to us, got it?!

223
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,450
Do you hear me?

224
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,090
I’m talking to you! Give it!

225
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,460
- Want to get beat?
- I don't dare again.

226
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,250
Remember this, do you hear me?!

227
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,860
Stinky brat, are you looking for your death?

228
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,070
The few of you, come over here!

229
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,140
Beat him!

230
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,040
You want our things?

231
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,970
Taking our things! Do you not want your life anymore?

232
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,110
Do you know the rules?

233
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,310
Stealing our things! Do you want to be beaten?

234
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,930
Beat him hard!

235
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,370
Beat him!

236
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,890
This kid can take a beating.

237
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,030
Today, I feel generous. I'll reward you with a dirty steamed bun.

238
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,930
Let's go.

239
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,200
I picked them on the mountain.

240
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,810
Give me one more.

241
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,860
Old man, do you think I look beautiful?

242
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,450
Beautiful or not?

243
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,940
Beautiful like your mom.

244
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,240
That's great! Don't wait for me to eat tonight.

245
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,700
Here.

246
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,680
Are you better? How do you feel? Are your wounds better?

247
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,370
Much better.

248
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,800
What's wrong?

249
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,170
Nothing. It's just that when I touch your body, my fingers feel a bit numb.

250
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,660
Is everyone outside the mountain pretty like you?

251
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,370
You've... never been outside this mountain?

252
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,220
Never been outside.

253
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,600
Do you want to see the scenery outside the mountain?

254
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,860
You can let me see the scenery outside the mountain?

255
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,550
I want to see! Want to see!

256
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,430
It's so pretty! It's beautiful!

257
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,120
How is it?

258
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,500
It's so pretty.

259
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,410
Do you like it?

260
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,490
I like it.

261
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,700
What's wrong?

262
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,600
Sorry, it's my wounds.

263
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,850
Hurry and rest. Stop using your powers.

264
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,970
You're so good.

265
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,540
In the past, we had a lot of people on the mountain. The more I grew up, the fewer people there were.

266
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,120
The ones who've left all say the people outside don't welcome us.

267
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,440
Said we're all born as demons; we're all bad people.

268
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,100
But you don't treat me as a bad person.

269
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,720
You only... have some miasma in your body.

270
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,100
It must be because you spent your life on this mountain and are affected by the miasmas here.

271
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,560
Your clansmen, too.

272
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
Is this an illness?

273
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,910
Not an illness.

274
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,160
You were just affected by the miasmas on the mountain.

275
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,110
Your character and kungfu seem to have a bit of evil.

276
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,110
I've never encountered your people before.

277
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,100
But looking now, your nature is not at all bad.

278
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,990
How do you know? What if I am a big bad person?

279
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,400
You have yet to encounter black and white. How can you differentiate good and evil?

280
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,750
Your eyes tell me, you're a kind girl.

281
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,490
Even though you can't choose your birth,

282
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,840
but you can choose how you live.

283
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,900
Choose to be a good person, live to bring peace to Jianghu.

284
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,770
Live to bring peace to Jianghu?

285
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:53,470
Only by making this choice, our entire life can be meaningful.

286
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,330
You're saying, I should choose this choice, too?

287
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,830
Of course.

288
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,890
Then if I listen to you, I can become someone like you?

289
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,600
It's not easy being someone like me.

290
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,790
Even if it's really not easy,

291
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,540
I still want to be a good person like you. The scenery outside the mountain is so pretty,

292
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,450
and the flowers and grass are pretty like you.

293
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,240
No matter how difficult, it'll be worth it!

294
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,590
Elder Senior,

295
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,200
the Zhang Yu Sect leader, along with Jin Xian's Deacon, Chi Tianming, seem to have an urgent matter to discuss with Pavilion Master.

296
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
But Pavilion Master is in seclusion.

297
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,250
It's fine. I'll see them first.

298
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,390
Jin Xiu, you've always been laid back and have never seriously cultivated your techniques.

299
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
All day long, just searching for the way to maintain youth.

300
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,500
Why do you have time today to come to Thousand Dust Pavilion?

301
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,400
The way of looking young is not a matter of importance?

302
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,600
Chi Tianming, look at your face–

303
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
Enough.

304
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,390
What matter brings Young Master Jin Xiu here today?

305
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Everyone said Thousand Dust Pavilion's first disciple was very beautiful,

306
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,400
but I have never met him.

307
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,900
Today, I made a special trip to see how pretty he really is.

308
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,000
[Thousand Dust Pavilion]

309
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,370
Greetings, Sect Leaders.

310
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,600
My master is in seclusion.

311
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,800
All of Thousand Dust Pavilion's affairs are managed by me temporarily.

312
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,400
What's the urgent matter, Sect Leader Zhang Yu?

313
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
To disturb the peace during Pavilion Master's seclusion,

314
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I know it's rude.

315
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,760
But Mingxuan is trapped inside Fengmo Mountain, and we don't know of his whereabouts.

316
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,200
I really don't have another choice.

317
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Thousand Dust Pavilion's magic is the best in the world.

318
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,000
Young Master Qin, please ask Pavilion Master to come out of seclusion.

319
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,800
Jin Xian is my benefactor, and you are being too polite.

320
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,200
But interruptions during Master's seclusion

321
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,000
will turn his power against him.

322
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Young Master Qin, the Fengmo Mountain miasmas have raised many barbarians.

323
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,200
If we don't take care of it, I'm afraid it might become a disaster.

324
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,000
There's a rumor that the Demon King sealed his son in Fengmo Mountain.

325
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Jin Xian has long been concerned. But for the stability of Jianghu,

326
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,400
we must get rid of all the remnants of the Demon King.

327
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,600
Right now, Jin Xian is in trouble.

328
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,300
As comrades of the immortal sects, how can you be indifferent?

329
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
One side is good, one side is evil.

330
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
If Sect Leader Zhang Yu trusts me,

331
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,000
I am willing to go with the other sect leaders to Fengmo Mountain.

332
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
My first disciple brother received Master's teachings along with Jin Xian's wisdom.

333
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,900
Also, his technique has reached a high level, so I'm sure he can help with your urgent matter.

334
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,000
That's good then. Thank you, Young Master Qin.

335
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
Then without delay,

336
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
let's go right–

337
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,200
I have seen him, and there's nothing special to see.

338
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,190
I won't join in on the fun.

339
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
Goodbye.

340
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,800
Oh, the bird is all better now!

341
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,100
I've brought some food!

342
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Eat with me.

343
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,600
It's fine. I've already eaten.

344
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,400
But... I can still eat a bit more.

345
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Eating more isn't necessarily good.

346
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,100
Watching you eat gives me an appetite.

347
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,800
- Tomorrow, you–
- My wounds are healed.

348
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,060
They're really healed?

349
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,650
Congrats.

350
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,280
I have to go now.

351
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,410
Outside the mountain is much more beautiful than here, right?

352
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,400
The world outside the mountain is very big, very beautiful.

353
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,600
Nanzhou Sudi green willow. Drizzling rain from the wind.

354
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,400
Setting sun of smoke in the northern wasteland. Frost and snow.

355
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,300
If you ever leave this place, you can find me at Phoenix Mountain.

356
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,400
Remember, do not give in to the demonic path.

357
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,400
You must be a just person.

358
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,800
I know.

359
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Live for the peace of Jianghu, right?

360
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,200
I will be a good person.

361
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,810
Be careful on your way, okay?

362
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
If you have time... you can come back and visit.

363
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,900
Take care.
