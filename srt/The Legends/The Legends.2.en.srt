[Episode 2]

3
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,290
Take care.

4
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,290
Luo Mingxuan!

5
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,280
Wait for me!

6
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,980
Wait for me!

7
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,110
I will definitely come and find you. Wait for me!

8
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,140
Wait for me!

9
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,050
I will definitely leave this place.

10
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,090
Old Man, what are you doing?

11
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,130
I heard from the clansmen who returned from the outside

12
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,630
that there are members from a Southern Moon Sect outside who can make living people out of wood.

13
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,100
Don't you want one?

14
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,600
I will make a living creature for you to play with for your entire life.

15
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,110
How can something made from wood be considered a living creature?

16
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,150
Old Man, I don't want anyone to keep me company anymore. I want to leave Fengmo Mountain.

17
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,870
- Leave?
- Yeah.

18
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,640
I secretly saw a glimpse of the outside world.

19
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,440
It's so beautiful!

20
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,100
Blue skies, fresh flowers, even the wind that blew over is fresh.

21
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,990
The trees outside are thick and strong, too!

22
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,950
They would definitely make a good walking cane. Much better than the one you have now.

23
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,920
I want to leave and go to a much bigger world.

24
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,890
See many more people!

25
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,320
I want to become a good person who brings prosperity to people.

26
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,010
If you want to leave Fengmo Mountain,

27
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,920
you must be able to personally break open the seal

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,260
and survive by yourself.

29
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,690
Of course, I will rely on my own ability to leave this place.

30
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,150
I am going to practice martial arts!

31
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,320
Sect Leader, this is the location where I was separated from Golden Immortal.

32
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,240
There's a seal here, we are unable to enter.

33
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,720
This is power from the ancient times; a defense spell.

34
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,690
Outsiders cannot enter, and those inside can't leave.

35
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,820
Looks like the creator of this magic spell didn't wish to meddle in worldly affairs.

36
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,830
Young Master Qian, do you have insight into what kind of spell this is?

37
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,200
This spell is quite esoteric. My ability alone is unable to break it.

38
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,690
What you mean, Young Master Qin, is that our trip today was pointless?

39
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,030
Mingxuan!

40
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,850
- Mingxuan!
- Suruo.

41
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,720
Why did the two of you come here?

42
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,490
We received no news of you these past several days. Deacon Chi and I were worried.

43
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,360
Therefore, we went to Thousand Dust Pavilion to ask Young Master Qin

44
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,960
to take us here to Fengmo Mountain, to search for the entrance to the seal.

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,210
I entered the seal of the mountain alone.

46
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,060
I indeed saw the Demon Master's son who was sealed inside.

47
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,620
Unfortunately, I was careless and was wounded by the seal,

48
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,290
allowing the Demon Master's son to escape.

49
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,890
Mingxuan, how is your wound?

50
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,440
It's fine. I only need some time to recuperate.

51
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,170
But we must not delay in searching for Demon Master's son.

52
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,880
If he grows to adulthood, he will threaten all of Jianghu.

53
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,150
We must capture and eliminate him.

54
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,040
We, of immortal sects, shall not shirk from the duty of killing the Demon King's son.

55
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,190
We just don't know what appearance this Demon King's son has. What are his characteristics?

56
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,160
The lot of us don't know how to identify him.

57
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,550
A young man who has horrible blue markings on his face.

58
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,160
All right. I shall immediately return to the immortal sects and dispatch people to search.

59
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,550
When my master comes out of training seclusion, I will definitely report this matter to him.

60
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,450
I've caused trouble for the two of you.

61
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,810
Let me take you back to Phoenix Mountain to heal your injuries.

62
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,400
What is it?

63
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,790
Nothing. Let's go.

64
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,810
This sealed place has been peaceful for a thousand years.

65
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,550
Not even a fart has been released before.

66
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,330
I never thought that after all this holding back such a big one would appear.

67
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,790
Since the Demon King's son is no longer here,

68
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,860
Zhaoyao and I do not have any reason

69
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,620
to continue staying on Fengmo Mountain.

70
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,160
But the dazzling world outside isn't that much safer than this Fengmo Mountain full of marsh gas.

71
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,990
I strongly do not wish for Zhaoyao to leave.

72
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,570
Zhaoyao resembles her mother too much:

73
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,930
passionate, impulsive.

74
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,030
I’m really afraid this child will be just like her mother back then.

75
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,950
But if I am too forceful,

76
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,650
I'm afraid I'll lose my only granddaughter.

77
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,260
The kid has grown up; just let her fly.

78
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,840
Up there! Get him!

79
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,870
He’s up ahead! Hurry and keep chasing!

80
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,030
Surrender yourself! Surrender yourself!

81
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,500
Stop!

82
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,820
Don't run!

83
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,650
Hurry and keep chasing.

84
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,690
Stop!

85
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't run!

86
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,940
- It is him.
- Take him.

87
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,110
Sect Leader.

88
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,290
Deacon Chi has urgent news to report.

89
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,450
- You may go now.
- Yes.

90
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,040
Zhang Yu Sect leader.

91
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,710
Deacon Chi, what urgent news are you reporting?

92
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,520
My disciples have caught a teenage boy who is suspected to be the Demon King's son.

93
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,210
The Golden Immortal has been meditating to recover from grave injuries since he returned.

94
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,340
I will deliver this news to him in awhile.

95
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,710
How is the Demon King's son?

96
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,820
Golden Immortal.

97
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,630
Yesterday in the forests near Fengmo Mountain, my disciples captured a teenage boy.

98
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,840
Age, appearance, and body size;

99
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,830
also, the blue scar on his face all match what Golden Immortal described.

100
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,350
Bring the teenage boy in front of the Thousand Li Mirror.

101
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,280
Yes.

102
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,720
It is him.

103
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,070
Then... will you still be making another trip to Fengmo Mountain?

104
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,830
Golden Immortal is now cultivating his energy and healing.

105
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,140
He shall soon advance to the next level. He can not travel now.

106
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,380
How about waiting until Golden Immortal completes his advancement then handling this matter?

107
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,620
You must dispatch people to watch over this youth.

108
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,280
No need.

109
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,090
The Demon King's son is the son of our Immortal Sect's nemesis. Everyone wishes to eliminate him.

110
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,950
We only need to gather all the factions of our sects together and execute him where he stands. There's no need to wait for me.

111
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,820
This important task will have to rest on your shoulders, Deacon Chi.

112
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,760
It will be my honor to complete this task faithfully.

113
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,240
In that case, we shall trouble you then, Deacon Chi.

114
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,140
Yes.

115
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,140
Mingxuan, why are you in such a hurry?

116
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,090
Isn't it better to hold the execution until you're are fully recuperated?

117
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,460
The Demon King was treacherous and sinister when he was alive.

118
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,130
His son probably is not far from that.

119
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,720
Better to make the move sooner rather than later.

120
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,450
What you said makes sense.

121
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,680
Help me to notify all the factions in the Immortal Sect.

122
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,200
They must all be present to spread our sect's glory.

123
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,700
Sect Leader.

124
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,340
Golden Immortal is still wounded, make sure his tea is not too strong.

125
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,590
The incense in the room will be lit for an hour, then extinguish it for two hours.

126
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,770
Be alert for any situations.

127
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,230
Remember not to be careless.

128
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,950
Yes.

129
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,910
Mingxuan seems strangely restless.

130
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,380
Did he encounter something on Fengmo Mountain?

131
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,280
Old Man, I won.

132
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,450
Since I've beaten you, this time I can surely crack open the seal spell.

133
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,240
If you can open it,

134
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,950
then you should go.

135
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,110
I'll go and try it right now!

136
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,770
Nothing. I can't believe that. Again.

137
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,290
It's opened.

138
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,000
It's opened.

139
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,150
So beautiful!

140
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,420
Old man, I'm going.

141
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,090
Grandfather, once I've explored enough, I will bring you back a cane.

142
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,660
Everyone, a few days ago, Deacon Chi captured Demon King's son on Fengmo Mountain.

143
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,540
He shall be executed soon.

144
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,990
Golden Immortal wishes that everyone here and the rest of the sect leaders,

145
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,800
will assist Deacon Chi in raising the reputation of the legitimate sects.

146
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,220
Golden Immortal will not be coming?

147
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,380
Golden Immortal's power will be advancing to the next level in the next few days. He can not travel around.

148
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,590
We should all share some of Golden Immortal's burden to eliminate evil from Jianghu.

149
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,860
All right. Eliminate evil from Jianghu.

150
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,950
Eldest Brother, what are your intentions?

151
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,800
It's Golden Immortal's directive. It's natural that we shall obey.

152
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,010
Young Master Qin?

153
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,090
I wonder what your thoughts are.

154
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,020
As the younger generation of Thousand Dust Pavilion, I don't dare decide for my master.

155
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,040
I shall report this development to my master today.

156
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,710
Immortal Zi Dan is someone who cares for the world in his heart.

157
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:37,490
Surely, he shall respect Golden Immortal's decision. I appreciate your efforts, Young Master Qin.

158
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,740
Outside, it really is beautiful. Beautiful mountains and clear water.

159
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,500
And the scent of flowers, too. It's so nice!

160
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,280
Come have a look!

161
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,600
Watch! Come look! Breaking a rock slate with his chest!

162
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,110
Watch! Come have a look!

163
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,220
Such cute little monkeys!

164
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,610
Our sect leader captured the Son of the Demon King. Tomorrow, they'll execute him at Fengmo Mountain.

165
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,800
The Son of the Demon King?

166
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,110
Shouldn't we seize the chance to increase our reputation?

167
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,480
You're drunk, you!

168
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,510
Our Sect leader is looking forward to killing the Demon King's son in the name of justice.
- Kill him?

169
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,060
With your skills, just keep drinking, you.

170
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,040
What are you saying?

171
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,750
What of it? Huh?

172
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,580
Am I wrong?

173
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,410
What are you guys saying? The Son of the Demon King left the mountain?

174
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,510
Why does the Sect Leader want to kill him?

175
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,920
Girl, are you new in Jianghu?

176
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,710
As a big brother, I can only give you a word of advice: With matters of the legitimate sects, you better not join in the fun.

177
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,590
- Why?
- Why?

178
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,080
The Sect Leader is determined to kill the Demon King's Son this time. If a little girl gets involved,

179
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,480
and the Sect Leader thinks you're going to save him,

180
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,230
- you're done for!
- Because he's done many wrong things, I shouldn't save him?

181
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,610
Little girl, I can't explain to you the details of this matter in a short time.

182
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,250
I'll advise you again, like an older brother.

183
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,940
When you mingle in Jianghu's matters, ponder well the situation. It's the only way to keep your life.

184
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,270
What's the point of living in surrender?

185
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,790
As long as you know good from evil and act as a good person, you can flaunt yourself a bit.

186
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,530
Where did you learn such foolish words?

187
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,020
Who are you calling a fool? When I say I'll do something, I'll do it at all costs.

188
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,070
In this fun, I'm going to take part for sure.

189
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,350
Wine– Where's the wine?

190
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,140
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

191
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,260
Son of the Demon King, wait. I'm coming to save you.

192
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,660
Master.

193
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:10,380
Your brow is furrowed. What matter troubles you?

194
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,900
Tomorrow, the sects will unite to put to death the son of the Demon King.

195
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,260
Has your heart been moved to compassion?

196
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,090
Those who have committed no evil, how can they be convicted of evil?

197
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:33,590
Good and evil are bound in cause and effect.

198
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,040
Tomorrow, you don't need to go to Fengmo Mountain.

199
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,100
Stay in your room and practice for your achievement.

200
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,620
Master, what is this for?

201
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,520
Lotus heart, caused by good intention,

202
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,930
a small carelessness will incite demons.

203
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:55,460
Former Master, forgive my selfish heart.

204
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,750
The pupil Qianxuan has extreme wisdom.

205
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:08,230
After Jinshen, he is the person who can most likely soar high.

206
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,050
I can't bear for him to be entrapped in the world of mortals.

207
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,800
If he does not meet that woman,

208
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,680
then this calamity can be kept from him.

209
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,400
Isn't he dying today?

210
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,600
Kill him

211
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,340
All convened sect fellows,

212
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,540
these have been troubled times in Jianghu.

213
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,230
After a long wait, I received Jin Xian's order

214
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,490
to arrest the son of the Demon King.

215
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,730
Today, he will be executed here

216
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,560
to deter evil in the world and return order to our Jianghu!

217
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:11,080
- Execute the son of the Demon King!
- Execute the son of the Demon King!

218
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,490
- Execute the son of the Demon King!
- Execute the son of the Demon King!

219
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,450
He should die, yes. He should

220
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,930
That's the son of the Demon King?

221
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,660
Yes.

222
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,170
Isn't he just a boy? Why is a crowd surrounding him demanding that he be killed?

223
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,620
He was born to evil magic. The son of the Demon King should just die.

224
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,820
This is also by Jin Xian's decree.

225
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,800
Who's Jin Xian?

226
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,170
You don't even know this?

227
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,590
Jin Xian Luo Mingxuan. He's a well-renowned great name in our sect.

228
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,280
Nonsense. How could Luo Mingxuan issue such a decree?

229
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,000
Then tell me. What did this boy do wrong?

230
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,780
Even if I don't know what wrong he did,

231
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,970
he's just evil. Evil should be killed.

232
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:35,100
This child's blood is an offer to our fellows.

233
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,130
- Offer to our fellows! Offer to our fellows!
- Offer to our fellows! Offer to our fellows!

234
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,610
There's so many of you bullying one boy, aren't you ashamed?

235
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,070
Where did this wench come from? What a brazen attitude!

236
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,420
And where did you come from, old man? What a bronze face!
(Note: "Bronze face" is an idiom that means that the person is bold or impudent)

237
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,100
Impudence!

238
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,600
Which sect and school are you from, girl? You must know that this act will make you an enemy of our sect.

239
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,850
I have no sect nor school. But if I want to make an enemy of you, what will you do?

240
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,780
Such a mad girl; daring to say that she will make an enemy of our sect?

241
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,950
Leaving alone all assembled masters, today,

242
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,570
if you can defeat me, you will be allowed to take him away.

243
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,040
Defeat you? Fine!

244
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,930
Don't be afraid. I'll take you away.

245
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,970
To deal with such a nameless pawn, there's no need for you to take action yourself.

246
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,460
Nameless pawn?

247
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,660
Here. Easy.

248
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,720
My name is Lu Qiong, styled Zhaoyao. Do not worry about forgetting it now.

249
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,230
In the future, the whole of Jianghu will make you remember me.

250
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,520
Wench, quell your arrogance!

251
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,180
You said if I win the fight, I can take him away.

252
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,940
I've fought everyone except you.

253
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,230
Are you fighting or not?

254
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,820
A girl with no sense of reality.

255
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,940
Who else?

256
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,570
To do what? Have you not been shamed enough?

257
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,210
Our sect holds true to its word. Since you defeated Deacon Chi,

258
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,150
we shall let the two of you leave as promised.

259
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,790
How rare. There's someone with reason here.

260
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:22,770
Only, after this day, each of our sects will spare no effort to hunt you down

261
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,400
along with this son of the Demon King.

262
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,340
Good and evil do not go hand in hand.

263
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,460
Girl, take heed for yourself.

264
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,250
My own road,

265
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,240
I'll walk myself. No need to worry.

266
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,050
How are you? I said I'll take you with me,

267
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,560
so I'll definitely take you.

268
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,880
You're the first person I have saved.

269
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,560
Let's go.

270
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,290
Go.

271
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,280
Th--

272
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
Master.

273
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,970
Every person has their mind. I have my own.

274
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:12,890
It's a good thing that you aren't deceived by vanity.

275
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,160
But the sect persists in its course,

276
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,410
the Thousand Dust Pavilion is in its midst.

277
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,090
What do you think we should do?

278
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,430
Demons are the enemy,

279
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,340
yet only those who sin are demons.

280
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,640
The orphan of the Demon King has done no evil.

281
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,880
At present, the sect persecuting him is not the right way, in truth.

282
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,920
The wise are afraid of the cause, the fools are afraid of the effect.

283
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,780
My opinion is that we should not corner and kill the son of the Demon King.
