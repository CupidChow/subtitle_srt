00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,750
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,150
North Hill Master!

4
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,840
Success and defeat are decided here.

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,870
Ever since the North Hill Master was locked in the dungeon,

6
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,470
we North Hills disciples have suffered all kinds of humiliation.

7
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,990
Now, at last, we can rise and be proud!

8
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,710
Rise and be proud! Rise and be proud!

9
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,040
Wan Lu Sect has been sitting comfortably for too long. We have been waiting for this bloodshed.

10
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,610
In the face of any trials and dangers, North Hill Master, we are at your disposal.

11
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,390
Good.

12
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,870
Captain Lin, and you?

13
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,620
At this moment, Captain Lin, will you not say anything?

14
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,960
Wasn't Captain Lin under arrest?

15
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,840
I don't know.

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,360
In the end, she's made of flesh and blood. I wonder whether Sister can get through it.

17
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,780
Captain!

18
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,090
All who have gathered here answering my call

19
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,640
are brothers who followed me for many years.

20
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,390
I, Lin Ziyu, want to attack Wan Lu Sect today.

21
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,520
This will mean risking our lives.

22
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,190
Those willing to go, follow me. Those who are hesitant or afraid

23
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,670
can leave now.

24
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,220
Captain Lin, it's true we aren't happy with that Ah Da.

25
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,610
We think he's too rigid. We only obey to you, Captain Lin.

26
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,980
But we don't have to... this... betray Wan Lu Sect... and Sect Leader Li.

27
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,830
Sorry, Captain Lin, we only want to stay out of it. We'll pretend we don't know about this matter.

28
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,940
On another day, if we stand in different positions and we cross swords,

29
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,940
then everyone will fend for themselves, each by their own skills.

30
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,990
You all, remember well! There's no turning back in life.

31
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,740
Turning back is a dead end.

32
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,740
Who else wants to leave?

33
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,200
Only at Captain Lin's command!

34
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,820
Captain Lin,

35
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,670
I'll go deal with Li Chenlan. Those two from the Immortal Sect

36
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,950
are up to you.

37
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,810
Listen well, now. We'll split the troops in two directions.

38
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,130
- You: take a squad and surround South Hill Master's courtyard.
- Yes!

39
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,700
The others will patrol all of Chenji Mountain.

40
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,140
Keep constant vigilance on the movements in Wu'e Hall.

41
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,470
Everyone, remember! If you meet any opponent,

42
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,270
- kill without mercy.
- Yes!

43
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,560
Move!

44
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,210
Yuan Jie!

45
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,780
Sooner or later they would have been against us. Killing the enemy is the way of things.

46
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,310
Let's go.

47
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,240
Good enough. Opening my eyes,

48
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,750
I still remember you.

49
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,330
But why suffer such bitter pain?

50
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,660
It isn't bitter.

51
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,100
To me, it is sweet.

52
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,040
You crippled your power. The internal damage is large.

53
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,410
In a bit, after you've drunk the medicine, I'll need to treat you with needles.

54
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,290
The process requires four hours. Can you bear it?

55
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,940
Once tasted the pain

56
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,460
of longing for love,

57
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,440
the pain of flesh

58
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
has nothing unbearable.

59
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,290
I've already acknowledged my mistake.

60
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,620
Just don't tease me anymore.

61
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,990
Wait until your wounds are healed before drinking.

62
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,570
What if the day the wounds are healed never come?

63
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,420
Brother Cangling, I'll drink a cup with you.

64
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,170
I'll drink one to you!

65
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,650
I still remember you not drinking wine. You'd pass out after one cup.

66
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,310
Since you came into Wan Lu Sect, you've changed a lot.

67
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,330
This kind of change is good,

68
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,070
or is it not?

69
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,160
Of course, it's good.

70
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,800
This way you'll get drunk.

71
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,380
Drink happily while there is wine.

72
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,000
After all, there's always wine, but drinking companions won't always be present.

73
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,550
Otherwise, on another day, people may not be there.

74
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm afraid that drinking will not even hold any taste.

75
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,110
At times of dejection in life,

76
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,610
we should be even merrier.

77
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,240
Brother Cangling, since today you wish to drink,

78
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,700
I'll keep you company until we're thoroughly drunk.

79
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,930
The last time I drank my fill, Jianxin Sect was at its peak.

80
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,250
You and I were engaged.

81
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,330
Regarding the future, I had infinite hope.

82
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,000
Yet, it seems that in the span of one night,

83
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,540
you and I became irreconcilable.

84
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,550
And here we are now, everything's gone in ruin.

85
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,370
I don't know whether I can shoulder my responsibilities,

86
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,290
nor do I know

87
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,010
how to walk my path in the future.

88
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,590
Zhiyan, aren't I useless?

89
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,650
Look at me. Look at me!

90
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,760
Jianxin Sect's foundation is still there. Over time, it will be as splendid as it used to be.

91
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,600
No need to console me.

92
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,750
The Demon-Shield Ward was smashed.

93
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,550
Not even one Baixue Jianxin Sword is left.

94
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,500
Our Jianxin Sect, founded 100 years ago, has fallen into decline in my generation.

95
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,780
How can I ever go face my forefathers?

96
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,810
Zhiyan, how did you get this?

97
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,710
That day, Brother Cangling, when you strayed in the forbidden area of Wan Lu Sect,

98
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,030
during the fight, you inadvertently left Baishui Jianxin behind.

99
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,110
Baishui Jianxin?

100
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,330
Baishui Jianxin is still here. No sword is like the Baishui Jianxin Sword.

101
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,070
Zhiyan, you've really changed a lot.

102
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,370
Have I?

103
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,920
You're mature and sensible.

104
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,700
And you understand even more how to be mindful of others.

105
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,120
I remember the last time we enjoyed the moonlight was a few months ago. We were still in Jianxin Sect.

106
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,630
Who'd have thought that in just a few months

107
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,360
so many things would have happened.

108
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,350
Thinking about the past,

109
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,960
it feels as if it all happened in a previous life.

110
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,820
[Wu'e Hall]

111
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,080
Captain, Yuan Jie ganged up with Lin Ziyu and rebelled.

112
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,630
What?

113
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,820
The Sect Leader is executing the spell now, he absolutely can't be disturbed.

114
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,700
Go assemble the troops right now, split them in two groups; one to quell the revolt,

115
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,050
one to guard Wu'e Hall. Nothing must happen to the Sect Leader!

116
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,460
Yes, Sir!

117
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,230
Captain, why would you committ such treachery?

118
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,520
Zhiyan, do you still remember when we were little,

119
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,330
the first time you and I drank wine on the sly?

120
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,950
It was so strong that you shed tears.

121
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,910
Unexpectedly, your hand slipped and tipped over the whole pot.

122
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,120
I remember.

123
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,850
I remember it was a flower liquor that my father had been treasuring for years.

124
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,080
And I spilled it to the last drop.

125
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,360
My father was so distressed,

126
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,140
but he also couldn't bear to reproach me.

127
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:56,090
Zhiyan, the things in the past have already happened, we cannot change them.

128
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,430
Let's look forward, all right?

129
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,160
The things in the past cannot be changed, sure, but we have changed.

130
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,110
Time passes and the world turns. We can never go back.

131
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,200
But what I feel for you has never changed.

132
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,320
Sister Ziyu, have you thought clearly about it? Once we step out here,

133
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,160
we'll have no way to go back.

134
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,380
I've long since lost my way back.

135
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,190
I can only follow this path and move forward step by step

136
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,930
until I get to a place where he can see me.

137
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,200
Until I'm by his side.

138
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,250
West Hill Master, forgive the offense.

139
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,320
With such a beautiful moon, why break the peace?

140
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,520
[Wu'e Hall]

141
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,800
Attack!

142
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,000
[Wu'e Hall]

143
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,710
Li Chenlan, if you have any skills,

144
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,570
bring them all out today.

145
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,130
You wish to stop me? Just you?

146
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,240
Let him come in.

147
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,480
You are all dismissed.

148
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,950
- Yes!
- Yes!

149
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,820
Li Chenlan, I'll let you die with some dignity.

150
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,400
Draw your sword.

151
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,390
Big Sister, you held through it!

152
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,520
Since ancient times, only very few people were able to use this method to leave the Land of Sojourn.

153
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,530
Miss, you are tough.

154
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,540
Just this small thing.

155
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,160
Lu Zhaoyao, is truly ostentatious.

156
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,460
Let's go.

157
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,340
You want to go now? You are still weak.

158
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,720
Don't want to rest a bit at the inn?

159
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,990
My desire to return is like that of an arrow. I can't delay it anymore.

160
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,430
I really envy the person who can make you willingly face such pain.

161
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,010
