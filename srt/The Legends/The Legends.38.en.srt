[The Legends]

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,020
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,570
Jin Xiu, have you saved Pavillion Leader Tang?

4
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,880
Deacon Chi, now there's only the two of us.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll be very frank with you.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,570
Regardless of the rest, if that Jiang Wu can help our Immortal Sect get rid of Li Chenlan

7
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,230
are you really not interested?

8
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,420
Qin Qianxian has long been a hindrance.

9
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,900
First, he opposed Jin Xian's awakening.

10
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,020
After Jin Xian awakened, the Revered Lady perished.

11
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,830
Jin Xian vanished.

12
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,070
Qin Qianxian had a part in these things, too.

13
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,190
Such a person may as well be killed.

14
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,110
If you can really get Jiang Wu to keep his word,

15
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,930
I, Chi Tianming, am willing to lend all my strength.

16
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,860
I will make him keep his word.

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,630
After Qin Qianxian dies,

18
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,630
Li Chenlan will die for sure.

19
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,800
As for Xiong Tian...

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,140
Don't worry about that. I'll talk to him myself.

21
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,040
On the day you go to Thousand Dust Pavillion, I'll send disciples after you.

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,680
But, Jin Xiu, if this fails,

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,660
your name is as good as in the mud.

24
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,310
It won't fail.

25
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,610
Sect Leader, Lin Ziyu's asking for an audience.

26
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,940
Bring her in.

27
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,790
Sect Leader.

28
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,560
- Withdraw.
- Yes.

29
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,640
I'd never have thought that it would be Captain Lin from Wan Lu Sect.

30
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,730
What brings you to the Immortal Sect?

31
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,300
I'm not the captain of the Dark Guards anymore.

32
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,380
Then, what are you here for?

33
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,810
For a deal.

34
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,220
What right do you have to make a deal with me?

35
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,190
I know all the weaknesses of the Wan Lu Sect.

36
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,620
Say, do I have a right or not?

37
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,630
Then, how do you expect me to believe you?

38
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,150
The whole world knows that I, Lin Ziyu,

39
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,510
turned on the Wan Lu Sect.

40
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,430
Among the freemen, I have nowhere else to go.

41
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,780
I think, Deacon Chi, you should understand one principle:

42
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,970
your enemy's enemy is a friend.

43
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,160
Fine. Miss Lin, you were once blind to true valor,

44
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,130
now you're willing to join our Immortal Sect; it couldn't be better.

45
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,060
Miss Lin, you mentioned a deal.

46
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,420
I wonder what you're asking for.

47
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,980
I only ask for Lu Zhaoyao to die.

48
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,600
How did you know I was here?

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,850
I smelled it.

50
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,530
Here, this is a cake for you.

51
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,980
Thank you.

52
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,470
If you feel bored, you can read, too.

53
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,730
These flowers and grass drawings are really pretty!

54
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,800
"The Diamond Hexagram

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,420
by the strength of a Buddhist master,

56
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,530
draw the force of an ancient weapon."

57
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,720
[...by the strength of a Buddhist master, draw the force of an ancient weapon.]

58
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,030
Boss, I'm here to check my account.

59
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,490
Check, check, check... You check every day, how many more coins can be there?

60
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,880
You think you, Lu Zhaoyao, can get rich overnight?

61
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,060
Look!

62
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,400
So much? It's all mine?

63
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,350
Miss, you really know how to make money.

64
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,380
Miss, if I've done something inappropriate in the past,

65
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,630
please pardon me. It was me, too blind to see greatness.

66
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,640
Miss, would you like to start a great business with me here in the Land of Sojourn?

67
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,300
To be our money shop's prime client?

68
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,580
- What can a prime client do?
- A prime client...

69
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,340
Zhaoyao, first things first.

70
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,250
I'll look for Cao Ning and break off the engagement immediately.

71
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,460
- Let's go to Empty Shop first.
- All right.

72
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,540
No... Prime Client!

73
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,070
Hey, consider that Prime Client!

74
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,450
Sister. Brother-in-Law.

75
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,920
Good morning, customers.

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,270
Have you found a remedy for the Empty Pill?

77
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,840
You two don't know...

78
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
I've devoted all the shop's energy, researching every day and night.

79
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,770
This Empty Pill Extreme Edition provides a temporary outburst of force,

80
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,860
so after use, it will absorb equivalent energy.

81
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,360
As long as you can find a huge energy source to compensate,

82
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,480
you can solve the problem of exploding.

83
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,560
So, have you found the remedy to the Empty Pill?

84
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,840
The remedy... still requires some time...

85
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,030
Give me another one.

86
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,600
I won't.

87
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,430
- Don't worry, it's not to give to you.
- Ziyou!

88
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,000
What did you buy another Empty Pill for?

89
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,220
You want to bring it back as a souvenir?

90
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,130
I'll give it to Ah Rong to check. See if there's any solution.

91
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,710
You little vixen, stop right there! Stop there!

92
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,330
You destructive enchantress! Where do you want to run?

93
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,550
I was just looking for you. I gave you back your money, yes?

94
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,990
Quick, call your son. We'll sign the divorce.

95
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,330
Call my son here...

96
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,490
My son went up to Heaven!

97
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,160
What... What divorce do you want to sign?

98
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,330
- Give me back my son!
- What do you mean, up to Heaven?

99
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,890
How do you go up to Heaven, now? If your son went up there, what's that to do with me? How will I give him back to you?

100
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,020
It's because you did those good things...

101
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,070
You did so many good deeds for my son...

102
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,920
He obtained full merits...

103
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,440
My son went up to Heaven...

104
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,860
He can't come back!

105
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,780
Doing good deeds for you people with high merit can even send you up to Heaven?

106
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,440
No one told me about this rule in the Land of Sojourn to begin with!

107
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,760
I looked on helplessly as my son went up to Heaven.

108
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,910
I looked on staring as my son flew away and disappeared...

109
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,120
My son!

110
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,150
My son! My son!

111
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,380
Son, come back!

112
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,990
Mother misses you!

113
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,670
- We're not signing the divorce anymore?
- You're a widow, now.

114
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,010
Who's there to sign it?

115
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,550
For two Empty Pills, I got myself a name as a widow!

116
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,510
- Don't remind me.
- Enchantress!

117
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,210
- Let's take shelter at Sima Rong's.
- Stop right there!

118
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,230
Give me my son back!

119
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,940
Neither you nor I can use Teleportation now. We have to take a shortcut. Let's go!

120
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,630
"Preceding the storm, wind fills the air."
(T/N: Quote from Tang poet Xu Hun, "East Tower in Xianyang")

121
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,190
I'm afraid the world will soon lose its peace.

122
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,970
Ah Rong, there's people coming out of the tree again!

123
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,640
- Ah Rong?
- Chenlan?

124
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,090
So this is the Empty Pill Extreme Edition?

125
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,630
That's the thing that blasted me.

126
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,640
Those people in the Land of Sojourn can't be relied on.

127
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,790
They only said that the solution lies in force replenishment.

128
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,760
But on how to replenish it, they have no idea.

129
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,590
Ah Rong, check it out for me.

130
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,630
See if you can find a solution.

131
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't worry; of course, I'll do my best.

132
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,300
I haven't eaten all day.

133
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,100
Little Round Face, do you have anything to eat here?

134
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,200
Yuezhu, take Zhaoyao to find something to eat.

135
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,990
Let's go.

136
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,180
Lin Ziyu went to Chi Tianming for shelter.

137
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,760
Are you certain?

138
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,620
The scouts I sent

139
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,300
were all lost there. I haven't heard from them again.

140
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,820
Lin Ziyu knows the Wan Lu Sect well.

141
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,620
She will surely find out that it was you following her;

142
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,290
hence, Jiangzhou is not safe anymore.

143
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,670
How about you bring Yuezhu along

144
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,760
and come back to the Wan Lu Sect with me?

145
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,560
But I can't bear to part with that crabapple tree in the yard.

146
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
That year...

147
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,320
Yuezhu closed her eyes just under a crabapple tree.

148
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,770
I had no time to bring her back.

149
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,080
I could only take a seed from that tree.

150
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,280
Now this crabapple tree in this yard

151
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
is the only connection I have left with her.

152
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,590
Look, this is me in Ah Rong's drawing.

153
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,060
Only... why are the ears different?

154
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,260
This is a question for Sima Rong.

155
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,730
Zhaoyao, we should go.

156
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,290
Little Round Face, see you later.

157
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,950
Miss Lin, when can you give me that map of the Wan Lu Sect?

158
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,950
It's all in my brain. Of course, Deacon Chi, you can have it whenever you need.

159
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,560
He's Sima Rong's man.

160
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,990
Each of these four Hills Masters from the Wan Lu Sect have unique skills.

161
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,030
Sima Rong, especially; he's the hardest to deal with.

162
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,130
Sima Rong is Li Chenlan's eyes and ears.

163
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,330
Let's make him blind, first.

164
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,620
Jin Xiu, did you bring any good news?

165
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,040
Chi Tianming and Xiong Tian have agreed.

166
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,200
They'll send disciples to the Thousand Dust Pavillion

167
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,560
and help in the attack to Qin Qianxian.

168
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,130
Very good.

169
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:40,270
You got what you wanted. Let Tang Yue go.

170
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,760
I hadn't thought you were a fool for love.

171
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,100
Go get her.

172
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,830
Come with me.

173
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,690
Who'd have thought that playing with people's hearts was so fun?

174
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,310
Empty gestures.

175
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,330
I considered you a friend,

176
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,930
but you have no integrity. You associated with Jiang Wu.

177
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,990
I guess I saw wrong.

178
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,500
Once you're out, go back to Qingyin Sect.

179
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,150
Don't mind the matters of Jianghu anymore.

180
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,170
What happens next

181
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,260
may make you hate me to the bones,

182
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,120
but the day will come when you'll understand.

183
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,380
This pill involves the use of magic. Always hard to break through.

184
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,730
Qin Qianxian's magic is the greatest in the world.

185
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,620
Perhaps, he has a way to solve it.

186
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,970
Yuezhu.

187
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,990
Yuezhu? What's with you?

188
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,710
Ah Rong, why did you draw me wrong?

189
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,080
My ears don't look like this at all!

190
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,160
Where did you find it?

191
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,800
In the study.

192
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,480
Put it back.

193
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,970
No way. You drew it wrong. You have to change it.

194
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
I won't. Put it back.

195
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,870
Today, I have to go to the Wan Lu Sect.

196
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,430
- Be careful at home by yourself.
- I won't be careful.

197
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,330
Done.

198
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,370
Many thanks, South Hill Master.

199
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,130
No need for ceremony. In the Wan Lu Sect,

200
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,730
it's rare to have a patient as obedient as you, Pavillion Leader Qin.

201
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,140
Come in!

202
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,900
South Hill Master, I heard that my uncle's illness was healed,

203
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,460
so I came to see him.

204
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,270
Have a chat with your uncle. I'll take my leave.

205
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,580
What are you doing here? They're having a talk between uncle and niece.

206
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,290
I came to see the Beautiful One!

207
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,080
Uncle, what plans do you have for the future?

208
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,490
I'm more or less recovered. I'll soon go back to the Thousand Dust Pavillion,

209
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,730
but I'll wait until Lu Zhaoyao is all right.

210
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,440
Uncle, can it be that for Demoness you really...

211
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,560
Absolutely nothing romantic.

212
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,670
What does it mean? So do you like Sect Leader or not?

213
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,750
But only I can like Sect Leader!

214
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,300
That Little Monster! It's enough that Sect Leader likes him.

215
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,590
But Sect Leader doesn't like you, so you can't like Sect Leader.

216
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,330
Is that clear?

217
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,370
Pavillion Leader Qin. Miss Zhiyan.

218
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,410
The West Hill Master would like a word with Pavillion Leader Qin.

219
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,340
With me?

220
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,610
Does Qin Qianxian really have a solution?

221
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,520
Pavilion Master Qin's powers have reached those of an Immortal Master.

222
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,680
If even he doesn't have a solution,

223
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,520
then there really isn't anything we can do.

224
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,740
Chenlan,

225
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,230
if the Zhaoyao that returned was a fake,

226
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,520
would you still love her?

227
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,440
I only love one Lu Zhaoyao.

228
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,170
One...

229
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,730
Indeed. There was only one, to begin with.

230
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,800
Sect Leader Li is also here.

231
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,080
Ever since we said goodbye at the Thousand Dust Pavilion, it's been a while since I last saw Pavilion Master Qin.

232
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,390
I've never expected to see West Hill Chief again,

233
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,010
even though I came to the Wan Lu Sect.

234
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,860
I wonder why West Hill Master wanted to see me.

235
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,230
This is the pill that is causing Zhaoyao to explode.

236
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,930
There are still some things I do not understand.

237
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,400
I wanted to ask for your advice. This pill originates from the Land of Sojourn.

238
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,750
There is powerful magic attached to it.

239
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,690
Has Pavilion Master Qin seen it before?

240
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,390
This is the first time I've seen something from the Land of Sojourn.

241
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,390
About what Lu Zhaoyao is experiencing, although I've never heard of it,

242
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,470
I've seen a formation in an ancient scroll in the Library Pavillion.

243
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,570
It can reconstruct blood and flesh.

244
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,690
Perhaps, it can help resolve this desperate situation.

245
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,690
I'd like to hear all the details.

246
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,750
This formation is called the Diamond Hexagram.

247
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,140
The formation requires an artifact as a guide.

248
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,250
By the power of a great Master of the Ancient Way,

249
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,570
it can draw the force of an ancient weapon.

250
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,450
Once the formation is activated, blood and flesh can be rebuilt.

251
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,990
I think, if blood and flesh are rebuilt,

252
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,360
Lu Zhaoyao's physical problems due to the pill

253
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,840
will certainly disappear.

254
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
However,

255
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,200
this formation has been lost in Jianghu for a long time.

256
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,190
I don't know whether it is true or not.

257
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,990
We can try. For the ancient weapon, we have Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

258
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,420
As for the artifact and the Master of the Ancient Way...

259
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,950
Sect Leader Li, since you wish to try,

260
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,740
I will set out today towards the Thousand Dust Pavilion and retrieve the artifact.

261
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,700
Thank you.

262
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,930
Also, this formation is exceptionally dangerous.

263
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,270
I will need Sect Leader Li's cooperation to contain the formation.

264
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,400
Of course. Of course.

265
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,750
There is one more thing

266
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,510
- that requires Pavilion Leader Qin's advice.
- Please, tell me.

267
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,020
I've heard... that Jiang Wu

268
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,630
is Pavilion Leader Qin's inner demon.

269
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,120
This is the mistake of my life.

270
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,090
May I ask, Pavilion Master Qin,

271
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,870
how did you pull out your inner demon back then?

272
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,360
Xu Zong Sect's former sect leader gifted me with a medicine,

273
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,560
to assist me in casting out my inner demon.

274
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,200
I've seen you before. You're a member of the Wan Lu Sect.

275
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,190
Where is Sima Rong?

276
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,520
He's not here.

277
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,220
No need to look anymore. The one in the picture is not you.

278
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,390
You're just a piece of wood.

279
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,360
Burn it down.

280
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,040
Ah Rong.

281
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,760
I'm Yuezhu.

282
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,790
Not a wooden Little Pig.
(T/N: Xiao Zhu = "Little Pig")

283
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,020
My picture.

284
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,700
My books.

285
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,450
Once Qin Qianxian returns

286
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,660
and Zhaoyao is better, I'll return to Jiangzhou.

287
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,060
Yuezhu is alone at home.

288
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm a bit worried.

289
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,360
Ah Rong, thank you.

290
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,880
Between the two of us, there's no need for thanks.

291
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,810
Your brotherly relationship is really nice.

292
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,160
Sect Leader!

293
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,110
Beautiful One left?

294
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,660
He left last night.

295
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,100
He didn't tell me!

296
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,600
He'll be back in a few days.

297
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,610
Demoness, really! You know Seventeen has an impatient disposition.

298
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,700
Seventeen!

299
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,860
Blaming me again?

300
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,100
Seventeen, are you all right?

301
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,440
I'm angry! Beautiful One didn't say anything and just left.

302
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,890
I don't care! I'm going to go get him back!

303
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,670
My uncle just went back to the Thousand Dust Pavilion to retrieve an artifact.

304
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,850
He'll return to the Wan Lu Sect in a few days.

305
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,470
He'll be back in a few days?

306
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,660
- Yes.
- You promise?
- I promise.

307
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,490
I'll give you one, little niece.

308
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,050
We're approximately the same age, who's your niece?

309
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,460
My seniority in the Wan Lu Sect is quite high,

310
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,570
when Little Monster was just a door guard,

311
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,430
I was already East Hill Master. You're Little Monster's disciple,

312
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,870
aren't you in the rank of my niece?

313
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,840
Sect Leader, West Hill Master's yard was set on fire last night.

314
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,650
Yuezhu!

315
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,600
- Check the surroundings.
- Yes!

316
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,900
Yuezhu!

317
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,270
Yuezhu!

318
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,650
Yuezhu,

319
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,240
I will repair you for sure.

320
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,330
Ah Rong, no need to repair me anymore.

321
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:08,770
I'm a wooden figurine. I'm not hurting. I know now.

322
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,770
I'm fake, I'm not the real Yuezhu.

323
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,360
Little Pony is you, but Little Pig
(T/N: Xiao Ma=Little Pony, Xiao Zhu= Little Pig)

324
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,710
is not me.

325
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,780
The real Yuezhu...

326
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,000
didn't have wooden ears.

327
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,550
Ah Rong, there is only one Yuezhu.

328
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,820
I don't want to be a fake.

329
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,420
Yuezhu,

330
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,670
listen to me.

331
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,070
I won't listen. My body is not hurting at all.

332
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,440
But my heart hurts a lot.

333
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,800
Just that in the future, there will no longer be any petals falling from the crabapple tree.

334
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,780
Ah Rong,

335
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,920
you must take really good care of yourself.

336
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,770
Yuezhu...

337
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,530
Yuezhu, don't worry.

338
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,760
I'll definitely find a way to repair you.

339
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,800
Is there really no way to fix this Little Round Face?

340
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,530
Let's go back to the Wan Lu Sect first.

341
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:09,100
I'm afraid I'll have to find another place to live in the future.

342
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,320
Who would do such a thing? Do you have any clues?

343
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,150
A few days ago, the spy that was sent to find Lin Ziyu didn't return.

344
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,400
It seems...

345
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,060
that we alerted the enemy.

346
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,470
Lin Ziyu?

347
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,050
We can't let her roam like this anymore.

348
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,270
Miss Lin, I heard this time you just burned Sima Rong's yard,

349
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,900
but you weren't able to kill Sima Rong.

350
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,200
I'm afraid after today, Sima Rong will return to Chenji Mountain.

351
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,330
This is a way of alerting the enemy, Miss Lin. I wonder how you'll explain it.

352
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,970
Sima Rong stayed in Jiangzhou for so many years,

353
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,450
many pieces of information and secret reports were in his yard.

354
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,950
I burned it all down; it was still quite the damage.

355
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:31,040
Good. Then when do you plan to give me the Wan Lu Sect's map of arrays and traps?

356
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,590
The map of arrays and traps are highly confidential. We can't have anything go wrong.

357
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,530
I still need a few more days.

358
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,260
I'll give you five more days. To work with us Immortal Sects, you must show some sincerity.

359
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,660
Lin Ziyu,

360
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,160
what exactly are you doing?

361
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:25,270
[Wan Lu Sect]

362
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,730
[Thousand Dust Pavilion]

363
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,510
Pavilion Master, you've traveled a long way. It's getting late. Please, have a rest.

364
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,860
Pavilion Leader taught us that the life and death of all things are predestined.

365
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,760
Why did you meddle in it today?

366
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,000
I heard you're going to hold down some kind of formation?

367
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,100
I need to nurse my body back to health fast in a few days.

368
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,900
Nurse? How will you nurse it?

369
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,830
Sima Rong, you also agree with him doing this?

370
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,660
Chenlan, in your current physical condition,

371
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,380
it's probably not suitable to cast the formation with Pavilion Leader Qin.

372
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,580
There's no one else.

373
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,500
But Hanguang's words are not without reason.

374
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,870
Recently, your body's Dark Vapor is becoming more severe and your mood is fluctuating a lot.

375
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,730
I'm worried you won't be able to hold down the formation.

376
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,090
Hold down the formation? You'll hold down your own coffin first.

377
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,440
But speaking of that, I heard from Pavilion Leader Qin

378
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,220
that Xu Zong Sect has a valuable medicine.

379
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,830
It was a great help to him when he was pulling out his inner demon.

380
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,900
Hanguang, do you know this medicine?

381
00:36:53,350 --> 00:37:00,870
