[Episode 22]

3
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,060
This isn't fun, Master. I'll go back to my room first.

4
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,590
Stay for a bit.

5
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,440
Master, it's not fun to just sit here. Why don't we play a game?

6
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,990
Waiter, bring the wine over!

7
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,950
Is it even or odd?

8
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,460
Even.

9
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,240
You've lost.

10
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,700
Again.

11
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
Even.

12
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,500
You've lost again.

13
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,350
Master, after so many drinks, is your body able to handle it?

14
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,490
If I'm willing to bet, I'll admit defeat.

15
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,220
Why don't we stop playing? Master!

16
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,830
Master? Master?

17
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,400
You're really good at enduring,

18
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,120
but your luck is really bad.

19
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,820
Little Beauty left Wan Lu Sect? Where would she go?

20
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,140
Ah Wu, there are some words that I don't know if I should say or not.

21
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,200
Then keep it inside.

22
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,640
Ah Wu, this Qin Zhiyan is affecting you too much now.

23
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,120
I like her.

24
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,910
Ah Wu, even your stubbornness should have a limit.

25
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,250
Why do you have so many things to say?

26
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,360
Ah Wu!

27
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,390
What now?

28
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,700
The scout from Jinzhou came with an important report.

29
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,960
What did it say?

30
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,100
Qin Zhiyan appeared in Jinzhou.

31
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,640
Little Beauty is in Jinzhou?

32
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

33
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,010
But... Li Chenlan is with her.

34
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,000
Damn pervert.

35
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,160
Master... we...

36
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,100
There is an inn ahead. We'll go there and rest first.

37
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,380
All right. Let's go.

38
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,330
Strange. When did the Little Monster become so familiar with Jinzhou?

39
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,200
Has he come here before?

40
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,430
- Guests, are you here to eat or for accommodation?
- Two rooms.
- Please wait for a moment.

41
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,140
Waiter!

42
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,190
Coming!

43
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,220
Don't run around in the daylight.

44
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,770
Bring the two guests upstairs for two rooms.

45
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,810
Okay. Guests, please.

46
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,390
I'll go out scouting. Stay in, don't move.

47
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,120
Freshly-made, three coins each. Have a couple for a taste.

[Eternal as sun and moon]

72
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,500
So suspicious.

73
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,390
This guy... can he really not see me, or is he pretending?

74
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,230
Did he come to Jianxin Sect because he, too, feels that Liu Suruo is hiding something?

75
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,450
Then I may as well stay close to him. It will be safer.

76
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,620
Odd.

77
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,600
How come now it's Liu Suruo managing all daily activities in Jianxin Sect?

78
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,170
Why do I always feel ill at ease? It's best that nothing happens now.

79
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,280
The horseman just came to report that Windchaser is almost...

80
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Windchaser!

81
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,500
This way, please.

82
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,140
This one.

83
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,030
This... Miss Liu, this one is first rate,

84
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,870
but its temper is too strong. It's hard to tame. A normal man can't even harness it.

85
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,300
There's no horse I can't tame.

86
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,410
Good, good.

87
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,780
This is no way to tame a horse. If you want to tame him, you must consider his mood,

88
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,790
let him know that you are a good master.

89
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,600
To tame a horse you must even consider the horse's feelings?

90
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,770
Naturally. All things have a spirit. If you want to violate it, of course, he'll rebel.

91
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,290
You have to make him feel safe for him to trust you.

92
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,930
But don't be hasty in building a relationship with him,

93
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,790
this is a gradual process.

94
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,630
But why did he turn docile as soon as he saw you?

95
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,740
Maybe he has a bond with me.

96
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,150
Being able to tame horses because there's a bond? I don't believe it.

97
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,300
Of course, it also requires strength.

98
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,030
Since this horse has a bond with you, Young Lord, I'll give it to you.

99
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,540
I'll consider it as you having a good eye, Miss. But a gentleman wouldn't take what belongs to others.

100
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,100
Many thanks.

101
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,460
Young Lord!

102
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,900
Excuse me, Young Lord, may I have your name?

103
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,520
A man without a name and of no importance. If we are bound to, we'll certainly meet again.

104
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,210
Young Lord, you have a bond with him. Please, name him.

105
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:02,000
This horse is robust and strong, can chase wind and clouds. Call him Windchaser.

106
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,710
Windchaser...

107
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,420
You had a bond with Mingxuan.

108
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,520
And with me, too.

109
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,800
In truth, now you're old, too.

110
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,770
And I am, as well.

111
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,310
You're tired.

112
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,490
Don't struggle anymore.

113
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,850
Give Windchaser a burial with honors.

114
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,340
Yes.

115
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,880
Kill the stableman.

116
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,460
Yes.

117
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,290
Mingxuan, Windchaser's gone.

118
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,050
I lured Li Chenlan to Jinzhou.

119
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,920
The risk is high.

120
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Is Windchaser's parting at this time an omen?

121
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,550
But I've really waited too long.

122
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,450
If it's wrong, this time

123
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:17,160
let me be wrong all the way. I'll certainly get you to wake up.

124
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,840
Boss! Bring me a bowl of cool tea.

125
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
All right, just wait a moment.

A man from the Immortal Sect.

127
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,180
People from the Immortal Sect would come and have tea in such a small tea stall?

128
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,160
This sort of tea can access your lips?

129
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,400
Whatever is drunk is a gift. How dare I nitpick?

130
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,530
"Born to the world, dust to dust." So you're from the Thousand Dust Pavilion!

131
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,050
One year, on this road, I caught several disciples from your Thousand Dust Pavilion.

132
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,170
Guest, here's your tea. Please enjoy.

133
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,810
That year our Wan Lu Sect Leader, Lu Zhaoyao, attacked Jinzhou.

134
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,500
It was an imposing, unstoppable force; all the way to Jinzhou,

135
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,050
we stopped by that 10,000 Sword Formation. Coincidentally your Thousand Dust Pavilion stuck their nose in.

136
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,200
You came forward to cut off our retreat. Luckily, our Sect Leader had no hesitation.

137
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,390
She retaliated immediately, caught you straight on. Back then I was just in the middle.

138
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,030
I even personally caught several of your Thousand Dust Pavillion pupils.

139
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:41,100
But our Sect Leader was always the greatest. She actually caught your Pavillion Leader.

140
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,370
Thinking back to that year, riding the whirlwind with our Sect Leader,

141
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,030
life at it's fullest, it was really a blast.

142
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,960
You are a man of Wan Lu Sect.

143
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,810
I used to be. After Lu Zhaoyao died, I quit.

144
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,900
Why? Isn't Li Chenlan's conduct more tempered and beneficial to mankind?

145
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,310
Mankind? I don't get into that. I just want to wander free, look after myself.

146
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,390
What benefit to mankind? Crap!

147
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,800
Mankind's all right. Y'all look after yourselves, that's it.

148
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,610
Your reasoning is indeed thorough.

149
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,410
Thank you for your teaching.

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,140
Demoness, how did you end up coming back with Li Chenlan?

152
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,520
We met by chance, don't worry. He can't see me.

153
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,570
Get ready. I'll take you on a night assault on Jianxin Sect. Call Li Chenlan to join us.

154
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,190
Do you really intend to take Li Chenlan along?

155
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,820
Or else, why did you ask him to come to Jinzhou? For fun?

156
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,490
I... I say, how about we go first?

157
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,820
If anything happens in Jianxin Sect,

158
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,180
then we can come back and call him in.

159
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,460
If anything happens, it will be too late. You only have one life.

160
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,760
If you don't want to go, anyway in Li Chenlan's eyes I am you,

161
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,060
I'll go with him. You stay here.

162
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,250
That can't be. If you go with him, how can I go look for my father?

163
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,520
Then you go with him. I'll follow from behind. Is that fine?

164
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,240
I...

165
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,720
So what do you want to do?

166
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,970
Then I'll go with him. You follow from behind.

167
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,940
Fine. Hurry, call Li Chenlan.

168
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,920
P-P-Please, Master,

169
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,100
go with me... to Jianxin Sect.

170
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,280
- Revered One.
- Deacon Chi.

171
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,590
Han Yue. Xin Ting. Pass the command:

172
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,900
add men to the patrols day and night.

173
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,750
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes, Ma'am.

174
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,050
Revered One, that Li Chenlan is in Jinzhou?

175
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,470
At present, we haven't received news yet.

176
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,320
But I've felt restless all day long.

177
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,330
Let's prepare ourselves, there's no harm in it.

178
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,060
Cangling, if you see Zhiyan, capture her immediately and bring her to me.

179
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,650
Yes.

180
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,430
Deacon Chi, please have the troops from Phoenix Mountain transferred here,

181
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,630
in case they are needed.

182
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,750
Yes!

183
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,650
Liu Wei, come with me to check the Demon-Shield Ward.

184
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,150
Yes.

185
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,540
I think he'll be here soon.

186
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,400
Pavillion Leader.

187
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,920
Why are you here?

188
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,930
I simply conjectured. I did not expect to really find you at the outskirts of Jinzhou.

189
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,330
Pavillion Leader, were you informed that Jiang Wu came to Jinzhou and are here on the chase?

190
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,610
Jiang Wu is in Jinzhou, too?

191
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,210
Pavillion Leader, you didn't know? Then, why did you come here?

192
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,860
I came for another matter.

193
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,760
I didn't imagine Jiang Wu was here, too.

194
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,600
[Jianxin Sect]

195
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,210
Uncle Chi.

196
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,610
Li Chenlan is really here.

197
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,030
We don't have time to start the Demon-Shield Ward, yet.

198
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,580
I must stall Li Chenlan.

199
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,320
Sect Leader Li has come a long way. Why didn't you send a notice?

200
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,150
I would have welcomed you at the door.

201
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,040
Always better than coming uninvited like this, isn't it?

202
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,220
Demoness, we ran away so blatantly.

203
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,330
- What if Li Chenlan finds out?
- I can't worry about that.

204
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,090
It seems this Jianxin Sect was prepared.

205
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,600
If you really want to see your father, stop fearing the dangers behind and ahead. Just do it as if there's no going back.

206
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,340
Demoness, this is Liu Wei's study.

207
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,970
There's a place like this in Jianxin Sect?

208
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,340
Let's go.

209
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,530
I recognize this.

210
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,900
This is the "Unyielding Indestructible Golden Lock."

211
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,600
But how do we open it?

212
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,760
That's because you've never heard of the "All yield, break all" Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

213
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,220
Demon Li, that day on Fengmo Mountain, we should have just killed you!

214
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,270
You dare look down on me! Attack!

215
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,490
He did come.

216
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,210
Jin Xian's body. It cannot die.

217
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,900
Luo Mingxuan, even lying in a coffin you are repugnant.

218
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,860
Don't hope to wake up. Don't hope

219
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,860
to lay your eyes on this world again.

220
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,330
Why is Jin Xian in this place?

221
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,690
Back then I was mortally wounded in the Sword Tomb, but I woke up in Thousand Dust Pavillion's Sushan glacier.

222
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,910
Jianxin Sect killed your father and stored Luo Mingxuan's golden body.

223
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,900
All this...

224
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,510
Qin Qianxian... Qin Yu... Qin Zhiyan...

225
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,020
There was once a rumor in Jianghu, that the blood of the Qin family had the effect of bringing the dead back to life.

226
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,890
Was that actually true?

227
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,150
Jianxin Sect killed your father; it must have been to take the blood and revive Jin Xian.

228
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:33,520
This blood... it's all my father's?

229
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,970
So, it was to revive Luo Mingxuan

230
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,530
that they murdered my father.

231
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,530
His life is a life.

232
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,570
And my father's life wasn't?

233
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,600
Is it just because he's Jin Xian?

234
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,670
So his life's more precious?

235
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:12,610
If Jin Xian returns to life trampling other people's corpses, what kind of "Gold Deity" is he?

236
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,190
What "Gold Deity?" Isn't it just a title that the people in the Immortal Sect give themselves?

237
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,450
What a pack of dogs in human shape. They'll put on a show of justice and virtue,

238
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,760
but behind their backs, they'll do all sorts of bad things.

239
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,790
If Jin Xian comes back to life,

240
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,740
I'll be the first one there to send him to hell.

241
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,180
Two Qin Zhiyans?

242
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,390
A dignified Hills Leader, and you tried to deceive me with fake blood of Qin Zhiyan?

243
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,010
So that's it.

244
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,440
No wonder the blood Yuan Jie gave me was useless.

245
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,630
There are actually two Qin Zhiyans.

246
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,680
Which one is true?

247
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,370
Hold steady. Don't give yourself away.

248
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,800
You won't say?

249
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,390
If you don't say, neither of you can leave here today.
