[Episode 53]

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,240
Brother Cangling.

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,450
Zhiyan?

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,180
When we said goodbye that day at the mountain gate, I didn't imagine we would meet again so soon.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,700
True. Only, once again it's at a time of life or death.

7
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,180
Zhiyan,

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,620
Jin Xian's return to life, all that came with it... it was all our Jianxin Sect's...

9
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,680
Brother Cangling,

10
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,860
I've never blamed you. This situation isn't on you, either.

11
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,740
If we want to complain, we can only blame fate for allowing it.

12
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,190
Don't blame yourself.

13
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,130
On Mount Phoenix,

14
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,110
be careful at all times.

15
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,300
You, too.

16
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,900
Little Niece! Little Niece!

17
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,300
- Little Niece!
- There's something at the Wan Lu Sect, I'm leaving.

18
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhiyan!

19
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,120
Be careful at all times.

20
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,750
Lu Zhaoyao is only one.

21
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,150
But do you know...

22
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,680
that Ziyu is the only one, too?

23
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,640
Once master and servant, how can you pick such a place to reminisce about the past?

24
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,330
You two, go on!

25
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,420
Miss Lin, a moment ago he said

26
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,500
"Lu Zhaoyao is the only one."

27
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,520
You're really pitiful.

28
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,490
Punishing him here would rather be too easy on him.

29
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,890
Also, you shouldn't ruin my great plan for tomorrow.

30
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,680
Many years ago,

31
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,370
our Immortal Sect captured you on Fengmo Mountain. Due to my serious injury I could not participate.

32
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,120
We lost such a long time.

33
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Now,

34
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,900
we are finally back on the right path, but

35
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,790
all of this has taken too many twists and turns.

36
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,960
Li Chenlan,

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,990
ten thousand deaths would not make up for your crimes!

38
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,750
Luo Mingxuan,

39
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,730
you're really sad.

40
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,090
Incorrigible!

41
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,770
Tomorrow, the world will finally see your sins.

42
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,970
Mo Qing,

43
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,830
wait for me.

44
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,220
All right.

45
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,060
Jin Xian, we have placed the defense in and out of Mount Phoenix.

46
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,620
If Lu Zhaoyao dares come, we'll destroy her.

47
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,480
Good.

48
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,970
Tomorrow these two demons, at all costs,

49
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,050
must be annihilated.

50
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,500
Tomorrow I'm going to Phoenix Mountain; it will be another fierce battle.

51
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,000
This evening I called you all here to tell you to leave the Wan Lu Sect.

52
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Protect your life. This way I won't be hindered by any worries.

53
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,420
No way. On any day, if Sect Leader tells me to go, I'll go for sure. But tomorrow it can't be.

54
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,470
You must go.

55
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,880
- But Sect Leader...
- Seventeen,

56
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,220
if in the Immortal Sect there's still someone with a conscience, they will not let Jin Xian do evil.

57
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,120
Let's hope so.

58
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,710
Zhaoyao, if you can stake all your strength on this one chance,

59
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,000
so can we.

60
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,780
So, don't talk about making us leave anymore.

61
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
Tomorrow, I'll take Li Yazi forward as well.

62
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,510
It isn't only to lend a hand to you, Sect Leader Lu. Even more, it's for each of the Immortal Sects,

63
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,360
to give them the truth.

64
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,580
Many thanks to each of you.

65
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,390
Sect Leader, the Thousand Dust Pavillion disciple Su Yan is seeking an audience.

66
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,430
- Let him in, quick.
- Yes.

67
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,120
It seems we're adding one to our odds.

68
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,300
Sect Leader Lu, my senior assumed that tomorrow you'll certainly take action and commanded me to come.

69
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,410
I'll march on Phoenix Mountain with you. Senior worries for our leader. He'll take our disciples there first.

70
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,820
Right! Tomorrow, we also have to save Qin Qianxian!

71
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,410
Do you all have a plan?

72
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,570
Plans are useless by now.

73
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,660
We can only use all the people we have and follow fate.

74
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,760
Demoness, your Liuhe Tianyi Sword is still in Luo Mingxuan's hands.

75
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,200
For tomorrow's battle, you're short of a proper weapon.

76
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,240
My weapon is just outside Phoenix's Song Hall.

77
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,620
All Immortal Sect Leaders and followers,

78
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,960
I, the Gold Deity. Luo Mingxuan, today, by the will of Heaven,

79
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,610
have set a formation against demons here;

80
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,490
so as to eliminate the son of the Demon King, to the benefit of all the people in the world!

81
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,570
- Jin Xian the Englightened!
- Jin Xian the Englightened!

82
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,160
Hey, you'd said that for Sima...

83
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,530
no, wait... You'd said that for Qianxian...

84
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,390
no, wait... they had said that Qin Qianxian was held around this backyard.

85
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,520
I've looked all around and can't find him.

86
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,660
You've been running circles all in the same place!Seventeen, to the left!

87
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,060
To the left. To-to the left.

88
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,130
If you go right you'll run in a circle again!

89
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,090
Right...

90
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,490
Is it here?

91
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,730
Sima Rong, someone's holding guard here.

92
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,790
Hurry, go look!

93
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,930
All right.

94
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,920
There's a ward!

95
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,190
Sima Rong, there's a ward here. Qin Qianxian must be here.

96
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,830
Seventeen, don't be so loud.

97
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,570
Beautiful One, let's go!

98
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,800
- Wait.
- What is it?

99
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,060
Outside there is still a ward. I can't get out.

100
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,690
Then, what do we do?

101
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,060
I'll teach you some magic. Try it.

102
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,100
All right. You speak, I'll do.

103
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,780
Li Chenlan.

104
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,660
First, he's the son of the Demon King. This is his original crime.

105
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,620
Second, he's the Wan Lu Sect Leader. This is a crime against humanity.

106
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,880
Third, the massacre of the South Moon Order. His beastly nature can't be swayed;

107
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,300
it is of the utmost cruelty. Fourth, he swept away Jianxin Sect,

108
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,910
harming the people of Jinzhou; their cries filled the streets, they were left with no means to live.

109
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,290
Recently,

110
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,190
again, he slaughtered

111
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,860
the entire Xu Zong Sect for their secret art.

112
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,300
His crimes call for execution.

113
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,510
Add crimes as you please.

114
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,150
Even at the point of death, you refuse to repent.

115
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,090
Jianxin Sect Leader is here!

116
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,960
Liu Cangling! What have you all come for?

117
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,600
Xu Zong Sect's case has nothing to do with Li Chenlan.

118
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,460
The man who killed Sect Leader Jiang, stole the secret art and destroyed Xu Zong Sect is you,

119
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Luo Mingxuan!

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,320
Liu Cangling, don't think you can spout nonsense here.

121
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
I have a witness.

122
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,970
Xu Zong Sect's survivor,

123
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,170
Sect Leader Jiang's personal pupil, Li Yazi.

124
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,220
My Master and Senior Gu,

125
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,960
as well as all my fellow disciples in Xu Zong Sect,

126
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,700
were killed by Luo Mingxuan. I saw it with my own eyes.

127
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,010
- What?
- Is that so?

128
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,220
- An investigation!
- How could this be?

129
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,690
Enough!

130
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,620
Luo Mingxuan! Do you want to silence him by murder in front of this entire crowd?

131
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,030
Jin Xian, I hope you can give us a reasonable explanation.

132
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,930
Tang Yun! Which side are you on?

133
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,550
I'm on the side of truth.

159
00:17:33,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Timing and subtitles brought to you

160
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,670
The truth is...

161
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,970
Luo Mingxuan is the real demon!

162
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,960
Lu Zhaoyao, you came indeed.

163
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,920
But this time you can't save him,

164
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,250
and you can't save yourself.

165
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,350
The one who can't save himself is you.

166
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,510
Zhiyan, take Li Yazi away.

167
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,360
Go!

168
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,900
Yazi, let's go.

169
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,790
Where are you going?

170
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,880
You've broken your wind and now you're leaving? I haven't given my permission, yet!

171
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,230
Zhaoyao!

172
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,210
Luo Mingxuan is now an evil monster. Qingyin Sect disciples, listen to my command!

173
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,660
Let us put down the evil monster together!

174
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,690
- Yes!
- Yes!

175
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,050
It appears, Sect Leader Tang, that you want to be our enemy.

176
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,820
I won't assist tyrants in doing evil.

177
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,230
Fine.

178
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,430
Then don't blame me for being rude.

179
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,750
Jin Xiu! Why are you here?

180
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,940
I told you, this time I want to be with you.

181
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,860
Fine. Then be together in death.

182
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,910
What right do you have to fight me?

183
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,050
I came to take revenge for Ah Wu!

184
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,250
His palm... His weakness is on his hand palm!

185
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:11,780
Ah Wu, I've taken revenge for you.

186
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,890
Jin Xian!

187
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,790
This is Jin Xian you all worship as head of the Immortal Sect!

188
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,300
This is the truth you wanted!

189
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,170
Beauty comes from the heart.

190
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,130
Luo Mingxuan, the true face you revealed

191
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,180
is truly hideous!

192
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,330
Today, the one who should be judged

193
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
is you, Luo Mingxuan!

194
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,600
Zhaoyao!

195
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,410
Zhaoyao!

196
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,530
Luo Mingxuan's strength is so overbearing.

197
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,330
What is this now?

198
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,600
Jin Xian is turning like this?

199
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
True face.

200
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,580
If this is the face required to achieve the Great Way, then this is just as I should be!

201
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,120
The hardships I've suffered

202
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,380
in the days ahead will become the light that shines on all creatures!

203
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,320
Every sacrifice is for the achievement of the Great Way!

204
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,120
Jin Xiu!

205
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,640
The martyrs of today will begin with you.

206
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,980
No.

207
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,530
W-We...

208
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,400
Were we wrong?

209
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,810
Wrong? How can Jin Xian be wrong?

210
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,300
How can I be wrong?

211
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,020
I can't be wrong.

212
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,810
I can't be wrong. I can't be wrong!

213
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,170
- Why? How could this...
- Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

214
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,800
No!

215
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,650
Little Yun!

216
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,670
Don't!

217
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,700
- Jin Xiu, about what you mentioned last night...
- Don't!

218
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,770
...I wanted to accept.

219
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,020
Now, I'm afraid I can't.

220
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,530
Don't!

221
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,230
- Don't!
- But it's fine.

222
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,640
In the years I've had,

223
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,980
I've finally repaid you for saving my life--

224
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,160
Little Yun, don't!

225
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,340
You love beauty so much.

226
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,460
This headful of silver hair... pity...

227
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,120
Little Yun!

228
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,830
Luo Mingxuan! You're out of your mind!

229
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,790
Only without affections or desires can we achieve the Great Way!

230
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,990
If it's without affections or desires what's the use of the Great Way?

231
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Sect disciples and Qingyin followers, obey my command!

232
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,350
- Yes!
- Yes!

233
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,750
Let's kill the evil monster together! Victory or death!

234
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,230
All right. Since it's like this,

235
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,580
you'll all be martyrs of the Great Way!

236
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,380
Zhaoyao! Run away!

237
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,130
Zhiyan, take them away!

238
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,180
But you...

239
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,670
Go!

240
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,260
Go!

241
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,710
Martyrs? I'm willing!

242
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,780
I'm willing to sacrifice for my faith!

243
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,230
No! No!

244
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,160
Let's go.

245
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,590
It won't do. We still can't avoid the ward.

246
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,620
Since we can't avoid it, we can only brave it.

247
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,330
When Sect Leader told us to come a little later she was in fact taking precautions.

248
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,130
Qianjin wrote to me that the Immortal Sect was facing danger.

249
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,090
Our Rain View Sect would never ignore others' plea.

250
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,280
We must leave this place alive!
