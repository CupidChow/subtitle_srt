[Episode 19]

3
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,940
Crabapples are so beautiful.

4
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,190
Just like the first time

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,170
I caught you falling from the crabapple tree.

6
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,640
That was a scam. I'm so good at fighting,

7
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,280
how could I fall down from a tree?

8
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,280
I know.

9
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,030
Coming close to you... it was all to fool you.

10
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,840
I know.

11
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,170
But my feelings for you

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,990
are true.

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,320
I know.

14
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,490
Ah Rong,

15
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,280
you're always too kind

16
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,770
and too stubborn.

17
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,700
Forgive me.

18
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,080
Only this way

19
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,380
can you forget me.

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,570
I won't forgive you.

21
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,250
And I won't forget you.

22
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,820
I will always remember you.

23
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,230
Yuezhu!

24
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Yuezhu!

25
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,210
Yuezhu!

26
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,670
Yuezhu!

27
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,330
Yuezhu!

28
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,050
Ah Wu, don't kill me.

29
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,270
No. Don't!

30
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,070
Yuezhu!

31
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,570
Yuezhu!

32
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,590
Zhaoyao, I'll be there with you.

33
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,690
The Heart Prying Mirror?

34
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,990
That's wrong.

35
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,190
Master!

36
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,240
I shouldn't be here.

37
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,510
I should...

38
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,080
be by your side.

39
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,950
Indeed, it was an illusion.

40
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,250
More fighting?

41
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,120
Little Short Hair, you and I both fell into this trap.

42
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,770
The way I see it, when the moon is at its zenith, the force of this formation will be stronger and stronger.

43
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,190
If you and I keep fighting, I'm afraid they'll all fall into the pit.

44
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,590
So, what do you want to say?

45
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,860
You want to discuss a deal with me again?

46
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,760
Sima Rong works for Li Chenlan, so you wanted to kill him,

47
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,110
but you didn't do it right away.

48
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,100
I guess you wanted to get information from him, first. Right?

49
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,260
You're very smart.

50
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,370
But as I see it, you aren't that smart.

51
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,690
Him, I'll take him away.

52
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,620
Yuezhu!

53
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,760
Then, what do I gain from it?

54
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,850
Gain?

55
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,490
As they say, "If you know yourself and your enemy,
you'll win every battle." You know,

56
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,130
Sima Rong and Li Chenlan in Wan Lu Sect were apprenticed with the same master and are thick as brothers.

57
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,320
This is actually the first time I've heard of it.

58
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,420
You want to get information from Sima Rong
and didn't check their connection?

59
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,320
Catching Sima Rong is useless.

60
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,610
You can get information from me.

61
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,960
Yeah?

62
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,190
You let go of Sima Rong. In the future, I'll be your informant.

63
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,330
Sima Rong has no hatred for Li Chenlan. But I do.

64
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,320
Fine. I accept.

65
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,840
Since you bear a grudge against Li Chenlan, why don't you just come away with me?

66
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,740
You'll be under my wing.

67
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,360
I'll still have to leak information for you.

68
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,940
Somehow I feel that a million pieces of information are not as good as having you in person.

69
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,160
While I'm still talking civilly to you, let go of my hand quickly.

70
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,670
What if I don't?

71
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,760
M-Master...

72
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,020
Sooner or later, I'll kill you.

73
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,970
Damn!

74
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,140
Why aren't they back yet? They've been gone so long.

75
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,780
Lin Ziyu!

76
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,780
Why is she here?

77
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,350
- Captain!
- Captain!

78
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,520
This one was sneaking outside. I don't know who she is.

79
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,190
Who are you?

80
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,790
Ah Rong?

81
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,660
Master, a moment ago did you...

82
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,620
If you insist on refusing, don't complain about my manners.

83
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,220
Stop!

84
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,160
Get up.

85
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,800
Sect Leader.

86
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,250
- Sect Leader.
- Sect Leader.

87
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,640
Assist the West Hill Master into his room. Summon Gu Hanguang here.

88
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,150
Yes, Sir.

89
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,180
Sect Leader, this person was sneaking outside a moment ago.

90
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,650
She's extremely suspicious. Moreover, no matter how I asked, she refused to show her face.

91
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,730
What's so suspicious in my maid coming to see me?

92
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,920
She's timid and you scared her.

93
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,590
You haven't even seen her face. Miss Zhiyan, how do you know she's your maid?

94
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,820
Is there any problem? I'm with her day and night.
I know her looks better than anyone.

95
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,670
Fine. Since she's your maid, what's wrong in showing herself?

96
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,770
She never shows herself. As soon as I came to Chenji Mountain, I said

97
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,520
I would skin whoever tried to disrobe her.

98
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,760
I do what I say.

99
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,170
- What?
- Enough. It's just a maid.

100
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,130
Send people to check any stragglers from Jiang Wu's party in Jiangzhou. Clean them off.

101
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,630
Leave some to help the West Hill Master put his house in order.

102
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,650
And add men to the guard protecting the place. I can't have any more mistakes.

103
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,120
Yes, Sir.

104
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,580
Let's go back to the room.

105
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,980
Demoness, have I messed up again?

106
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,480
But I really didn't mean to!

107
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,560
I was really worried about you, I...

108
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,300
What is it?

109
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,090
I think, this time, I'm probably the one who messed up.

110
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,200
What mess did you make?

111
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,200
Stay put here. I'll go have a look.

112
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,870
Ah Rong?

113
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,200
Ah Rong? I won't...

114
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,160
I won't...

115
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,690
Ah Rong, I won't let anyone hurt you. I won't...

116
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,590
- Yuezhu,
- ...let anyone hurt you.

117
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,610
we brought Ah Rong back safely.

118
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,120
Ah Rong is back safe?

119
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,530
He's back safe. So don't worry.

120
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,190
I want to go see him. Can I?

121
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,420
Fine. Come.

122
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,000
South Hill Master, this way, please.

123
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No need to tell me. I know where it is just by following this smell of blood.

124
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,600
You must not hurt Ah Rong!

125
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,720
It's nothing. He's a doctor. He has a bit of a bad temper.

126
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,100
Let's go.

127
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,940
Master, Yuezhu wanted to come see the West Hill Master. I brought her to have a look.

128
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,150
Hurry up and check on Ah Rong.

129
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,990
There's a pill inside.

130
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,700
Master, you...

131
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,480
Go out for now.

132
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,930
Go out.

133
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,600
Is he healed?

134
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,800
I was afraid that if I didn't heal him quickly, you'd have died.

135
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,830
Take off your clothes.

136
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,860
Let's talk about it when we're back in Wan Lu Sect.

137
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,770
What did you say?

138
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,020
Let's talk about it when we're back in Wan Lu Sect.

139
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,150
You still dare use the Instant Travel Art.

140
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,140
You really are tired of living so long.

141
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,380
You were in such a haste to come back.

142
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,070
Don't think I didn't notice you wanted to dodge that little disciple you have.

143
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,350
Li Chenlan, you don't even fear death,

144
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,530
but you fear that disciple of yours?

145
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,480
You can fully dig at me. Are you happy?

146
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,950
I'm happy. Extremely happy.

147
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,730
Take off your clothes.

148
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,320
Sima Rong has no hatred for Li Chenlan. But I do.

149
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,390
Are you awake?

150
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,400
How did we get back?

151
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,890
Where's that Sima Rong?

152
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,390
Ran off.

153
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,600
How could he run off?

154
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,200
We planned it well and we weren't followed. It was all planned through.

155
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,620
There was no mistake. How did he get off?

156
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,460
I told you! We shouldn't have gone to Lingting Mountain. That place is crooked.

157
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,760
You didn't say not to go to Lingting Mountain at first!

158
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,290
You're only saying it now that Sima Rong's gone. Hindsight!

159
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,180
Enough, enough! Don't fight.

160
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,960
Ah Wu, Sima Rong ran off. How come you're not mad at all?

161
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,980
Because I let him off myself.

162
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,400
I made a deal with the Little Beauty.

163
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,610
- What deal?
- What deal?

164
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,960
She goes to Wan Lu Sect as my mole, and together we'll do away with Li Chenlan.

165
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,610
When I'm the Sect Leader of Wan Lu, she'll be mine.

166
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,050
Li Chenlan left?

167
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,590
I don't know why you made him angry.

168
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,010
But I think sincere communication is the only way to solve problems.

169
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,830
What is there to communicate? He left already.

170
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,360
We can go to him.

171
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,190
I think this time he must be really angry.

172
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,170
Normally, he'll at least say goodbye to you before he leaves.

173
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,060
How do you know?

174
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,750
Why wouldn't I know? He does that every time.

175
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,190
So, why is he angry?

176
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,580
I made a deal with Jiang Wu. He would free Sima Rong...

177
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,620
and in return, I'd provide news on Wan Lu Sect for him.

178
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,090
You... And Li Chenlan overheard that?

179
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,640
You openly betrayed him... and he overheard it?

180
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,120
It's over.

181
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,840
Demoness, should you go explain that to him?

182
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,910
Explain what?

183
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,140
You should explain to him, so that he doesn't misunderstand you.

184
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,130
I never explain my actions to other people.

185
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,410
If people want to talk... then I'm the one that creates topics.

186
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,360
That's because you used to be really powerful, but now Li Chenlan is more powerful.

187
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,850
That day you lost to Li Chenlan, you said to him,

188
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,830
"This little woman willingly admits defeat." Now you are acting so tough.

189
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,050
Since you're so good at explaining, we look the same now, why don't you go and explain to him?

190
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,640
Me? I'm not the one who made him angry. How do I explain to him?

191
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,720
I thought you'd grown braver.

192
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,990
Looks like you only dare to be outspoken in front of me.

193
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,930
I must have been too nice to you.

194
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,600
Demoness, are you resisting it too much...

195
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,190
Is it because you don't know how to explain yourself to someone sincerely?

196
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,130
So you can seduce and act,

197
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,320
but can't explain yourself sincerely?

198
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,420
That's right. But it's because I don't ever need to explain myself.

199
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,090
Misunderstanding is inevitable in human relationships.

200
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,860
You need to explain if there's a misunderstanding. Have you never explained when you were misunderstood?

201
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,650
I've never been wrong.

202
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,200
Even If I'm ever wrong, I'll just make it real so I won't feel wrong anymore.

203
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,150
Make it real?

204
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,420
If they say that I'm bad, then I'll become bad.

205
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,070
If they say that I'm evil, I'll be evil.

206
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,320
If they say that I'm arrogant, I'll show them arrogance.

207
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,220
That's because I'm their greatest nightmare.

208
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,380
Demoness, I still think you should explain to Li Chenlan.

209
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,620
Why are you still talking about that?

210
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,820
I thought I'd made myself clear.

211
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,390
I created Wan Lu Sect and came this far...

212
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,450
with my unquestionable power and strength.

213
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,580
Explain?

214
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,430
People who hate you will never accept your explanation.

215
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,110
But he doesn't.

216
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,630
Doesn't what?

217
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,170
He's not someone who hates you.

218
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,540
I think he's a good person.

219
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,950
A good person?

220
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,120
But the people I trust the least, are precisely good people.

221
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,730
The southern land has a warm climate and is beautiful...

222
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,500
The northern land is desolate... and extremely cold.

223
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,940
If you leave this mountain one day, you can come look for me on Phoenix Mountain.

224
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,100
Keep this in mind. Never wander off the right path.

225
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,800
Be a good and righteous person.

226
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,660
I know. We should live to protect peace in Jianghu, right?

227
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,530
I will definitely be a good person.

228
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,150
What I hate most are sentiments.

229
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,970
[Jianxin Sect]

230
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,100
Young Master.

231
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,880
Young Master, you are finally back. Sect Master has been looking for you for a long period of time.

232
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,530
- Where's my father?
- Master is ill. He has been resting in his room.

233
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,310
Why is he suddenly not well? Is he sick?

234
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,590
I don't know. Sect Leader has been the one taking care of Master.

235
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,120
Managing the sect for Master.

236
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,880
I will go take a look.

237
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,790
Sect Leader instructed us to inform her immediately if Young Master Cangling returned.

238
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,980
- I'm going to report to Lady Changyu. You stay here.
- All right.

239
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,960
Qin Qianxian is extremely strong; yet, he stays in the periphery.

240
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,040
If the world is peaceful,

241
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,850
then it is difficult to get him to reveal himself and give us his blood.

242
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:47,580
However, if he knows that the world has gone chaotic and needs the Gold Deity to keep the peace,

243
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,190
even if he doesn't offer to give us his blood,

244
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,040
I'll have ways to force him to agree.

245
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,370
But after Lu Zhaoyao's death, Li Chenlan hasn't been expanding his influence at all.

246
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,570
It's been peaceful for many years.

247
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,730
If there's chaos, the cause can only be that newly emerged Jiang Wu.

248
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,660
He's not enough. Only Li Chenlan, who has command of Wan Lu Sect,

249
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,460
can make the Immortal Sects feel threatened.

250
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,550
But Li Chenlan...

251
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,580
If he doesn't make a move, we'll provoke him.

252
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,920
I heard that since Qin Zhiyan ran to Wan Lu Sect,

253
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,640
Li Chenlan has been doting on her.

254
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,910
He seems to hold a deep affection for her.

255
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,420
You mean...

256
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,540
Qin Zhiyan's blood is useless.

257
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,590
But perhaps, she's still useful to us.

258
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,950
Revered One, Young Master is back. He's going to see Master.

259
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,320
- You may leave now.
- Yes.

260
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,220
Why did Liu Cangling come back?

261
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,060
This child... it was really not the time to come back.

262
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,800
Cangling!

263
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,770
Aunt!

264
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,160
Look at you, child. Where have you been these days?

265
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,750
Your father and I have been looking for you all the time.

266
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,430
I was unfilial.

267
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,070
It is just fine that you are back.

268
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,520
Your father has been nursing his health. Refrain from disturbing him.

269
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,600
What is the reason for my father's sudden health issues?

270
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,960
First, it's concern over Qin Yu's matter. Second, it's worry over you.

271
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:58,600
Add the fact that he recently met some mishaps while practicing his skills, his body suffered some discomfort.

272
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,430
I'll go see him.

273
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,330
Go see him.

274
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,550
Father, I'm back!

275
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,640
Father.

276
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,350
Your father is recuperating. You'd best not disturb him.

277
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,860
Not to mention, you've been out for so long, you must be tired, too.

278
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,180
Rest well for a few days.

279
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,560
Aunt, thank you for your concern.

280
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,120
When you are well rested, you'll have to take care of sect matters for your father.

281
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,750
After all, in the future, this position as a Jianxin Sect Leader will be yours.

282
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,260
You should learn to do some things.

283
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,000
Also, regarding the marriage with Zhiyan, just drop it.

284
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,720
Aunt!

285
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,720
This isn't just my opinion. It is also your father's opinion.

286
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,860
Qin Zhiyan is currently Wan Lu Sect's Leader's disciple.

287
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,810
- Between you and her...
- Aunt,

288
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,940
about this matter, we'll talk later.

289
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:46,700
Fine. When your father has recovered, we'll discuss it again.

290
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,100
Isn't that South Hill Master's servant?

291
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,220
Go back to the Cleanse Dust Palace.

292
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,910
What a hypocritical demoness! She's obviously worried.

293
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,970
All right. Go back.

294
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,590
Yes, Sir.

295
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,210
This is... Liuhe Tianyi Sword's injury.

296
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,420
His wound has not healed since then?

297
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,840
How long before I can recover?

298
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,740
You were struck by lightening. What do you think?

299
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,870
This wound was recovering slowly to begin with.

300
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,780
In addition, you ignore your doctor and keep exerting yourself.

301
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,210
The injury that had just healed was split by lightning again.

302
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,160
Over and over. Deadly annoying.

303
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,430
How long before it heals?

304
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,370
So, you do want to heal?

305
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,000
The way you are tossing and turning now, don't even hope to heal in this life.

306
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,230
If you settle down to recover, you'll be fine in a month or so.

307
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,040
If you want to heal a little faster, put down everything you have on hand at the moment.

308
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,870
Sit down in meditation.

309
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,780
Maybe in ten days, you can heal.

310
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm off. For the time being, keep away from water.

311
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,100
I should just go get a basin of cold water now

312
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,770
and pour it straight on your wound,

313
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,930
then stab you with the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

314
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,350
But why

315
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,760
suddenly

316
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,100
I don't want to do that anymore?

317
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,690
Both of them are so generous, at other people's expenses!

318
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,530
It's really too good of an act.

319
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,830
If you're so great, hurt or sick, don't come to me for treatment!

320
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,600
Can't we do it just once, after you're done with your tossing about?

321
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,170
Caused me a lot of delay in my schedule for the last few months.

322
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,750
An Si!

323
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,660
Here!

324
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,210
Has the Xu Zong Sect issued this year's medical question yet?

325
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,800
Master, we haven't yet received Sect Leader Jiang's medical question.

326
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,290
This year, he's later than last year by 3 days.

327
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,590
It looks like he means to issue a difficult question.

328
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,390
Sect Leader.

329
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,060
With Sect Leader Jiang so focused, it appears this year's topic

330
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,340
will be such as to give a headache to all the healers in the world.

331
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,090
I reported to you, Sir. You said to come in.

332
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,370
I was too bold and disturbed you.

333
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,860
Not at all, not at all. Please, have a seat.

334
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,720
Hurry, see to the tea for Palace Leader Shen.

335
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,660
Palace Leader, please.

336
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,360
Here.

337
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,140
Through these years, as soon as Sect Leader Jiang issues a question,

338
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,890
that Wan Lu Sect's South Hill Master issues another.

339
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,130
They say it's the contest among all the healers of the world.

340
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,980
But you two fellow apprentices are the only ones who can solve the topic.

341
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,410
Sect Leader Jiang, though you and the South Hill Master aren't under the same master anymore,

342
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,310
your bond has never lessened.

343
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,170
Forgive me a word of vanity.

344
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,200
At present, he is the only one in the world who can solve my questions.

345
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,500
Hanguang and I do not share fellow apprentices' feelings so much,

346
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,360
but, rather, the clear appreciation of matching opponents.

347
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,890
Palace Leader Shen, did you have an urgent matter in coming here?

348
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,560
Sect Leader Jiang, you're too kind.

349
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,320
I've been graced with so much of your generosity
that if I had not paid you a visit in thanks

350
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,700
I would have really been disrespectful.

351
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,610
Palace Leader Shen, what do you mean by these words?

352
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:24,240
My health is poor. It was your medicine, Sect Leader,
that realigned my vital force.

353
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,290
Palace Leader Shen, you're in error.
This kindness wasn't from me.

354
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,990
But in our Immortal Sects who else has such a medical skill,
to be willing to help me thus?

355
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,050
Could you, Sect Leader Jiang, give me a hint?

356
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,210
Cannot say.

357
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,160
However, if I were to give these prescriptions,

358
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,180
in them, I'd set two coins less of pipewort,

359
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,460
three coins more of glossy privet fruits,

360
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,190
that way the medicinal effect would improve.

361
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,950
Fine. Next time, if I have a chance,

362
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,140
I'll follow your advice over that healer's.

363
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,150
By the grace of your kind generosity I've benefited with medicine for many years,

364
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,630
yet I don't know the name of my benefactor.

365
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,360
Many remote letters were sent, not one ever had a reply.

366
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,950
