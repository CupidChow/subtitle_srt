[Episode 10]

3
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Did you know? Sect Leader was competing with Lady Zhiyan just now at Teasing Moon Peak.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
Really?

5
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
In a romantic surrounding (lit. amidst the flowers and moon), it was so beautiful.

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
How was it romantic?

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Lady Zhiyan said, "I've never even killed a bug."

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
Sect Leader took Lady Zhiyan and said, "KIll!" then killed a bug.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Really? Was it real?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Learn that skill. Next time we go out, we'll take girls to kill bugs!

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Why do you all think Sect Leader would like a girl from the Immortal Sect?

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
She came so suddenly.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,100
Enough!

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,400
It's late and you're still not in bed. Go and practice if you're not going to sleep.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Where's Ah Da?

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
Ah Da has been watching Miss Zhiyan lately.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,600
He's on duty day and night. He seldom comes back.

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
I got it. You're dismissed.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Yes.

20
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,190
[Thousand Dust Pavilion]
Master didn't bring Miss Zhiyan back?

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,990
Sect Leader Li doesn't want to let Miss Zhiyan leave.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If we want to bring her back, it's going to take some effort.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,900
It's fine.

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
It might be safer for her... to be in Wan Lu Sect than in the Immortal Sects.

25
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
How so?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I suspect that...

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,100
the person who killed Qin Yu is from the Immortal Sects.

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Last night, I noticed that Li Chenlan is protective of her.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Right now, it might be safer for her to be in Wan Lu Sect.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,500
You still suspect Sect Leader Liu?

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,400
The matter needs further investigation.

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
How much do you know about Jiang Wu of New Mountain?

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,600
We've only recently heard of Jiang Wu.

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
His background is a mystery. Previously, he was a strong disciple under Tu Ying of New Mountain.

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
Not long ago, he killed Tu Ying, taking over the position as the leader of New Mountain.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Recently, he's moving around in Jiangzhou City. He has an evil and unreasonable way of doing things.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
It seems like he wants to compete with Wan Lu Sect.

38
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,620
This Qin Qianxian is really at ease with Wan Lu Sect.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,400
But now if we want to take Qin Zhiyan's blood,

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,800
we'll have to rely on ourselves.

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Sect Master, I've contacted Yuan Jie.

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,400
True enough, he's still unable to forget about the son of his enemy.

43
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
But Lu Qi...

44
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
That person is Lu Qi?

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,040
Yes.

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Back then, he escaped from Yuan Jie.

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,800
The Gold Deity had helped him a lot.

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't have survived until now.

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,510
Sect Leader Chang Yu.

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,200
Ever since the Gold Deity has been sealed off, I seldom come to Phoenix Mountain.

51
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Also, I seldom visit children like you who were under the Gold Deity's protection.

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,800
Although Gold Deity has been sealed off, we've never forgotten the favor that he had done for us.

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,300
That's great.

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,830
Lu Qi,

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
right now, I have a way to resurrect the Gold Deity.

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
But I might need your help.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
There's a way to resurrect the Gold Deity?

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sect Leader, please tell me. If I can help, I will do everything I can.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
You're a really good kid.

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
The Gold Deity's effort to protect you wasn't in vain.

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,900
But...

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,000
This method requires a huge sacrifice. It's hard for me to ask for it.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
Sect Leader, please tell me quickly.

64
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,900
If we can resurrect the Gold Deity, I'm even willing to exchange my life for it.

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, what if it really requires you to use your life in exchange?

66
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,420
I am willing.

67
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,800
Zhiyan, you really shouldn't stay here.

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
It's great here.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,800
I won't leave with you. I need to seek my revenge.

70
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
It must be a misunderstanding.

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,100
What misunderstanding?

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,400
I saw with my own eyes, that Liu Wei...

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Father!

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,700
- Father!
- Don't come over!

75
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,510
I must avenge my father's death.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Stop talking about going back.

77
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,600
We... will never...

78
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,310
be able to return to the past.

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,600
You can't stay in Wan Lu Sect though.

80
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,000
What's wrong with Wan Lu Sect?

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My elder uncle also agreed to let me stay here. He thinks it's safer here as well.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
Zhiyan!

83
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,600
This girl from the Immortal Sects is so shameless. She pesters Master at night.

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,200
During the day, she secretly visits the young master of Immortal Sect.

85
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,800
Sister Zi Yu, shouldn't we report it to Master?

86
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,250
No need for that.

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,920
Why is Qin Zhi Yan behaving like two different people

88
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,250
day and night?

89
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll surely proves that...

90
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,500
Jian Xin Sect is innocent.

91
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,670
The losers are always in the wrong.

92
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,800
I'll give you a chance now to fight me.

93
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,700
Win or die together.

94
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,600
Or you can fight each other.

95
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,900
The winner can live on.

96
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,230
Brother.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,800
Both of us are like brothers. How can a devil like you instigate us?

98
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Go ahead, kill or maim us at your disposal.

99
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,100
All right. Go ahead.

100
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,000
Men.

101
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,610
Pavillion Leader.

102
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,580
Has there been any news about Jiang Wu lately?

103
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,270
I just heard that a team from the Wan Lu Dark Guard was completely put down by Jiang Wu's men.

104
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,090
The Dark Guard?

105
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,200
That's odd. Why does the Pavilion Leader pay such attention on Jiang Wu?

106
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,160
Captain! Captain!

107
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,240
What is it?

108
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,800
It is confirmed. The brothers who went after Jiang Wu were all...

109
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,980
they're all...

110
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,660
Sect Leader, the Dark Guard we dispatched to Jiangzhou a few days ago

111
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,360
were completely annihilated.

112
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,400
Completely annihilated?

113
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,910
Yes. The brothers' bodies are still in the West compound in Jiangzhou.

114
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,060
Pavillion Leader Qin,

115
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,370
why did you come to this place?

116
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,360
I heard something happened in Jiangzhou and I came to see.

117
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,930
Jiang Wu will pay the price

118
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,150
for what he did today.

119
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,210
Evil sin.

120
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,160
Thank you, Leader Qin.

121
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,220
This is my duty.

122
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,570
Jiang Wu continuously defies Wan Lu Sect. I won't let him off.

123
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,620
Leader Li, I have a proposal.

124
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,990
Please, speak.

125
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,600
Jiangzhou stands on the border between the Immortal Sect and Chenji Mountain. It's a delicate position.

126
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
If the Wan Lu Sect acts rashly against Jiang Wu,

127
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,790
I fear it may incite conflicts in Jianghu.

128
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,000
But Jiangzhou is adjacent to our Thousand Dust Pavilion.

129
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,860
Jiang Wu has been long wreaking havoc here.

130
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,410
The Thousand Dust Pavilion is willing to join hands with Wan Lu and cut him down together.

131
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,350
Leader Li, what is your opinion?

132
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,130
It would be very good.

133
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:02,020
I'd only heard that the Thousand Dust Pavilion Leader Qin dwelt beyond this world and never inquired about Jianghu.

134
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,450
I wouldn't have expected to see such deadly determination.

135
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,790
Disciples of the Great Way should devote their heart to the people.

136
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,380
Jiang Wu is not one of them.

137
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,990
I never thought the day would come when I could meet the North Hill Master so peacefully.

138
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,270
Where is Lu Qi?

139
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,560
No rush. If you agree to cooperate with us,

140
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,520
Lu Qi will, of course, appear before you.

141
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,820
Talk. What do you people want?

142
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,640
Our Immortal Sect's disciple, Qin Zhiyan, is currently in Wan Lu Sect

143
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,710
and has also claimed Li Chenlan as master. I presume you have heard of this.

144
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,940
We want that woman.

145
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,450
You took such pains just for a little girl?

146
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,760
She's no ordinary little girl.

147
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,010
I've already have a man infiltrated in Wan Lu Sect.

148
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll entreat the North Hill Master to lend him help at the moment of need.

149
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,770
Such a small matter.

150
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,010
Then, North Hill Master, you agree to join hands with us?

151
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,920
The man I want?

152
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,040
Lu Qi!

153
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,580
He is right here.

154
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Yuan Jie! You...

155
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:13,110
That year the Immortal Sect put to death my wife and son, and I've finally had my vengeance today.

156
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,860
This is the great wheel of justice!

157
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,490
What satisfaction!

158
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,710
I'll bring you the person you want in two days.

159
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,730
When I, Yuan Jie, give my word, I keep it.

160
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,820
If by then you can't deliver her,

161
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,760
expect retribution!

162
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,660
I, Yuan Jie, am not as useless as you people from the Immortal Sect.

163
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,090
North Hill Master.

164
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,140
You're the man infiltrating from the Immortal Sect?

165
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,390
Yes. I hope the North Hill Master will look after me

166
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,850
and help me get close to Qin Zhiyan as soon as possible.

167
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,510
Easy. Tomorrow, I'll have a room prepared for you in Teasing Moon Peak.

168
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,630
Closer to Qin Zhiyan.

169
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,930
Thank you, North Hill Master.

170
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,400
Doing good things for the Demoness every day is so tiresome.

171
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,330
Miss, I saw you lost in a trance. Are you all right?

172
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,130
I'm all right. Thank you for your help a moment ago.

173
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't mention it. I saw you Teasing Moon Peak. You are the Sect Leader's disciple, Miss Zhiyan?

174
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,870
You recognized me?

175
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm new in the Dark Guard Squad. I don't have many friends on Chenji Mountain.

176
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,840
You, Miss, have a kind face, so I remember it.

177
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,900
I'm a newcomer here, too. I'm not too used

178
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,900
to the way they deal with people on Chenji Mountain.

179
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,290
That's perfect. From now on we can look after each other, Miss Zhiyan.

180
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:45,040
Then, if you need any help, you can come to me.

181
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,420
I'd heard that Miss Zhiyan was good at heart.

182
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,200
You often do good deeds in the vicinity of Chenji Mountain. You have made a name.

183
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,970
That's too much praise.

184
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,290
Oh right, Miss Zhiyan. There's a family in dire straits down the mountain.

185
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,840
They especially need your care. How about I'll take you there now?

186
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,660
- All right!
- Let's go this way.

187
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,920
How's that okay ?

188
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,680
Miss Zhiyan? This way, please.

189
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,950
Didn't they teach you anything in the Immortal Sect?

190
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,710
Only rapers and robbers will show unlimited graciousness. Don't talk to strangers.

191
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,400
Do you know him? Are you familiar with him? You aren't and you dare walk away with him?

192
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,500
Send him off quickly.

193
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,850
I'm sorry, I suddenly remembered I have something to do. I'll take my leave.

194
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,550
Hey, hey!

195
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,650
You're bereft of good judgment. Can you be a little smarter?

196
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,700
Do you think everyone who smiles to you is actually good? So naive.

197
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,090
Why do you always think the worst of people?

198
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,830
He's wearing the Dark Guard's uniform. But have you seen a Dark Guard who talks this much?

199
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,780
- But..
- There's no but.

200
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,930
Who?

201
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,130
Miss Zhiyan.

202
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,220
Zhiyan, wake up.

203
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,830
Miss Zhiyan, are you all right?

204
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,120
What's the matter? Now you know fear?

205
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,610
Say whatever you want to. This time, you're in the right.

206
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,690
Does what I say matter? You won't listen if I tell you. Even if I did, you wouldn't understand.

207
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,160
It's hard to tell how good a person is. And it's hard to tell how terrible a bad guy can be.

208
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,140
Yes, you are right. I was too naive.

209
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,760
What do you think that disciple is up to?

210
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,940
It's pointless to ask you. Judging from his looks, he doesn't seem like someone from Wan Lu Sect.

211
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,010
Looks like he disguises himself to mingle in. Could he be from the Immortal Sects?

212
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,380
Liu Wei killed your dad. Now he sent people to kill you, tidying up the loose ends.

213
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,460
But that's not right. If that was Liu Wei, why didn't he save Brother Cangling?

214
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,900
Why he wanted to kill me instead?

215
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,420
Still thinking about your Brother Cangling?

216
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,700
Practice your skills quickly. If you have no ability, all your dreams are for naught.

217
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,300
That's right. Why didn't he save Liu Cangling?

218
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
Master, someone wore a Dark Guard's uniform and assaulted Miss Zhiyan.

219
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,330
Got hurt?

220
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,500
- Thanks for Master's concern. I didn't get hurt.
- Did Qin Zhi Yan get hurt?

221
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,510
Fortunately, I got there in time. That villain didn't get to lay a finger on her.

222
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:10,400
But it was an urgent situation. I didn't get to catch him. Forgive me.

223
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,450
- You said he was wearing a Dark Guard's uniform?
- Yes.

224
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:19,000
But he doesn't look familiar. He's not a Dark Guard.

225
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,460
I'm afraid he has someone on the inside. Continue to pursue this.

226
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,910
Yes.

227
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,170
Send this letter to Thousand Dust Pavilion.

228
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,970
What's the matter?

229
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,800
I know I shouldn't say this.

230
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,100
But Miss Zhiyan is very energetic.

231
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,270
She seldom sleeps, stays awake day and night. I really can't stand it anymore.

232
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,900
I hope that Master will assign more men for me.

233
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,640
All right. I'll assign someone in two days.

234
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,160
Thanks, Master.

235
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,100
You are dismissed.

236
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,520
Yes.

237
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,410
Awake day and night?

238
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,880
Seldom sleeps?

239
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,900
You want to join with Thousand Dust Pavilion to deal with Jiang Wu? No!

240
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,490
Wan Lu Sect will never consort with Immortal Sects.

241
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,700
Although you're someone with a high status, it's not up to you to question Master's decision.

242
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,850
I'm talking to Master.

243
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,990
Since when do you, a mere Dark Guard, get to interrupt the conversation?

244
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,070
If we don't work with the Immortal Sects, it's hard to get rid of Jiang Wu.

245
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,490
Don't the dead Dark Guards' lives matter?

246
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,940
Nothing can be accomplished without norms or standards. To join hands with the Immortal Sects,

247
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,240
it's a self-destructive action!

248
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,740
Jiang Wu of New Mountain will surely turn into big trouble.

249
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,220
While he is still not powerful yet, it's better to get rid of him sooner.

250
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,700
I have decided on this. There's no need to argue about it.

251
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,320
Today, someone disguised as a Dark Guard and assaulted Qin Zhiyan.

252
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,730
Find the person.

253
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,200
Do not allow anyone to cause disruption among the Dark Guards.

254
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,900
Yes.

255
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,650
Why work with Wan Lu Sect?

256
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,310
Senior!

257
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,310
There have been murmurs of discontent from the Immortal Sects regarding you, Master.

258
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,340
Right now, if you join hands with Wan Lu Sect, I don't know what else they will say about it.

259
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,870
Jiang Wu has been doing evil deeds in Jiangzhou City for some time.

260
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,100
But no one among the Immortal Sects inquires about it.

261
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,530
That day, I met Li Chenlan. He's a clear-headed person.

262
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,250
Under his control, Wan Lu Sect is different from what it was before.

263
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,500
Back then, the factions in Immortal Sects joined forces because they had the same goal.

264
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,800
But nowadays, the factions no longer share the same goal. How do they work together?

265
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,360
Su Yan, don't be too entangled in the situation and not see the wood for the trees.

266
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,930
Yes, Master. I have learned from you.

267
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,490
This time, you'll meet the people from Wan Lu Sect on my behalf.

268
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,080
When you encounter Jiang Wu...

269
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,030
kill him with this sword.

270
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,460
Master, this is...

271
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,450
A magical weapon that has been blessed.

272
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,350
It's the first time Master has bestowed a magical weapon for the sake of eliminating evil.

273
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,390
I noticed that Master looks troubled since coming out from seclusion training.

274
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,480
It's nothing. Be careful tomorrow.

275
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,950
Rest earlier.

276
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

277
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,160
North Hill Master, I failed to capture Qin Zhiyan.

278
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,420
I was injured by a Dark Guard instead. I'd better leave here soon.

279
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,170
North Hill Master, please get me out of Wan Lu Sect.

280
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,130
The people from the Immortal Sects are truly useless.

281
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,880
Why did you heave a sigh? If you have the energy, go practice and meditate instead.

282
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,370
Go, do meditation.

283
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,190
What lousy manual is this? It's so useless.

284
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,500
If only I could go to the Library Pavilion. There are some higher level manuals there.

285
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,940
Demoness, I miss my father.

286
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,160
Restrain yourself.

287
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,260
Why are you so cold-hearted? Don't you have times when you miss someone?

288
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,330
- Am I pretty?
- As pretty as your mother.

289
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,830
Grandfather, you are the best.

290
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,600
No. I am used to being a cold person.

291
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,920
Demoness, don't tell me you're only back here to take revenge on Li Chenlan.

292
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,070
What will you do after you take your revenge?

293
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,530
People like you from the Immortal Sects...

294
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,840
Always worrying pointlessly before doing anything.

295
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,270
The revenge hasn't even started and you are already thinking about after the revenge.

296
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,820
There will be things to do after the revenge. Be practical first.

297
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,620
All right.

298
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,080
We can't keep staying at the summit of Teasing Moon Peak.

299
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,500
Put some effort into it. Use your face to seduce Li Chenlan and get him to teach you something useful.

300
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,750
Even an authorization to enter the Library Pavilion will do.

301
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,630
Authorization to the Library Pavilion. What is that?

302
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,730
All of Wan Lu Sect's collections are stored there.

303
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,040
Everything from high-level martial art books, anecdotes, and strange tales.

304
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,380
Go look through it. Maybe you will find a way to solve our condition.

305
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,760
Then I'll research. You go get Li Chenlan's authorization.

306
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,670
You are ordering me about? I told you to go.

307
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,770
I... My legs turn to jelly when I see Li Chenlan. I can't go.

308
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,680
You are so useless.

309
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,390
Fine. I'll go.

310
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,500
By the way, you mentioned something about seduction.

311
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,170
How can love between two people be taken for a show?

312
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,590
You have no respect for love.

313
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,780
What love? I'm not interested in nor believe in it.

314
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,360
I, Lu Zhaoyao, can get anything I want myself.

315
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,030
As for going after love...

316
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,370
It is exhaustive work that may not end well.

317
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,030
I already made that mistake.

318
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,900
Enough. I'll go to Li Chenlan.

319
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,160
You stay here and don't cause any trouble.

320
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,280
Master, North Hill Master Yuan Jie would like to seek an audience with you.

321
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:04,820
Master, I found that he took out a Dark Guard's uniform last month.

322
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,580
He may have some connection with the Immortal Sects' spy who attacked Miss Zhiyan.

323
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:17,020
North Hill Master has always hated the Immortal Sect. Keep investigating further.

324
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,480
Take North Hill Master to Wu'e Hall. I'll persuade him myself.

325
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,750
Otherwise, he will not let go of our plan to collaborate with Thousand Dust Pavilion.

326
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,790
Yes.

327
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,580
The person who assaulted Qin Zhiyan is from the Immortal Sect. I've already found him.

328
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,290
Sect Leader, that is the person.

329
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,880
North Hill Master, is there anything else?

330
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,290
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

331
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,660
Sect Leader's disciple, Qin Zhiyan.

332
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,890
Why are you still standing there? Get out of my way!

333
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,050
What's the matter?

334
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,880
Guard Captain.

335
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,460
She claims to be Master's disciple.

336
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,380
It's you. I know her. Follow me.

337
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,750
Be alert guarding the door.

338
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,960
Master is having an important discussion. Wait for a while.

339
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,240
Don't speak out of turn or move about.

340
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,490
You're dismissed.

341
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,510
Master, these are the newly elected candidates for the Dark Guards.

342
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,450
Greetings, Master.

343
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,040
I have only one request for the Dark Guards.

344
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,850
You must have undivided loyalty to your master.

345
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,290
Yes, Master!

346
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,620
You're dismissed.

347
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:39,160
Nothing has changed here. It's still my style.

348
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,520
Back then, I sat here and had control of life and death.

349
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,390
I lived an extravagant life where the people feared me.

350
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,390
Recently, Master's way of doing things...

351
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,020
is in violation of the principles of Wan Lu Sect.

352
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,320
When the late Master was alive, she would never work with the Immortal Sects.

353
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,460
It's the only way for Wan Lu Sect to strive for dominance.

354
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,970
That's how we achieve to be at the top of the Jianghu world.

355
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:13,770
Therefore, please think it through before you make a move.

356
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,760
In the past, your action of removing the formation and the white jade altar...

357
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,450
at the entrance of the mountain was just a formality. What's done is done.

358
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:28,690
Currently, Jiang Wu of New Mountain behaves wildly. Indeed, we need to annihilate him.

359
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,280
But Wan Lu Sect will never work with the Immortal Sects!

360
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,210
New Mountain lies at the border of the two forces.

361
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,810
Jiang Wu made use of the sects' conflicting views to do as he pleases.

362
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:45,520
He has deeply rooted himself in Jiangzhou City. Choosing to join hands with Immortal Sects because...

363
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,040
it's the most convenient and fastest way to get rid of this scourge.

364
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,640
This is so that we will not be attacked from all sides.

365
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,490
- Master.
- This matter is settled.

366
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:18,710
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

367
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:24,630
