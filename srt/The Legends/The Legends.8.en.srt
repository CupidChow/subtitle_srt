You have too many crimes. For each crime, ten percent is deducted. So, you have no money left.

46
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
But you once saved a life and did some good deeds, so we added back a few percentages for you.

47
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,680
So adding up all the mess, if someone does one good deed for you, you only get ten percent of the amount.

That is to say that the system in this money shop

- What is it?
- New Mountain's Jiang Wu showed up in Jiangzhou City.

157
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,610
The West Hills Master, Sima Rong, lives in Jiangzhou City.

158
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,860
- We need to increase our security. Don't give Jiang Wu any opportunity.

159
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,440
Yes.

160
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,950
Right. Where's Ah Da?

161
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,720
Master Li ordered Ah Da to keep an eye on the girl from the Immortal Sects.

162
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,330
But Ah Da is one of our most skillful men.

163
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,340
The Leader is putting an overqualified person...

164
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,490
Of course, Sect Leader has his own reason for doing that.

165
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,350
Who are you to speak out of turn?

166
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,030
I was wrong.

167
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,870
Tell our people to brace themselves. Keep an eye out for Jiang Wu.

168
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,630
Yes. I shall obey your order.

169
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,050
Go.

170
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,810
Love is everywhere.

171
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,550
Can you do some good things?

172
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,630
- Pretty girl, do you want to do something good?
- No need.

173
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,680
Hey, handsome guy, do a good deed?

174
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,550
No need.

175
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,440
- Do you want to do something good?
- No.

176
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
[Will you come and do some good deeds?]

177
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
- Brother, do some good deeds?
- No.

178
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,950
There are actually people who set up a stall to do good deeds. Interesting!

179
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,050
It's a long beautiful night, with a cool night breeze.

180
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,740
Why don't you do some good deeds to assuage the loneliness?

181
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,960
All right, how do I do it?

182
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,610
Donate some clothes. Under the name of Lu Zhaoyao from Mount Chenji.

183
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,800
Do good deeds in the name of Lu Zhaoyao of Mount Chenji?

184
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,660
I really admire her. It's a shame that demoness died young.

185
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,860
What do you admire her for?

186
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,970
I heard that she was beautiful. Also, she was hard to tame.

187
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,590
Tame? He dares to use this term to describe me?

188
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,640
I've never seen such a person before. Now, I actually meet one.

189
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,570
Very well, Short-Haired Boy. You've got my attention.

190
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,940
Tell me. Why are you doing good things for her?

191
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,240
I never need a reason for doing things.

192
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,080
Interesting.

193
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,590
I'll donate this robe. Does that count as doing good deeds for her?

194
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,320
- Yes.
- Hold on.

195
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,390
I've already done something good for her. What do I get in return?

196
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,620
What do you want in return?

197
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,720
About that...

198
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,830
I want her spirit in Heaven to help fulfill a wish of mine.

199
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,590
Her spirit in Heaven?

200
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,480
All right, say it. What is your wish?

201
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,950
I want to kill Li Chenlan and take over Wan Lu Sect. I want to replace him.

202
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,500
Huh? Interesting.

203
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,800
- Ah Wu!
- All right, all right, cut it off. I know.

204
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Right, both of you quickly donate some clothes, too.

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,400
When we get into Wan Lu Sect later, Lu Zhaoyao will be our founding grandmaster.

206
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,100
A little faster.

207
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,970
Good kid.

208
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,990
You understand the rules. I admire you.

209
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
All men are mortal since the dawn of time. Would you donate some clothes?

210
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,200
No, I am not donating.

211
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Who's going to donate clothes if you shout like that?

212
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Let me help you.

213
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,800
What are you doing?

214
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,200
Didn't you see the pretty lady asking for a clothing donation?

215
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
What does that have to do with me?

216
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
You... You...

217
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,650
I'll go donate. I'll go.

218
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
You, come over here.

219
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,800
I am talking to you. Where are you running to?

220
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
He has talent and ambition.

221
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,400
- Wan Lu Sect needs exactly such a person.
- You too. Come here.

222
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
Stand here.

223
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,200
He's having fun now and this will delay our business.

224
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,400
What can we do?

225
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,200
- Let him be.
- Come over. Stand there.

226
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Stand here. Stand in a line. Don't move.

227
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
Remove it.

228
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,500
How's that? So many people are donating clothes for the Demoness. Is it enough?

229
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I really admire you.

230
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,200
You dare to set up a stall that most people dare not. Most people dare not look me in the eyes.

231
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,900
You dare, too. Why don't you work with me?

232
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
No, thanks.

233
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,800
I have my own things to do. Thanks a lot for your help tonight.

234
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,950
It's getting more and more interesting.

235
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm Jiang Wu of New Mountain. I've been recently staying in Jiangzhou City.

236
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,000
If you think it through, come see me anytime.

237
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
Move aside.

238
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,830
Oh, right!

239
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't let me find out that you left without donating any clothes.

240
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,300
- I'll donate.
- I'll donate.

241
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,200
When is this vicious man going to leave Jiangzhou City?

242
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,500
He's a real thorn. Why isn't Wan Lu Sect getting rid of him?

243
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,400
What do you understand?

244
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Why is Jiang Wu refusing to leave Jiangzhou City?

245
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,800
Because this is the border between the Immortal Sects and Wan Lu Sect.

246
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,200
Neither the Immortal Sects nor Wan Lu Sect can make a move.

247
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
- Whoever moves first will be going up against the other two.
 - Jiang Wu.

248
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Didn't you notice that Jiang Wu gained control of Su Clan's influence here?

249
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
Both the righteous and evil parties don't bother with him.

250
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I heard that on the day Jiang Wu massacred the Su Clan,

251
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,500
he didn't spare the young and the elderly in Su Clan.

252
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,400
Later on, Jiang Wu cleaned up the courtyard,

253
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,000
he didn't find it scary, he just brought his people and moved right in.

254
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He took over their area and terrorized the people.

255
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
I wish Lu Zhaoyao came back to life.

256
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Both of them are cruel and ruthless.

257
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,800
The best thing would be if they took each other down to hell.

258
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,600
Hey, young men.

259
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,200
Are you not afraid of Lu Zhaoyao really coming back to life

260
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
and joining forces with Jiang Wu?

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,200
By then, commoners like you will be in an abyss of suffering.

262
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,200
Go. Go.

263
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,380
Brother, you're wearing a frown on your brow. Is it because of the rumors in Jianghu?

264
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,500
It seems you've heard as well.

265
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,800
Yes.

266
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Qin Zhiyan slandered you without evidence.

267
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
She damaged your reputation, as well as Jian Xin Sect's reputation.

268
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,400
You can't blame her for this.

269
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,850
Brother Qin Yu still hasn't been found after missing for so many days.

270
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
I just don't understand.

271
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,600
Why is she so certain that it was my doing?

272
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,030
Something is odd about this.

273
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,400
Perhaps, someone is trying to sow dissension between Jian Xin Sect

274
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,300
and other Immortal Sects.

275
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That being the case,

276
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,800
in my opinion, we should hold a Grand Meeting.

277
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,600
We'll use the opportunity to clear up the matter.

278
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,200
We can also get the Immortal Sects to help us find the real culprit.

279
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
That sounds good, too.

280
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Then, I'll tell them to make the preparations.

281
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,100
Fine.

282
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,200
Brother.

283
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,200
I've recently heard a rumor

284
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,700
that Qin Zhiyan ran off to Wan Lu Sect.

285
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,200
Do you think this matter with Qin Yu

286
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,500
may have anything to do with Wan Lu Sect?

287
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm just guessing. I'll go prepare right now.

288
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,140
You may go now.

289
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
- I'm dead tired.
- Demoness,

290
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,000
I followed your order and stayed by the window for the entire day.

291
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,200
I didn't see anyone. Only a few birds.

292
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
It's quite tiring to do good deeds. You go tomorrow.

293
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,700
Did you encounter anything today?

294
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,200
I ran into a red short-haired guy. He's quite interesting.

295
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,970
Why the sigh?

296
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,200
I'm missing someone from afar.

297
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,590
I miss my old friends.

298
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
You think too much because you live too little.

299
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
While I was busy doing good deeds, you spent the day feeling melancholy.

300
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,500
Tomorrow, wake up earlier and get out there. Don't come back until you are dead tired.

301
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,680
How can you be like this?

302
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,610
Demoness.

303
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Demoness!

304
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Demoness, don't sleep just yet.

305
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.

306
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I... I want to know how Brother Cangling is doing.

307
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
He either got locked up or thrown out.

308
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,400
So is he locked up or thrown out?

309
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
I don't know.

310
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,540
Brother Cangling,

311
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,900
how are you right now?

312
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Ah Wu, you gave the cloak to that woman.

313
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
She seems like a daredevil. She must have a powerful background.

314
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,400
We just took over New Mountain. Everyone is jealous of us.

315
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,600
I think we should lay low for now.

316
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,000
What are you afraid of?

317
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Exactly. What are you afraid of?

318
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Ah Wu even gave Wan Lu Sect a slap on its face. Will he be afraid of others?

319
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,300
I want to do more than slap their faces.

320
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,200
Jiang Wu is too arrogant.

321
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,800
He swaggers through the streets with his subordinates as if deliberately making his presence known.

322
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,100
This time, we can easily capture him.

323
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,000
[Favorable East Wind]

324
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,490
Right.

325
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,200
Do you think you can catch me just by being one step ahead?

326
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,600
Look and see who the prey is now.

327
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,400
Abominable!

328
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,700
I can't move anymore.

329
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,800
- Take them to the dungeon.
- Yes.

330
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Ah Wu, what do you want to do with them?

331
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,200
Same old method.

332
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,170
Demoness, where are you going?

333
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,000
To do good deeds. The short-haired guy from yesterday was quite interesting.

334
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,800
If I run into him, I can save a lot of work.

335
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
But other people can't see you.

336
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,060
Right, then you go.

337
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,200
I want to go after eating breakfast. Is that okay?

338
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,200
No.

339
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,100
Go!

340
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,000
We caught an idiot from Jian Xin Sect in the Forbidden Area.

341
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Right now, he's being held in the dungeon. He is a good catch.

342
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,770
Don't say that I didn't look after you.

343
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
How so?

344
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,800
The guards cast a Power Absorption Spell on that fool.

345
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
Really?

346
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,600
Don't forget to get your share, Brother.

347
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Brother Cangling.

348
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,680
Demoness! Demoness!

349
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,670
What are you doing?

350
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,990
Demoness, can you tell me how to save him?

351
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,700
Save who?

352
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,220
Brother Cangling! He is locked in the dungeon. Your Wan Lu Sect's prison drains people's power.

353
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,790
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

354
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,120
I didn't know. Furthermore,

355
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,500
Wan Lu Sect's prison doesn't drain power from just anyone.

356
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,090
Right now, he's barely alive. Why did you send him there?

357
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:04,500
Are you blaming me? It's you who refused to let him take you away.

358
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,020
Now that he is dying and can't try to take you away again, you also don't want that.

359
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,620
Why are you always reluctant? It's hard to please you.

360
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,800
How... How is that the same?

361
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,270
Forget it. I'll stop talking to you. I'm going to save him.

362
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,480
Save what? Do you know how to save him?

363
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,850
Tell me, please.

364
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
Zhiyan...

365
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,560
Do you know what place this is? Get lost.

366
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,990
Be arrogant. The more arrogant I am, the less likely they will mess with me.

367
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,800
If... If you have the nerve, say that again.

368
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,720
Do... Do you know who I am? I am Sect Leader's disciple.

369
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,600
Disciple?

370
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,880
You... no.

371
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,140
I... we... In Wan Lu Sect...

372
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,580
There's no place that I can't go. Do you know?

373
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,700
Nonsense. Why is Sect Leader's disciple here at the dungeon?

374
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,000
I... Mind your business!

375
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,200
Do you know what my master did to the guard yesterday?

376
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,620
If you don't let me in, you'll have to bear the consequences. Open the gate!

377
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,380
Let's go.

378
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,990
The person you want to see is there.

379
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,060
Brother Cangling!

380
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,390
Zhiyan...

381
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,600
This is Wan Lu Sect's Power Absorption Spell.

382
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,790
- Zhiyan...
- Brother Cangling.

383
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:33,060
You must hold on. I will definitely think of a method to save you.

384
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,270
Master, Lady Changyu sent you an invitation to attend a Grand Meeting in two days time.

385
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,720
[To Thousand Dust Pavillion Leader]

386
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,650
[To discuss our mission of stopping evil doers.]

387
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,820
Lady Changyu is normally hands-off toward Jianghu. Recently, she's making a lot of moves.

388
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,280
I'm afraid something suspicious will happen at Phoenix Mountain.

389
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,000
Are we attending the meeting at Phoenix Mountain?

390
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,170
Yes. We need to go and find out the reason.

391
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,000
[Qing Ying Pavilion]
(Soundless Music Pavillion)

392
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,640
Master.

393
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,960
You dare to interrupt the sound of Heaven? How crude. Leave us.

394
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,580
But it's a letter from Jian Xin Sect.

395
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,900
Let me see.

396
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,720
[Meet at Phoenix Mountain in three days to discuss how to combat Wan Lu Sect.]

397
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,880
It's the Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sects.

398
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,500
I recently heard Thousand Dust Pavillion Leader Qin's brother, Qin Yu, went missing.

399
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,890
His only daughter said that Sect Leader Liu killed him.

400
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,300
The meeting must be to clarify this matter.

401
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,540
Boring. I'm not interested in going.

402
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,700
Wait.

403
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,060
Qin Yu is Qin Qianxian's brother,

404
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,790
and Sect Leader Liu is holding this meeting for this purpose. Will Qin Qianxian attend?

405
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,790
Pavillion Leader Qin has accepted the invitation.

406
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,750
That's rare.

407
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,020
In that case, I should go.

408
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,830
I haven't seen him for so many years. I wonder how he looks now.

409
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,310
You are attending a meeting, not a beauty competition.

410
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't know about you people.

411
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,970
I'm going exactly for the purpose of competing for looks.

412
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,160
I'll go back to dress up and pack my things.

413
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,420
Is he going to die for sure?

414
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,040
Stop crying.

415
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,530
I'll help you think of an idea.

416
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,800
Make use of your disciple status to get some pills to keep Liu Cangling alive.

417
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,060
Then bribe or threaten the guards at the gate.

418
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,800
With the excuse that you want Liu Cangling's power for yourself, have them remove the spell.

419
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,950
When his power is restored, create an opportunity for him to escape.

420
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,610
Demoness, you're so clever.

421
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,110
Rubbish.

422
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,980
I'll get to it.
