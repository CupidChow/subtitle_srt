00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,960
I heard there was a celebration today for the Immortal Sects. I came to join the fun

4
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,790
and bring along a big gift!

5
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,300
What kind of gift are you giving?

6
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,030
Using your blood as a sacrifice for Phoenix Mountain to celebrate your big day.

7
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,430
It already sounds celebratory, am I right?

8
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,480
That's preposterous! Today is a day of great rejoicing.

9
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,070
How dare you be so impudent!

10
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,030
Suruo.

11
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,970
Don't force me to kill you.

12
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,460
Force you? No, you already want to kill me.

13
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,180
But you have it backwards today.

14
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,340
Today, I'm killing you.

15
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,120
Little lady, you made me think of some unpleasant things.

16
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,220
Oh, then you should adjust yourself.

17
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,800
Hurry and leave. I'll take care of this place.

18
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,860
Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

19
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,710
Just because you have the heavenly sword, you think you can run wild in the Immortal Sect and go against me?

20
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,300
I am not interested in why you are posing as Qin Zhiyan.

21
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,840
As long as you're not a hindrance to me, I won't be in your way either.

22
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,410
It may be a bit difficult to run wild in the Immortal Sect, but to go against you?

23
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,030
That's easy.

24
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,870
Your tone and expression are too much like someone.

25
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,080
It's completely loathsome.

26
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,450
You talk too much.

27
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,220
Liu Wei, capture the one without a sword.

28
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,770
Hurry and leave.

29
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,260
Watch over Jin Xian. Initiate the formation.

30
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,370
Yes.

31
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,090
Leave first. Protect yourself. I'll be right behind you.

32
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,360
- No. We said we'll leave together!
- Stop talking nonsense, I won't die!

33
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,020
Find a safe place and wait for me. My life is now dependent on yours.

34
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,690
Leave!

35
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,400
Leave!

36
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,220
Demon-Shield Ward!

37
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,340
What's going on?

38
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,990
Yea, what's happening?

39
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,490
What's happening? What's going on?

40
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,020
The Demon-Shield Ward! Look!

41
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,740
- What happened?
- I don't know.

42
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,020
What's that?

43
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,210
Look! Look!

44
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,420
The Demon-Shield Ward!

45
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,940
The Demon-Shield Ward appeared!

46
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,580
It's true!

47
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,520
Demon Li, the Demon-Shield Ward is already in motion.

48
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,970
Today, you will die for sure!

49
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,680
All the scores of these many years will be settled today!

50
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,160
When Jin Xian wakes, I, Chi Tianming,

51
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,620
will deserve top credits!

52
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,770
Jin Xian wakes up? Without my permission, no one is waking up.

53
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,600
Anyone who tries to wake him, should go accompany him!

54
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,030
Mo Qing.

55
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,130
Still want to run?

56
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,800
If you beg for mercy now and follow my will, perhaps I'll let you live.

57
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,250
You want me to beg? Not possible.

58
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,610
Now you have lost your weapon; you have no way out.

59
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,400
If you kneel and beg for mercy, maybe I'll be lenient for a moment

60
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,810
and let you keep your life.

61
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,400
You want me to beg? Not possible.

62
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,290
You want to not die,

63
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,590
not possible!

64
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,710
No.

65
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,720
Lu Zhaoyao, you can't kill me.

66
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,850
No!

67
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,690
But you'll never wake up.

68
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,580
Grandpa...

69
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,480
Grandpa...

70
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,470
Mingxuan! Mingxuan!

71
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,430
Mingxuan, don't leave me behind! Mingxuan!

72
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,400
Mingxuan!

73
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,260
He's definitely leaving you behind.

74
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,690
If you're not content, you can go with him.

75
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,740
Lu Zhaoyao, I swear

76
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,890
as long as I live, I'll definitely wake him up.

77
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,020
By then, it'll be time for you to die!

78
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,210
The Demon-Shield Ward. They actually activated the Demon-Shield Ward!

79
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,350
Brother Cangling!

80
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,780
Brother Cangling! I...

81
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,310
Brother Cangling?

82
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,480
Why is he the same as Liu Wei?

83
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,980
Brother Cangling, what's wrong with you? Brother Cangling, I'm Zhiyan.

84
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,300
Zhiyan.

85
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,970
Zhiyan.

86
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,890
Oh no! Someone must've attacked Zhiyan.

87
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,160
The Demon-Shield Ward is already in motion. Today, you'll have no way to escape.

88
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,410
Run? I didn't think about running.

89
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,950
What is that?

90
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,420
The launch of a myriad of swords; looks like the Demon-Shield Ward is starting.

91
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,370
The Demon-Shield Ward?

92
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,190
Tell me a bit. What is the Demon-Shield Ward?

93
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,710
This...

94
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,090
Tell me.

95
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,310
When Lu Zhaoyao surrounded Jinzhou City that year,

96
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,100
there were hundreds of sword-casting families in Jinzhou. Many of them donated swords

97
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,180
to make the 10,000 Sword Array, above the city of Jinzhou, that fended off Lu Zhaoyao's attack.

98
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,030
When Lu Zhaoyao retreated, in memory of that war,

99
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,700
the Jianxin Sect, on the model of that year's 10,000 Sword Array, created the Demon-Shield Ward.

100
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,030
When this Ward perceives demon essence, it will trigger an agglomeration of golden swords.

101
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,350
No demon spirit in the city will have any place to hide.

102
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,830
Everyone knows about this in Jianghu. You don't know it?

103
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,600
I don't know it.

104
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,550
Then, I need to tell you about it.

105
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,230
Ever since Li Chenlan took over Wan Lu Sect,

106
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,700
the frictions in Jianghu have gradually abated.

107
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,500
So this Demon-Shield Ward, of course, is mentioned very rarely. But the fame of the ward still exists.

108
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,740
I wonder who the suicidal fool is who dared break through the ward.

109
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,940
I guess it's that new demon with a disproportionate arrogance, Jiang Wu!

110
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,800
They all say that a young calf has no fear of tigers; I think he's the only one who could do something like this.

111
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,630
Then, tell me, why would Jiang Wu risk his safety breaking through the ward?

112
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,900
This...

113
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,280
Hey, I guess the person who broke through the ward should be Li Chenlan.

114
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,720
Why is it Li Chenlan?

115
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,250
The young lady of Xuanyu Hall, Qin Zhiyan... You've all heard of her?

116
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,000
This young lady was firmly convinced that Liu Wei killed her father. She wouldn't listen to anyone's advice.

117
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,890
She broke her engagement with the young lord of Jianxin Sect, ran to Wan Lu Sect alone and took Li Chenlan as Master.

118
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,900
What you all don't know is that in Wan Lu Sect this Qin Zhiyan won over Li Chenlan's deep affection!

119
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,430
If she frowns, Li Chenlan will chop people's heads off!

120
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,600
So, I say, today's stirrings must be Li Chenlan coming to take revenge for her.

121
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
That's it?

122
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,280
What else do you want to know?

123
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,660
First, Qin Zhiyan does not belong to Li Chenlan.

124
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
She belongs to me, Jiang Wu.

125
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,470
Jiang Wu!

126
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,900
Second, I don't like people seeing me as dumb.

127
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,370
As for you, who told you to sit here?

128
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,280
You again?

129
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,850
Pavilion Master Qin.

130
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,690
Hurry and leave.

131
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,900
Did I say he can leave?

132
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:06,190
Qin Qianxian, then I'll just have fun here with you.

133
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,150
Brother Cangling, do you not recognize me?

134
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,210
Brother Cangling!

135
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,370
Who turned you into this?

136
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,720
Brother Cangling, who turned you into this?

137
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,510
Brother Cangling!

138
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,610
You said, you'd always take care of me.

139
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,220
You'd never hurt me. Did you forget?

140
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,490
Brother Cangling.

141
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,900
Brother Cangling!

142
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,130
Leave!

143
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,430
Brother Cangling!

144
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,040
Find a safe place to hide. My life is now dependent on yours.

145
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,110
You understand me very well.

146
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,590
You're my mistake.

147
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,520
Seems like we're not the only ones fighting today.

148
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,730
I'm sure there will be many corpses in Jinzhou City. I can have a good meal again.

149
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,860
You're angry?

150
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Let's keep fighting!

151
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's see how you'll escape this time.

152
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,140
My sword hasn't had enough fresh blood.

153
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,660
I guess we'll have to kill a chicken.

154
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,930
You, alone, dare come to our Jianxin Sect courting death!

155
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,020
- You talk too much.
- You must die today.

156
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,130
Don't be afraid. I'll take you away.

157
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,350
Come.

158
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,240
No one is leaving today!

159
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,460
Liu Wei, raise the sacred sword!

160
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,600
I didn't imagine the Demon-Shield Ward also had a second attack.

161
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,620
Master, let me help you.

162
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,930
Today, we'll crush this fabled Demon-Shield Ward.

163
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,750
Let's show those dumb Immortal Sect people who the real Big Demon is.

164
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,570
Fine. Today we're crushing this Demon-Shield Ward!

165
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,200
[Qing Yin Hall]

166
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,590
In the end, there was also another whiff of evil energy that struck the sword array.

167
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,510
Let's go.

168
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,620
[Eternal as sun and moon]

169
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,930
I will break you, my mistake, today.

170
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,790
All right.

171
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,420
Qin Qianxian, today is just the beginning.

172
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,000
Master, your face just now

173
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,390
was different from usual.

174
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,360
Are you scared of me?

175
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,410
I don't love hypocrites who put on an act,

176
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,750
yet I love the genuine one who cares and loves me.

177
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,360
Master! Master!

178
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,630
Master!

♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

180
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:32,820
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

181
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,250
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

182
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,330
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

183
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:47,750
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

184
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:55,310
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

185
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:02,700
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

186
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:10,230
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

187
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:21,000
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

188
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,830
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

189
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:47,820
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

190
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,240
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

191
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,170
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

192
00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:02,770
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

193
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:10,260
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

194
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:17,700
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

♫ This uproar hasn't settled.  ♫

197
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:40,200
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

198
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:47,710
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

199
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:55,360
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

200
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:06,000
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
