[Episode 50]

3
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,740
Now New Mountain's Jiang Wu has been killed.

4
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,540
I, Luo Mingxuan, am back on Phoenix Mountain.

5
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,010
I'll wield control over the Immortal Sect to the common fulfillment of our great cause.

6
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,780
Welcome back, Jin Xian!

7
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,720
Jin Xian the Enlightened!

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,530
Before we attack the Wan Lu Sect, we need to purge the Immortal Sect.

9
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,480
Notify all the sects to be on Phoenix Mountain in three days.

10
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,300
Regarding Jin Xiu, if you find him, just dispose of him.

11
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,270
Yes.

12
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,270
- This...
- Is his health seriously affected?

13
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,190
His health has no problem. It's just that to treat this wound...

14
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,300
This doesn't concern you.

15
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,700
- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

16
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,440
It would be all right if Gu Hanguang were still here.

17
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,900
Sect Leader, are you all right?

18
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,850
- I'm fine.
- Demoness, what's with Li Chenlan?

19
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,200
This Wanjun Sword is becoming more and more domineering.

20
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,510
Demoness, don't worry too much for now. We still have good news today.

21
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,880
From the Thousand Dust Pavillion, they told me that my uncle woke up.

22
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,210
Beautiful One is awake?

23
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,270
Really? Oh! That's great! It's great!

24
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,350
It's too great!

25
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,530
Yes, we can say there's one good thing.

26
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,120
Call out your sect leader!

27
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,910
It is too late for today! Go back for now.

28
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,060
Cut the crap! Call her out!

29
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,150
Cut the crap! Call her out, right now!

30
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,650
Sect Leader Chi, what is the meaning of this?

31
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,690
Tang Yun, is Jin Xiu in?

32
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,170
If you're looking for Jin Xiu, you should go to the Tianxuan Sect.

33
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,400
Why did you come to my Qingyin Sect?

34
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,240
Drop the act. Jin Xiu hasn't been back to Tianxuan Sect for several days.

35
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,220
Who in Jianghu doesn't know that you two have been close friends for many years?

36
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,370
If he didn't come to you, who else could he have gone to?

37
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm really sorry, Sect Leader Chi. Today, Jin Xiu is not in my house.

38
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,530
Whether he is or not, we'll know after a search.

39
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,470
Search!

40
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,260
Sect Leader Tang! Do you know that Jin Xiu went against Jin Xian?

41
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,850
By now, he's a traitor of the Immortal Sects.

42
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:58,470
If you hinder my actions, you'll be charged with the crime of sheltering a traitor.

43
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,480
If Jin Xian finds you guilty, I won't be able to do anything to help you even if I want to.

44
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,590
All right. I just want to see what you can find.

45
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,670
Search.

46
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,380
By today, Luo Mingxuan will already be on Phoenix Mountain.

47
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,360
He may send people looking for me very soon.

48
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,590
Where are you planning to go next?

49
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,920
You don't need to know. Some things are actually safer if you don't know them.

50
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,160
About the news I gave you,

51
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,630
I'll trouble you to take a few trips and tell the other sect leaders.

52
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,270
I've been running around for the Tianxuan Sect all my life. I've gone left and right several times.

53
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,110
Having a close friend like you is a rare thing.

54
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,740
I'll come back to see you.

55
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,090
Sect Leader, we didn't find Lord Jin Xiu.

56
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,090
The disciples sought every room, without finding him.

57
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,600
What?

58
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Sect Leader Chi, do you still have anything to say?

59
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,730
Fine. Since we haven't found Jin Xiu, that's it.

60
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,680
But, Sect Leader Tang, please listen to a word of advice.

61
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,410
Jin Xiu's heart has no sincerity.

62
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:44,410
It's best if you draw a line between yourself and him.

63

[Thousand Dust Pavillion]

64
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,410
Pavillion Leader, your awakening is truly a great fortune.

65
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,310
Thank you, Sect Leader Shen.

66
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,990
The Thousand Dust Pavillion... Do you know that Luo Mingxuan is still alive?

67
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,060
Also, I heard that he's the one who killed Jiang Wu.

68
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,590
The power he used is extremely similar to that which destroyed the Xu Zong Sect.

69
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm afraid if the matter of the Xu Zong Sect really--

70
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,530
Is there any evidence?

71
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,590
It was Tang Yun and Jin Xiu who brought me this news. I'm only speculating.

72
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,030
Pavillion Leader, Qingyin Sect Leader Tang is seeking an audience.

73
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,690
I heard that Pavillion Leader Qin woke up and I came visiting.

74
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Sect Leader Shen is here, too.

75
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,740
Jin Xiu asked me to personally deliver this letter to you, Pavillion Leader Qin.

76
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,070
What do you two think?

77
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,400
If Jin Xian really did as the letter says,

78
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,720
then he is Hanguang's murderer. I won't let him off.

79
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,060
The Thousand Dust Pavillion has long since retreated from the ten great Immortal Sects.

80
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,160
It is unwilling to be involved in Jianghu's grievances.

[Jianxin Sect]

82
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,950
You are saying that in the destruction of the Xu Zong Sect was Jin Xian's doing?

83
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,240
- Precisely.
- Young Master, do you have any proof?

84
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,420
Even now, you still won't believe my words?

85
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,550
This is no trivial matter.

86
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,590
I dare not believe your words alone.

87
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,220
Sect Leader, Jin Xian sent news. A summons to the Immortal Sect meeting in three days.

88
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,070
I understand. You're dismissed.

89
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,580
Yes.

90
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,510
It sounds like a Hongmen Banquet.
(T/N: from a historical event, it means a treacherous situation)

91
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,170
Sect Leader, you are awake.

92
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,540
Sect Leader, please calm your anger.

93
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,080
What happened?

94
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,790
Mo Qing.

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,080
Little Monster's eyes turned red!

96
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,350
Hey, why are you going mad, Little Monster? You want to fight?

97
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,620
Mo Qing!

98
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,310
You want to kill me?

99
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,000
You all get out. Seventeen, call Sima Rong here.

100
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,910
Sima Rong? What are you calling him for?

101
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,120
Mo Qing. Mo Qing, calm down. Mo Qing!

102
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,770
Mo Qing! Mo Qing!

103
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,010
Mo Qing. Mo Qing.

104
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,740
My name is Li Chenlan. I once asked you for directions, old sir.

105
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,630
Boss. Boss? Boss?

106
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,980
What are you doing?

107
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,410
Since the time you met Brother-in-Law, you've been constantly spacing out.

108
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,650
My days are probably a few now.

109
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,690
Boss, don't talk nonsense!

110
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,870
Lately, my memory is getting worse and worse.

111
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,200
My forgetfulness instead is growing.

112
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,430
Furthermore, I feel your brother-in-law looks familiar.

113
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,060
- His name is...
- Li Chenlan.

114
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,460
Li Chenlan...

115
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,600
Boss, where are you going now?

116
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm going to look at previous events in the Mirror of Past Memories.

117
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,060
Many people say that after looking at the Mirror of Past Memories

118
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,010
your wealth will be swept clean.

119
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,150
At my age, what would I want so much money for?

120
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,230
Isn't life just about understanding?

121
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,140
Descendent of the Li family, do you recognize me?

122
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,810
I'm here to bring you domination with unparalleled glory.

123
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,680
As long as you submit yourself to me,

124
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,560
you will possess an almighty force.

125
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,670
You are holding a demon inside. I should kill you.

126
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,900
But this is all my sin.

127
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,500
You have no fault for this.

128
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,840
Let your father think of a way.

[Pure Wave Palace]

130
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,940
He wasn't like this a moment ago.

131
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,300
Seventeen, you can go now.

132
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,920
- But I...
- Behave.

133
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,730
All right.

134
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Chenlan, your eyes...

135
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,870
Mo Qing, tell me.

136
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,880
What did you do with Jiang Wu on Fengmo Mountain?

137
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,700
Zhaoyao...

138
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,260
You wish to go out.

139
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
Who are you?

140
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
I am Wanjun.

141
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Can you help me?

142
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
As long as you and I become one.

143
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Don't suppress the force in your blood any longer.

144
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,600
Follow it. Follow me!

145
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,500
Then, you'll obtain Wanjun Sword's full force.

146
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,200
Do you not wish to save Lu Zhaoyao?

147
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I do.

148
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Your strength should not be suppressed at all!

149
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,680
I was imprisoned in the seal.

150
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,000
In order to get out, I borrowed Wanjun Sword's strength.

151
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
Wanjun Sword's strength.

152
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,800
Back in the year that Chenlan came out of Fengmo Mountain,

153
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,600
your face bore the mark of the seal.

154
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
During the battle of the Sword Tomb, Chenlan, you pulled out Wanjun Sword

155
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,800
and the mark disappeared.

156
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,000
Hanguang in the past urged you to use the Wanjun Sword less,

157
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,400
but now you've also borrowed Wanjun Sword's strength

158
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,700
to break through the seal of Fengmo Mountain.

159
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Becoming like this.

160
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,100
Your Demon Essence is related to the Wanjun Sword.

161
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Mo Qing, you can't use the Wanjun Sword anymore.

162
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
You have to seal it away.

163
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,800
Luo Mingxuan is still there.

164
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,600
He will surely rally the Immortal Sects together to attack the Wan Lu Sect.

165
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,300
Lately, the Wan Lu Sect has been upset by internal strife.

166
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,400
I want to protect you.

167
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,230
Mo Qing,

168
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,200
don't shoulder my grudges for me anymore.

169
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,000
I didn't come to this life to kill Luo Mingxuan.

170
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,700
I came to protect you.

171
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,630
All right. I'll go seal off the Wanjun Sword.

172
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,740
This Wanjun Sword was born in the Sword Tomb.

173
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,020
Maybe that place is the best choice.

174
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,100
As soon as your health is a little steadier, we'll set out to the Sword Tomb.

175
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Although you can give me unparalleled strength,

176
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,950
but I'm not willing to be under your control.

177
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,000
On this day, I'm sealing you here.

178
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,800
If I lose my conscienceness,

179
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
no matter how great the power,

180
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,500
what good is it?

181
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,600
Chenlan, even if the Wanjun Sword is sealed,

182
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,000
from now on, you also can't use any more power.

183
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,400
You won't be any different from ordinary people.

184
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
And I will pose no threat to ordinary people, either.

185
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Chenlan, are you afraid?

186
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Are you afraid that one day you won't be able to control yourself

187
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
and kill Zhaoyao?

188
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,160
I'm also afraid to hurt innocents.

189
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Ah Rong, since I was sealed in Fengmo Mountain, it's been a rough path,

190
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,200
a rugged wandering. I once thought that there would be no harm in subverting this world.

191
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,800
But the appearance of one person

192
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,700
made me love this world that once disgusted me.

193
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,300
I want to protect Zhaoyao

194
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,100
and also protect these mountains and rivers, and this earth that gave birth to her.

195
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
What are you chatting about?

196
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
We are talking about what a person lives for.

197
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,400
The Wan Lu Sect people always used to laugh at me, saying

198
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,800
that I was the most gentle person in this Wan Lu Sect.

199
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I also used to think so.

200
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,000
But on this day, I finally know

201
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
that the most gentle person is someone else.

202
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,200
It is getting late. I'll go home now.

203
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Let's go for a walk.

204
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,100
Today, Chenlan told me

205
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,600
that he wants to protect Zhaoyao

206
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,720
and protect the mountains, rivers, and earth that gave her life.

207
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Such words are so sweet and gentle.

208
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,700
I used to think

209
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
that I'd devoted all my heart to Yuezhu.

210
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,600
When Yuezhu passed,

211
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,800
my world lost nine parts

212
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,500
out of ten shades of color.

213
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,400
But today, seeing Chenlan,

214
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,810
I finally realized how narrow my view was.

215
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,760
I was selfish.

216
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,000
I couldn't let go of my obsession.

217
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,450
And I was timid, too.

218
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,400
I couldn't be straight with you about this dark thought.

219
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You were not Yuezhu.

220
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,010
You were you.

221
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
It was me

222
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,170
who thought it wrong.

223
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,600
This earth where Yuezhu once came,

224
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,960
every weed and every tree,

225
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
it should all be treated with gentleness.

226
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:01,720
Jin Xian, yesterday, I went to visit the Qingyin Sect. But I didn't find any trace of Jin Xiu.

227
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,590
If he doesn't make an appearance,

228
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,110
then take down the entire Tianxuan Sect, and you won't have to worry about Jin Xiu not showing up.

229
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,210
I also think so, therefore I have already informed all of the sect leaders in your name.

230
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,190
Going forward, Fengshan will be taking over Tianxuan Sect.

231
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,280
Sect Leader Chi, you surely have meticulous thinking.

232
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,430
- Thank you for the praise.
- But... next time you use my name to issue an edict,

233
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,560
It would be better to let me know.

234
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,490
Yes.

235
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,740
I was thoughtless in my considerations. I overstepped.

236
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,580
Forget it.

237
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,820
It's a small matter. Forget it.

238
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,380
Go call Lin Ziyu back here for me. I have something to discuss with her.

239
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,980
Yes.

240
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,320
You've already killed Jiang Wu. When do you plan to attack the Wan Lu Sect?

241
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,340
You're so impatient.

242
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,770
This is the reason I gave you the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

243
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:23,010
Don't be impatient. First, go back to the Wan Lu Sect and help me scout out information.

244
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,170
After I consider the information, I will then understand when to attack.

245
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,490
What situation do you want to know about?

246
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,990
When I went to Fengmo Mountain, I saw Li Chenlan.

247
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:41,000
His entire body was full of Demon Essence to the point where it was beyond control.

248
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,390
I ignored how deep his power was.

249
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,270
You go have a look first at the Wan Lu Sect's recent activities.

250
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,840
Okay.

251
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,220
In regards to Lu Zhaoyao and the Wan Lu Sect, don't worry.

252
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,510
Lu Zhaoyao must die.

253
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,650
All of this came about because of the Demon King's son.

254
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:12,160
Therefore, the Demon King's bloodline must ultimately

255
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,560
be ended by my hands.

256
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,350
Do you feel that during this period, Zhiyan has been managing the Wan Lu Sect well?

257
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,740
A young lady from an upstanding family in the Immortal Sect, she has some natural talent for power tactics.

258
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,160
She knows how to assess control and balance.

259
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,320
She is doing very well.

260
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,030
Once life is steadier, I want to let all of these matters to be handled by other people.

261
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,080
You and I can be just like this,

262
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,980
Holding hands, we can travel to the ends of the earth.

263
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,750
We can look at the moon in the sky, feel the wind of the world, and live the most normal life.

264
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,600
You don't want to be the highest ruler?

265
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,540
Just being the ruler of your heart is enough.

266
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,790
That you achieved a long time ago.

267
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,220
Although I really don't want to mention it, Luo Mingxuan still lives.

268
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,660
And in the future, we still don't know how much bloodshed and how many disasters will have to be endured.

269
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,020
And the Liuhe Tianyi Sword...

270
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,230
I really regret sending you to you take the sword back then.

271
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,820
The entire situation was due to my own choice.

272
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,500
Don't think too much of it; a needless bother.

273
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,620
That's true.

274
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,240
But, Mo Qing, rest assured.

275
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,390
I will take care of you.

276
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,740
Once we come back from the Sword Tomb, let's finish our incomplete wedding.

277
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,340
Okay.

278
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,110
I still remember

279
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:27,300
that the last time we met like this, Suruo was still by my side.

280
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,550
It's a pity. The right course was tossed aside.

281
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,260
Our sect has endured hardships.

282
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,770
Moreover, a rat like Jin Xiu has appeared.

283
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,080
But everyone can relax.

284
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,800
From today on, I will take on the responsibilities of Jix Xian once again.

285
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,650
I'll lead the Immortal Sect to recover the glory we once had.

286
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,340
Now that Jiang Wu has been killed,

287
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,270
only the Wan Lu Sect remains as an obstacle to our great undertaking.

288
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,610
As long as you all follow me,

289
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:13,620
the day of the Immortal Sect's new flourishing can be expected soon.

290
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:23,070
Jin Xian, there is something that I don't understand.

291
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,420
Your severe injury is just starting to heal, how is it possible that in such a short period of time,

292
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,290
your power has grown so much and you were able to defeat Jiang Wu?

293
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,620
Qin Qianxian! What do you mean by this?

294
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,540
I am also extremely curious.

295
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,630
About Jin Xian's persistent good luck.

296
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,280
Liu Cangling! As a young one, why are you following him in rising up?

297
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,080
It looks like everyone has a misunderstanding about me.

298
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,540
I heard a rumor in Jianghu that it was me, Luo Mingxuan, who killed Jiang He

299
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:10,000
and even stole the Xu Zong Sect's secret art to increase my power.

300
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,710
A wise man does not believe in rumors.

301
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,650
I hope that none of you will lightly believe in such infamy.

302
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,790
Jin Xian, all this power in your body...

303
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,480
Suruo, before dying,

304
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,120
not only sacrificed her life to protect me, but also left me all the power at the ending of her life.

♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

306

00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,100
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

317
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,190
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

318
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:37,680
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

319
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,140
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

320
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,810
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

321
00:40:52,670 --> 00:41:00,110
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

322
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:07,650
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

323
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:15,160
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and Earth are shaken  ♫

324
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:22,680
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

325
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:30,210
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

326
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:41,780
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
