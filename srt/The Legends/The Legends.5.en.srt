[The Legends]

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,860
[Episode 5]

3
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,260
Lu Zhaoyao! You are a wicked woman. You must die today!

4
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,060
Where is the Sect Leader?

5
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,050
Inside the Sword Tomb.

6
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,770
Wanjun Sword.

7
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,300
The Sword Tomb.

8
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,080
Sect Leader!

9
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,950
- Wanjun Sword is coming into the world.
- The ancient enchanted sword has immense power.

10
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,180
It must not fall into their hands. Fight for a quick win!

11
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
- Revered Lady Changyu!
- Revered Lady Changyu!

12
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,000
The Demoness was heavily injured by the miasma from the sword pedestal. Today, she can't escape here.

13
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,760
She must be put to the sword today and pay for the evil from these few years.

14
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,920
I was careless! I fell into the Immortal Sect's ambush.

15
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,100
Sect Leader,

16
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,820
your wound is serious.

17
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,280
Why are you here?

18
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,760
Your wounds need tending immediately.

19
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,010
The wounds don't matter.

20
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,610
Wanjun Sword is emerging today. I must get it!

21
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,520
But your wounds...

22
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,280
Little monster... Did I use to call you that?

23
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,460
This look he has... is it...

24
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,540
Mo Qing,

25
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,760
do you love me?

26
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,630
Sure enough.

27
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,450
This Silver Mirror is my personal belonging.

28
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,150
I forgot who gave it to me. But it should be a precious item.

29
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,830
Today,

30
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,650
if you help me leave here unscathed,

31
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,530
I promise to set you above and rule over the masses in Jianghu.

32
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,200
This silver mirror

33
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,660
is yours, as a token.

34
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,020
No.

35
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,290
You don't need to give me anything.

36
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,580
Keep it.

37
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,120
Just keep it for yourself.

38
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,110
He's is a romantic.

39
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,200
Mo Qing,

40
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,680
draw those Immortal Sect followers away from me, can you?

41
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,160
Sect Leader,

42
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,210
I would give up everything for you,

43
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,350
as long as you're safe.

44
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,960
You can give up everything for me.

45
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,070
Isn't that just because you have nothing?

46
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,320
A moment ago Baishui Jianxin Sword detected a thread of magic power. It seems Lu Zhaoyao is close.

47
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,120
I won't let anything happen to you.

48
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,100
A man from the Wan Lu Sect?

49
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,100
Wanjun Sword is coming into the world.

50
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,050
Wanjun Sword.

51
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,230
Zhaoyao can finally fulfill her wish.

52
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,180
This sword's voice is calling out to me.

53
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,960
Can't touch it!

54
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,410
The sword belongs to Zhaoyao.

55
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,110
Let go!

56
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,390
Let go now!

57
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,160
Let go! Wanjun Sword can only know one master!

58
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,220
Let go!

59
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,170
Why? For what reason?

60
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,020
Why am I unable to let go?

61
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,370
You little monster!

62
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,250
You really are the son of the Demon King!

63
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,590
Enduring hardships for years,

64
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,460
guarding the gate, it was just to use me!

65
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,270
You rascal... What a schemer!

66
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,030
I'm an infamous demoness.

67
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,090
The day I died,

68
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,940
it was when the ancient magic artifact, Wanjun Sword, reappeared in the world.

69
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,100
I gave my all and suffered every sort of pain

70
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,280
to get Wanjun Sword, to ascend to the highest position in Jianghu.

71
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,780
I'd never thought that in the end

72
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,560
it would become a gift for someone else.

73
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,440
Thinking of all my efforts throughout this life,

74
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,180
I really can't accept it.

75
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,190
[Five years later]

76
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,090
North Hills Chief, we've dug to the bottom of this Sword Tomb.

77
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,560
All right. You can go back.

78
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,990
Yes, sir.

79
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,960
Sect Leader, if you could see today's Wan Lu Sect,

80
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,920
you would be filled with anger, too.

81
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,820
Today's Wan Lu Sect

82
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,560
has long since lost the way it was.

83
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,610
Father...

84
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,730
Don't come here!

85
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,070
Sect Leader!

86
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,660
The Sword Tomb has been dug out.

87
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,170
We haven't found the Previous Sect Leader's body.

88
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,210
To think that the Previous Leader had such an illustrious name,

89
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,470
and in the end, not even her body can be found.

90
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,940
Sect Leader, this time you'll finally be at ease.

91
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,660
If the North Hills Chief is so nostalgic about the Previous Leader,

92
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,330
why don't you follow her to the underworld, to uphold your loyalty?

93
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,300
What do you think you are?

94
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,460
Without the Previous Leader,

95
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,510
could you have risen to Captain of the Dark Guards?

96
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,950
I would have surely followed the Previous Leader and treaded all over the world.

97
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,990
Even down to the Underworld, I'd have gone unwavering.

98
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,050
When that time comes,

99
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,910
I will definitely drag you down with me.

100
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,180
- You!
- Enough.

101
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,260
North Hills Chief, please withdraw.

102
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,620
Sect Leader, the North Hills Chief contradicts you again and again. I–

103
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,980
No need to follow me.

104
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,830
It is the taste you liked.

105
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,270
I'm not going back. I want to leave the Thousand Dust Pavilion.

106
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,350
Since not one of you believes me, I'll seek vengeance for my father on my own.

107
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,090
Miss Zhiyan, your father's death still contains many suspicions.

108
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,820
The Pavillion Leader will certainly clarify the truth in the name of justice.

109
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,300
Miss Zhiyan, he's your father's biological brother, you should believe in him.

110
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,620
He's the one who doesn't believe me!

111
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,740
Senior Suyu, what should we do now?

112
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,980
You people don't believe me so I can only rely on myself. I must leave.

113
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,460
I'm not scared!

114
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,290
This Sushan maze you have here... how...

115
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,350
Hey! Are you people still there?

116
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,760
Hey! Are you all still there?

117
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,430
Leader Qin, it pains me that Brother Qin Yu encountered such terrible tragedy.

118
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,100
It shocks me even more that Zhiyan mistook me for the killer.

119
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,250
I am glad that Leader Qin could personally come here today.

120
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:50,200
I want to work with you to find the real murderer. Not only to clear the misunderstanding.

121
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,720
Even more, it is to avenge Brother Qin Yu.

122
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,700
Since Sect Leader Liu speaks thusly, then I will get to the point.

123
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,820
I came today to verify your whereabouts on the day of the event.

124
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,100
That day I was at Phoenix Mountain, sharing drinks with their Deacon Chi Tianming.

125
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,730
After a few cups, I was slightly drunk. When I woke up, I returned home.

126
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,300
Later, I heard that Brother Qin Yu had been attacked in the Xuanyu Hall

127
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,220
and Zhiyuan had escaped in the commotion. Leader Qin,

128
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,200
the most pressing matter at present is to find Brother Qin Yu.

129
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,560
Dead or alive, there has to be an answer. Not to mention, Xuanyu Hall is currently unattended.

130
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,830
We need to find someone to manage the Hall's affairs posthaste.

131
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,310
Pavillion Leader. Sect Leader Liu.

132
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,900
Miss Zhiyan wouldn't listen. She ran into the Sushan Maze.

133
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,900
Sect Leader Liu, in the Pavillion there are some matters that need my attention,

134
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,140
so for today, I won't keep you any longer.

135
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,200
Leader Qin, as you please.

136
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,810
Revered One...

137
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,580
Has Qin Qianxian left?

138
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,020
Yes.

139
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,400
Did his expression show anything unusual?

140
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,450
Nothing unusual. I suppose Liu Wei did not raise any suspicion.

141
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,520
Of course.

142
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,860
I will withdraw.

143
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,950
Mingxuan, Lu Zhaoyao died. It's such a pity

144
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,440
that she died so easily.

145
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,470
What in the world is this place? I've been walking all day.

146
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,530
So this is what the Netherworld looks like.

147
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,350
What Netherworld? Who are you?

148
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,010
Who are you?

149
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,540
I... I'm not telling you. You tell me who you are first.

150
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,300
Fine. Listen well.

151
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,980
My last name is Lu, first name is Qiong, called by Zhaoyao, [Ancient Chinese have a formal first name and a casual first name. ]

152
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,390
founder of the Wan Lu Sect at Chenji Mountain...

153
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,900
D-D-Demoness!

154
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,810
Right. I'm that Demoness.

155
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,550
A-A-Aren't you already dead?

156
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,800
Right.

157
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,580
Wasn't I already dead?

158
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,750
- Let's try.
- Try wha–

159
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,650
Ouch! Why did you hit me?

160
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,700
Why-Why do you look like me in the mirror?

161
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,900
In the mirror, I look like you? So, in your eyes, I don't look like you?

162
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,930
N-N-No. In the mirror you have my face,

163
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,030
but the one I see is you.

164
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,710
I'm also curious about why it's different.

165
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,370
God! It's scary!

166
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,920
This place is actually a maze spell.

167
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
How did I come back here?

168
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,580
It's the end! I can't get out.

169
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,050
Come here.

170
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,770
Little sister, what are you afraid of?

171
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:12,130
Leaving this trivial maze is no problem for me. I can take you out.

172
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,800
But before I do, answer some of my questions. All right?

173
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,000
Wh-What questions?

174
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,410
First, where is this place?

175
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,610
This is Mount Su's Thousand Dust Pavillion.

176
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,790
Thousand Dust Pavillion...

177
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,080
Second, where do you want to go?

178
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,260
W-W-Wan Lu Sect.

179
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:47,400
Your body is showing Immortal Sect's energy, you're clearly from there. But you say you want to go to Wan Lu Sect. Why?

180
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,630
Th-The Immortal Sect is crooked. I want to become strong.

181
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,150
And then... seek vengeance.

182
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,140
Vengeance? For what?

183
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,950
Liu Wei, from the Jian Xin Sect, killed my father.

184
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,020
I want to avenge my father and kill Liu Wei.

185
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,800
Liu Wei...

186
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,610
What a coincidence. I want to go back to Wan Lu Sect, too.

187
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:24,960
I can take you out of the Sushan Maze and take you to Wan Lu Sect. How about it?

188
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,800
You-You'd be so good?

189
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,950
Because I'm generous.

190
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,190
But it was said...

191
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,800
Can you believe the rumors? They said that in Wan Lu Sect everyone was a follower of evil.

192
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,290
Now you, too, want to go to Wan Lu Sect. Do you think you are a follower of evil?

193
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,980
I...I... It seems you're right.

194
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,660
Also, you're not so much like they said.

195
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,130
Is that prettier or uglier?

196
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,370
It's... It's...

197
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,710
It-It's pre-prettier. Prettier.

198
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,560
Rubbish.

199
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,770
I am really a good person.

200
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,500
So... Demoness,

201
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,370
I'm curious. Why are you in the Sushan Maze?

202
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,900
- I don't know.
- This maze is very close to the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

203
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,700
Does my uncle know that you're here?

204
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,220
Don't know.

205
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,110
Why do I always get hurt?

206
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,930
We've been walking for so long. How come this doesn't look any different than the place we just went through?

207
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,840
Did we go back again?

208
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,700
Your eyes can't tell the difference. But mine can.

209
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,600
We finally got out!

210
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,530
This maze is a nuisance; of course, you can't get out without a Sect Leader's skills.

211
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,800
But who am I?

212
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,670
Little girl, you should rejoice that you've found big shoulders to climb on.

213
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,770
Miss Zhiyan, you did come out.

214
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,630
Miss Zhiyan, come back with me first.

215
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm not going back. Since none of you believes me, I'll avenge my father by myself.

216
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,530
How can there be two Miss Zhiyans?

217
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,480
Don't blame me! Don't blame me! I must go.

218
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,880
Cut this rubbish. Let's leave quickly while nobody is onto us, lest anything else should happen.

219
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,270
Sect Leader, as of late in Jianghu, there's a rebel group that calls itself "New Mountain."

220
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,800
They run wild, clashing with our Wan Lu followers every now and again.

221
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,410
I think we should dispose of them as soon as possible, to defend our Sect's prestige.

222
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,700
Sect Leader, I think that subduing the enemy without a fight is the best strategy.

223
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,050
If we can induce them to submit willingly to our sect, that will be a defense of our prestige.

224
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,800
Ridiculous. Subdue the enemy without a fight?

225
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,620
Captain Lin, you make it sound easy.

226
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:21,300
Are you going to send a team of women to pillow-talk them into idiocy?

227
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,930
These past few years, the North Hills Chief has been fighting here and there. It was hard work on you.

228
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,260
Do you mean that in a battle of wits

229
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,210
you'd do no better than sending a team of unskilled women?

230
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,310
Captain Lin, you're good at banter.

231
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,450
Then please, Captain Lin, take a trip in person

232
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,970
and chat them into submission.

233
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,660
Enough!

234
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,180
Where is this New Mountain? Who is the Sect Leader?

235
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,110
The Sect Leader is a coarse man swaying a broadsword.

236
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:02,010
The disciples call him Tuying, "Bald Eagle." The Sect is located near Fengmo Mountain.

237
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,220
Near Fengmo Mountain.

238
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,750
Yes.

239
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,200
Then we can't allow him.

240
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,330
- As a subordinate, I'm willing-
- Lu Gang!

241
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,170
Here, sir!

242
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,700
Within three days, clear off this sect. Spare those who flee. Put down those who resist.

243
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,430
I shall accept the order.

244
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,700
Sect Leader, I don't understand.

245
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,160
These few years your conduct has never resembled the Previous Leader's fierce ways.

246
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,200
If we could make them surrender to us this time,

247
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,550
though it'd take longer, there would be no need to obliterate them. Sect Leader, why...

248
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,740
In the vicinity of Fengmo Mountain, there can be no-one disturbing the peace.
