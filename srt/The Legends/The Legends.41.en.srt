00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,860
[Episode 41]

3
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,990
Looking at this map

4
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,740
the Wan Lu Sect's terrain is easy to defend and hard to attack.

5
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,880
That's right. The Wan Lu Sect is surrounded

6
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,300
with natural chasms and rifts.

7
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,230
The gate is also guarded strictly. It's hard to go in.

8
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,810
- It certainly makes for some trouble.
- What are you afraid of?

9
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,290
Just attack straight on. If one comes, we kill one. If two come, we kill two.

10
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,700
Deacon Chi, do you have any stratagem?

11
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,200
As I see it, we may as well set the mountain on fire.

12
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,860
The Wan Lu Sect will be mine.

13
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,190
You want me to set my own mountain on fire?

14
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,790
I know you don't have anyone to back you up now.

15
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,110
Otherwise, I should suspect that you're working as someone's secret agent.

16
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,470
What about that Sect Leader Tang?

17
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,930
Tang Yun's health has been poor lately, but Qingyin Sect agreed

18
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,120
to send men in the attack on the Wan Lu Sect.

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,400
It wouldn't be that you hid her away?

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,220
I do wish, but she won't let me.

21
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,120
For the attack on the Wan Lu Sect, you people just can't think of a resonable plan?

22
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,880
The Wan Lu Sect at present only have three Hill Masters left.

23
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,140
First off, this Lu Seventeen. She's strong in power but simple-minded.

24
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,720
Gu Hanguang, though excellent in medicine, is not the best regarding fighting power.

25
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,440
And there's that Sima Rong. He's excellently informed.

26
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,940
But he's just a cripple.

27
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,790
If there's no one to attend him, I guess

28
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,190
he doesn't even have the strength to protect himself.

29
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,840
This way... We may as well split into three groups and go after these Hill Masters

30
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,590
cutting them off. We'll get rid of Li Chenlan's right-hand man.

31
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,640
This way... 1. We can weaken the Wan Lu Sect's power.

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,480
2. We can use them for blackmail.

33
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,830
This sounds like the best plan.

34
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,500
Let's do as you said.

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,420
But remember, you all,

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,440
Lu Zhaoyao is mine.

37
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,210
No one can touch her.

38
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,380
Ah Rong, is there any way to make this Heart Lotus blossom?

39
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,070
This Heart Lotus is the most valuable treasure of the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

40
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,860
Only the leaders who have sat in charge of the Thousand Dust Pavillion have had the power to make it blossom.

41
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,660
Pavilion Leader Qin just happens to have been deprived of his power.

42
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
I'm afraid...

43
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,180
There is still time. There must be another way.

44
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,220
Don't worry. I'll do all I can to find another way.

45
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,840
Ah Rong, there's one more favor I have to ask you.

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,850
Chenlan, just say it.

47
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,460
Now, Zhaoyao has agreed to marry me.

48
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,910
But in this world, I don't have any other family.

49
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,000
You and I have known each other for many years; we're like true brothers.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,500
I'd like you to be our wedding's master of ceremonies.

51
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,310
All right!

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,440
No matter what, we can say that our Wan Lu Sect is welcoming a happy event.

53
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,460
Where's Yuezhu?

54
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,980
You haven't repaired her yet.

55
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,970
I don't know

56
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,460
whether I should repair her again.

57
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,840
Sect Leader, the fabrics are here.

58
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,090
Change all clothing materials to shark pearl silk.

59
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,720
Yes.

60
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,720
I've never seen you spend much. Who'd have thought you were so extravagant and wasteful?

61
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,540
I still feel like it's too hasty.

62
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,070
Hasty? How grand do you want it?

63
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,640
If I want the stars in the sky, will you pluck them for me?

64
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,550
I will.

65
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,620
Little Monster,

66
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,330
they are already in your eyes.

67
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,500
Hanguang,

68
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
do you think for Zhaoyao's wedding day, for refreshments, would it be better to have chicken gizzard

69
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,910
or petals and goose pie?

70
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,300
Chicken gizzard is spicy and easily leads to inflammation.

71
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,400
Petals and goose pie is not easy to digest.

72
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,070
Neither is good.

73
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,040
Then... are there any pastries you would like to eat?

74
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,190
Do you recall the first time I went to Rain View Sect? You and I had a tasting of Yuqian Longjing tea;

75
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,840
those faint yellow little tea pastries?

76
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
Custard cheese cakes?

77
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,630
I think that was their names. They were quite good!

78
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,360
All right. Then, I'll pick custard cheesecakes.

79
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,160
For tea, we'll just choose Yuqian Longjing tea.

80
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,600
For drinks, maiden rosé is, of course, the best.

81
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,230
Qianjin,

82
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,440
organize a wedding.

83
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,600
I don't need to.

84
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
I think you do.

85
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,900
Demoness, if you want to snack, can you take it back there?

86
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm at the last step!

87
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,390
Since it's such a pain to embroider it, couldn't we just have bought one ready-made?

88
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,710
How can that be all right? We've been through so much together, I consider you a sister now.

89
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,700
For your dowry, of course, I have to use my own hands!

90
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,160
But to think of it, it's a miracle. A few months ago, I'd have never imagined

91
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,350
that I would actually make Lu Zhaoyao's bridal dress.

92
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,400
I, though, knew since the beginning that you'd bring me trouble.

93
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,080
I...

94
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,340
I won't get angry.

95
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,860
Oh right. Have you and Li Chenlan set an auspicious date?
(T/N: Traditionally, an astronomer would be called to set a date)

96
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,730
An auspicious date?

97
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,870
Have you matched the horoscopes?
(T/N: Traditional ritual before a wedding)

98
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,680
The horoscopes?

99
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,510
I can't believe it. You two have not even checked your horoscopes?

100
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,490
What are you two doing?

101
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,490
We're doing a happy event.
(T/N: Synonym for "wedding")

102
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,390
Mr. Fortune Teller, don't sigh. Tell us. What is the problem?

103
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,290
The horoscopes do not match, unsuitable for marriage.

104
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,610
Listen to your babbling. So what if I still want to marry?

105
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,760
Sect Leader Lu, I'm not trying to praise myself.

106
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,420
My master was the one who calculated when the Wanjun Sword would appear,

107
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,200
that half-immortal person.

108
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,880
Compared to my great Grand Master, I can't predict the fate of the nation.

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,340
I can't calculate that, but regarding auspicious days for marriage...

110
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,250
Demoness, you--

111
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,630
Tomorrow! I want to get married tomorrow!

112
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,560
You must not! Your horoscopes do not match to begin with.

113
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,270
In addition, tomorrow is an inauspicious date. You can't hold a wedding tomorrow.

114
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,900
It'll be tomorrow.

115
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,180
If you insist to do it your way, then Sect Leader...

116
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,790
and Sect Leader Li will encounter ill fate tainted with blood.

117
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,850
Then, what do we do?

118
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,730
Please go home, Sir.

119
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,110
W-Wait! For such an important day as that of the wedding, you two must choose an auspicious...

120
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,730
...date.

121
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,130
I've been under a malefic star since I was little. His luck has never been good, either.

122
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,380
The two of us don't need him to tell our future.

123
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,200
I know myself how chaotic tomorrow will be.

124
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,260
But so what? A demoness like me, and a great demon like him,

125
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,470
what stormy waves have we not seen?

126
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,450
Why would we fear the words of a fortune-teller? This wedding will be celebrated tomorrow.

127
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,500
If Heaven really wants to go against us,

128
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,210
then I just refuse to comply.

129
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,910
Say, isn't that right, Little Monster?

130
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Right.

131
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,800
Let's resume the story. It's said that the leader of the Wan Lu Sect, Lu Zhaoyao,

132
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,720
forced her way into the dragon's den by herself.

133
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,500
Although she beat the Gold Deity, Luo Mingxuan,

134
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,770
yet, her own spirit was almost scattered away as well

135
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,110
and her body was severely injured.

136
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,270
The Great Demon, Li Chenlan,

137
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,440
as soon as he knew it, he set aside any thought of food or rest,

138
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,800
and he started searching by land and sea for a cure for Lu Zhaoyao.

139
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,900
But the road to finding the cure

140
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,370
is filled with obstacles.

141
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,070
Therefore, for Lu Zhaoyao's condition

142
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,630
the chance of getting well are fewer and fewer.

143
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,580
Pressed by urgency, Li Chenlan,

144
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,550
in order to show his love for Lu Zhaoyao,

145
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,740
decided to hold for Lu Zhaoyao

146
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,420
and himself an unprecedented

147
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,500
wedding!

148
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,530
Who's that?

149
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,870
What nonsense. Who allowed them to marry?

150
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,700
Dear patron, everything I said is true.

151
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,270
Not one sentence was false!

152
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,720
Get lost!

153
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,190
Ah Wu...

154
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,280
Call Jin Xiu to see me.

155
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,580
What is it?

156
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,140
Let everyone be ready to attack tomorrow.

157
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,340
We will attack from the main entrance.

158
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,580
I want Li Chenlan to know who Lu Zhaoyao actually belongs to.

159
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,300
We are not yet fully prepared. If we attack right now,

160
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,220
it will cause unnecessary sacrifices.

161
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,630
You can refuse me,

162
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,670
but this is the result. Do as you please.

163
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,310
I'm going.

164
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,640
Someone!

165
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,410
Deacon.

166
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,930
Who sent this letter?

167
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,700
This... I do not know.

168
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,720
No one's been in Deacon's room. Today... no one came, either.

169
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,960
- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

170
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,370
[Tonight, at 11:00, meet me at Xu Zong Sect - Luo Mingxuan]

171
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,300
[...meet me at...]

172
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,890
[Xu Zong Sect]

173
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,000
[Luo Mingxuan]

174
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,720
Heaven blessed our Immortal Sect! Heaven blessed our Immortal Sect!

175
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,630
Let's look separately.

176
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,120
Jin Xian!!

177
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,970
It's my fault. I didn't protect you. You've suffered.

178
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,460
Deacon Chi, please get up.

179
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,510
I feel too ashamed to face you.

180
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,830
I know you are loyal to the Immortal Sects.

181
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,420
Please rise to your feet. Tell me the latest news about the Immortal Sects.

182
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,760
Jin Xian, after the battle on Phoenix Mountain, we all thought that you were gone.

183
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,390
Everyone has their own ulterior motives. For the position as the Immortal Sects' leader,

184
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,310
Young Master Jin Xiu is colluding with Jiang Wu to attack the Wan Lu Sect.

185
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,930
This put Qin Qianxuan into a coma and he's still unconscious.

186
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,390
The Thousand Dust Pavilion even withdrew from the Immortal Sects.

187
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,490
Now, he and Jiang Wu are fighting the Wan Lu Sect together.

188
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,830
He wants to drag the Immortal Sects into this.

189
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,360
Then, how's the Wan Lu Sect now?

190
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,590
The Wan Lu Sect hasn't done anything relevant to us recently.

191
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,410
I suppose it's because of the recent internal strife. They have a lot on their own plate, too.

192
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,110
But I heard that tomorrow is Lu Zhaoyao's and Li Chenlan's wedding.

193
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,700
Don't act rashly for now.

194
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,850
Let's keep our Immortal Sect's strength.

195
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,430
Let that Jiang Wu try the Wan Lu Sect's limits first.

196
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,900
- Waiting and observing will be enough.
- Yes.

197
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,500
Right! Jin Xian, do you want to go back to the Pheonix Mountain to regain control of the situation?

198
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,830
We still need to wait a bit.

199
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,660
Wait till I learn Xu Zong Sect's secret technique

200
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,870
and restore the powers that are sealed in.

201
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,530
Xu Zong Sect really is hiding a secret technique?

202
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,700
No one from the Jiang household has ever lived past 30.

203
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,170
Could it have to do with this?

204
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,390
It's more or less related to that.

205
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,660
Will you be in danger if you practice this power?

206
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,180
I have a gold body. It's fine.

207
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,220
But when I brought up the topic of this secret technique, Jiang He was evasive.

208
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,160
I need you to help me take the secret technique.

209
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,260
I'm at your disposal. I'll risk my life for you.

210
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,470
Who is it?

211
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,070
- Jin Xian.
- To achieve great things, one need not stand on trifles.

212
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,380
Don't be soft-hearted.

213
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,580
Sect Leader! Bad news!

214
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,000
Sect Leader, bad news.

215
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,470
A healer must avoid impetuousness at all costs.

216
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,430
What urgent matter do you have? Speak.

217
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,250
I saw with my own eyes Jin Xian kill one of our disciples.

218
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,640
This matter will be a misunderstanding.

219
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,130
On another day, I'll personally ask Jin Xian.

220
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,260
Go.

221
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,080
Yes.

222
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,800
Wait. Remember! This matter must not be disclosed.

223
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,670
Yes. Your disciple takes leave.

224
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,290
[To Sect Leader Chi]

225
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,940
I heard that Jiang Wu is planning to attack the Wan Lu Sect tomorrow.

226
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,960
Sect Leader Chi, are you not going?

227
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,830
How can you flip through my post?

228
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,530
I'm telling you. Tomorrow's Lu Zhaoyao's wedding with Li Chenlan,

229
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,160
this event must not happen.

230
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,920
Whether it happens or not is not up to us.

231
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,240
No matter the result, let Jiang Wu attend the ceremony first.

232
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,850
This is currently the best choice.

233
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,490
First, it will cost many losses to the Wan Lu Sect's troops.

234
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,600
Second, it can also make the Wan Lu Sect

235
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,010
dampen Jiang Wu's vigor.

236
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,900
You think Jiang Wu will lose?

237
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,200
Not even Jin Xian and the Revered Lady Changyu could overcome the Wan Lu Sect.

238
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,600
Could a trifling Jiang Wu take them down single-handedly?

239
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,030
Miss Lin, don't be too anxious.

240
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,410
First, sit back and watch the tigers fight; wait for the right opportunity

241
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,290
and then strike.

242
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,810
Sect Leader, don't marry Little Monster! Please!

243
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,900
Little Teen, don't cry. It's a bad omen.

244
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,220
Don't marry, Little Monster!

245
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,530
I don't want you to marry him!

246
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,690
Seventeen, tonight, there will be a lot of braised meat.

247
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,060
If you don't let it go, you won't get anything to eat.

248
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,280

First, we kill Li Chenlan. Destroy the leader and the gang will fall.

incarnating the wonder of a perfect match

274

can attain the joy of harmonious married life.

275

Palace Leader Shen, have you seen Seventeen?

276
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,140
I think I haven't seen her since the beginning.

- Don't say that.
- Lest she makes a ruckus.

- Come back soon!
- All right.

318
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,710
Sect Leader... Sect Leader?

319
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,170
Sect Leader...

320
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,050
Sect Leader...

321
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,590
Where's Seventeen?

322
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,880
I don't know where she is, but Zhiyan went to find her.

323
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,600
Gu Hanguang, take Sima Rong and Qianjin away.

324
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,770
Quick! They can't fight, don't waste time!

325
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,590
Mo Qing! Mo Qing!

326
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,340
Mo Qing!

327
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,730
Li Chenlan, you're so weak now.

328
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,260
Why don't you give Zhaoyao to my care?

329
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,210
You're way too arrogant!

330
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,150
Do you like it?

331
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,930
I picked your crown.

332
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,230
- Why don't you count it as marrying me?
- You!

333
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,710
Since we parted at Ling Ting Mountain, West Hill Master, I hope you've been well.

334
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,630
The Wan Lu Sect is nothing more than this.

335
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,250
Li Chenlan, you can't beat me now.

336
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,030
My body has Qin Qianxian's power.

337
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,350
Die!

338
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,780
Qin Qianxian's rotten power.

339
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,070
Both Sect Leaders were defeated by my hand.

340
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,880
Do you people want to die?

341
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,980
Put your swords down.

342
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,250
Down!

343
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,650
Lock them in the dungeons.

344
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,930
Remember, you are mine.

345
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,870
Bury this sword; stupid sword that recognizes its master.

346
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,700
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

347
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,570
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

348
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,070
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

349
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,210
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

350
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:29,640
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

351
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:37,160
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

352
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,700
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

353
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:52,170
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

354
00:39:52,170 --> 00:40:02,270
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

355
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:23,670
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

356
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:29,590
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

357
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,120
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

358
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,930
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

359
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:44,680
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

360
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:52,110
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

361
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:59,580
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

362

♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

363
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:14,690
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

364
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:22,120
♫ On the remote road, desolate, heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

365
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:29,610
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

366
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:37,100
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

367
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:48,010
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
