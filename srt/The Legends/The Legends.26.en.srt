[Episode 26]

3
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,050
This time, I must let everyone know that

4
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,380
Liu Suruo killed my father and I am not crazy!

5
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,170
What do you have apart from your determination?

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
Tell me. How will you get there? How will you leave?

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,900
I'll just act according to the situation.

8
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,950
I know it's dangerous. But I still must go.

9
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,620
Sure. You can go. But I have a condition.

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,820
Master the Teleportation Technique before the Grand Meeting.

11
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,090
All right. I'll learn. I'll definitely master it.

12
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,020
Get me a cup of water. I got thirsty arguing with you.

13
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,810
Demoness, I think that after spending some time with Li Chenlan,

14
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,650
you're starting to soften.

15
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,200
Maybe you've fallen for him. It's just that you haven't realized it yet.

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,520
What do you mean by that?

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,480
I didn't expect you'd let me go, but you actually did.

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,650
Who says I agreed to let you go to Phoenix Mountain?

19
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,940
I just don't think you can master the Teleportation Technique within two days.

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Ah Wu has been acting weird since he got hold of this sword.

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,670
I don't know why either.

22
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,840
This sword is actually useful.

23
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,060
Xiao En. Xiao Yi.

24
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,450
- Ah Wu.
- I'll be training in isolation for a few days.

25
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,080
In isolation? You've never been in isolation.

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,980
Don't you just need to capture some men to boost your power?

27
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,430
I'm not training for myself. It's for this sword.

28
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,130
This sword?

29
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,210
I'm making a trip to Phoenix Mountain in a few days. You don't have to come with me. I'll bring Xiao En along.

30
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,820
I want you to investigate the two Qin Zhiyans.

31
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,880
I want to know which one is the one I like.

32
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,380
All right.

33
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,660
The obsession in your heart is too strong.

34
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,810
Don't rush into teleportation. Clear your mind first

35
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,610
and let yourself blend into the world.

36
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,810
Let your thoughts scatter, then slowly gather your soul.

37
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,050
And then?

38
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,070
Then think of your destination.

39
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,840
It's driven by your heart. You'll get there as a matter of course.

40
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,890
Why would you help me? Be so good to me?

41
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,280
Where the heart goes, the mind can't control.

42
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,370
Demoness, you're thinking of Li Chenlan, aren't you?

43
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,600
Nonsense! I was thinking about how to teach this stupid girl.

44
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,700
Focus. You're running out of time.

45
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,400
If you don't master it, I won't bring you over.

46
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,970
Go. Do your best.

47
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,850
Work harder.

[Sixteenth: Give Jiang He answer]

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,120
Fifteen grams of Songnai.

50
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,780
That's incorrect.

51
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,280
- Songnai relieves heat.
- Come in.

52
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,100
It contradicts the remedy's neutral heat.

53
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,920
Master, Ms. Zhiyan asks to see you.

54
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,610
Greetings, South Hill Chief.

55
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,590
What do you want?

56
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,110
That...

I...

58
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,190
I'd like to have one Nine-Cycle Pill.

59
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,320
An Si, give it to her.

60
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,910
Yes.

61
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,540
So many!

I...

64
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,710
South Hill Master...

65
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,550
could I... take one more?

66
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,360
Take them all. Don't bother me again in the next 3 days.

67
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,350
All right. I won't bother you.

68
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,790
Thank you, South Hill Master!

69
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,110
She asked for one more.

70
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,840
One more?

71
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,510
One more Weiliang.

72
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,490
Then simmer in separate intervals

73
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,970
to ensure the efficacy and keep the humidity and heat at the same time.

74
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,280
Right. That's right.

[Thousand Dust Pavilion]

80
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,030
I've heard that you are able to know all without stepping out of your home.

81
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,740
Please forgive me for not welcoming you earlier.

82
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,820
Forgive us.

83
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,460
I came too suddenly. It's been rude of me.

84
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,810
Please forgive me.

85
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,390
But I do have an important matter to discuss with Master Qin.

86
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,760
I hope, Master Su Yan, you will allow it.

87
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,160
Of course. Please, West Hill Master, wait inside the pavilion.

88
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,280
I've heard of you far and wide, West Hill Master.

89
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,750
You must have come for important business.

90
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,560
I heard the Pavillion Leader intends to attend the Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sects.

91
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,160
We are very worried about your well being.

92
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,260
This is the Immortal Sect's business. Wan Lu Sect has no reason to worry about us.

93
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,580
I'm not worried about the Immortal Sects. You're the only person I'm worried about, Master Qin.

94
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,230
Regarding the matter of Liu Suruo of Jianxin Sect attempting to revive Jin Xian,

95
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,560
is Master Qin aware of it?

96
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,510
Reviving Jin Xian?

97
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,170
That's correct.

98
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,400
Jin Xian's body is immortal. But he was sealed by our late sect leader.

99
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,460
Although he has never awakened, his body remains intact.

100
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,950
His wife Liu Suruo has been racking her brains

101
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,660
and considering all means to wake Luo Mingxuan, but to no avail.

102
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,250
Now, from an unknown source, she was informed

103
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,420
that the blood of the Qin Clan might be able to revive Jin Xian.

104
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,350
Because of this, both your brother and Miss Zhiyan were attacked.

105
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,450
Now Liu Suruo is desperate.

106
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,650
She has used up all of Qin Yu's blood

107
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,520
and Miss Zhiyan is in Wan Lu Sect.

108
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,590
She has no other option.

109
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,450
As such, she could only go after you.

110
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:41,170
Now that you know this, are you still willing to attend the Grand Meeting?

111
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,920
How did you obtain this information, West Hill Master?

112
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,580
Gathering information is just like stargazing.

113
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,750
The stars are distributed all across the sky. The same goes for information.

114
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,920
Put all the scattered bits together, study them, and you will see the big picture.

115
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,500
I've long heard that you're an insightful man.

116
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,200
However, you are merely observing from afar, like watching a wist of smoke.

117
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,350
Without seeing up close, how does one know what the object is?

118
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,650
Events in Jianghu are ever-changing, like clouds and winds.

119
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,870
The truth cannot be seen from afar.

120
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,990
I won't know the truth if I do not attend the Grand Meeting.

121
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,670
That is to say, this Grand Meeting

122
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,620
you will attend it no matter what?

123
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,670
I will definitely attend.

124
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,510
Since you insist on going, it is not right for me to stop you.

125
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,030
But there's one thing I'd like to know.

126
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:02,040
What are your thoughts on resurrecting Jin Xian?

127
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,050
Heavenly law is fair and bright. Karma has its own ways.

128
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,610
Whether you call it luck or fate, it is all nature's course.

129
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,810
However, killing for blood to nurture another is an act of evil.

130
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,370
I dare not subscribe to that.

131
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,550
You are a wise man indeed.

132
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,550
With this answer from you, I can report back to my sect leader.

133
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,620
Farewell, Chief Sima.

134
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,130
Please don't take me further.

135
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,570
Xuzhi... Now you really need to come back.

[Xu Zong Sect]

Master.

138
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,320
Master, can I take a look at it?

139
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,230
- Take it.
- Thanks.

140
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,570
Is there a name for this new herb?

141
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,430
It takes 30 years to grow two of these. It has incredible properties.

142
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,830
It can cure all poisons and transform a body completely.

143
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,780
Therefore its name is "Rebirth."

144
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,040
Rebirth?

145
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,710
Correct.

146
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,520
You may release this year's test and answers

147
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,330
for all physicians to collect on their own.

148
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,630
Also, dry this herb and deliver it to Wan Lu Sect.

149
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,270
Yes.

150

- Wait.
- Master.

Anything else?

Never mind, let's send this medicine in a few days.

153

The Nine-Cycle Pill is incredible.

156
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,850
I feel so light and sensitive now.

157
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,470
Gu Hanguang is such a stingy person.

158
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,440
I can't believe you managed to get a full box of Nine-Cycle Pills from him.

159
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,860
You've improved.

160
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,840
When I was there, South Hill Master was researching a remedy for Sect Leader Jiang He.

161
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,690
He gave it to me to send me away.

162

South Hill Master and Sect Leader Jiang He have been battling with medicines for so many years.

163
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,850
Haven't they met each other before?

164
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,250
Of course, they've met. They were brother disciples before.

165
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,520
What? Brother disciples?

166
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,360
How come I've never heard of that?

167
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,920
There's a lot you've never heard.

168
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,210
If South Hill Master was a member of the Immortal Sects,

169
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,310
how did he become Wan Lu Sect's Master of South Hills?

170
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,560
It was because of a woman.

171
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,690
You mean the woman that turned him into the way he is now?

172
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,280
Correct.

173
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,050
People say that only vicious people join Wan Lu Sect.

174
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,570
But there's actually someone like South Hill Master,

175
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,150
who's willing to sacrifice himself for another.

176
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,610
How naive.

177
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,900
Before he joined Wan Lu Sect, Gu Hanguang was no kind man either.

178
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,450
He was only kind to that woman because she was special to him.

179
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,160
Who's that person?

180
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,030
You should know her.

181
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,250
She's from the only Immortal Sect that has exclusively women.

182
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,630
Rain View Sect?

183
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,960
Aren't they forbidden from falling in love?

184
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,160
Correct, but their leader couldn't contain her feelings.

185
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,950
The person South Hill Master sacrificed himself for is the Leader of Rain View House,

186
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,400
Shen Qianjin?

187
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,700
It can't be.

188
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,920
I've never heard Leader Shen mention South Hill Master.

189
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,010
Of course. She doesn't remember anything.

190
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,930
Enough. If you still can't master the Teleportation Technique after taking the pill,

191
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,450
your determination will be nothing but a joke.

192
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,740
Let's go. It's time to get back to training.

193
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,360
Since Qin Qianxian is determined to go, let him go, then.

194
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,530
I've ordered the Dark Guards to set out tonight at the time of Yin.
(T/N: 3:00 a.m.)

195
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,210
Where's Seventeen? Is she back?

196
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,020
I received news a moment ago. She's speeding on the way.

197
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,260
Is she still well?

198
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,510
Full of spirit.

199
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,960
She's giving quite the hard time to the men we sent to get her.

200
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,570
Though it's not very appropriate, I would really like to go and see Seventeen raising a ruckus.

201
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,900
It must be fun.

202
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,960
You seek fun, too?

203
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,730
Wouldn't you like to see?

204
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,370
I would.

205
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,260
East Hill Master!

206
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,550
East Hill Master.

207
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,880
What's wrong with you? Huh?

208
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,930
You practice magic. I can't do it, and yet you're more clumsy than me!

209
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,260
What is it? You want me to carry you?

210
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,120
East Hill Master, that Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sects won't start before morning.

211
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,120
If we... we get there a little later it's no problem.

212
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
You're a pain!

213
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,570
Didn't you say that if I mess up the Immortal Sect's Grand Meeting, I can see the Sect Leader?

214
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,650
I'm already very unhappy that I can't see the Sect Leader straight away.

215
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,010
If you keep holding me back with your hems and haws,

216
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,330
when we go back, I won't just beat you to death,

217
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,420
I'll also beat to death the Little Monster who sent you. Got it?

218
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,100
Hurry up!

219
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,220
Focus. Cast distractions aside.
Find that energy that you use for gossip.

220
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,660
Wh-What are you doing?

221
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,350
A fallen leaf.

222
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,420
So, Master... tomorrow there is that Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sect.

223
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,300
I think... when–

224
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,390
Don't worry. I've made all the arrangements.

225
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,910
We won't let Liu Suruo succeed.

226
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,510
Go back. Get some rest.

227
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,090
Master!

228
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,790
What is it?

229
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,110
Nothing. I just wanted to call you.

230
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm here.

231
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,940
Master.

232
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,140
Thank you for being here.

233
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,070
Mingxuan,

234
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,790
do you still remember what day it is today?

235
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,670
That year, on this day, you achieved your completion as Jin Xian.

236
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,740
News of Jin Xian coming to the world was spread everywhere.

237
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,070
I also finally saw the man who'd tamed my horse for me.

238
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:34,120
Brother, what does the achiever of the Golden Body look like?

239
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,710
In a moment, you'll see and you'll know.

240
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,920
Jin Xian... isn't it just a man emanating a blinding golden light?

241
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,410
Presumably that flash of light must be quite gaudy.

242
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,160
What do you know?

243
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,290
Jin Xian's advent is our Immortal Sects' greatest joy!

244
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,960
What do you understand?

245
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,740
The Immortal Sect has a beautiful man such as me.

246
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,560
Now, that's the Great Joy.

247
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,820
It's him.

248
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:44,140
[Mighty Rectitude]

249
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,880
Felicitations, Jin Xian, for achieving the Golden Body.

250
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,170
Many thanks to everyone.

251
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,770
Many thanks.

252
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,220
So you are Jin Xian.

253
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,500
Jin Xian is nothing more than a flattering designation they gave me.

254
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,120
Then, from your point of view, who are you?

255
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,810
Perhaps,

256
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm the man who has a bond with you.

257
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,050
A bond with me.

258
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,070
This slumber you are in has lasted for too long.

259
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,380
Revered One, Jiang Wu is here.

260
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,490
Mingxuan, did you hear that?

261
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,870
You are going to wake up soon.

262
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,850
This sword, now, can wound Qin Qianxian.

263
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,770
Tomorrow, I'll certainly make him part with his life.

264
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,590
About tomorrow, you must be sure that there is not the least mistake.

265
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,750
Just stay on Phoenix Mountain tonight.

266
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,750
Tomorrow morning, lurk in the shadows.

267
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,270
In case of a change, you can move at any moment.

268
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,570
Depends on my mood.

269
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,690
I really don't understand why we, from the Immortal Sect,

270
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,840
should mingle together with those messy people.

271
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,030
Spurious schools and crooked ways.

272
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,740
Say it again, I'm listening.

273
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,190
A scrap from Jianghu dares start a brawl on Phoenix Mountain?

274
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,420
You dare disrespect our New Mountain Sect Leader!

275
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,990
What's this Phoenix Mountain?

276
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,190
The Jianxin Sect has been flattened.

277
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,100
If you don't grow some sense, we can burn down this Phoenix Mountain, too.

278
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,020
- Impudent!
- Stop!

279
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,320
This is Revered Lady Changyu's guest.

280
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,490
How dare you disrespect him? Go find your punishment.

281
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

282
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,580
Sect Leader Jiang, it's just a misunderstanding.

283
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,990
Please, don't take any offense.

284
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,420
I heard Sect Leader Jiang can appreciate wine.

285
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,380
How about following me for a taste of our Immortal Sect's vintage collection? Consider it an apology.

286
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,390
Now, this is talking.

287
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,900
Please.

288
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,880
Senior Han Yue, why were you so courteous to that Jiang Wu?

289
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,320
How many of our Immortal Sect brothers died at his hands?

290
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,910
Jiang Wu has an irrational temper and a willful character. He's not to be offended.

291
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,740
Swallowing a bit of our own pride is nothing.

292
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,210
If you accidentally ruin the Revered Lady's plan, then you'll have to answer for it.

293
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,210
Enough. Tomorrow is the Immortal Sects' Grand Meeting.

294
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,190
Tonight, be more alert.

295
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,570
- Yes.
- Yes.

296
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,260
Tomorrow, that Qin Qianxian will be done for. Just thinking about it makes me happy.

297
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,040
Ah Wu, watch your drinking. You still have something important to do tomorrow.

298
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,930
What are you afraid of?

299
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,540
Tomorrow, Qin Qianxian won't be able to escape even if he sprouts wings.

300
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,340
Today, it's like celebrating in advance. Pour the wine!

301
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,060
- But...
- But? What "but?"

302
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,290
What a grumbler.

303
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,040
You drink, too.

304
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
All right.

305
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,050
It's just a pity that Little Beauty can't hold more than one cup.

306
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,120
Otherwise, once I've killed Qin Qianxian,

307
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,700
the true pleasure would be to go get wasted drunk with the Litte Beauty.

308
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,360
This Qin Qianxian is Miss Zhiyan's uncle.

309
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,530
After Qin Yu died, he's the only family she has.

310
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,090
Ah Wu, aren't you afraid that Miss Zhiyan will hate you?

311
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,140
Hate me?

312
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,590
After I kill Qin Qianxian, I'll marry her.

313
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:43,000
From that moment, I'll be her only family. She'll have to love me.

314
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,510
[Phoenix's Song Hall]

315
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,830
Little Yue Yue, wait for me.

316
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,860
Wait for me.

317
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,920
Since you came to Phoenix Mountain, why didn't you wait for me?

318
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,480
Why should I go with you?

319
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,920
It is widely spread in Jianghu that you and I are a couple of lovers.

320
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,730
If the two of us had come together,

321
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,680
who knows how much more talk there would have been in tea houses and taverns.

322
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,030
Then, I want to avoid it even more.

323
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,090
[Phoenix's Song Hall]

324
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,850
It's Thousand Dust Pavillion again. I just don't understand

325
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,100
why we still keep their place free.

326
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,490
Anyway, they're not coming.

327
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,460
Thousand Dust Pavillion's Qin Qianxian is here!

328
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,830
What a rare visitor! The Pavillion Leader has increased his participation in our activities, recently.

329
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,480
Lord Jin Xiu, I hope you are well.

330
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,850
You are still as... beautiful.

331
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,420
The Revered Lady of Changyu is here!

332
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,170
- Revered Lady Changyu.
- Revered Lady Changyu.

333
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,560
[Mighty Rectitude]

334
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,740
Everyone, please have a seat.

335
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,520
A few days past, Li Chenlan from Wan Lu Sect single-handedly invaded Jinzhou.

336
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,100
He crushed our Demon-Shield Ward and destroyed our Jianxin Sect.

337
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,770
By now, the Immortal Sect is at a turn of life and death.

338
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:52,540
Today, I summoned all of you here to discuss the grand plan for the armed expedition against Wan Lu Sect.

339
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,210
I hope for everyone to pool their wisdom together

340
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,720
to join forces and minds in a united effort against Wan Lu Sect.

341
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,020
But all through the past few years, Wan Lu Sect has kept its distance and never interfered with the Immortal Sect.

342
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,150
Now, Li Chenlan trampled Jianxin Sect without warning.

343
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,100
Revered Lady Changyu, do you know the reason?

344
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,790
Only because that demon has taken a fancy to Qin Zhiyan.

345
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,980
Taking advantage of a misunderstanding between Zhiyan and our Jianxin Sect,

346
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,970
he lured her into Wan Lu Sect by deception.

347
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,300
My nephew there, Liu Cangling,

348
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,160
was engaged with Miss Zhiyan;

349
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,880
hence, he paid a visit asking for her and incited that demon's vindictiveness.

350
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,170
Li Chenlan destroyed our Jianxin Sect out of a selfish desire.

351
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,790
He harmed my brother, who until today hasn't awakened yet.

352
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,510
The Demon-Shield Ward was the pillar of the faith in our Immortal Sect.

353
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,750
This move by Li Chenlan was truly beyond savage.

354
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,340
He thoroughly disregards us.

355
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,430
No need for empty words. Kill off Wan Lu Sect.

356
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:58,660
What a reckless courage. Jianxin Sect could not dispose of him even with the Demon-Shield Ward,

357
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,170
do you want to go just to meet your fate?

358
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,420
Furthermore, with your countenance,

359
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,480
it would certainly be an ugly death.

360
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,030
Since Revered Lady Changyu summoned us here today, have you already thought of a way to deal with it?

361
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:19,370
Taking into account the whole of Jianghu, at present there's only one person who can oppose Li Chenlan.

362
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,550
The Revered Lady means...

363
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,750
Jin Xian. Luo Mingxuan.

364
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,450
The Immortal Sect's Grand Meeting is almost over.

365
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,060
I can't learn the Teleportation Technique.

366
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,440
I'm so useless!

367
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,490
To tell it plainly, the Teleportation Technique is a state of mind.

368
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,100
You just need to experience it and you can grasp the feeling.

369
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:45,520
You've already learned the technique and hand moves. You only need to find the feeling.

370
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,390
Feeling?

371
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,610
Back then how did your father send you off from Jianxin Sect?

372
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,590
- Father!
- Don't come here!

373
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,520
Father...

374
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,420
I get it.

375
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,350
Revered Lady Changyu, what do you mean?

376
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:26,010
Everybody knows that Jin Xian was sealed off long ago and has been sleeping for many years.

377
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,960
I have found the method to break the seal.

378
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,380
Only, it needs... a little bit of blood from Pavillion Leader Qin.

379
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,350
Within three days, we'll be able to wake Jin Xian.

380
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,640
Revered Lady, wouldn't drawing blood injure the Pavillion Leader?

381
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,750
Naturally not. How could I do something that harmed fellow disciples from the Immortal Sects?

382
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,990
Everyone, thinking back to when Jin Xian led all of our Immortal Sects,

383
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,540
we looked down on Jianghu and nobody would disrespect us.

384
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,030
But ever since Jin Xian fell to sleep, each Immortal Sect has been fending for itself,

385
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,770
like grains of sand. This is why Wan Lu Sect could take advantage of our weakness.

386
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:23,370
At present, Li Chenlan can push us around without us having the strength to retaliate.

387
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,970
Don't you all miss the glory of the past?

388
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,590
Don't you all wish to win back the Immortal Sect's pride?

389
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,890
In my opinion,

390
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,870
now the only one who can contend with Wan Lu Sect is Jin Xian.

391
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,030
In order to ensure the stability of our Immortal Sect in Jianghu,

392
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,050
waking Jin Xian is imperative.

393
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,990
Pavillion Leader Qin, you may as well donate a bit of blood.
