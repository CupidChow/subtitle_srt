00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,810
Search thoroughly! He's hurt! He can't have run far!

4
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,120
You go there! You go that way!

5
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,050
Zhiyan!

6
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,920
Why are you here?

7
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,700
Let me see.

8
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,660
Zhiyan, come away with me.

9
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,360
By then, Cangling will be certainly surrounded by Wan Lu disciples.

10
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,720
He will surely not be able to break through.

11
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,850
But you're currently the Sect Leader's pupil. You can let Cangling seize you.

12
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,740
We are surrounded by Wan Lu disciples. I'm the Sect Leader's pupil. In a bit, seize me.

13
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,840
Zhiyan, you...

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,500
Hurry up, the sun's setting. When I'm visible, we'll be exposed.

15
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,580
- Zhiyan!
- Hurry up! Let's do it.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,740
Save me!

17
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,330
Make way!

18
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,070
You need to scream. Even if you're not hurt, at least coordinate with your Brother Cangling!

19
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,510
Hold his hand back!

20
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,940
You have to enhance the mood! Say you're scared, make them go away, say this guy's grasp is hurting you!

21
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,430
Act more realistically, okay?

22
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,030
It hurts. I'm scared.

23
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,490
He'll kill me. You all make way.

24
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:41,300
Don't move! Anyone dares take a step, I'll kill your Sect Leader's pupil!

25
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,460
Can you put some heart into it? Scream! Louder!

26
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,240
I'm scared! It hurts!

27
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,090
He'll kill me! You all make way!

28
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,390
- Quickly! Inform the Sect Leader!
- No, no, no, no, no!

29
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,650
Oh, no!

30
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,140
This old man, me, was not aware

31
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,370
that these days on Chenji Mountain

32
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,300
there's room for rascals to cause strife here.

33
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,850
North Hill Master!

34
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,980
"Rather meet Lu Zhaoyao than the North Hill Master."

35
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,220
This time you two have met both.

36
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,570
People from the Immortal Sect actually show their impudence here in Wan Lu?

37
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,530
I never imagined his power had grown so much.

38
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,190
This is bad. Ten thousand Canglings wouldn't even tickle him.

39
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,190
People from the Immortal Sect are no more than this.

40
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,190
Stall for time, until nightfall. Then I can face him for you. Hurry.

41
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,120
N-N-North Hill Master, I'm the Sect Leader's pupil.

42
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,730
- P-Please save me–
- Little girl,

43
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,780
you are the Sect Leader's pupil. Of course, I shall save you.

44
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,330
Zhiyan!

45
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,980
Brother Cangling!

46
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,190
People from Jianxin are nothing but this.

47
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,730
Brother Cangling!

48
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,520
You old man, you're actually acting like this in the open!

49
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,050
Don't insult our Jianxin Sect!

50
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,860
Brother Cangling!

51
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,330
Back then the Immortal Sect battled with our previous sect leader in the Sword Tomb,

52
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,160
you all put a lot of effort into that.

53
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Today, for the sake of our previous leader,

54
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to get that off my chest!

55
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,210
This old man is making my heart conflicted with these words.

56
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,170

I beg you to stop hitting.

63
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,930
Stop!

64
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,500
Please don't hit anymore.

65
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,690
You're the Sect Leader's pupil. Why would you defend a kidnapper?

66
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,640
Please don't hit him anymore, all right?

67
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,970
Take Liu Cangling away!

68
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,590
Naive!

69

Sect Leader, Jiang Wu's remaining rebels in Jiangzhou have been wiped out.

70
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,420
We are also chasing after the ones who fled.

71
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,270
As for Jiang Wu, though his whereabouts are unknown, in the immediate time he'll have no way to cause a ruckus.

72

Hurry up! With Yuan Jie's current power, neither of you are his match.

78
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,920
We can't, Demoness. Brother Cangling is too badly hurt!

79
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,160
Hide well. Don't come out.

80
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,040
I told you to stop fighting! Can't you hear?

81
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,430
How arrogant for a young person!

Zhaoyao?

83
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,290
It doesn't matter if you don't tell me. I'll just pick one for you.

84
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,120
I'll call you Mo Qing!

85
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,990
Mo Qing... Mo Qing... It's also easy to remember.

Greetings, Sect Leader!

87

Sect Leader, I'm in pursuit of the man from the Immortal Sects.

88
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,880
But your disciple

89
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,850
blocked my way. This action of hers...

90
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,720
What about it?

91
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,410
I'll make a judgment on this matter. You may go back now.

92
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,680
How's your injury?

93
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,760
Judging from Little Monster's tone...

94
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,560
is it possible that my previous seduction worked?

95
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,930
I can seize the opportunity to kill him.

96
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,950
I still can't gather up my energy.

97
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:20,020
Master, just now, I thought... I'd never see you again.

98
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,890
That won't happen.

99
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,350
If you want... I will always be with you.

100
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Master, how should we deal with the man from the Jianxin Sect?

101
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,530
- Execute him.
- Yes.

102
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,100
Master, he's my childhood friend who grew up with me.

103

He's my fiancé as well.

Although I don't love him,

105
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,960
he's still among the people closest to me.

106
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,990
You want to save him?

107

You're awake?

You have slept the whole day. Don't you need to follow Miss Zhiyan?

Miss Zhiyan! I'm so dead.

You asked for me?

127
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,520
Check her injury.

128
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,670
- How is her injury?
- Only superficial wounds.

129
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,950
She's just slightly worn out in her inner force.

Gu Hanguang, I hope you've been well.

How long will it take for her to heal?

132
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,980
No need for treatment. Just take some medicine to mend and replenish her energy.

133
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,350
What? He's not planning to treat me?

134

But the one out there has a more severe injury.

135
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,000
Once he's healed, toss him out of Chengji Mountain.

Fine. As long as he doesn't die.

You've severely exhausted your inner force, meditate well and get better.

143

Come get the second pill from me in ten days.

144

I thought you were going to give me the whole box.

145
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,560
Master, then I'm going to meditate.

I'd get a sliver of good luck where you're concerned.

But you must hate me so much now.

I'm aware that between you and I, besides the battle of Sword Tomb,

154

to me the feelings between us may have been pure beauty.

It is fortunate to have you back after losing you, I do not ask for anything else.

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,400
That little brooder! When did he leave? I didn't even notice.

163
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,030
- Captain.
- Is the Sect Leader inside?

164
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,430
During the guard shift change, they said he never left.

165
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,500
Qin Zhiyan?

166
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,110
That... I don't know. She should... also be inside.

167
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,520
Open the door.

168
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,900
How come they're gone?

169
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,590
Qin Zhiyan? What are you doing here?

170
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,320
I...

171
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,720
Why is she here?

172
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,280
Why are you here instead of waiting at Teasing Moon Peak?

173
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,020
Miss Zhiyan, when did you come out?

174
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,100
I... I... before...

175
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,060
Why are you scared of her? Throw it back at her. Since when is it her business to manage Pure Wave Palace?

176
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,410
If you're healed, Miss, hurry back to Teasing Moon Peak.

177
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,390
Why are you caving?

178
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,500
Let's go...

179
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,940
- Let's go.
- Fine.

180
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,600
I'll settle this myself later.

181
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,250
Enough, enough! Let's go!

182
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,010
That Qin Zhiyan is such a lunatic.

183
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,340
You've been in Wan Lu so long, it's about time for you to grow that chicken spine of yours.

184
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,120
But we should get along well with others.

185
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,230
What did you come out of the room for?

186
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,520
Oh, right, I came to ask about Brother Cangling.

187
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,560
What about him? How is he now?

188
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,700
He was healed by the South Hill Master and thrown out of Chenji Mountain. He won't die, so don't worry.

189
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,800
So Wan Lu's South Hill Master is that great!

190
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,240
But Brother Cangling's wounds were so serious, was he really healed in one day?

191
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,700
Of course. If Gu Hanguang didn't even have such skill,

192
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,280
would I have let him be my South Hill Master?

193
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,940
Then, what about you? Did he also heal you?

194
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,830
You seem to have recovered from North Hill Master's attack.

195
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,100
I only ate one Nine Cycle Pill. But that also came from Gu Hanguang, so you can say he healed me, too.

196
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,610
The Nine Cycle Pill?

197
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,930
I got it!

198
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:29,180
It's that all-powerful medicine for which they say "Better lose the way to Heaven than waste a Nine Cycle Pill!"

199
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,860
If the South Hill Master can make the Nine Cycle Pill, why can't he cure himself?

200
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,220
I heard that he used to be an elegant young lord.

201
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,370
You know quite a lot.

202
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,690
This South Hill Master used to be a man form the Xu Zong Sect, one of the top ten Immortal Sects.

203
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,130
Later, he betrayed the Xu Zong Sect. His name is Gu, formal first name is Chen, casual name is Hanguang.

204
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,330
They called him "Yama's Scourge," because his medical skill could snatch the dying from the grasp of Yama, the King of Hell.

205
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,660
After he became famous in his youth, he retired to a secluded life in the wilderness, nowhere to be found.

206
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,410
Afterward, the only news of him that spread around Jianghu

207
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,760
was that I'd recruited him into my Wan Lu Sect.

208
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,530
He went from a young lord, as pretty as jade, to a pale-faced man.

209
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,040
Since then, his extreme chills became even more severe.

210
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,340
Since then, it was rumored all through Jianghu that I, Lu Zhaoyao, in my greed for power,

211
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,780
had used too much strength and harmed Gu Hanguang.

212
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,940
So... was it really you?

213
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm as free as the wind and the waves; I've been drifting in Jianghu for so many years,

214
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,610
looking around the whole world. No man can be more dashing than me.

215
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:08,770
I only admired Gu Hanguang for his medical skills. If it is about greed for power, he should be the one after my power.

216
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,950
Then... he...

217
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,360
He did become like this for a woman, but that wasn't me.

218
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,100
Then, who was it?

219
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,650
This is Gu Hanguang's matter. You can go ask him yourself.

220
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,600
Come on...

221
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,900
How could I go ask him? Just tell me a little.

222
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,740
I... I promise I'll do good things for you! Okay?

223
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,680
Isn't doing good things your duty already?

224
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,090
Don't go back to the Teasing Moon Peak. Go straight down the mountain and get to work.

225
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,790
Go. Right. Now.

226
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,660
Go.

227
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,850
- Do you need help?
- No, no.

228
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,660
Do you any help?

229
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,690
- Hello! Do you need help?
- No need, no need.

230
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,860
Zhiyan!

231
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,330
Brother Cangling!

232
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,170
Zhiyan, hurry and go back with me.

233
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,390
The South Hill Master already completely healed you.

234
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,360
Since you're fine, if there's nothing else, go back as soon as possible.

235
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,400
No! I want to take you away.

236
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,250
Brother Cangling, why can't you understand?

237
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,220
I'm not going back with you. We can't go back at all.

238
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,980
As I see it, Jianxin Sect, at the moment, is a hundred times more dangerous than Wan Lu Sect.

239
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm doing very well in the Wan Lu Sect . They didn't imprison me, nor did they hit me or yell at me.

240
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,910
You saw it. I can completely get in and out at my will now.

241
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:35,110
This is my own choice. In the future, don't talk about taking me back. You can go.

242
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,510
Zhi...

243
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,930
Sect Leader.

244
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,800
Where's Qin Zhiyan?

245
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,230
She went back to Teasing Moon Peak.

246
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,090
Have the Cleanse Dust Palace cleaned up.

247
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,350
- Cleanse Dust Palace?
- Clean it up well.

248
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,300
No need for complicated furnishing and decorations. A simple style is better.

249
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,710
Have the bedding laid in the northwest corner.

250
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,600
Northwest corner? Won't that be just a wall away from Sect Leader's bed?

251
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,400
- Proceed.
- Yes.

252
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,160
Sect Leader.

253
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,070
What did the Sect Leader order? Why does he even look happy?

254
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,710
Go. Have the Cleanse Dust Palace cleaned up.

255
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,970
The Cleanse Dust Palace? What for?

256
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,870
Could it be that the Sect Leader wants to have that Qin Zhiyan...?

257
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:01,230
Forget it. This way it's also better for Brother Cangling.

258
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,730
Keep my chin up!

259
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,980
Hello, do you need any help?

260
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,720
No, no.

261
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,160
Hello, do you need help?

262
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,060
No, no.

263
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,430
You really don't need any help?

264
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,470
I can...

265
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry.

266
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,530
Li... Li...

267
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,750
Leader Li.

268
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,290
I'm sorry, I offended you.

269
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,250
Get up.

270
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,070
Don't you know that someone wants your life?

271
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,860
I-I know.

272
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,220
Then, why did you still go down the mountain?

273
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,810
To do good deeds for Lu Zhaoyao.

274
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,560
Next time you go down the mountain, have Ah Da go with you.

275
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,280
You must return to Wan Lu Sect before sunset.

276
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,020
Yes.

277
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,140
Scared me to death.

278
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,650
There's nothing to learn in this one either.

279
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,350
But I can give it to that little girl, Zhiyan.

280
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,610
Thank you, Sect Leader, for escorting me back.

281
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,830
Take it.

282
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,320
This... This... What is this?

283
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,890
Wear it the next time you come out.

284
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,920
All right.

285
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,230
Go ahead and pack your things. In a bit, you're coming with me towards the Wu'e Hall.

286
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,610
I'll wait for you in this yard.

287
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,530
Why did you come back together with Little Monster?

288
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,170
No way, no way. I really can't spend time with Li Chenlan.

289
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,760
When I walk, my arms and legs are moving together at the same time.

290
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,080
Even if he doesn't talk, his aura is still suffocating me.

291
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,640
Next time, don't forget to call him Master. Be more natural and cute.

292
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,080
Come, show me.

293
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,560
Ma- Ma- Master.

294
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,810
What is that in your hand?

295
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,630
He gave it to me. I don't know what it is, either.

296
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,420
A token of love! Put it on and go seduce him.

297
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,130
Make him go to Library Pavilion and find better secret manuals and give you better medicine.

298
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,040
No, I'm not going. I'm not going.

299
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,590
Useless!

300
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
I'll go.

301
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,410
Master.

302
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,030
Let's go.

303
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,050
- Go where?
- Wu'e Hall.

304
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,400
Why are we suddenly going to Wu'e Hall?

305
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,170
Are you not my disciple?

306
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,360
It doesn't stand to reason for the Sect Leader's disciple to stay at Teasing Moon Peak.

307
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,470
This little monster.

308
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,280
You don't want to go?

309
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,140
No, I want to go!

310
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,690
Let's go. I'll do whatever Master says.

311
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,110
You just like this body and you want to live with her.

312
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,860
You just want to see her, hold her, and take advantage of her at any time, right?

313
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,790
Don't think I can't see through you, you little frosty poser.

314
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,310
Master, this road is so long, my legs are sore.

315
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,430
How 'bout you carry me?

316
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,590
Come here.

317
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,090
I'm very heavy.

318
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,860
I can carry you.

319
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,380
Let's go!

320
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,430
Quicker.

321
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,310
Let's go.

322
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:11,060
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

323
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:17,090
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

324
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,530
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

325
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,690
♫ Step into a fiery sea, to become a god  ♫

326
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:32,050
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

327
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:39,620
♫ On the remote road, I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

328
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:47,080
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

329
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:54,510
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

330
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:05,540
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

331
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:26,140
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

332
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:32,190
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

333
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,620
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?  ♫

334
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,530
♫ Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

335
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:47,060
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

336
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:54,530
♫ On the remote road, I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

337
00:39:54,530 --> 00:40:02,010
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

338
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:09,530
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

339
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:17,020
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

340
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:24,590
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and heart are shaken  ♫

341
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:32,060
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

342
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:39,650
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

343
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:50,780
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
