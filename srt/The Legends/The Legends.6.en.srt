[Episode 6]

3
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,150
Pavillion Leader, Miss Zhiyan came out of Sushan today,

4
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,390
knocked out a disciple and left the Thousand Dust Pavillion, and we don't know where she went.

5
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,890
According to that disciple, Miss Zhiyan, before she left,

6
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,120
revealed she intended to avenge her father.

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,800
But in Miss Zhiyan's current's state of extreme agitation,

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,460
I fear...

9
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,050
- Send someone to find her.
- Yes.

10
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,120
What else?

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,420
There is an odd detail.

12
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,210
The disciple who was hit says he thinks he saw two Miss Zhiyan's.

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,390
But after he woke up his head hurt, we dare not be certain.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,890
Two?

15
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,020
Ah Wu!

16
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,760
Ah Wu, men from Wan Lu Sect are here.

17
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,410
They came to die.

18
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,420
Who are you?

19
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,200
Your master.

20
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,900
Demoness, you said you were going back to the Wan Lu Sect. What are you going back for?

21
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,220
I'm going back to my sect. What do you think I'm going to do?

22
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,370
You want to go back and be the sect leader?

23
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,960
But Wan Lu Sect now also has Li Chenlan as the leader.

24
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,750
So his real name is Li Chenlan.

25
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,830
Oh, right. The son of the Demon King. His surname was Li.

26
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,400
You say you want to go back to the Wan Lu Sect as a leader.

27
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,540
What if Li Chenlan disagrees?

28
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,520
Disagrees?

29
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,270
If he disagrees, I'll kill him. I'll take back what is mine.

30
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,150
Little Sister, your big sister here has a question.

31
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,890
S-S-Say it.

32
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,600
I have not left the mountain in five years. I'm unclear on the situation in Jianghu.

33
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,820
Tell me in detail.

34
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,840
What's the status of Wan Lu Sect in Jianghu?

35
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,230
The Wan Lu Sect?

36
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,730
The Wan Lu Sect is quite formidable!

37
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,450
At present... it has almost complete rule over Jianghu.

38
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,410
As for Li Chenlan... he really is at his peak.

39
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,020
At his peak.

40
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,670
What a good peak.

41
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,430
Then do you know who runs the shop in Wan Lu Sect?

42
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,340
R-Runs the shop?

43
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,120
There is a guard captain, the Dark Guards Captain, Lin Ziyu.

44
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,160
These last few years the Dark Guards have become prominent.

45
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,290
Very often, when there's something, Li Chenlan sends them...

46
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,510
to do it.

47
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,880
Lin Ziyu?

48
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,580
The Dark Guards were loyal to death to me. He's really good.

49
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,160
He managed to get all the remaining ones at his disposal.

50
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,660
What about those Four Hills' masters I had? North, South, East, and West?

51
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,890
I've only heard about the North Hill's Master, Yuan Jie.

52
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,300
About the other Hills Masters, it seems nobody ever mentioned them in Jianghu.

53
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,850
Yuan Jie.

54
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,760
Hill Master, why such fury?

55
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,670
That Li Chenlan has too little consideration of me.

56
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,150
He'll find any means to quench my power.

57
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,340
These last few years, Li Chenlan has been striving to increase his influence.

58
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,500
In our Wan Lu Sect, he's changed quite a lot of people.

59
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,970
I've been constantly obliging him,

60
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,930
merely looking forward to a day when I could welcome back our previous leader.

61
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,260
But now the Sword Tomb has been dug to the bottom.

62
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,650
Welcoming back the previous leader is an empty hope.

63
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,670
The Wan Lu Sect will never again be as it was.

64
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,930
I shall never oblige him again.

65
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,440
Hill Master!

66
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,210
Li Chenlan,

67
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,620
you are going to pay the price for what you did!

68
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,070
Now, I'll give you a chance to live. Come under my command and I'll spare you.

69
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,340
If you are unwilling, you'll have to die.

70
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,440
You want to kill me or chop me...

71
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,770
The Wan Lu people are indeed as the rumors say: all so loyal.

72
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,270
The ones who are left... may as well play a game for us.

73
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,890
My rule here is very simple.

74
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,580
Of the people who are in the cell, only one will come out alive today.

75
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,660
As for how he's coming out, that's entirely based on his skills.

76
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,150
That's fair enough, isn't it?

77
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:25,120
Go back and tell Li Chenlan that I, Jiang Wu, am now the New Mountain Sect Leader.

78
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,610
In a short while, I'll be the new Wan Lu Sect Leader.

79
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,030
Ah Wu, defying the Wan Lu Sect in our present condition doesn't seem too good.

80
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,450
No problem. What I want is arrogance.

81
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,400
Wear this.

82
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh! Right, right!

83
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,640
In other people's eyes, you and I still look the same.

84
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,300
But why don't you wear it?

85
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll wear it.

86
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,010
Wasn't this only a rundown village at the foot of Chenji Mountain?

87
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,750
When did it become such a lively town?

88
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,640
Have a look! Come and see!

89
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,740
The White Jade Altar Inn of Shunan, second-to-none!

90
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,760
The inn of the first-rate experience, from the Shunan fierce formation!

91
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,320
Have a look! Young ladies, are you staying?

92
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,460
Our White Jade Altar Inn is an exclusive of Chenji Mountain.

93
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,230
Its foundation is made with real white jade from the Wan Lu Sect's altar.

94
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,200
Inside, it's spotlessly clean. Outside, it has beautiful scenery.

95
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,090
What did you say?

96
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,880
Spotlessly clean.

97
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Before that.

98
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,180
Its foundation is made with the real white jade altar.

99
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,380
You're saying you built your place using the White Jade Altar as a foundation?

100
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,520
Ye-Yes.

101
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,050
It can't be. Nonsense! Preposterous!

102
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,540
It's true, Miss! Hey!

103
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,060
Miss! Miss! I don't know about anything else. But our foundation here

104
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,930
was really a gift from Sect Leader Li, Miss. No customer is cheated!

105
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,950
Demoness! Demoness, what's with you?

106
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,420
What's with me? What do you think?

107
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,800
When I was the Wan Lu Sect Leader, I wanted us to have such a unique style.

108
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,170
I worked so hard and dug up such a big slate of jade to use it as our altar.

109
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,640
I chopped such a big ebony tree to make our formation,

110
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,820
not to mention all the traps and tricks I spread around Chenji Mountain.

111
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,570
And spear walls, arrow walls,

112
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,460
wildfire circles, ice glazes,

113
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,970
invaders would either die or wish they'd died.

114
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,660
I spared no effort to make people think of Chenji Mountain as a terrifying hell on Earth,

115
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,250
and now somebody tells me

116
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,510
that my White Jade Altar was used to build an inn on it?

117
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,050
Attention, guests coming from the South, due North!

118
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,720
Don't miss the lucky chance you have in this town!

119
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,480
Our meat is from pigs raised in a pigsty made with authentic ebony from the Sect Gate on Chenji Mountain!

120
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,550
Our signature dish is Broadsword Meat!

121
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,300
After one bite, you're guaranteed to want more!

122
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,070
You won't want to leave without eating a whole pig!

123
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,530
Demoness, don't be angry. Don't be angry.

124
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,620
I'll go and clarify.

125
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,290
Don't get mad.

126
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,960
Guests, come on in! Come on in!

127
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,030
- Miss.
- Young chief, excuse me, how do you raise your pigs?

128
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,930
Our meat is all from pigs raised in a pigsty made with ebony from the Sect Gate on Chenji Mountain!

129
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,110
I'll tell you! The meat is succulent, crisp and tender. It has texture and is chewy.

130
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,730
After one serving, you're guaranteed to want a second!

131
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,130
Miss, come in and have a taste, then you'll know.

132
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,880
Sect Leader Li personally gave the order for us to use it.

133
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,200
Believe me! Come inside and have a taste. Our meat here, really,

134
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,600
- it's exquisite!
- Li Chenlan!

135
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,980
- Miss, hey! Don't go!
- Demoness!

136
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,550
Hey, Miss! No customer is cheated here!

137
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,570
This... This...

138
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,350
These...

139
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,310
The...

140
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,780
What's this?

141
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,010
A... A field?

142
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,120
Did I want fields?

143
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,520
I wanted fiends and demons; a reputation of infamy!

144
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,550
Troops deployed that would make the people tremble in fear!

145
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,350
Where are fiends and infamy nowadays?

146
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,130
Wan Lu Sect Leader Li gave us the land at the foot of the mountain for farming. Food and clothing are the real thing.

147
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,850
The original White Jade Altar and Ebony Tree

148
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,660
were nothing but empty toys.

149
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,450
Demoness, what's with you?

150
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,620
I need a moment.

151
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,290
I have a slight wish to go back to the ice cave for a while.

152
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,050
Look! Actually, it's quite good this way.

153
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,810
This scene is so beautiful.

154
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,750
Also, everyone seems to be working in content and in peace.

155
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,070
Li Chenlan, I hate you for snatching my sect

156
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,180
and I blame you for changing it. You're my mortal enemy!

157
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,800
I'll take you down to hell and make you plead wrongdoing on your knees!

158
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,430
Sect Leader, are you unwell?

159
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,700
No harm. What is it?

160
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,890
Reporting to you! Lü Gang's party set out to wipe out the New Mountain Sect's disciples,

161
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,960
but have not come back yet. It is much later than we expected he'd return.

162
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,330
Something's happened.

163
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,900
It is still unclear. But in my opinion, we should dispatch men to investigate.

164
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,650
Send Ah Da with people to investigate. Give support as needed.

165
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,280
Yes, sir.

166
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,150
Brother Lü!

167
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,650
Reporting to Sect Leader. When I arrived, the New Mountain Sect Leader had been murdered already.

168
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:07,440
Big Brother Lü... Lü Gang's tragic death seemed to be by the same hand.

169
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,060
It was indeed by the same hand.

170
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,190
Sect Leader, how...?

171
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,760
Sect Leader, that Jiang Wu is truly savage.

172
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,690
Please give me the order to exterminate him.

173
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,750
If he's savage, he must have his reason.

174
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,190
Don't rush into action. First, check this man's history.

175
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,130
If there is any other power behind him, you must dig it out.

176
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,810
Yes, sir.

177
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,800
You're all dismissed.

178
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,980
- Dismissed.
- Yes.

179
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,900
When will the wind of death come to a halt in Jianghu?

180
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,820
Zhaoyao,

181
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,500
the days of peace and prosperity

182
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,780
are so hard to reach.

183
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,840
Demoness, this isn't the main entrance to Chenji Mountain.

184
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,550
Where are we going?

185
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,930
To the North Hill's Master's courtyard.

186
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,400
North Hill"s Master Yuan Jie?

187
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,640
I heard that he hates us from the Immortal Sect most of all!

188
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,960
If he sees me, he'll kill me for sure!

189
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Don't be loud! Don't be submissive.

190
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,790
Follow me. I guarantee you won't die.

191
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,620
Halt! Who's there?

192
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,930
Go tell Yuan Jie that the Sect Leader is here. Make him come welcome me.

193
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,910
The Sect Leader?

194
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,990
Where is she? Let me see her.

195
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,200
Little Miss, you want to be met at the gate by our leader. How pompous you are!

196
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,590
You may not recognize me, and you may laugh at me,

197
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,190
but you have to know

198
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,330
that in the Wan Lu Sect the only thing you have to fear is to do the wrong thing.

199
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,370
If you don't open your eyes, you may end up without eyes.

200
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,970
I'll give you one more chance to go tell him to come and meet me here.

201
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,050
Stop deceiving us. If we go report it now, that will be ridiculous.

202
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,110
- Leave! Get lost!
- Yes, get lost.

203
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,030
Demoness, let's go.

204
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,220
Did you hear that? Quickly, get lost!

205
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,370
If you keep disturbing my peace, you may lose your head.

206
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,600
I say your head has no use.

207
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
Wench! You really think I can't set you straight?

208
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,830
I thought this wench was special, but in the end she can't even take one blow.

209
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,580
You even dared to demand that our North Hill's Master should come and meet you in person.

210
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,970
- Demoness, I didn't think you were this kind of Demoness.
- My fighting power!

211
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,110
You're lucky that our Master is not in today, and I can't be bothered to kill you.

212
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,170
My patience today can be a lesson to you. Leave quickly.

213
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,280
Zhiyan!

214
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,760
Brother Canling!

215
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,020
He's from Jian Xin Sect. Let's catch him! Go!

216
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,370
Brother Canling! I'm here!

217
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,800
Come, men! Somebody is trespassing in the forbidden area!

218
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,180
They didn't dare chase us. Zhiyan, you haven't been harmed?

219
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,990
- You saved the wrong person.
- Zhiyan!

220
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,960
I know, you're still under the wrong impression about my father and you're angry at me.

221
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,610
But I came to save you with a fully sincere heart!

222
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,720
What place is this Wan Lu Sect? And you dare come here alone!

223
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,300
You really saved the wrong person!

224
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,790
I'm not wrong! I just wanted to save you.

225
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,630
The people in Thousand Dust Pavillion said you wanted revenge.

226
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,580
I immediately guessed you'd come here. I'm not only going to take you away today,

227
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,680
I also want to go look for your father with you and save him.

228
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,830
- I...
- You are so annoying, I said I'm not and I'm not!

229
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,090
What to do?

230
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,710
Strangers broke into the forbidden area!

231
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,950
If the Sect Leader finds out, we'll all be sent down the mountain to farm land.

232
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,480
Sect Leader!

233
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,650
Paying respect to the Sect Leader!

234
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,880
Paying respect to the Sect Leader!

235
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,070
Someone broke into the forbidden area.

236
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,800
Yes, sir.

237
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,520
Why did you not kill them on the spot?

238
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,420
Because, Sect Leader, you previously prohibited killing without discrimination.

239
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,520
Elsewhere, of course, it is prohibited.

240
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,340
But those invading the forbidden area, no matter the reason, kill them.

241
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,060
Yes, sir! This subordinate understands!

242
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,800
When this matter is dealt with, go directly to the disciplinary hall to receive punishment.

243
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,830
Thank you, Sect Leader!

244
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,330
Sister Ziyu, how about...?

245
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,240
Tell us again how you came out of it.

246
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,990
Only one could come out alive.

247
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,940
I... I... came out by killing.

248
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,170
By rule of Wan Lu Sect, what befalls killers of fellow sect men?

249
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,610
- Captain! Captain, spare me! I was forced to do it!
- Sister Ziyu,

250
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,780
since the Sect Leader didn't say...

251
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,460
The rules are the rules.

252
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,920
- People!
- Here!

253
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,900
Captain, spare me!

254
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,590
Captain, news from the forbidden area. Someone broke through.

255
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,060
Let's go.

256
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,390
Just him, alone?

257
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,170
Reporting to the Sect Leader!

258
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,600
There was also a woman on the horse.

259
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,320
I don't know where she's gone, now.

260
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,270
I suppose she must have left.

261
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,890
- Send people to look for her.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,930
Take him away. Seal off the forbidden area.

263
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,400
- Yes, Sect Leader!
- Yes, Sect Leader!

264
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,560
Hurry up! Let's take him away! Take him!

265
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,560
You...

266
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,400
How do you walk around? Crashing into people in the middle of the day!

267
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,150
You're a big guy, what's so bad about a little bump? I didn't even complain that you were in my way.

268
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,800
All right, back to Qizhi land. The market isn't waiting for us. [Land of End Rest]

269
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,250
Qizhi land? [Land of End Rest]

270
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,200
What's that?

271
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,060
Qizhi land is just a market.

272
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,000
They only sell pills that are rare among the mortals.

273
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,080
For instance, the "dream access" pill which is used to catch dreams.

274
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,330
Or the "recovery" pill.

275
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,390
Recovery? What do you recover?

276
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,950
You recover your spirit. In a short interval, it allows people

277
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,090
to recover the fighting power to their highest point.

278
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,650
Recover the fighting power in a short interval.

279
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,610
Chief, it is obvious she's poor. Don't waste your breath on her.

280
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,660
Let's go.

281
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,310
Poor? Me, Lu Zhaoyao, poor?

282
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,340
Qizhi land [Land of End Rest ]

283
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,700
What weird place is this? How did I...

284
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,280
Little Monster!

285
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,490
I came in a rush. I forgot to pluck some green fruits for you.

286
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,930
It has been five years since I erected the cenotaph,

287
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,490
and yet I never dared to come once. Zhaoyao,

288
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,400
you resent me?

289
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,990
What a good kid. He even put up a stone for me.

290
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,860
And there's no inscription!

291
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,650
You couldn't even carve the few words

292
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,510
"Lu Zhaoyao, supreme Demon of the Wan Lu Sect, invincible in Heaven and Earth"?

293
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,160
I've taken good care of your Wan Lu Sect.

294
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,820
"Good?" Based on your words,

295
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,110
I should even thank you for killing me and stealing my place?

296
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,030
With Wan Jun Sword in my hands, I gradually found my true power.

297
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,850
You Little Monster! It was all my fault for saving you at the time.

298
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,600
The Wan Lu Sect now takes in any freemen in the world.

299
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,790
Isn't your intention to unify the whole Jianghu

300
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,850
and ascend to the supreme position? That should have been my place!

301
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,860
What you wanted,

302
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,390
I'm making it come true a piece at a time for you.

303
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,640
Right! What I wanted, you snatched it all away!

304
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,850
It's such a pity that you can't see it.

305
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,720
You even want me to see it with my own eyes?

306
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,790
Zhaoyao...

307
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,990
Fine. You dare call my name.

308
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,200
I see you want me to fight you to the death!

309
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,190
Captain!

310
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,780
- The Sect Leader?
- Captain... he's inside.

311
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,430
This subordinate is willing to make amends, pledging his life for the protection of the Sect Leader!

312
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,790
This Little Monster! The mark on his face has disappeared,

313
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,240
but now he's a thousand times more fearsome than when he was ugly.

314
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,490
Hateful!

315
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,220
Currently, between me and this Little Monster there is a difference of ten thousand Liu Canglings.

316
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,740
It's either this or die.

317
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,270
This is the only way.

318
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,600
Young Master, Sir, this little woman willingly admits defeat.

319
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,850
Remember?

320
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,770
If you can't run, yield! Saving your life is the right thing.

321
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,690
I... What's the right way to yield?

322
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,580
Young Master, Sir, this little woman willingly admits defeat.

323
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,320
Young Master...?

324
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,320
Who are you?

325
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,910
Young Master... No, Sect Leader Li, this little woman Lu...

326
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,260
looked for this place. My name is Qin Zhiyan.

327
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,280
My father was attacked by Jian Xin Sect Leader Liu Wei.

328
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,760
I am desperate. I came seeking refuge at Wan Lu Sect.

329
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,020
Unexpectedly, I was grabbed by that follower of the Jian Xin Sect.

330
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,400
Breaking through the forbidden area was never my intention. I hope the Sect Leader will have mercy.

331
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,590
"Seeking refuge."

332
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,980
Though your sword moves are not bad.

333
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,850
Seeing the Sect Leader made me too excited, I thought to exchange blows to learn.

334
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,790
Sect Leader, I wish to take you as my master.

335
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,690
You wish to take the Sect Leader as a master? You Immortal Sect lackey, dream on!

336
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,610
Who gave you such nerve?

337
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,900
Sect Leader, didn't you just say that those invading the forbidden area,

338
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,790
no matter the reason, I have to kill them?

339
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,760
Sect Leader, those who invade the forbidden area

340
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,800
according to the tradition, indeed should be killed.

341
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,340
Sect Leader, I didn't invade here. I was forced.

342
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,200
I had no intention to offend. You can't kill me.

343
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,420
In Xiyue peak, arrange your own accommodation.

344
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,050
Sect Leader, why did you let off the invader of the forbidden area?

345
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,300
You carelessly led people into the forbidden area, disrupting the peace of the previous leader.

346
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,440
There will be no second time.

347
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,340
Yes, sir. Your subordinate was wrong.

348
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,010
- Boss, are you all right?
- Boss?

349
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,330
Hey,

350
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,120
are you the gatekeeper?

351
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:08,070
Keep the gate all your life. Don't climb higher. The higher you climb, the quicker you die.

352
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:13,140
Your Sect Leader accepted me as a pupil. Hurry, take me to Xiyue peak.

353
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,200
I'm injured. Call some people and have a palanquin brought here to carry me.

354
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,730
I am now the Sect Leader's pupil. If you don't serve me properly, be careful that I might report you.

355
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,620
- You... You...
- I... I...

356
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,900
"I" what? You senseless gate servant! What did your Sect Leader just say?

357
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,510
"Kill the invaders of the forbidden area." But did he kill me?

358
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,910
He'll kill anyone else, but not me. Use your brain and think about it!

359
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,400
What she's saying does make sense.

360
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Go! Go call for a palanquin.

361
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,470
Go! You pig-heads!

362
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,060
You all actually saw with your own eyes Qin Zhiyan going to Wan Lu Sect?

363
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,750
- Deacon, forgive us!
- Deacon Chi, Liu Cangling, Xin Sect's young master found Qin Zhiyan right before I did.

364
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,180
I waited. But I really didn't get any opportunity.

365
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,880
She cannot die elsewhere. We have to think of a way to get her out.

366
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,240
Zhu Cheng.

367
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,770
Deacon.

368
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,500
Infiltrate the Wan Lu Sect. Wait for a chance to snatch Qin Zhiyan back.

369
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,690
Remember: alive.

370
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,080
Yes, sir.

371
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,400
I trust in our Deacon's skills. Since you have already sent people after Qin Zhiyan,

372
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,200
then I'll wait for your good news.

373
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,700
Revered Lady, don't worry. I will bring Qin Zhiyan to you in time.

374
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,760
Thank you, Deacon, for your efforts.

375
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,340
This is the horse Jin Xian gave you, Windchaser? He's still so daring and powerful.

376
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,870
Yes, he's still as mighty.

377
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,790
Sect Leader, we checked.

378
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,320
The man is the son of the Jian Xin Sect Leader, Liu Cangling. He's now locked in a prison cell.

379
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,850
The woman is from the Qin family of the Immortal Sect, Qin Yu's daughter, Qin Zhiyan.

380
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,600
Qin Zhiyan?

381
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,910
These sect followers look so fierce and scary, how can I go in?

382
