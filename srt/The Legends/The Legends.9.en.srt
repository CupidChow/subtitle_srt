[Episode 9]

3
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,690
I... I am the Sect Master's disciple.

4
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,530
I want to take that person's powers for myself. Remove the formation.

5
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,630
Miss, how about we share it?

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,360
No.

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,460
Release him.

8
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,240
Release him? You can't do this even if you are the master's disciple.

9
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,920
I meant I want you to remove the formation thoroughly.

10
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,390
- Miss Zhi Yan, this should do it. Right?
-Yes.

11
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,020
Open the door. I want his powers for myself.

12
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,830
Brother Cangling.

13
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,810
Zhiyan.

14
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,160
I promised your parents that I'd take good care of you.

15
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,540
Now I need you to save me instead.

16
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,090
I'm so useless.

17
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,770
Just focus on recuperating here. Right now, Wan Lu Sect could be safer than being out there.

18
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,670
Zhiyan.

19
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:13,240
What do you mean? Wan Lu Sect is a dangerous place like that of a dragon's nest and a lion's den.

20
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Even if you are mad at me, you shouldn't be saying such a thing.

21
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,700
Don't say anymore. I'm well aware of what kind of place Wan Lu Sect is.

22
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,720
I will not leave this place before I can avenge my father's death.

23
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,300
Zhiyan... Zhiyan.

24
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,110
You should rest. When you have recovered, you should leave on your own.

25
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,600
- I'll bring more pills for you. Then you can reunite soon with your father, Liu Wei.
- Zhiyan!

26
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,920
Your father's death has nothing to do with my father. There must be a misunderstanding.

27
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,220
Zhiyan, please trust me. Zhiyan!

28
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,610
Zhiyan!

29
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,820
Pavillion Master, Mount Feng is up ahead.

30
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,200
It seems like we're here early.

31
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,020
We, Thousand Dust Pavilion, rarely attend activities held by the Immortal Sects. The other sects are already unhappy about that.

32
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,930
In order to prevent idle gossip, it's good for us to come early.

33
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,120
Su Yan, everyone has a pair of eyes, everyone sees a different path.

34
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,080
It's enough to walk our own path and do our own work.

35
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,650
No need to heed what others say.

36
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,290
Yes.

37
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,760
Wow, isn't this Pavilion Master Qin?

38
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,890
How rare to see Pavilion Master Qin outside of Thousand Dust Pavilion.

39
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,910
Master Qin isn't willing to say anything more. Indeed you are proud and aloof.

40
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,660
Perhaps even your body is here but your heart still belittles us?

41
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,720
Young Master Jin Xiu, Pavilion Master is not what you...

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,970
Young Master Jin Xiu, you are mistaken.

43
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,940
Sect Leader Liu. Chang Yu Sect leader.

44
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,000
Master Qin is a compassionate person who practices Buddhism. Those who care and love the world have few words.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,460
Young Master Jin Xiu, please don't misunderstand.

46
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,940
Chang Yu Sect Leader.

47
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,950
Everyone, please have a seat.

48
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,990
We've invited everyone here today because my brother has something he must clarify to all of you.

49
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,800
I assume everyone has heard the rumor by now.

50
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,670
My good friend, Qin Yu, was killed and his daughter believes I did it.

51
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,700
To me, I find this extremely ridiculous but Zhiyan is very certain and unwavering.

52
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,550
To prevent a misunderstanding from you all, I should clarify this in person.

53
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,600
On the day Brother Qin went missing, I was having a drink with Deacon Chi at Wanxing Sect.

54
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,040
I got drunk and by the time I woke up, it was the morning. Deacon Chi can bear witness.

55
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,200
That's correct. Sect Leader Liu was indeed drinking with me at Phoenix Mountain that day. He left at the break of dawn.

56
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,080
Sect Leader Liu, you don't need to explain. We know you're not that kind of person.

57
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,700
You and Qin Yu were good friends for many years, we've all seen it. In addition,

58
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,000
your son and Qin Yu's daughter, Zhiyan, have a marriage agreement.

59
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,830
I firmly believe Sect Leader Liu could not commit such a cruel crime.

60
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,150
Pavilion Master Qin.

61
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,320
Chang Yu Sect Leader.

62
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,250
Do you have some time to speak, Pavilion Master Qin?

63
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,100
Your personal presence has brought honor and glory to us in Phoenix Mountain, Pavilion Master.

64
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,890
Chang Yu Sect Leader, you're too kind. We are both from Immortal Sects. This is also Thousand Dust Pavilion's duty.

65
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,500
This is just how Jianghu is.

66
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,410
One wave hasn't subsided, and another rises.

67
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,140
Although we are close in the Immortal Sect, troubles still keep coming.

68
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,870
Your brother's death has become an unresolved case in the Immortal Sect.

69
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,370
But the black and white of this world will one day yield the truth.

70
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,200
I heard that Lady Qin Zhiyan is currently at Wan Lu Sect.

71
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,120
Our Immortal Sect's daughter landed in an evil sect.

72
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,900
Perhaps there's an inside story to it?

73
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,000
What I mean is, if Miss Qin was abducted,

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,550
would Pavilion Master Qin need our Immortal Sect's help

75
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,290
to attack Wan Lu Sect and save Miss Qin?

76
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,680
Although Zhiyan was born into the Immortal Sect, she has her own judgment on things.

77
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,410
She's staying in Wan Lu Sect by her own choice. It is not my place to forcefully interfere.

78
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,430
I actually have another issue to ask. Chang Yu Sect Leader is experienced and knowledgeable,

79
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,710
I wonder if you've heard of the Manipulation Technique?

80
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,120
Manipulation Technique?

81
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,400
It is apparently an occult art to control people's minds.

82
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,580
Leader Qin, I wonder what the reason is that you are suddenly asking about the Manipulation Technique.

83
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,790
A few days ago, I happened to read about it while rifling through ancient texts. I'm merely curious.

84
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,900
It is getting late. I'll take my leave.

85
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,920
That is all right. Pavillion Leader, take care.

86
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,720
Revered Lady Changyu, did that Qin Qianxian find out something?

87
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,490
He didn't find anything. But we must act quickly regarding Qin Zhiyan.

88
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,650
Yes, Madam.

89
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,830
I never expected Lady Changyu to care so much about Miss Zhiyan.

90
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,530
Lady Changyu doesn't care about the disappearance of the young master of Jianxin Sect, Liu Cangling.

91
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:36,120
But when I mentioned the Manipulation Technique, she seemed to be hiding something.

92
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,820
Speaking of this, Leader, why did you suddenly mention the Manipulation Technique?

93
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,060
A while ago I saw a mark on Liu Wei's body.

94
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,060
It looked as if he'd been subjected to the Manipulation Technique.

95
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,340
But today I saw Liu Wei speak genuinely, not faked.

96
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,060
But at present we can only speculate; it is very hard to obtain conclusive evidence.

97
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,640
There is never an absolute certainty. For now, we can only walk one step at a time.

98
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,740
You and I shall proceed to the Wan Lu Sect at once, to bring Zhiyan back.

99
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,190
Yes.

100
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,580
Today, pal, I've won money. Whatever you want to eat or drink,

101
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,840
- it's all on me!
- Your word!

102
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,430
Let's find some girls then!

103
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,590
Let's go!

104
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,210
Pretty cute! Little miss, what are you here for?

105
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,790
If you have anything to say, just say it! Your big brother here will help you...

106
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,930
I... heard that this place has the 9-Turns pill.

107
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,110
I want to place a bet with this jade pendant, can I?

108
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,280
This thing looks good. Where is it from?

109
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,720
This way won't do. I can't be submissive.

110
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,570
One hand passes the medicine, the other takes the jade.

111
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,170
Otherwise, I will be leaving.

112
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,910
Don't rush it.

113
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,930
You've got the right person.

114
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,160
The thing you want is right here on me.

115
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,120
One hand passes the medicine, the other gives the jade.

116
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,240
Medicine!

117
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,030
This is wrong! This isn't the 9-Turns pill.

118
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,360
- You gave me a fake medicine!
- That's right.

119
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,750
Mine is called 7-Turns pill. That is the scent.

120
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,870
You heard it wrong. Who do you have to blame?

121
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,330
- You cheated!
- You got the goods for the money, no cheating here.

122
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,880
If you don't want to leave, little missy, you can stay and play with us a bit, too.

123
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,910
Close the door!

124
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,320
What happened? Were you bullied?

125
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,430
Demoness!

126
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,540
Five beats all!

127
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,380
- Six, six, six!
- Drink!

128
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,740
The little missy is back!

129
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,150
Come, come!

130
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,350
I heard you two played a trick to get my stuff.

131
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,780
Did I tell you that what I hate most is people willing to bet but not to admit defeat?

132
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,270
You're looking to die!

133
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,200
Are you all right? Take it easy.

134
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,850
That "Emptiness pill" has a pretty good effect.

135
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,560
Odd.

136
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,180
Reporting to Captain: the Dark Guard Squad we sent after Jiang Wu appears to have met with disaster.

137
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,480
They seem to have disappeared. We have received no communication.

138
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,130
What did you say?

139
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,950
Leader Qin,

140
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,430
forgive the late welcome. I wonder what brings you here.

141
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,500
I heard my niece is in your sect. I came for her.

142
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,950
Miss Zhiyan?

143
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,510
Precisely.

144
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,120
She certainly is in Wan Lu Sect. She is at the Xiyue peak. I'll take you now.

145
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,270
I wonder if you have heard that recently a certain Jiang Wu has been raising trouble in Jiangzhou.

146
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,820
In my opinion, he is not only opposing the Wan Lu Sect, but also disrespecting the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

147
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,360
After all, Jiangzhou City is also part of the Thousand Dust Pavillion.

148
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,300
This way, please.

149
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,360
This body now is no good. Back in the day a hundred more of them would have been no match for me.

150
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,700
And now, even a minimal action put me in such a strain.

151
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,880
Demoness...

152
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,140
Fine, spare me the thank you's.

153
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,500
If you really want to thank me, hurry up and do good things for me. What's the use of mere words?

154
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,610
Yes! I'll go do good things for you right now.

155
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,530
Leader Qin, this is Miss Zhiyan's residence.

156
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,420
Thank you, Captain Lin.

157
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,040
Why is he here?

158
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,360
Leader Qin, please take your time with Miss Zhiyuan. I have to take care of something.

159
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,690
Thank you for your trouble, Captain Lin.

160
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,410
Don't mention it, Pavilion Leader.

161
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,430
Come in.

162
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,300
Just when she is needed here.

163
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,280
- She had a brawl with the people from the betting house?
- Yes.

164
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,160
Not simply that: Miss Zhiyan was also extremely angry.

165
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,000
She said what she hates most are people willing to bet but not to admit defeat.

166
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,810
"Willing to bet but not to admit defeat..."

167
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,420
Sect Leader, I just found out that you inquired about Captain Lin;

168
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,830
Thousand Dust Pavilion Leader came and Captain Lin personally took him to the Xiyue Peak.

169
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,680
I understand.

170
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,930
Ah Da, keep watching. Report to me every day.

171
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,830
Yes, Sect Leader.

172
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,400
If I had known, I wouldn't have let Zhiyan leave a moment ago.

173
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
This Qin Qianxian has such solemn face.

174
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,900
In his presence, it feels as if no pretense can escape him.

175
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,840
Zhiyan, are you all right in Wan Lu Sect?

176
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,990
Wan Lu Sect? It's pretty good.

177
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,200
No, actually, it's not that good. People around here are a bit fierce.

178
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Are they?

179
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Yeah!

180
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,800
If we keep chatting like this, I'll get caught sooner or later.

181
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,400
Zhiyan, go back to the Thousand Dust Pavilion with me. After all Wan Lu Sect is no place to linger long.

182
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,200
About your father, I will not stand indifferent; it is under investigation...

183
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,900
Uncle... my stomach hurts so much!

184
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,000
Wait a moment, I'll be right back.

185
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Why isn't Qin Zhiyan back, yet?

186
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,200
This Qin Qianxian is a lot harder to handle than Li Chenlan.

187
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,010
Sect Leader Li.

188
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I wonder what urgent matter induced the Pavilion Leader to visit in the middle of the night.

189
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,200
I came in a hurry,

190
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
forgive the inconvenience. I came for my niece.

191
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,000
I heard that she's been imposing on the Wan Lu Sect for several days.

192
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,600
It is time to take her back.

193
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,000
Although Qin Zhiyan is your niece,

194
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you coming in the middle of the night

195
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
may still be somehow inappropriate.

196
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,600
Sect Leader Li, you are very scrupulous. I have never minded such details.

197
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
When Zhiyan comes back, I will take her home.

198
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Thank you for your hospitality these last few days, Leader Li.

199
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Shortly after she came into Wan Lu Sect, Zhiyan claimed me as master.

200
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
Since she is my own disciple,

201
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,500
her comings and goings from Wan Lu Sect are up to me.

202
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Is Leader Li saying...

203
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,500
that today it won't be possible for me to take Zhiyan away?

204
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,100
You can not.

205
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,800
Demoness.

206
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,400
Qin Qianxian is here. Send him away as soon as possible.

207
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Those two eyes of his look like they can see through everything in my mind. Just seeing him makes me panic.

208
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Wait a moment. My uncle is here?

209
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,800
Hurry up! Go send away that great Buddha!

210
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
How can my uncle be that scary?

211
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,600
Hurry up! Go!

212
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Un...

213
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,500
L-L-L-Leader Li!

214
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,800
Your uncle says he wants to take you away from Chenji Mountain.

215
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,820
I'm not leaving.

216
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Zhiyan!

217
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm not leaving! I want to improve my techniques here.

218
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Since none of you believe my words, I'll take revenge by myself.

219
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You don't believe me? Just forget it.

220
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It is not at all that I don't believe you.

221
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,400
Then, why are you not willing to avenge my father?

222
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,200
This matter still nee–

223
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,800
You not avenging my father means you don't believe me.

224
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,100
I'll stay here in Wan Lu. I think everything's better here.

225
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
All right.

226
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,700
If you are not willing to leave, I will not insist.

227
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,000
Leader Li,

228
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
my niece is staying in Wan Lu Sect; I'll trouble you to take care of her.

229
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,170
It is no bother.

230
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,000
L-Leader Li,

231
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,200
you-you're not going yet?

232
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,400
N-No-No, I don't mean to throw you out.

233
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,100
You-You stay. Stay.

234
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,240
You went to the betting house today.

235
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,810
I-I d-did.

236
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,430
The betting house is no place for you to go.

237
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Ye-Ye-Yes. I won't dare go again.

238
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,900
Even if they lend me ten sets of guts, I will not dare go again.

239
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,220
How come he's here, too?

240
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,370
Hey, stand up.

241
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
My back!

242
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,500
Why did Li Chenlan come here?

243
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,800
I don't know. As soon as I came in, I saw him there with my uncle.

244
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
How scary! Li Chenlan is really fearsome!

245
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
It's obvious that your uncle is more fearsome!

246
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,200
It's clearly Li Chenlan who's more fearsome!

247
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Whatever. As long as you didn't let them find you out, did you?

248
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,300
I don't think so.

249
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,800
Fine. This trial is more or less over.

250
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,600
In here there are pills to improve your level. Start taking them.

251
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,300
When I get even more powerful medicines, I'll share some with you as well.

252
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,000
"Jianxin White Water?"

253
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,800
Oh no!

254
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,400
I... I was too agitated a moment ago, I forgot to send Uncle to save Brother Cangling.

255
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,000
I guess your Uncle's opinion is that Liu Cangling is safer in Wan Lu Sect's cells.

256
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,600
Why?

257
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
For an Immortal Sect Leader like him to agree to let you stay in Wan Lu Sect,

258
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,800
it means that the Immortal Sect now is more dangerous than the Wan Lu Sect.

259
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Liu Cangling is the young master of the Jianxin Sect.
(Jianxin = Heart Reflecting.)

260
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,400
If he takes him away, he has no reason to keep him in Thousand Dust Pavilion.

261
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,000
An open threat is easy to dodge, but a hidden enemy is hard to prevent.

262
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,500
At a given time, Liu Cangling may die even more quickly.

263
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,900
Right...

264
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,200
Demoness, thank you.

265
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,800
What's the use in mere thanks?

266
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,900
Don't just use these empty words. Tomorrow, keep doing good things for me.

267
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,680
Come! Today, only one man can come out alive.

268
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,200
You want us to kill each other? No way!

269
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,100
You won't succeed!

270
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,700
I won't?

271
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,200
Even if I die, I would not kneel down to you.

272
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,000
Really?

273
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
Didn't you say you would not kneel?

274
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,010
If you don't start fighting, I'll blow up your heads.

275
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
Life follows death,

276
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,800
death is the beginning of life, life is but a moment,

277
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,700
let me walk free!

278
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
They all killed themselves.

279
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Who would have thought they'd be so loyal to Li Chenlan?

280
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,700
Wan Lu's Dark Guard Squad does deserve its reputation.

281
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Coming here this late again?

282
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,490
Yue Zhu, you can go first.

283
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,930
What's wrong?

284
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:57,170
I heard Qin Zhiyan said she hates those who refuse to concede defeat after losing a bet.

285
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,400
- So?
- Don't you think this phrase of hers...

286
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,450
is very similar to a person?

287
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,170
Just based on this phrase?

288
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,710
Besides this...

289
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,400
Qin Qianxian came to Mount Chenji.

290
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,860
His words seem to imply something.

291
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,020
He thinks there's a change in Qin Zhiyan's temperament, too.

292
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,470
You're thinking about her day and night. Your longing for her

293
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,330
leads you to believe that everything proves your thoughts.

294
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,670
She is by your side. Instead of speculation, asking her in person and get a feeling yourself.

295
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,420
Isn't it better?

296
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,400
The eyes can lie.

297
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,550
But not the heart.

298
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,940
Your uncle suddenly came here. Is it because you've raised his suspicions?

299
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,680
My uncle is the Chief of Qianchen Pavilion with extraordinary observation and analytical skills.

300
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,700
Perhaps...

301
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,400
Open the door.

302
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,270
Why don't you go?

303
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,990
Li...

304
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:08,600
Li... Li Chenlan is here. You go.

305
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,030
Why is he here again?

306
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,810
It's late. I wonder why Master is looking for me?

307
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,200
Everyone knows you're my disciple, and yet I haven't taught you anything yet.

308
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,060
As your master, I should be teaching you a few moves.

309
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,560
Why would he suddenly want to teach me martial arts?

310
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,980
Could he be trying to test me out?

311
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,200
Let me see your foundation skills.

312
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,610
Fortunately, I know some Sect moves. Not an issue for me.

313
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,960
Lousy skills.

314
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,650
Have you killed before?

315
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,780
Master, I've never even killed a bug.

316
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,780
Now, you've killed one.

317
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,600
Master, you're amazing.

318
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,770
Master, what can I do for you?

319
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,760
Her skills are indeed of Immortal Sect's.

320
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,100
From tomorrow onward, no need to follow her anymore.

321
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,910
Yes. But when Miss Zhiyan fought with others at the Summit of Xiyue,

322
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,760
there seemed to be some improvement in her martial arts.

323
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,720
Master, a few days ago, Qin Zhiyan sneaked into the dungeon to visit Liu Cangling.

324
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,300
I suspect that she's an Immortal Sect spy here with an ulterior motive.

325
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,200
Ah Da, why aren't you aware of this?

326
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,690
I have reported it to the master.

327
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,120
Master, she is a troublemaker. We should expel her.

328
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,000
Ah Da, continue to follow Qin Zhiyan.

329
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,430
Understood.

330
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,100
Both of you are dismissed.

331
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,450
Lin Ziyu.

332
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,900
Why didn't you inform me before you led Qin Qianxian to Qin Zhiyan?

333
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,280
I was wrong.

334
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Don't let that happen again.

335
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,780
Yes.

336
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,430
You're dismissed.

337
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:21,250
