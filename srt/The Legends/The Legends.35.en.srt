[Episode 35]

3
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,800
It's wrong.

4
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,230
It's wrong. It's all wrong!

5
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,260
Lu Zhaoyao's ways were always like lightning.

6
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,490
What she hated most was other people scheming around her,

7
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,230
stealing her thunder.

8
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,490
How could she be like this?

9
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,540
No. You're not her.

10
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,720
You're not her.

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,620
You're not the Lu Zhaoyao I followed!

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,650
You're lying to me.

13
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,290
You're all lying to me!

14
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,950
You're not Lu Zhaoyao.

15
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,660
Don't you dare pretend to be my previous sect leader!

16
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,660
You can be heartless to me,

17
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,400
but you can't be disloyal to her.

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,950
I only follow Lu Zhaoyao.

19
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,420
You're impostors... What loyalty?

20
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,030
Li Chenlan...

21
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,410
This way... We'll settle all the scores today!

- Hill Master!
- Hill Master!

23
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,250
- Hill Master!

24
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,940
Traitor! Our Dark Guards have suffered tremendously because of you.

25
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,510
Mo Qing!

26
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,330
Mo Qing, what's wrong? Mo Qing!

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,540
Mo Qing!

28
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,850
Mo Qing.

29
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,310
- Hill Master!
- Hill Master.

30
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,450
You have such skills and yet you're content with this?

31
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,860
Lu Zhaoyao!

32
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,340
You told me that year

33
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,090
that you wanted to kill all the hypocrites in the world.

34
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,990
Yet, right now, our great cause is incomplete.

35
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,260
Your ambition is dead. You've put yourself in a cage for a man!

36
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,240
I cannot accept this! I can't!

[Wu'e Hall]

41
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,240
Yuan Jie, you were harmed by enemies that year; your family was slaughtered.

42
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,200
But when you entered Wan Lu Sect you took an oath

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,290
to always be loyal; to never betray.

44
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,720
But, today, you murdered fellow sect members.

45
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,060
When you entered Wan Lu Sect, you all took an oath

46
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,460
to always be loyal to the Wan Lu Sect Leader; to never to betray.

47
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,520
Today, I, Lu Zhaoyao,

48
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,430
support Li Chenlan as Wan Lu Sect Leader. Does anyone still not accept it?

49
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,330
- This...
- Who should we listen to?

50
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,230
I don't accept it!

51
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,430
I know you don't accept it.

52
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,590
At first, you went to great pains to find anything on me and Qin Zhiyan.

53
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,140
You wished to get us cast out of Wan Lu Sect.

54
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,520
Except that, unfortunately, even when you exerted all your brains

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,310
and managed to drag me to his presence, he still didn't do anything to me.

56
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,650
Two Qin Zhiyans... with such different personalities...

57
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,720
So this was it. So the other Qin Zhiyan in the yard was you.

58
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,220
So you were always alive.

59
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,190
So you were always next to him.

60
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,920
Who dares touch my sect leader?

61
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,780
Sect Leader! You're finally back!

62
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,480
Why did you only just come back? I looked for you for so long!

63
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,850
Do you know how much I've missed you?

64
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,760
I looked for you for so long, Sect Leader!

65
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,420
I'm back.

66
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,550
Lin Ziyu, back in the day, I wiped out the Xue Sha Sect, saved Seventeen

67
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,620
and a bunch of people used for medicine testing; taking them back to Wan Lu Sect. You were one of those people, weren't you?

68
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,840
So what?

69
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,790
All these years, I've served in your Dark Guards, guarding your Wan Lu Sect.

70
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,390
I've long since paid my debt!

71
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,990
You still dare disrespect Sect Leader?

72
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,720
Do you believe I'll beat you to death?

73
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,130
So you just committed such treachery

74
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,170
and slaughtered long-time comrades, just to fulfill your personal desire?

75
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,560
Why are we still talking to her? Just beat her to death!

76
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,110
Lu Zhaoyao, I'll be back.

77
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,180
- If you have guts, don't run!
- Seventeen!

78
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,250
Don't rush. We'll take care of her later. Quelling the remaining upheaval takes precedence.

79
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,260
Go get Gu Hanguang here first.

80
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,900
Yes, Sect Leader.

81
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,730
Reporting to Sect Leader. I'll do my utmost to assist the Sect Leader

82
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,060
in eradicating Yuan Jie's leftover supporters and quell the Dark Guards' revolt.

83
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,370
Sect Leader, a moment ago, I seized Zhou Bai...

84
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,610
it's because in the past Lin Ziyu had saved Sect Leader.

85
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,130
I thought that under such a situation, Lin Ziyu had not gone renegade.

86
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,350
That's why... I helped her.

87
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,200
I understand.

88
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,490
This is a time when people are needed.

89
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,840
Follow Ah Da in eliminating North Hill's remaining dregs.

90
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,010
Yes, Sect Leader. I will spare no effort.

91
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,760
Is it all over?

92
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,100
This storm in Chenji Mountain has even disturbed Jiangzhou City.

93
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,280
Why are you here?

94
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,200
You're back.

95
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,710
You're quite unperturbed at seeing me.

96
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,250
That's because I already knew.

97
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,200
No matter what, it's good that you're back.

98
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,970
Chenlan, you need to treat your wound.

99
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,820
Seventeen already went to find Gu Hanguang.

100
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,970
That's good. This way, everyone will be here.

101
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,950
Except...

102
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,160
North Hill Master... North Hill Master...

103
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,110
Qianjin!

104
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,390
Are you all right?

105
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,870
Are you all also all right?

106
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,450
We're fine.

107
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,470
Gu Hanguang!

108
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,130
Lu Seventeen, what do you want?

109
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,400
- Come with me.
- What do you want?

110
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,720
Cut the crap!

111
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,890
Hill Master! Hill Master! I heard that the previous sect leader is back.

112
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,570
Where's Hill Master?

113
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,560
You said, Lu Zhaoyao is back?

114
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,500
Your guilt... is half mine.

115
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,820
- Sect Leader!
- Release me, Lu Seventeen.

116
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,230
You...

117
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,160
Lu Zhaoyao?

118
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,220
You are still alive.

119
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,410
Evil truly lives to 1,000 years.
(T/N: Idiom)

120
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,560
That is true.

121
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,420
I didn't compliment you.

122
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Take a look at Mo Qing. His energy is irregular. I don't know what caused it.

123
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,090
Irregular?

124
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,620
It would be abnormal if it were regular.

125
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,390
Each of you troubles me every other day.

126
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,350
If you keep this up, why not just go to my place and get poison?

127
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,920
You may as well die by poison and get it over with.

128
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,210
What are you looking at? You are the worst one of them all.

129
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,220
I almost forgot about you.

130
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,620
Luckily you are smart and found your way here.

131
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,460
Master, I brought him here as per your command.

132
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,630
Lu Zhaoyao.

133
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,430
Leader Qin, it's been a while.

134
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,480
I need to tell you something.

135
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,890
All right. Coincidentally, I also have a lot of questions for you.

136
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,950
Let's go.

137
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,230
Chenlan.

138
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,750
Back then at the Sword Tomb, you were the one who took my body away?

139
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,480
How did you know that?

140
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,490
Don't worry about how I knew it.

141
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,090
Just tell me why you did that.

142
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,520
Because my one obsession became a demon.

143
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,220
Do you still remember when we first met?

144
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,050
Back then, I lead the Wan Lu Sect southward.

145
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,140
I didn't want to lose more men so we turned back.

146
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,830
Near the Thousand Dust Pavilion, I heard that you were one of the great beautiful men of our time.

147
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,840
I was curious. I wanted to bring you back for a look.

148
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,450
You brought me back to Wan Lu Sect and stared at me for the entire night.

149
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,160
I was young and reckless.

150
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,290
Come to think of it now, my master could really predict the future.

151
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,860
He predicted that I would have a turning point in my life, and tried to steer me away from meeting you.

152
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,080
Yet some things are unavoidable.

153
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,560
After that night, my thoughts became chaotic. They slowly got transformed into an inner demon.

154
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,790
Inner demon?

155
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,890
I couldn't allow this inner demon to ruin my cultivation,

156
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,180
so I saved your injured body at the Sword Tomb.

157
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,890
Kept you inside the ice.

158
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,210
And I cast a life-prolonging spell on you, which helped me purge out my inner demon.

159
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,650
Did you get your inner demon out?

160
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,750
It was purged.

161
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,240
But it gave the world an even worse trouble.

162
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,040
That inner demon is the current Jiang Wu from New Mountain.

163
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,250
Wait a minute.

164
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,950
What did you say?

165
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,770
Let's review one more time.

166
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,020
I only look you over for one night and it caused the birth of Jiang Wu?

167
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,820
Young Master Jin Xiu, what are you here for?

168
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,990
Jiang Wu of New Mountain.

169
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,910
You probably don't want to hear polite conversation from me. I will get to the point then.

170
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,430
I came here because I want to collaborate with you.

171
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,370
Collaborate with me?

172
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,510
The Jin Xian is dead. The Wan Lu Sect is weakened.

173
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,020
I think Jianghu is missing a leader.

174
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,400
You are at your peak among all the different sects.

175
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,860
I am a high-level person among the Immortal Sects.

176
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,180
It is most fitting that you and I should collaborate together.

177
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,660
Then, would the position of leader go to you or to me?

178
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,700
The position of leader of the Immortal Sect will come to me.

179
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,020
You can have Wan Lu Sect. What do you think?

180
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,060
The suggestion is not bad.

181
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,700
But I want proof.

182
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
What proof?

183
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,410
Qin Qianxian's head.

184
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,330
All right. I agree to it.

185
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,320
You agree rather quickly.

186
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,570
Doesn't the Immortal Sects believe in the righteous way?

187
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,340
I've long considered that Qin Qianxian unpleasing to my eyes.

188
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,570
In addition,

189
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,690
no one can define what my righteous way is.

190
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,630
That's interesting.

191
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,490
Let's speak of something more realistic.

192
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,090
Before you kill Qin Qianxin, I want you to do something for me.

193
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,000
What is your intention?

194
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,820
When you kill someone, kill the heart first.

195
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,230
Lu Zhaoyao is back, isn't she?

196
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,630
I want to use this opportunity to spread a rumor in Jianghu.

197
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,590
Say that Qin Qiangxian likes Lu Zhaoyao and had exerted much effort into reviving her.

198
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,630
His saint's reputation is a mere act.

199
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,100
You want to damage his reputation,

200
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,990
demolish his position in Jianghu.

201
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,530
If you want to collaborate with me,

202
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,780
show me your sincerity.

203
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,490
I am the one who committed the mistake.

204
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,720
I caused you and the people much more trouble.

205
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,510
I came today to ask for your forgiveness.

206
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,180
Forgiveness?

207
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,610
This matter is not entirely your fault. There's no need to ask for forgiveness.

208
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,960
You are the one who preserved my body.
Whatever scores we had, they're even.

209
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,950
Not to mention, those are all in the past. There's no benefit in speaking of it further.

210
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,760
But in the future, you shouldn't harbor any more feelings for me.

211
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,720
You are so beautiful, I am afraid that Little Monster might feel grievance.

212
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,220
All right.

213
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,750
When Lu Zhaoyao and Qin Qianxian first met,

214
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,630
unforgettable feelings were bred.

215
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,180
Then, he kept her hidden for many years;

216
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,130
seeking to employ Thousand Dust Pavillion's forbidden arts

217
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,330
to revive her!

218
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,170
Revive her?

219
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,980
I didn't expect that the divine Qin Qianxian

220
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,800
was actually enchanted by that Demoness Lu Zhaoyao's beauty.

221
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,080
Then what?

222
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,600
If you wish to know what happened next...

223
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,990
come listen to next session's chapter.

224
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,800
Have some tea.

225
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,050
How does the storyteller know about all this? It must be all made up.

226
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,960
I don't know, either.

227
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,280
But a fly can't bite on an uncracked egg.
(Idiom: nothing happens if it's groundless)

228
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,800
An empty cave invites the wind, it may not be for no reason.
(Idiom: rumors may have a true origin)

229
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,750
Father.

230
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,300
Son, I have no other way. I can only imprison you here.

231
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,270
Don't be scared. Stay here. Wait for my return.

232
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,000
- Father...
- Wait for me!
- Father!

233
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,260
You will eventually ruin your body.

234
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,600
The old sickness that was healed by Rebirth Herb has now returned. It is even worse than before.

235
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,030
Do you think that you can't die because you're the son of the Demon King?

236
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,250
We asked you here for treatment. Don't weigh him down.

237
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,100
If you really care about him, ask him to take better care of his body.

238
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,680
This is the first time I see someone who hasn't died after using the Nine Heavens Spell for so long.

239
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,800
He is lucky already.

240
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,980
What did Qin Qianxian want to talk to you about?

241
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,780
Some old issues, not worth bringing up.

242
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,300
But there's one thing that's worth mentioning. That Jiang Wu's origin is truly unusual.

243
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,870
He is actually Qin Qianxian's inner demon.

244
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,840
I've learned something new, that inner demons can transform into people.

245
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,900
You are too loud. You should leave now. Don't hinder the patient's rest.

246
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,100
I am also a patient. My South Hill Master, check for me why I can't use my powers anymore.

247
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,890
Why can't you?

248
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,480
I took some pills, and in order to get rid of the pills remnants in my body, I did...

249
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,420
Then I...

250
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,030
Not only can you not use your powers, but you also can't gather up your inner breath.

251
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,320
Why did this happen? Do you feel any discomfort?

252
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,930
None.

253
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,220
It's just that I can't use my powers. Don't worry so much.

254
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,010
I have you now. You have power. Isn't that the same as if I had power? Who dares come at me?

255
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,190
That day after you killed Jin Xian, your body exploded into fireworks. What was that about?

256
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,900
It's a long story. Have you heard of the Land of Sojourn?

257
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,960
I heard that from Qin Zhiyan.

258
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,220
It is a place only those who have experienced near-death may go into.

259
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,700
There's an entrance, in the Forbidden Area in the Red-stone forest, where my burial plot is located.

260
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,100
Inside there, are many kinds of shops selling all kinds of pills with mysterious effects.

261
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,420
There's one called Empty Shop, that sells...

262
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,450
the Empty Pill which can make a person recover their power.

263
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,600
There's such an amazing pill in this world?

264
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,680
I took some Empty Pills and recovered some of my power.

265
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,900
But it caused my body to be invisible during the daytime.

266
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,820
This time I took their limited edition Empty Pill and it gave me back my peak power.

267
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,670
Come to think of it, being unable to gather my power

268
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,300
might be the side effect of this limited edition Empty pill.

269
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,250
Is there a remedy?

270
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,900
I don't know right now. I have to ask about it when I get a chance.

271
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,200
Stop worrying. Now you can see me during the day. Also, I look like myself again.

272
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,700
It should be okay now. But I am going to need your protection now.

273
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,800
You have a big responsibility. You need to take care of yourself.

274
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,970
It's okay. I am not going to leave you anymore.

275
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,440
How can you stand this?

276
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,890
I heard that Luo Mingxuan awakened.

277
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,640
I came here because I knew that someone would not be able to standstill.

278
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,300
Unfortunately, my body is not too efficient, I couldn't make it in time.

279
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,140
Since I can see that there are no more urgent issues here, I'll return home now.

280
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,690
You just arrived and you are leaving already?

281
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,580
I don't want to make the person at home wait too long.

282
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,280
- Pavillion Leader.
- Where did you go?

283
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,400
I took a walk around when I saw that you were speaking with Sect Leader Lu.

284
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,150
- Wan Lu Sect is different from its reputation in Jianghu.
- How so?

285
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,110
People say that Chenji Mountain and Wan Lu Sect are full of blood and violence.

286
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,600
Today, I saw the farmhouses and tilled land at the foot of the mountain. People providing for themselves.

287
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,280
Greenery and liveliness in the mountain.

288
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,430
The mountain peak, though still showing signs of the internal strife, emanates no feeling of death.

289
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,730
Listen with your ears, watch with your eyes.

290
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,670
Sense with your heart. That is all part of the practice.

291
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,600
You are able to understand this.

292
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,000
- It's great.
- I've learned from Master. Leader, are you ready to leave yet?

293
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,520
Wait! Wait!

294
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,780
Beautiful One, what did you speak to Sect Leader about?

295
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,710
We spoke of old times. I am planning to say my goodbyes.

296
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,000
Why are you leaving so soon? Isn't it fun here?

297
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,600
My mind is troubled.

298
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,900
I don't have a solution. I am anxious[ therefore, can't be delayed further.

299
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,830
You can go to the Library Pavilion. There are many books there.

300
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,100
Sect Leader said that place can answer the world's puzzles.

301
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,010
The Library Pavilion in Wan Lu Sect contains vast texts. That's well known.

302
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,700
Maybe I can really find the answer there.

303
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,920
Su Yan.

304
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,170
Pavilion Master.

305
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,700
You go back to Thousand Dust Pavilion first and manage affairs. I will return in a few days.

306
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,130
That...

307
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,400
Yes.

308
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,280
I will speak to Sect Leader for you.

309
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,940
Will I really lose all of my powers?

310
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,960
Sect Leader Lu, I am here to apologize to you.

311
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,340
Why do you need to apologize to me?

312
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,960
I want to represent my father and Jianxin Sect, and tell you that I am sorry.

313
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,300
I am also here to apologize to you.

314
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,010
What is there to apologize for? I dare not blame you.

315
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,730
You should blame me.

316
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,600
It's my mistake. I caused the trouble.

317
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,870
You know your wrongdoing?

318
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,570
I know it.

319
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,490
But I don't want to forgive you. Get out.

320
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,870
Sect Leader Lu!

321
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,930
Demoness, if you don't forgive me today. I will come back another day.

322
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

323
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,300
Sect Leader!

324
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,100
I just saw a delicate-looking missy by your door. Also, a man from Immortal Sects.

325
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,380
They look familiar. Who are they? Also, they look unhappy.

326
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,500
They did something bad to me. I am punishing them for a bit.

327
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,120
I will go kill them.

328
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
- Come back.
- I can't kill them?

329
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Can't.

330
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,030
All right.

331
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,800
Don't try anything.

332
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,930
What did you come here for?

333
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,660
I am here to get access permission to the Library Pavilion for the Beautiful One.

334
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:50,100
Qin Qianxian is trying to find the solution to deal with Jiang Wu.

335
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,290
Permission granted.

336
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,140
Sect Leader is the best!

337
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,400
Why are you so happy?

338
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,630
I have a playmate now.

339
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,360
Qianjin... you lost.

340
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,190
You’ve been creating medicine and playing chess in Wan Lu Sect for many years.

341
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,770
But at Rain View House, I played chess only when I was free.

342
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,740
It is natural that I lost.

343
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,610
So, you’re not accepting the result?

344
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,710
I’m less skillful in chess, why don’t we solve lantern riddles?
(T/N: Riddles popularly written on lanterns during festivals)

345
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,100
All right.

346
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,100
When drawn, it's a circle; when written, it’s a square.

347
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,460
Long in the winter, short in the summer.

348
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,960
The East Sea has a fish, it has no head nor tail.

349
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,710
Remove the backbone... and that is the answer.

350
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,980
It seems I can't beat you with lantern riddles either.

351
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,330
Then, I'll let you win next time.

352
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,940
Hill Master. Sect Leader Shen...

353
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,480
What character is this?

354
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,950
Why can't I figure it out?

355
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,530
You can't figure out the thing that you look at every day?

356
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,470
Figure it out on your own.

357
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,930
It's the character for "sun"!
(T/N: Sun: 日. Fish: 鱼)

358
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,760
Hanguang, Wan Lu Sect has been taking care of me.

359
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,540
Tomorrow night happens to be Qixi Festival.
(T/N: Lovers' day - meeting of the cowherd boy and the weaver girl)

360
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,050
How about inviting everyone here and having hot pot together?

361
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,840
Fine. For your sake, I'll make it easy for them.

362
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,590
Your injury recovers very slowly.

363
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,190
What's happening out there?

364
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,000
Today is Qixi Festival. Everyone is doing the preparation.

365
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,270
Oh right, Qianjin is preparing a hot pot at my place.

366
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,550
She asked me to invite everyone. Remember to come.

367
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,850
All right. It's been a long time since I've celebrated a festival.

368
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,570
Today, in Shunan village there's the night market. I hear it's very entertaining. Would you like to go?

369
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,240
Yes, I feel bored anyway.

370
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,050
Sect Leader, I want to go, too.

371
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,120
I'm having a date. Why are you tagging along?

372
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,190
I want to have a date with you, too.

373
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,270
At your age, you should officially go find someone else you like.

374
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,880
I officially like Sect Leader. Is that a problem?

375
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,510
It's your fault for taking Sect Leader away!

376
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,480
Hurry up and find her a husband.

377
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,420
Sect Leader, hurry up and find him a husband!

378
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,180
All right, stop arguing.

379
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,710
Don't go to the night market, you have no patience anyway.

380
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,520
Tonight, we'll go to Gu Hanguang's and have a good meal.

381
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,970
Behave.

382
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,910
What's wrong? Are you even jealous of little Seventeen?

383
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,410
I really want to hide you away.

384
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,620
I want to buy something for Demoness.

385
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,350
Have you decided what to buy?

386
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,710
Demoness doesn't like jewelry. She finds it inconvenient to carry.

387
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,630
She dislikes silks, she thinks they're cumbersome when fighting.

388
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,260
But she likes to eat.

389
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,320
She won't think it's special as a gift.

390
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,100
Brother Canling, let's go check that.

391
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,640
Zhiyan!

392
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,020
"Hair-pinning flower matching a young lord."

393
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,140
"All the time separate, biding you farewell."

394
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,660
Zhiyan, let's have a good talk.

395
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,290
Talk?

396
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,790
Talk about what?

397
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,460
Talk about how your father personally killed my father?

398
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,980
By now, between you and me, there's a rift of bloody vengeance.

399
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,620
The best I can do is not to put the blame on you.

400
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,990
As for the rest, there's nothing for us to talk about.

401
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,370
Brother Canling,

402
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,190
why can't you understand?

403
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,120
We can't go back anymore.

404
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,630
Take this.

405
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,680
- All right, thank you.
- Let's go.

406
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,470
It's really beautiful.

407
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,400
Come see! Top-quality Madiao!
(T/N: ancient game played with tiles and chips)

408
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,880
Boss, how much for this Madiao?

409
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,360
Miss, you have good taste.

410
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,190
This Madiao is made with the best jade.

411
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,200
Here. Look at this.

412
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,680
- I'll buy this.
- Okay.

413
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,610
Thank you.

414
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,030
Brother Cangling, I'm done.

415
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,740
Good.

416
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,350
Here, Miss.

417
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,300
Be safe, you two.

418
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,560
Let's go buy one.

419
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:37,620
