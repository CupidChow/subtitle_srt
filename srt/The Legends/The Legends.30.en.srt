[Episode 30]

3
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,750
I've never been here, either.

4
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,990
I still need to go back and look for Sect Leader.

5
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,180
What can we do? Find the direction, hurry!

6
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,990
Based on my own strength, at the moment I have no way to find the direction to get out.

7
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,400
Maybe... you can do it.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,160
Me?

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,990
Why?

10
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,430
You are different from other people.

11
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,520
What difference do I have? I'm just rather stronger.

12
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,380
You have an innate resistance to magic.

13
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,480
This maze of Sushan is magic, to begin with.

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
If you could come in, naturally you can also go out.

15
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,400
But... I don't know the way.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Perhaps this is a kind of fate.

17
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,750
Think in your heart about Lu Zhaoyao, about what you miss most.

18
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,910
Memory River Tea!

19
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,390
Here.

20
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,070
Thank you! Thank you!

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,590
Here! Here!

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,920
What do you want the Empty Pill for?

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,180
To recover your original physical power...

24
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,550
You... what do you plan to do?

25
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,160
Outside, I still have a sect.

26
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,260
In the sect, there are some things that I haven't had the time to settle, yet.

27
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,330
Without power, I'm afraid they'll turn against me.

28
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,070
Now I'm planning to get married here. I want to go out and get it over with.

29
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,350
That way I can make them do good deeds for me.

30
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,900
Later on, your account and your son's will be even more filled with money.

31
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,770
You have to remember to bring back some more money!

32
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,600
Here.

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,620
Sister! Sister! Sister!

34
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,400
It's our shop's Empty Pill's Extreme Edition.

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,100
it sure can make you recover your peak strength in a flash,

36
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,000
but it'll only last four hours.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,420
Also, this effect is still in the test phase.

38
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,120
As for any other effects it may have,

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,450
at the moment, they're still uncertain.

40
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,330
When time's over, Sister, how you come back is still unknown.

41
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,880
Is it certain that I'll recover my power?

42
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,390
Well, that is certain.

43
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,120
Then it's enough.

44
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,610
The terror-stricken, great demon, Lu Zhaoyao.

45
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,600
It's been very long since I last moved my muscles.

46
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,370
Welcome, Jin Xian!

"At the cry of the roosters,

(Note: quote from The Book of Songs, Airs of the States)

50
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,360
Fellow sectmen,

51
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,940
the long night has passed.

52
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,550
I wonder if the Revered Lady is going to take part in the discussion.

53
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,800
She'll be here soon.

54
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,960
I have just awakened. For a long time, I have not known about Jianghu's affairs.

55
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,740
These past years, Jianghu has been shaken by storms. There have been many changes.

56
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,250
A moment ago, I was told by the Revered Lady

57
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,700
that Wan Lu Sect's Lu Zhaoyao is dead

58
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,550
and the inheritor of Wan Lu Sect is the son of the Demon King, Li Chenlan.

59
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,820
Regarding this man's style of conduct,

60
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,890
do any of you have any understanding?

61
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,060
That kid is mighty arrogant!

62
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,030
A few years ago, when he'd just ascended as sect leader,

63
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,770
he wiped out the South Moon Order, causing a massive loss to our Immortal Sects.

64
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,890
Although these last few years he's been much quieter,

65
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:20,230
in his hands, Wan Lu Sect has been growing day by day, even more than with Lu Zhaoyao.

66
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,330
Regarding this man's conduct,

67
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,190
comrades in the alliance, do you have the force to suppress his expansion?

68
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,750
For many years the Revered Lady has been worrying about this matter, too.

69
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:43,390
Since the Sword Tomb Battle, each of the Immortal Sects has been nursing themselves; keeping a low profile.

70
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,380
Aside from their own matters, they've become indifferent to all the rest.

71
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,430
For instance, regarding Jin Xian's awakening,

72
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,800
Qin Qianxian and Shen Qianjin have been extremely uncooperative;

73
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,790
posing a hundred obstacles.

74
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,450
Thousand Dust Pavillion's Qin Qianxian?

75
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,680
Qianxian is Immortal Zidan's disciple.

76
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,200
On this occasion, how could he show such a lack of sense?

77
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,970
What "lack of sense"?

78
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,970
Jin Xian, you may have been sleeping for too long

79
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,160
and there are some things you ignore.

80
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,180
Not long ago, he joined forces with Li Chenlan to handle a matter.

81
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,590
Recently, he's also been getting very close to Wan Lu Sect.

82
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,590
I wonder what kind of mind is lurking under his pretty skin.

83
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,910
It appears that lately, within our Immortal Sects,

84
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,830
we need a bout of purging.

85
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,660
Revered Lady, today you're really beautiful.

86
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm old. I surely don't have the spirit I once had.

87
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,960
Revered Lady, your appearance is as alluring as it was back then.

88
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,140
The only thing I don't understand is, Jin Xian has been awake for days

89
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,900
and yet he has not mentioned the wedding with you, Revered Lady.

90
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,990
I say it is not right by you.

91
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,200
What's this nonsense?

92
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,970
At present, we have a great enemy in front of us. Jin Xian is a man who holds the whole world in his heart.

93
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,550
How can he put such matters first?

94
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,520
But, Revered Lady, you've waited so long already!

95
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,320
I've waited this long for him to wake up.

96
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Since he's awake now, of course, I'm at ease.

97
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,550
For everything else, there will be ample time.

98
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,150
I well know Mingxuan's feelings for me.

99
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,930
He's a gentle and considerate man.

100
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,840
Of course, he won't let me down.

101
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
Mingxuan!

102
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,370
What are you doing?

103
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,740
I'm reading something.

104
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,990
I heard from my brother that a short while ago, free rebels revolted in the South.

105
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,610
Is it for this reason that you've been gone so long this time?

106
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,830
Are you tired?

107
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm not tired.

108
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,240
Recently, I heard you've been ill. Is your health recovered?

109
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,620
It was just a minor illness. No great harm.

110
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,220
Seeing you return in triumph, I recovered almost fully.

111
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,590
On the way back, I saw this piece of jade in good condition,

112
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,230
I know that you like these things and I bought it.

113
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,120
Thank you for remembering.

114
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,000
It's my duty.

115
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,150
The wind's strong outside. I'll escort you back in.

116
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,450
Enough.

117
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,100
Let's go to the hall. Lest we keep them waiting too long.

118
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,570
Yes.

119
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,560
How can it be?

120
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,160
Lu Zhaoyao!

121
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,950
You aren't dead.

122
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,830
Indeed, a devil is hard to tame.

123
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,550
Don't you worry, Jin Xian.

124
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm just here to take you back to eternal rest.

125
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,820
Liuhe Tianyi!

126
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,740
Luo Mingxuan, you think you can kill me?

127
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,080
I should have killed you the first time we met, and not let you run wild to this point.

128
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,050
Aren't you saying it in reverse?

129
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Upon our first meeting, shouldn't I have been the one to kill you?

130
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,340
Lu Zhaoyao!

131
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,060
You ruined half of my life. I thought you'd died and that was it.

132
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,780
Since now you're back to life, if I don't stab you to death myself,

133
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,260
- ...I won't be free of years' worth of hatred!
- Suruo!

134
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,900
Bring it on.

135
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,920
Half of my heart is filled with demon essence. It's all thanks to her!

136
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,280
If I can't stab her, I won't be rid of it.

137
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,260
You Immortal Sect people have no clean slate.

138
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,900
Luo Mingxuan, demon essence is evil.

139
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,460
Why don't you eradicate her first, as a warning to others?

140
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,310
Fulfill your reputation as self-less Gold Deity!

141
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,090
You b*tch!

142
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,100
Good girl.

143
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,400
Suruo!

144
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,750
Stop there! I know what you want to do.

145
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,400
Just awakened from a deep slumber, your inner power is not enough. Right?

146
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,560
You want to preserve your strength while you let these tools eat into my force.

147
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,750
When I'm weak, you'll finally move to kill me.

148
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,170
But I don't have so much energy to waste on others.

149
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,500
Make them withdraw the formation and then scram away!

150
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,110
I want to kill you, you want to kill me.

151
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,720
No one else butts in.

152
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,160
Otherwise, how about I first kill your wife, here, who's already dipping into demon essence?

153
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,470
You Immortal Sect people shout "Kill the demon! Kill the demon!" all day long. Now we have one right here.

154
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,730
Today, I'll just do a good deed.

155
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,700
Lu Zhaoyao, kill me!

156
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,660
I've already died once, I'm not afraid of you!

157
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,390
I just love the way you guys never repent even in death.

158
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,390
Fine.

159
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,080
Maybe I can hold up your reputation for you first.

160
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,160
Stop!

161
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,790
Let her go. I'll remove the formation.

162
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,270
Mingxuan!

163
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,130
Fine.

164
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,220
Keeping the promise.

165
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,470
Luo Mingxuan, in the past you wanted to kill me.

166
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,280
Just because I was born in demon essence,

167
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,300
I had to be a follower of pure evil.

168
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,030
I felt down for a while,

169
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,520
but then I was relieved.

170
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,040
If the world's Right Way is all like you people,

171
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,050
then I might as well be born a demon!

172
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,550
You said it right.

173
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,380
If you are the Right Way,

174
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,830
then I'm just destined to be the Right Way's enemy!

175
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,750
I used to think I could teach you to be good.

176
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,380
But you still saved the Demon King's son, set up Wan Lu Sect, and you're just as obstinate.

177
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,930
That's right! I'm just that bad!

178
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,760
You have any complaints?

179
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,840
When you save people, you're kind. When I save people, I'm evil.

180
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,360
When you set up a sect, it's right.

181
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,110
When I set up a sect, it's wrong.

182
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:26,440
Your belief is "perseverance." My belief is "obstinance." Where's the sense is this?

183
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,600
Don't you know why you were born in demon essence?

184
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,330
You were born in the land of the Demon King's seal. A thousand years ago, when the Demon King died,

185
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,860
inevitably his blood was unguarded; so he sealed off his son, ensconcing him up on that mountain.

186
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,480
The Demon King protected his son, and he also posed a magic seal on that place.

187
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,500
Since then, all the villagers on the mountain were infected by the demon essence.

188
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,830
Everyone was born a demon.

189
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,470
They couldn't go out. Outsiders couldn't get in.

190
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,160
That was the land cursed by the Demon King

191
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,550
to make the villagers, generation by generation, protect his descendant.

192
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,970
Such was your birthplace.

193
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,210
What a load of crap!

194
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,750
That's fine. I can take advantage of it to take a breath.

195
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,990
That year I set out on my own to eliminate the Demon King's son. I broke the seal,

196
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,350
but I was wounded by it; I fell off the cliff and was saved by you.

197
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,680
I thought I could direct your mind to be good, but I never expected

198
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,470
that, later, as soon as you came down the mountain you'd save him.

199
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,880
I'd been hurt by the Demon King's seal and had not healed.

200
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,490
While I was recuperating on Phoenix Mountain, the Immortal Sect located that Demon Son

201
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,950
and called all the sects to join forces and eliminate this scourge. But you,

202
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,070
instead, wounded a multitude of our Immortal Sect masters with cruel means, just to save that calamity.

203
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,370
Afterwards, you set up Wan Lu Sect, slaughtered our Immortal Sect members

204
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,970
and you pushed Li Chenlan up to the position he is now. This is your nature.

205
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,190
A demon...

206
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,650
is always evil.

207
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,130
Subdue demons!

208
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,340
Lu Zhaoyao has me to protect her.

209
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,240
The son of the Demon King!

210
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,380
Jin Xian! Revered Lady! Since Lu Zhaoyao and Li Chenlan are both here,

211
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,770
and Jin Xian has just recovered, I'm afraid it's not appropriate to engage with them directly.

212
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,850
How about we take a step back now, keep our strength, and then regain momentum?

213
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,540
It can't be. Today, I want to kill her at all costs!

214
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,450
Suruo, Deacon Chi's words make sense.

215
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,940
My power has not recovered yet. We have to avoid this attack and retreat for the moment.

216
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,290
Wait for the day when my power is recovered: I'll cut them both down by my sword and return the peace to the world.

217
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,950
Zhaoyao,

218
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,740
is it really you?

219
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,120
It's me.

220
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,610
It's really me.

221
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,340
It's me.

222
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,960
Luo Mingxuan is still alive.

223
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,590
Not for long.

224
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,980
We can't let him get away. Chase him!

225
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,130
You stay here.

226
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,810
I didn't crawl out of the abyss of death to come and play around.

227
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,010
If you fight, I'll be the sword.

228
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,580
If you fold, I'll be the shield.

229
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,450
Luo Mingxuan has awakened. Zhaoyao won't leave him alone.

230
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm afraid the peace has been broken.

231
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,020
Yuezhu, I'm making a trip to Wan Lu Sect to check the situation there.

232
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,040
Stay here and wait for me. I'll be back in a few days.

233
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,290
Come back soon. You haven't finished the story from last time, yet.

234
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,160
There will be a fight at Phoenix Mountain.

235
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,020
Everyone be vigilant! You got that?

236
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,130
Yes, we understand.

237
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,260
[Wan Lu Sect]

238
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,270
That's a large troop of Dark Guards.

239
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,320
It appears this time that something big is stirring.

240
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,160
Where are you going?

241
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,080
Jin Xian has awakened and the Immortal Sects are facing a huge threat.

242
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,420
As the Master of Rain View House, I must head to Phoenix Mountain to stop the fight.

243
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,460
You still have the Cold Poison in your body. What can you do there?

244
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,250
Cold Poison?

245
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,920
I never told you about the Cold Poison in my body.

246
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,190
How did you know?

247
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,430
From my observation for the past few days.

248
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,420
It took Sect Leader Jiang several months

249
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,230
to identify the Cold Poison in my body.

250
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,570
How did you ascertain that it was Cold Poison in just a few days?

251
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,660
South Hill Master, I've been wondering for a while now.

252
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,990
The knot on your herb pack

253
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,800
is the same as the knot from the mysterious man who sends me medicine every year.

254
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,040
I've no idea what you're talking about.

255
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,650
South Hill Master!

256
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,410
Please let me finish.

257
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,220
Throughout my stay here,

258
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,690
I've had a vague feeling as though you were my friend of many years.

259
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,270
Everything you say and do feels so familiar to me.

260
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,420
But when I try to recall, I can't seem to remember at all.

261
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,140
South Hill Master, I think you must be hiding something from me.

262
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,110
Can you please tell me the truth?

263
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,260
There's nothing to tell you.

264
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,130
We've never met prior to this, and now we aren't that familiar either.

265
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,390
I reminded you because it's my duty as a physician.

266
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,920
If you insist on going, then so be it.

267
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,660
South Hill Master.

268
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,180
Leader.

269
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,310
What is it?

270
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,450
I received a letter from our sect reporting that Luo Mingxuan fought with Li Chenlan and Lu Zhaoyao on Mount Phoenix.

271
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,100
Lu Zhaoyao?

272
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,990
How could she appear?

273
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,500
No one knows. But as soon as she appeared, she broke the barrier outside of Phoenix's Song Hall.

274
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,490
She seems to be planning to seal off Jin Xian again.

275
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,150
Are all the Immortal Sects there?

276
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,530
Except for Thousand Dust Pavilion.

277
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,450
Jianxin Sect, which was recently attacked, has not sent men either.

278
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,860
Only Revered Lady Liu Suruo was there.

279
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,500
What about Miss Zhiyan?

280
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,710
She already left Mount Chenji.

281
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,090
They said Liu Suruo threatened to kill Liu Cangling

282
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,580
in order to obtain Qin Zhiyan's blood.

283
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,290
Go back and tell everyone not to leave Rain View Sect.

284
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,380
The battle on Phoenix Mountain is not a battle of justice.

285
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,670
It's about a personal feud.

286
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,450
Our Rain View Sect can't stop them.

287
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,570
Yes, Leader.

288
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,980
What are you laughing at?

289
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm laughing at a certain overconfident someone.

290
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,680
She thinks she's different from other people.

291
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,930
But what happened in the end?

292
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,320
Ended up just like me.

293
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,510
Locked up in this dark dungeon cell.

294
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,250
Yuan Jie, I'll kill you one day.

295
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,920
You... love Li Chenlan.

296
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,930
But he has never held you in his heart.

297
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,080
You're no match for Qin Zhiyan.

298
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,950
You can't even compare to that fool, Ah Da!

299
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,460
A man whom you can never get...

300
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,500
Do you still want to give your all to serve him?

301
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,450
Sect Leader, this person was sneaking outside a moment ago. She's extremely suspicious.

302
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,620
Moreover, no matter how I asked, she refused to show her face.

303
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,580
What's so suspicious in my maid coming to see me?

304
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,790
She's timid and you scared her.

305
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,450
You haven't even seen her face; Miss Zhiyan, how do you know she's your maid?

306
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,680
Is there any problem?

307
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,690
I'm with her day and night, I know what she's like better than anyone.

308
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,920
As soon as I came to Chenji Mountain I said

309
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,880
I would skin whoever tried to disrobe her. I do what I say.

310
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,330
You admit your wrong?

311
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,850
Sect Leader, I failed my duty to protect Miss Zhiyan.

312
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,820
I know my wrongdoing; Sect Leader, please administer the punishment.

313
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,450
Go stand at the wall for a time;

314
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,160
leave matters of the Dark Guards to Ah Da for the moment.

315
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,140
Yes, Sir.

316
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,210
Why are you certain that Qin Zhiyan betrayed Wan Lu Sect?

317
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,540
You're hiding something from me.

318
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,050
Come, people! Lock Lin Ziyu in the dungeons!

319
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,780
You may as well join hands with me, to kill Li Chenlan.

320
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,670
I promise you that Qin Zhiyan

321
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,430
will be yours to deal with.

322
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,410
Sister Ziyu! Sister Ziyu!

323
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,670
Xiao An? Why are you here?

324
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,110
Ah Da led all the Dark Guards to Phoenix Mountain.

325
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,120
Phoenix Mountain?

326
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,840
- What about Sect Leader?
- Sect Leader went first.

327
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,970
He may already be there.

328
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,840
All right.

329
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,810
You go to Phoenix Mountain, too. Tell the brothers not to panic.

330
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,080
They must protect Sect Leader's safety.

331
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,650
I got it.

332
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,010
Lin Ziyu... Lin Ziyu...

333
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,540
It seems you're willing to spare no effort in your devotion to Li Chenlan.

334
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,400
As his faithful dog,

335
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,030
we can say you completely fulfill your duty.

336
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,140
Mingxuan?

337
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,690
Jin Xian, are we just running like cowards?

338
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,260
Lu Zhaoyao might even win all by herself.

339
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,250
Li Chenlan came around carrying Wanjun Sword.

340
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,750
If we fought with them no matter the consequences, at best we could win a thousand by losing 800.
(Idiom: means getting more harm than gain)

341
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,030
Only a fool like you would go looking for a fight.

342
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,440
Say that again!

343
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,260
You take care of those four. Leave Luo Mingxuan to me.

344
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,630
Those four are nothing to worry about. The others,

345
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,200
I'll face them along with you.

346
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,630
If you play like that, where does my glory as past sect leader end up?

347
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:27,540
It's just because they faced you and are now exhausted, that I can entrap them so easily.

348
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,870
You are good at setting the stage for me.

349
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:37,210
You've always been like this, doing everything gently, without a sound. And I didn't know.

350
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,130
That year, when I said I wanted to go look for him,

351
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,430
how you must have felt.

352
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,930
Luo Mingxuan, you've made me miss out on a lot!

353
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,070
Protect yourself.

354
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,330
Fold!

355
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,750
Fence-sitter!

356
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,870
- You all, leave, too!
- Revered Lady Changyu!

357
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,230
The Holy Phoenix appeared. If you stay, you'll only hinder Jin Xian.

358
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,300
Mingxuan and I can handle it. Go!

359
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,120
Let's go!

360
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,210
That old man, back then, died in the Phoenix's fire in your place.

361
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,870
Today, don't dream of escaping again.

362
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,180
Luo Mingxuan, today

363
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,570
you must die!

364
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,170
I'll chop the bird. You kill Luo Mingxuan!

365
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,410
Fine.

366
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,340
My time is running out.

367
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,640
Come, people! Come!

368
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,170
What's the noise?

369
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,800
Brother Cangling's breathing is very faint now! Hurry! Find someone to come and see him!

370
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,420
Let him die! Anyway, you're locked up.

371
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,740
Are you still hoping for someone to let you out?

372
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,450
What do you know?

373
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,460
This is Jianxin Sect's young Master, Liu Cangling.

374
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,510
And that is Jianxin Sect Leader, Liu Wei!

375
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,830
The Revered Lady of Changyu was only trying to revive Jin Xian,

376
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,750
that's why she temporarily forced them in here.

377
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,500
Why do you think Revered Lady of Changyu couldn't bear to execute them?

378
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,830
It's because she was considering their family bond!

379
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,990
If any accident happens to them,

380
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,840
when the storm has past you think you can face the responsibility?

381
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,070
Brother Cangling...

382
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,200
Miss Zhiyan!

383
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,510
It's good that you are fine. Where's the Sect Leader?

384
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,630
Sect Leader? I don't know.

385
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,790
How come you're all here?

386
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,220
- Let's go have a look.
- Yes.

387
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,430
