[The Legends]

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,970
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,760
Pavillion Leader Qin, you may as well donate a bit of blood

4
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,250
so as to protect the safety of our Immortal Sect.

5
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,760
Exactly!

6
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,660
For the lives of all of us in the Immortal Sect,

7
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,040
you, Pavillion Leader Qin, are just losing a tiny bit of blood.

8
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,170
It is a good deal.

9
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,110
I only fear Qin Qianxian is not willing to.

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,390
Why must you stir up the fire?

11
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,480
Everyone's simply expressing their opinion. Why are you so nervous?

12
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,570
I think this matter is not appropriate. To remove Jin Xian's seal with someone else's blood and flesh...

13
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,570
such arts intrinsically violate the world of nature, the Path of Virtue.

14
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,500
Revered Lady Changyu, they can't be used.

15
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,750
To achieve great results, we can't quibble over trifles.

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,920
Nobody really wants to harm Pavilion Leader Qin.

17
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,170
Does using a little bit of his blood really call for such public accusations?

18
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,910
In the past, Li Chenlan slaughtered the whole Southern Moon Order of our Immortal Sect.

19
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,660
Now, again, he's destroyed the Demon-Shield Ward.

20
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,240
He's truly exceeding in arrogance.

21
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,010
When the day comes that Wan Lu Sect openly kills us all, the blood flowing

22
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,690
will not just be that of Pavilion Leader Qin.

23
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,220
Why are you wasting words with a woman?

24
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,940
How can you listen to female opinions?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,890
I, too, find it improper.

26
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,970
What is improper?

27
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,400
The Revered Lady of Changyu wants my blood to remove Jin Xian's seal.

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,680
The true goal is nothing but my family blood.

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,070
Did my younger brother Qin Yu also meet his death because of the Qin family blood?

30
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm still investigating it.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,300
If I hastily donated blood, I would bear fault with the departed.

32
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,410
This is the first impropriety.

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,060
Li Chenlan's destruction of the Demon-Shield Ward was a sudden event.

34
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,940
Whether it really is as the Revered Lady said, that he blew his temper over a beauty,

35
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,280
we still need to wait until Jianxin Sect Leader Liu Wei wakes

36
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,550
before we can draw our conclusion.

37
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,740
This is the second impropriety.

38
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,720
Employing a blood sacrifice to remove Jin Xian's seal

39
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,080
is an act against Heaven. It violates the Immortal Sect's Principles of Righteousness.

40
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,980
This is the third impropriety. I, Qianxian, understand

41
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,620
that the Revered Lady of Changyu treasures Jin Xian

42
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,810
and the heart of the Immortal Sect.

43
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,330
But such an act is still too reckless.

44
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:28,540
All said and done, Pavilion Leader Qin, you still don't believe me.

45
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,340
Qin Yu's death was a mystery.

46
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,770
That day, when Qin Zhiyan slandered my brother,

47
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,610
he also personally paid a visit

48
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,460
to explain himself and clear suspicions.

49
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,150
Pavilion Leader Qin, have you already forgotten?

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,870
During the city assault on Jinzhou,

51
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,870
the affection between Li Chenlan and Qin Zhiyan was visible to the world.

52
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,030
But my brother hasn't woken yet.

53
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,620
I'm more sad than anyone.

54
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,590
Pavilion Leader Qin, you say that I'm harboring some malicious intent.

55
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,180
Your accusation is extremely unfair to me!

56
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,390
Back then, Jin Xian was sealed by Lu Zhaoyao with blood.

57
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,080
Now removing the seal can only be by blood.

58
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,160
In the end, all of this was Lu Zhaoyao's fault.

59
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,070
Pavillion Leader Qin, you've been far from human affairs for a long time.

60
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,800
I fear you may have long since forgotten your status as a member of the Immortal Sect.

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,960
If the Immortal Zidan knew how Lord Qin, who used to be famous all over the world,

62
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,780
now prefers to call himself out,

63
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,160
would he regret choosing the wrong person back then?

64
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,260
People, when Lu Zhaoyao came down from the mountain back then

65
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,470
and snatched the Demon King's son from the Immortal Sect's grasp,

66
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,410
she alone opposed all the sects,

67
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,370
with such strength

68
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,060
that I suppose everyone here remembers the experience.

69
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,000
Back then, who could have subdued her if not Jin Xian?

70
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,370
But at present, Jin Xian is impeded. Each of our Immortal Sects is kept quiet by fear.

71
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,530
Where is the Principle?

72
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,340
If our Immortal Sects don't rally together, and instead even doubt each other,

73
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,800
we'll miss the most appropriate time to awaken Jin Xian!

74
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,590
Wait for the day when Wan Lu Sect will tyrannize Jianghu.

75
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,980
Where will our dignity be, then?

76
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,260
Allow me to ask all present: who, here,

77
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,650
is willing to lie prone to the rank rebels of Jianghu?

78
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,370
To let them rule your life?

79
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,820
Qin Qianxian, today you have to leave your blood,

80
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,190
whether you are willing or not.

81
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,680
Father, wait for me. I won't let your death remain obscure.

82
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,180
I won't let the people who killed you keep harming others.

83
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,190
I... I learned it!

84
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,770
I learned it!

85
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,730
Demoness, I learned it!

86
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,590
I learned it! Thank you!

87
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,990
But, Demoness, you promised you'd take me there. You can't deceive me.

88
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,090
Go to the room and get the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

89
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,770
Yes!

90
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,180
Have you thought well about it? Going now, we may not have a return.

91
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,330
There are some things that I must do.

92
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,250
[Wan Lu Sect]

93
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,360
Tomorrow's Luo Mingxuan's great wedding. I'm going to kill him.

94
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm well aware that the result here is uncertain.

95
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,630
But there are always matters with uncertain results

96
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,290
that are worth a desperate fight.

97
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,060
You have lost your weapon, now; you have no way out.

98
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,810
If you kneel and beg for mercy, maybe I'll be lenient for a moment

99
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,550
and let you keep your life.

100
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,960
You want me to beg?

101
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,990
No way!

102
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,120
You want to avoid death. No way!

103
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,530
Fine.

104
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,970
[Cleanse Dust Palace]

105
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,480
Please, Pavilion Leader Qin, put the greater picture ahead of all.

106
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,030
For sure, we should put the greater picture ahead of all.

107
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,390
Enough with this womanish fussiness! We only said we want a bit of your blood.

108
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,420
Nobody said we wanted your life!

109
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,800
Pavilion Leader Qin, please!

110
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,120
Uncle!

111
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,290
Zhiyan?

112
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,930
Zhiyan, why are you here?

113
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,890
Brother Cangling?

114
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,530
I hear that Li Chenlan smashed the Demon-Shield Ward

115
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,830
blowing his temper over a beauty.

116
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,200
Since Miss Qin is now a member of the Wan Lu Sect,

117
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,930
please leave presently.

118
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,210
Zhiyan is Qin Yu's daughter, the First Young Lady in the Immortal Sect.

119
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,070
What's inappropriate about it?

120
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,730
Zhiyan, since you came here today, do you have something to say?

121
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,430
I came

122
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,540
to expose her true colors!

123
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,920
It's you who personally poured my father's warm blood

124
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,840
in Luo Mingxuan's golden casket in the secret chamber in Jianxin Sect.

125
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,560
My father's warm blood was an offering to Luo Mingxuan.

126
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,180
You have a scorpion's heart!

127
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,040
You didn't just kill my father. You used the Manipulation Technique to control Uncle Liu.

128
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,940
Now, you're also controlling Brother Cangling.

129
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,130
You'll do such a thing even to your kin!

130
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,900
And now, again, you want to force my uncle to give his blood?

131
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,210
The little girl's enunciation has grown a lot fiercer.

132
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,940
Empty accusations based on words. What evidence do you have to prove that what you say is true?

133
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,260
I saw it with my own eyes. How could that be fake?

134
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,100
How do you know that Qin Yu didn't make a voluntary sacrifice?

135
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,460
The Manipulation Technique has been long lost.

136
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:20,050
How can you prove that I'm the one who manipulated my brother and Cangling?

137
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,420
I...

138
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,190
Witless little girl. You dare blabber nonsense at the Grand Meeting of the Immortal Sect.

139
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,600
This is clearly a set-up.

140
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,200
In Wan Lu Sect, you were taken by Li Chenlan under his wing.

141
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,850
To serve him completely, you destroyed Jianxin Sect.

142
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,340
You are still not satisfied. You also want our Immortal Sect to disintegrate?

143
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,900
- All I said is true!
- Ridiculous!

144
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,050
Among all assembled here, who believes her?

145
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,160
I believe her.

146
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,080
Uncle.

147
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,990
If Zhiyan really meant to frame someone,

148
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,650
why should she come forward alone with her explanation and make herself a public target?

149
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,850
What nonsense is this? Just attack!

150
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,620
I heard that all of you in here were discussing how to go bother our Sect Leader.

151
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,550
Must be some farts who are tired of living!

152
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,670
W-Wh-Who's this?

153
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,760
East Hill Master, Lu Seventeen.

154
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,290
I raised her. Isn't she cute?

155
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,710
She's cute, she's cute.

156
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,230
Bring it on! Who else?

157
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,880
Your East Hill Master is amazing! How come she doesn't even dodge magic attacks?

158
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,810
In these years I was gone, it seems Li Chenlan didn't look for trouble with the Immortal Sect.

159
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,750
It made them forget. These arts

160
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,330
are all useless with Seventeen.

161
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,910
- Why?
- Seventeen's constitution is like that.

162
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,110
She can't learn magic, but magic can't hurt her, either.

163
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,930
So when she fights, it's all fists on flesh.

164
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,640
There is such a constitution?

165
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,960
Lu Seventeen, this is our Immortal Sect's Grand Meeting. How can we tolerate your impudence?

166
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,270
Who cares if you tolerate it? You dare bother my sect leader? Out of the question!

167
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,970
Little girl, curb your arrogance!

168
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,810
Manipulation Technique!

169
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,090
Liu Suruo, you wretch! Stop controlling Brother Cangling!

170
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,460
- Mind that her Ci Xiong Sword doesn't draw your blood!
- I...

171
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,520
Shen Qianjin, you want to turn against the Immortal Sect?

172
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,550
I don't wish at all to turn against the Immortal Sect, but how can such a situation happen in our sect's Halls of Justice?

173
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,970
The Manipulation Technique is witchcraft. The Revered Lady of Changyu should never use it.

174
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,520
If we want to revive Jin Xian, how can we not make sacrifices?

175
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,500
People, reviving Jin Xian today is imperative.

176
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,980
Today, we must get Qin Qianxian's fresh blood.

177
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,670
Preposterous!

178
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,280
Tell Lu Seventeen that I said that I want her to protect Qin Qianxian.

179
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,940
Seventeen! Lu Zhaoyao wants you to protect Qin Qianxian!

180
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,730
What did you say?

181
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,980
Lu Zhaoyao?

182
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,590
Who did Sect Leader say to save?

183
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,190
Qin Qianxian, the tall one, the most beautiful there.

184
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,100
Sect Leader says "save," I save.

185
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,480
You stand back. I'll protect you.

186
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,660
No, no! No!

187
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,530
Your Sect Leader says you can't kill that one!

188
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,960
If you pass false orders, I'll punch your head!

189
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,660
Sect Leader's demands are more and more.

190
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,670
But I still like her!

191
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,510
Tell Seventeen to take Qin Qianxian away first.

192
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,020
Seventeen, quick, take Qin Qianxian away.

193
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,490
Fine.

194
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,850
Brother Cangling!

195
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
Blood.

196
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,640
Who dares touch him?

197
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,560
M-M-My Uncle! She actually molested him!

198
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,760
It's normal. Since she was a child, she's never had a notion of the difference between men and women.

199
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,460
While I educated her, I forgot about that.

200
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,450
What are you standing there for? Hurry up and make Seventeen bring him back to Wan Lu Sect.

201
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,540
Seventeen, quickly, take him back to Wan Lu Sect!

202
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,940
Fine.

203
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,180
Th... They're just gone like that?

204
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,280
- Then, what about us?
- You leave as soon as possible, too.

205
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,050
Don't let that old woman get a chance.

206
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,210
Capture her!

207
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,460
- Go!
- All right.

208
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,700
I... I'm frightened, it doesn't work.

209
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,510
What are you saying?

210
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,280
I...I'm in a panic, I can't use it.

211
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,650
Where would you like to run?

212
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,580
Say you came prepared.

213
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,830
Stop there! Do you think I'd come here totally unprepared?

214
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,160
If you take one step forward... I'll just...

215
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,410
I'll just turn Luo Mingxuan's body to ashes.

216
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,250
I'll just turn Luo Mingxuan's body to ashes!

217
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,510
How could Jin Xian's Golden Body be threatened by a little girl like you?

218
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,330
Today, without Qin Qianxian, we'll just take you to the altar!

219
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,930
Stop!

220
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,480
Before Jin Xian's body could not be destroyed because...

221
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,980
Because there was no Wanjun Sword...
- ...because there was no Wanjun Sword!

222
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,190
Wanjun Sword... Wanjun Sword can smash the Demon-Shield Ward...

223
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,690
It... It can also destroy Jin Xian's body!

224
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,760
Don't you believe it? If you dare hurt me today,

225
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,300
the next second I'll just make Jin Xian's body turn to ashes!

226
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,570
I still just don't believe it. If you had such a skill, why would you threatenus?

227
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,710
You could just go.

228
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,800
Say, why doesn't he get struck by lightning?

229
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,540
Please, hold. People,

230
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,630
when did our Immortal Sect stoop so low as to gang up on one orphaned girl?

231
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,270
Sect Leader Shen, today you've been repeatedly holding us back.

232
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,240
Could it be that you are already collaborating with Wan Lu Sect from the inside?

233
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,950
You have already abandoned the Great Path?

234
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,430
As I see it today, I'm afraid it's you all, who, for the sake of immediate advantages,

235
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,880
have forsaken the Great Way.

236
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,180
What's this nonsense? Just kill Qin Zhiyan!

237
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,840
Sect Leader Shen! Sect Leader Shen!

238
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,200
Are you all right, Sect Leader Shen?

239
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,910
Calm down. Don't panic. Try the Teleportation again.

240
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,520
Yesterday, I drank this medicine.

241
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,420
I slept very deeply. I didn't even feel your needles.

242
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,880
What did you put in this medicine?

243
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,160
I added a substance to make you sleep.

244
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,500
Take it away. I can't drink it now.

245
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,790
Ah Da!

246
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,740
- Sect Leader.
- Where's Qin Zhiyan?

247
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,020
This morning, Miss Zhiyan learned to use the Teleportation Technique.

248
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,520
She's now teleported off. I...

249
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,830
Why did you not report to me?

250
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,800
Because now, Sect Leader, you...

251
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,620
I ordered you to tell me immediately every movement by Qin Zhiyan.

252
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,840
Today, you've neglected your duty.

253
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,730
When this matter is over, go directly to the Disciplinary Hall and submit to your punishment.

254
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,160
Yes.

255
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,150
What are you doing?

256
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,100
She's in danger. I have to go save her.

257
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,610
Sect Leader!

258
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,160
The hero rescuing the beauty. Just use Teleportation!

259
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,090
I see, no matter how I treat you, it's all for naught.

260
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,230
You wish to die.

261
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,900
Why drink this medicine?

262
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,590
Master, calm your anger.

263
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,510
This medicine is not easy to make. The ingredients are rare and they come for a high price.

264
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,800
The brewing method is especially bothersome.

265
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,550
It needs three people's working half a day.

266
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,790
I'm not drinking it!

267
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,370
Ah Da, send someone quickly to inform West Hill Master:

268
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,590
Let them go to Phoenix Mountain as reinforcement.

269
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,130
Yes, sir.

270
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,610
Think of your father. Back then he sent you off.

271
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,460
It sure wasn't to let you die here!

272
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,970
Hurry!

273
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,100
If you keep hesitating none of us can escape. Then there will really be nobody left to save him!

274
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,360
- Father!
- Don't come here!

275
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,700
Xiao An,

276
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,280
what time is it?

277
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,160
It's midday already.

278
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,400
Where's Qin Qianxian?

279
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,590
Qin Qianxian just ran.

280
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,700
He ran? Then why didn't you wake me up?

281
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,840
I called you! Look!

282
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,030
This morning I called you, you wouldn't get up. You even said if I kept nagging, you'd beat me to a pulp.

283
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,930
Even if the sky fell down, it wouldn't have disturbed your sleep.

284
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,490
I want to beat you to a pulp right now!

285
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,720
You want to run? Dream on!

286
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,390
Hold him still for me! I'll pour this medicine down his throat if I have to.

287
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,520
In this lifetime, I've only met two patients who dared not listen to me.

288
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,330
One was Lu Zhaoyao. She's dead. Now there is you.

289
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,880
Just go to King Yama for reincarnation!

290
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,330
South Hill Master, what do you want to do?

291
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,750
- I'll knock him out and feed him his medicine!
- That can't be!

292
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,120
Sect Leader, just drink the medicine...

293
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,910
Li Chenlan, if you don't drink this medicine today,

294
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,290
don't hope to go out that door.

295
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,780
Li Chenlan!

296
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,330
South Hill Master, the Sect Leader drank it. Calm yourself.

297
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,600
How did I end up in the wrong place?

298
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,660
L-L-Leader Li.

299
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,400
You... aren't hurt?

300
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,330
N-N-N-No.

301
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,420
This is the Sect Leader Shen from the Rain View House.

302
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,240
- Look at his attitude! He dares pull a face on me!
- South Hill Master...

303
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
- From now on there will be no more medicines for him.
- South Hill Leader...

304
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,460
- Let him die!
- No, South Hill Master...

305
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,470
Qianjin!

306
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,020
Qianjin!

307
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,870
S-So... I'll go to Cleanse Dust Palace for now.

308
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,660
One can teach Teleportation even this way...

309
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,280
You seem quite comfortable on top of that girl.

310
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,230
- Hill Master Lu.
- What is it?

311
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,010
Can you put me down?

312
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,480
I can't. Sect Leader told me to bring you to Wan Lu Sect.

313
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,510
And I'm not putting you down until I do.

314
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:08,290
I'm the Thousand Dust Pavilion Leader. You can take me there.

315
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,640
No way! What you say doesn't count. I only listen to my sect leader!

316
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,440
But you are going in the wrong direction.

317
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,930
Leader Qin, how does it feel to be carried by a woman?

318
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,670
Red hair, who are you?

319
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,330
And who are you?

320
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:45,210
I'm Wan Lu Sect's East Hill Master. My name is Lu Xuzhi, courtesy name Lu Seventeen. And you?

321
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm your future Wan Lu Sect's leader, Jiang Wu.

322
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,410
Pff.

323
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,640
Wan Lu Sect only has one leader: Lu Zhaoyao.

324
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,180
If you want to be our leader, you have come through me.

325
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,450
Hold on, hold on. I rather admire Lu Zhaoyao.

326
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm not here to pick a fight with you. I'm here for him.

327
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,680
You can't pick on him, either.

328
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,370
Sect Leader ordered me to take him to Wan Lu Sect and I must do it.

329
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,260
Nobody can touch him.

330
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,330
She's stubborn.

331
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:20,090
Leader Qin, how does it feel to hide behind a girl?

332
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,580
You think that neck wound is only for blood?

333
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,930
You must die today.

334
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,710
You're interesting, little girl.

335
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,730
You think you can escape from my grasp?

336
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,390
Revered Lady, this defeat was not due to lack of preparation.

337
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,680
It was because Wan Lu Sect had an inkling and sent people to create chaos.

338
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,550
If we can think of another way, we'll succeed.

339
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,720
Say, Beautiful One, who was that red hair? He has some skills.

340
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,150
He is...

341
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,930
What did you say? I didn't catch that.

342
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,590
He is coming. Go to the Sushan Maze.

343
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,340
Where is the Sushan Maze?

344
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,690
Run straight ahead, into that copse of trees.

345
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,700
All right!

346
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,350
Where is this place?

347
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,800
Please put me down.

348
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,290
All right.

349
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,800
You're quite impressive.

350
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,320
Let's go.

351
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,490
[Mighty Rectitude]

352
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,670
Our plan this time was still too rushed.

353
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,970
I overestimated Thousand Dust Pavilion's sincerity towards Immortal Sect.

354
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,840
All of you Sect Leaders have your concerns. I can understand.

355
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,190
Even if I only have my own strength, I must revive Jin Xian.

356
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,580
Everyone, I'm aware

357
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,530
that my method is a little brutal.

358
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,720
But if it can awaken Jin Xian and restore the Immortal Sect,

359
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,850
I'm willing to accept any blame for it.

360
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,090
Everyone...

361
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:15,290
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

362
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:21,220
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

363
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,750
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

364
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,790

00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:36,080
♫ The wind's rising; Nirvana comes from arrogant pride ♫

366
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:43,840

367
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:51,020
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

368
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:58,780

369
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:11,220
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

370
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:30,370
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

371
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:36,100
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

377
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:13,660

♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

380
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:36,090
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

381
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:43,720
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:54,440
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
