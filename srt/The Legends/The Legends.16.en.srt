[The Legends]

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,140
As expected...

4
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,960
Brother.

5
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,800
Suruo, you promised me

6
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,860
you would never touch that evil Manipulation Technique again.

7
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,390
You...

8
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,740
Brother, this is for Mingxuan.

9
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,170
It was so difficult for me to find a way to make him wake up.

10
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,300
I've already waited for too many years.

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,540
I can't wait anymore.

12
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,400
I just want him to wake up, really.

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Yet you still shouldn't commit such a wrong deed.

14
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,350
Was Qin Yu's life—

15
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,930
Brother,

16
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,560
I know you're a very upright person,

17
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,060
but I...

18
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,910
I have no other choice.

19
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,190
As long as Mingxuan wakes up...

20
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,080
if he just wakes up,

21
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,380
all of this will be over.

22
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,130
This courtyard is actually quite pretty.

23
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,460
Who are you?

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,590
You? The wall-climbing thief.

25
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,760
Oh, it's you.

26
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,110
Who are you? You keep coming here. What is your motive?

27
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,320
- Don't misunderstand, I-
- No matter who you are and what you want,

28
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,350
I won't allow you to hurt Ah Rong.

29
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,260
Why is your hand so cold?

30
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,820
An ear made of wood? Could it be that she's not a living person?

31
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,220
What do you want to do?

32
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,250
Considering you're Sima Rong's person, I won't bully you.

33
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,300
Do you know who I am? It'll scare you to death.

34
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,820
I'm the world-renowned Demoness--

35
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,170
Qin Qianxian rarely concerns himself with worldly affairs.

36
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,530
I can't believe he's so persistent regarding Jiang Wu.

37
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,960
I did not expect it either.

38
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,360
Speaking of that, is there any news regarding Jiang Wu?

39
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,220
The bait is already out,

40
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,390
but still no news.

41
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,730
It seems Jiang Wu is not only arrogant but also cunning.

42
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,820
I—

43
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,210
How did I get here?

44
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,130
Oh right! This is the exit I used before.

45
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,210
Wall-climbing thief, where are you?

46
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,960
Aren't we fighting anymore?

47
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,250
Wall-climbing thief, come out!

48
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,450
Now I believe the one who came is Lu Zhaoyao.

49
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,790
Chenlan, later,

50
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,590
I want to speak to Zhaoyao about some things.

51
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,340
I guess you have a lot of things to tell her.

52
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,060
Wall-climbing thief, where are you?

53
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,080
Are we not fighting anymore?

54
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,020
Ah Rong, wall-climbing thief ran into the tree.

55
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,360
What are you blathering about?

56
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,700
Master, I was admiring the flower in the courtyard with Little Round Face,

57
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,400
I didn't expect the crab-apples were so beautiful here.

58
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,160
So you all know each other.

59
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,500
Of course, we know each other! I was talking just now and you attacked me. How rude.

60
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm your Ah Rong's guest. What if you offend a guest?

61
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,900
Yuezhu has a quick temper. I hope Miss Zhiyan won't mind.

62
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,630
How about you come with me and have a look

63
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,890
at the materials to make the sword scabbard?

64
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,460
Fine, I won't fuss about it.

65
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,310
Yuezhu, prepare a cup of tea for Chenlan.

66
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,760
Sect Leader Li, this way, please.

67
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,610
Please enjoy, sir.

68
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,860
Did you hear?

69
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,720
Yesterday, Wan Lu Sect Leader, Li Chenlan

70
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,780
came to Jiangzhou City with his disciple.

71
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,130
Li Chenlan? Impossible!

72
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,020
If he came to Jiangzhou, that would be known for ten miles.

73
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,630
What do you understand? That's Li Chenlan.

74
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,490
People of that sort will just use Instant Travel and come and go at will.

75
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,460
How could they have the kind of hassle we deal with?

76
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,610
Also, I heard that yesterday, on the streets,

77
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,830
someone saw the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

78
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,300
Li Chenlan actually did get Heaven's Sword for his pupil?

79
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,160
Right? He definitely spoils that girl from the Immortal Sect.

80
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,830
Then, what are they doing here in Jiangzhou City?

81
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,160
That I don't know.

82
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,210
Pity we couldn't see that Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

83
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,860
The ancient Sword of Heaven; can't even tell how formidable it is.

84
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,360
If you're interested,

85
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,760
go explore the South Zhang Street, third alley.

86
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,860
I heard that's where they're staying.

87
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,540
If you're lucky, maybe you'll bump into them.

88
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,600
Here, let's drink.

89
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,930
So tired...

90
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,190
Where did Li Chenlan take the Demoness?

91
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,600
There are so many people. Where do I look?

92
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,370
So many? Which one is the most expensive and the best?

93
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,490
Miss, you certainly aren't shy.

94
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,670
Mr. Sima has such a close relationship with my master.

95
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,660
If I'm too courteous with you, then wouldn't I be acting like an outsider?

96
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,660
There's no cheap wood here.

97
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,720
But in terms of compatibility,

98
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,130
this block of Jade Dragon bloodwood, for Liuhe Tianyi Sword,

99
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,350
is a perfect match.

100
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Looks pretty good.

101
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,210
All right, this one then.

102
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,550
I heard Lady Ziyan can communicate with the late Sect Leader through dreams.

103
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,180
Previously, I accidentally banged my head at Zhaoyao's grave,

104
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,690
and then she appeared in my dream to ask me to do good deeds for her. I guess we're associated this way.

105
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,330
Oh?

106
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:34,150
If that really is the case, I have a favor to trouble you with, Miss.

107
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,530
What is it?

108
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,640
If you ever see the past sect leader,

109
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,080
please apologize for me.

110
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,440
If I had a pair of good legs right now, I would kneel down and apologize.

111
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,940
Why do you want to apologize to her?

112
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,070
That year in the battle of the Sword Tomb, Immortal Sect set up an ambush.

113
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,530
If it weren't for my misleading information,

114
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,710
the previous leader would not have lost her life.

115
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,470
Jianghu is a dangerous place, especially for wanderers like us.

116
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,820
Every day goes by at blade point.

117
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,740
On this road, there isn't an honor that doesn't require the fight of our lives.

118
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,060
Lu Zhaoyao was a world-renowned Demoness.

119
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
Pretty and also smart.

120
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,850
She must understand this reasoning.

121
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,680
If the things you said were ten points, eight to nine of them were compliments...

122
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,610
compliments to her. Zhaoyao must like you a lot.

123
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,360
But I wasn't complimenting her. Lu Zhaoyao was a reasonable person to begin with.

124
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,610
If she fell into an ambush and lost her life, it was her mishandling.

125
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,210
It's not your fault, so don't feel too guilty.

126
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,820
But I'll give your apology to her.

127
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,500
Though I know that the Sect Leader was never one to fuss over details,

128
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,880
in this world, people with such an open mind like hers are rare.

129
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,370
It's only that, in this life,

130
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm afraid I won't ever be able to forgive myself.

131
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,040
What actually happened to Sima Rong?

132
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Come back in five days to retrieve it.

133
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,690
Thank you, West Hill Master.

134
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,870
Sect Leader,

135
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,790
considering the unique flavor of Jiangzhou's night snacks, it would be a pity if Miss Zhiyan didn't try them.

136
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,600
It is inconvenient with my legs,

137
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,910
so I'll ask Chenlan to show you around on my behalf.

138
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,650
Everyone, come taste some!

139
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,230
Tasty skewers! Everyone come and have a taste!

140
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,290
Come taste some! Skewers!

141
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,130
Put some more, here.

142
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,280
Eat well!

143
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,190
Want to eat more?

144
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,510
- I want ten more!
- Yes, of course!

145
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,560
Master, are you not going to have any? They're pretty tasty!

146
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,290
It's pretty tasty watching you eat.

147
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,890
Master, you aren't shy, are you?

148
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,600
Master, I think I ate a bit too much.

149
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,590
I'm going to leave for a bit. Wait for me, okay?

150
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,250
In this sea of people, how do I find that Demoness?

151
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,950
You can't even stand straight and you want to practice martial arts for your vengeance?

152
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,440
Demoness! I feel more at ease now that I found you!

153
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,130
How come you got into that fight with Li Chenlan the other day? Your duel at dusk was really—

154
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,370
Li Chenlan's right there! Go hide!

155
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,120
Okay.

156
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,100
If I leave with Li Chenlan in a bit, Zhiyan can't do Instant Travel.

157
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,630
If Li Chenglan can't find me in the morning, I'm done for.

158
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,460
Seems like we can't leave Jiangzhou City tonight.

159
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,850
Are you okay?

160
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,800
Master, it's so rare for me to be at Jiangzhou City.

161
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,550
It's a shame if I don't get to look around.

162
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,870
Why don't you, Master, go back to Chenji Mountain first?

163
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,480
I'll stay here for a few days. How about that?

164
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,850
This place... it might not be safe.

165
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,690
No way, no way. If West Hill Leader is here, who dares to bully me?

166
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,650
Moreover, I won't stay here for too long.

167
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,830
Besides, Master can use the Art of Instant Travel. When you are free you can come and see me.

168
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,000
- Fine, but I have a condition.
- What?

169
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,250
Don't put yourself in any dangerous situation.

170
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,280
Okay.

171
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,870
- He's gone!
- Qin Zhiyan, you were sent by God to punish me, weren't you?

172
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,250
Why are you in Jiangzhou?

173
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,090
At dusk you fought with Li Chenlan all boom boom... I was worried about you.

174
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,870
Do I need you to be so worried?

175
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,630
Fine, let's find an inn to stay tonight.

176
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,750
Tomorrow, we're returning to Sima Rong's place.

177
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,890
Mingxuan, today's our wedding anniversary.

178
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,000
Unfortunately, we weren't able to complete our wedding.

179
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:19,280
For all these years, I've been waiting for the day we could be together forever.

180
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,210
Jianxin Sect's eldest daughter and Jin Xian are definitely a good match.

181
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,340
Once these two marry, they'll certainly strengthen our Immortal Sect.

182
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,620
A loving husband and a doting wife. A match made in Heaven.

183
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,050
The greatest celebration of our Immortal Sect,

184
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,250
this match made in Heaven, is officially completed!

185
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,540
Bride and groom, please exchange tokens of love.

186
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,330
Sect Leader, did Sect Leader Liu tell you any clues?

187
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,890
I waited all night in front of the Sushan Maze.

188
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,790
I never saw Sect Leader Liu.

189
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,960
I didn't find any trace of Sect Leader Liu inside Sushan maze, either.

190
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,350
Sect Leader Liu didn't come?

191
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,300
I hope it was he himself who didn't come.

192
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,150
Recently, I was looking for Jiang Wu's whereabouts.

193
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,450
I discovered a streak of force entrenched at Fengmo Mountain.

194
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,080
My opinion is that Jiang Wu's self-named "New Mountain" is just Fengmo Mountain.

195
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,160
Send people to investigate the issue in secret.

196
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,740
Yes.

197
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,640
There is something I don't understand.

198
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,260
Why is Pavilion Master so merciful to everyone but so persistent only with Jiang Wu?

199
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,130
He is the result of my momentary mistake.

200
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,760
Sect Leader, Miss Zhiyan did not return to West Hill Master's residence that night.

201
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,370
She spent the night at an inn.

202
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,380
Send more people to protect her covertly.

203
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,820
Yes.

204
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,750
Great!

205
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,930
Good! That's great!

206
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm so tired! Demoness, why are we out so early in the morning.

207
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,380
You're so useless. Once Li Chenlan finds out I wasn't at Sima Rong's place,

208
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,180
are you going to explain to him?

209
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,700
Oh right, do you know who Sima Rong is? Don't mess it up later.

210
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,950
Sima Rong? I know. Wan Lu Sect's West Hill Master.

211
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,070
He has eyes all over the world. He knows everything although he never leaves his house.

212
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,250
Then, do you know how his legs were broken?

213
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,830
How they were broken? I think I've heard about it.

214
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,080
Oh, that's right!

215
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,840
His legs were hurt in a set up by our Immortal Sects' South Moon Order.

216
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,190
As to how he was tricked and ambushed, I don't know.

217
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,810
Which year was this?

218
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:26,580
Which year? I can't remember.

219
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,710
Around the time after your Sword Tomb battle, you disappeared, Li Chenlan rose into the position.

220
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,580
Back then this matter went around all of Jianghu; it was the talk everywhere.

221
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,740
People only started talking about other things after a very long time.

222
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,640
Right after that, Sima Rong broke his legs.

223
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,410
Li Chenlan knew that the South Moon Order crippled Sima Rong; didn't he do anything?

224
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,930
He did! Previously in Jianghu,

225
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,500
there were ten big Immortal Sects, now it's just nine.

226
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,040
- Nine?
- Yes.

227
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,080
The South Moon Order was wiped out by him. At that time, our Immortal Sects went sick with sorrow.

228
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,930
[Jianxin Sect]

229
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,960
Uncle, don't be anxious.

230
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,980
The news hasn't been confirmed yet.

231
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,560
Deacon Chi, stop walking around.

232
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,380
You keep walking and I'll get dizzy.

233
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,250
Sect Leaders!

234
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,700
Was the previous news true?

235
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,590
The news has been confirmed. Wan Lu Sect's new leader, Li Chenlan

236
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,810
really declared war on the South Moon Order.

237
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,460
He said those who don't leave South Moon Order in three months

238
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,140
will be killed.

239
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,820
Those who don't leave South Moon Order will be killed?

240
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,340
Is this Li Chenlan planning to wipe out South Moon Order?

241
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,220
He just knows no law. He thinks we don't have anyone capable in the Immortal Sects?

242
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,350
We certainly don't.

243
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,470
In the Sword Tomb Battle, all the major sects suffered heavy casualties.

244
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,650
At such a juncture, we have no more spare energy left to confront the Wan Lu Sect again.

245
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,540
Jin Xiu, how can you exalt other people's ambition,

246
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,830
taking down your own pride? If our Immortal Sects suffered heavy casualties,

247
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,850
that Wan Lu Sect is no better!

248
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,730
Since Lu Zhaoyao is dead, regardless of whether the four Hills Masters will support the new leader,

249
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,690
the underlings must be in turmoil. I just don't believe

250
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,590
that the Wan Lu Sect in three months will have such ability.

251
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,940
Father, should we send our people to assist South Moon Order?

252
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,070
Assist what? In the Sword Tomb Battle,

253
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,400
your Jianxin Sect suffered the greatest loss in casualties.

254
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,300
You still have time to heed others' business?

255
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,280
Not to mention,

256
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,270
Deacon Chi's words, though pompous,

257
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,400
do hold some sense.

258
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,300
I heard that Li Chenlan used to be nothing more than a little gatekeeper in Wan Lu Sect.

259
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,730
If he could ascend to Sect Leader now,

260
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,460
it was but by seizing Lu Zhaoyao's one moment of weakness.

261
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,620
The South Moon Order isn't even worried, and we are fretting instead?

262
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,850
Don't forget,

263
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,750
Lu Zhaoyao is already dead.

264
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,940
Whether Wan Lu Sect will still be around in three months

265
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,550
is a different story.

266
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,910
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving first.

267
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,860
Yo, what is this little girl doing here?

268
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,300
Didn't you see these two ugly old men pulling long faces in here?

269
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,630
Careful, lest they scare you.

270
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,490
Uncle Liu, I'm here to find Brother Cangling.

271
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,530
Father.

272
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,660
You can go.

273
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,160
Yes.

274
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,420
Zhiyan!

275
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,150
Let's go.

276
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,650
Ever since Jin Xian passed away, our ties in the Immortal Sects

277
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,410
have been growing thinner and thinner.

278
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,810
I wonder what will be of this new generation.

279
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,690
That's right, Sect Leader Liu. How are the injuries of the Revered One?

280
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,320
Her injuries are quite severe.

281
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,590
She needs to rest a bit more.

282
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,040
Brother Cangling, did something happen?

283
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,860
Why is it that Uncle Liu's countenance just now

284
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,620
looked like he'd just met a thorny matter?

285
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,520
Wan Lu Sect's Demoness, Lu Zhaoyao, just died;

286
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,170
and the Demon King's son, Li Chenlan, emerged.

287
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,850
He sent an open war letter, saying that within three months

288
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,650
he'll make a bloodbath of the South Moon Order.

289
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,800
Why would he make a bloodbath of the South Moon Order?

290
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,140
South Moon Order's reputation in Jianghu is excellent,

291
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,810
and it counts as a pillar of our Immortal Sects.

292
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,480
Why is Li Chenlan doing this?

293
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,490
Li Chenlan is targeting South Moon Order,

294
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,130
I heard it's because of Wan Lu Sect's West Hill Master, Sima Rong.

295
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,760
He was set up by the South Moon Order and lost both legs.

296
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,950
Sima Rong?

297
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,920
But if Li Chenlan wants to make a bloodbath of the South Moon Order just to avenge him

298
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,030
that... that's too presumptuous!

299
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,920
Then... will he succeed?

300
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,860
No way! South Moon Order's Elder Dugu is so powerful,

301
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,930
she won't let Li Chenlan succeed.

302
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,420
So don't worry.

303
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,250
You know, Brother Cangling was not the only one who thought that.

304
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,780
No one in Jianghu expected

305
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,930
that in three months, Li Chenlan could really wipe out South Moon Order.

306
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,220
Demoness, what are you thinking about?

307
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,310
I was thinking, if it was up to me to do it,

308
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,870
I would have just taken my men and killed my way through. If it went well, I'd come out and show off.

309
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,190
If it went wrong, I'd just stuff it in. Anyway I would just have told everyone

310
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,240
that our Wan Lu Sect doesn't take that kind of beating. That's it.

311
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,320
I never thought Little Monster's style would be so high-profile and upstanding.

312
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,040
And he even told them in advance that he was going to trash them, and he also succeeded.

313
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,790
That's very impressive.

314
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,760
You Immortal Sects people call each other brothers.

315
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,950
At such a time of life or death, how come nobody showed up to lend a hand?

316
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,120
After the Sword Tomb Battle, everybody needed to treat their own wounds.

317
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,890
Who can recover that quickly?

318
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,480
Our Wan Lu Sect recovered that quickly.

319
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,860
Li Chenlan went by himself to do it!

320
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,520
He didn't take any Wan Lu Sect disciples.

321
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,640
By himself?!

322
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,320
[South Moon Order]

323
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,950
[South Moon Order]

324
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,060
Single-handedly attacking the South Moon Order

325
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,520
and even erasing it from Jianghu.

326
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,600
Little Monster must've been really angry.

327
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,430
I guess Sima Rong's crippling affected him heavily.

328
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,090
Their relationship is not that simple.

329
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,940
Demoness, what are you thinking about?

330
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,300
Thinking of you.

331
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,830
You're so flirty.

332
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,770
Please, Miss, help me out.

333
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,930
Why can't you believe me?

334
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,330
Are you an idiot?

335
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,730
I already said Miss Zhiyan is not here.

336
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,540
She left last night. Why are you still waiting here?

337
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,260
Forgive the trouble. Please let her know that Liu Cangling really has a reason to see her.

338
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,410
You really are an idiot.

339
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,670
Zhiyan!

340
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,740
Don't go soft-hearted.

341
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,000
Yuezhu, is there a guest?

342
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,600
Miss Zhiyan is back.

343
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,800
Miss Zhiyan, why did you return?

344
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,760
You didn't leave with Chenlan?

345
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,810
After I went out last night,

346
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,380
After I went out last night,

347
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,370
I found many fun things to do in Jiangzhou City so I wanted to stay a few more days.

348
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,930
I found many fun things to do in Jiangzhou City

349
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,130
so I wanted to stay a few more days.

350
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,740
Zhiyan, if you feel that Jiangzhou City is fun,

351
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,790
I'll stay here with you.

352
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,160
Just don't return to Wan Lu Sect.

353
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,160
It appears that young Master Liu holds veiled criticism towards our Wan Lu Sect.

354
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,090
Good and evil do not go hand in hand. Different paths can't communicate with each other.

355
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,130
Really? Tell me. Young Master Liu,

356
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,990
what is good and what is evil?

357
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,390
Of course, the Immortal Sect is good,

358
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,940
and everything else is evil.

359
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,600
What a joke! Your Brother Cangling is as much of a fool as you are.

360
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,490
Not true! He...

361
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,020
Zhiyan.

362
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,030
Brother Cangling, let's go out for a walk.

363
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,090
West Hills Master, we'll be back in a bit.

364
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,360
Miss Zhiyan, please go ahead.

365
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Here, let me put it on for you.

366
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
Okay.

367
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,900
Zhiyan.

368
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,930
Brother Cangling.

369
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,500
Why are you here?

370
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm feeding the fish.

371
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,800
What are you hiding behind your back?

372
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
I want to see.

373
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,450
I want to see!

374
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,100
It's too simple. I wanted to carve something,

375
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,400
but...

376
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,900
You made it?

377
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,800
It was a good material.

378
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,200
At first, I wanted to carve your favorite plum blossom.

379
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
But I failed.

380
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,000
And then I wanted to carve an orchid.

381
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,900
I failed again.

382
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,800
Finally, I just wanted to carve a pattern...

383
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,000
If you don't like it,

384
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,200
you can throw it away. I'll buy a better one for you.

385
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,600
I like it! I like anything you give me.

386
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,800
You... You like it?

387
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,400
Spring is shining with the colors of love.

388
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Hair-pinning flower matching a young lord.

389
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Brother Cangling, is it pretty?

390
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
It's pretty.

391
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,200
Is it pretty?

392
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,000
It's pretty; really pretty!

393
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,800
"Hair-pinning flower matching a young lord."

394
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,200
"All-time separate, biding you farewell."

395
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,400
Zhiyan, let's have a good talk.

396
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,600
Talk? Talk about what?

397
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,000
Talk about how your father

398
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,500
personally killed my father?

399
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
By now, between you and me,

400
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,000
there's a rift of bloody vengeance.

401
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,600
The best I can do is not to put the blame on you.

402
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,900
As for the rest, there's nothing for us to talk about.

403
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,300
Brother Cangling, why can't you understand?

404
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,800
We can't go back anymore.

405
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,760
Get up, get up! Hurry and get up!

406
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,180
You... who are you?

407
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,380
What do you want? Chi Tianming is my master!

408
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,270
If anything happens to me, he won't let you go!

409
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,200
Chi Tianming? It's me that won't let him go.

410
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,500
Old rules, let's start.

411
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,000
- What are you doing? Don't come closer!
- What are you doing? Don't come here!

412
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,800
Don't come closer!

413
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
Don't move.

414
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,200
Ah Wu, your wounds are all healed.

415
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,450
This little wound couldn't have hurt me.

416
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,930
Ah Wu!

417
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,150
Put him down.

418
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,300
I couldn't stop him; he killed himself with poison; passing a letter.

419
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,800
Jiang Wu's true body is hidden in Fengmo Mountain,

420
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,200
he feeds on fear and rage.

421
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,030
Sima Rong?

422
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:58,000
