[Episode 4]

3
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,190
Master... passed away

4
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,090
Nice!

5
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,000
Go!

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,190
Just like that.

7
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,200
Jump again!

8
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,740
I heard a couple of days ago that Thousand Dust Pavilion's master passed away.

9
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,670
Now the one in charge is Young Master Qin.

10
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,750
Then, we will call him Master Qin from now on.

11
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,520
Master Qin is young and promising, and his looks are incomparable.

12
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,530
The Thousand Dust Pavilion will have a new atmosphere.

13
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,840
Speaking of the hottest news in Jianghu,

14
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
Zhaoyao is still imprisoned in Phoenix Mountain.

15
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,890
Lu Zhaoyao got caught by Jin Xian, she will never be able to escape

16
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,830
That's gratifying to the public!

17
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,690
Villains holding sway, he forgot Lu Zhaoyao beat the crap out of him before.

18
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,360
You are out of control

19
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,130
You are shameless!

20
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,230
Jin Xian.

21
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,020
You still don't know what you did wrong?

22
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,240
I saved someone. I didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,160
The person you saved is a bad person.

24
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,610
He didn't do anything wrong,

25
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,820
but you want to execute him in public.

26
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,570
I saved a good person and now I became your prisoner.

27
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,590
How many innocents have you wrongly killed?

28
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:49,270
Everything you said, I trusted you. It turns out

29
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,640
you lied to me.

30
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,760
Lu Zhaoyao, stop being so persistent in doing the wrong thing.

31
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,020
As you are new to Jianghu, I don't want to mortally wound you.

32
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,570
If you tell us the location of the Demon King's son, all that occurred before this,

33
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,220
- we will let it go.
- I'm not wrong!

34
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,050
I won't tell you. I will protect Mo Qing.

35
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,960
Even if he's truly the son of the Demon King, I will still protect him.

36
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,330
Just like the world says, the Lu Clan who live on Fengmo Mountain

37
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,200
have an evil heart and evil mind.

38
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,370
They must be put to death.

39
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm not wrong.

40
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,760
I'm a good person.

41
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,710
I'm from Fengmo Mountain.

42
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,400
The words I've said, the things I've done,

43
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
I have no guilt or regrets!

44
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,330
You're the wrong one. You're wrong!

45
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,170
It's you who harm the innocent!

46
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,520
It's you who are twisting the correct way!

47
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,610
It's you who's obsessed with obscurity!

48
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,170
Girl, can you stand up?

49
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,530
Grandpa.

50
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,410
Mistreating my granddaughter, watch it!

51
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,950
Zhang Yu Sect leader, someone broke into the dungeon to save Lu Zhaoyao.

52
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,150
The person has strong strength and is fighting with Jin Xian now.

53
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,570
Grandpa!

54
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,730
Girl, are you okay?

55
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,540
Hurry and flee.

56
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,640
Hurry! Leave!

57
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,340
Grandpa!

58
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,520
Grandpa! Grandpa!

59
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,550
No!

60
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,800
No!

61
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,170
No! Grandpa!

62
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,250
Grandpa! Grandpa!

63
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,960
Now, you no longer have the strength to cast spells.

64
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,160
Dare to laugh?

65
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,940
Why shouldn't I laugh?

66
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,420
Using my old life

67
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,250
in exchange for my granddaughter's is worth it.

68
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,290
Grandpa!

69
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,360
So stubborn.

70
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,990
No! No!

71
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,190
No! Grandpa!

72
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,450
Girl, you're by yourself from now on!

73
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,360
Grandpa!

74
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,150
No! No!

75
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,180

76
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,150
Grandpa.

77
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,820
Grandpa.

78
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,930
Grandpa.

79
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,210
Grandpa!

80
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,780
Grandpa...

81
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,470
We had an agreement before that on everything else, we would listen to you;

82
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,120
but on this matter, you must listen to me.

83
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,330
I picked them on the mountain.

84
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,280
Old man, am I pretty?

85
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,010
- Pretty or not?
- As pretty as your mom.

86
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,940
Old man, I'm leaving!

87
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,300
Hurry! Leave!

88
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,400

Mo Qing.

94
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,610
How long have you been here?

95
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,230
One month.

96
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,140
One month.

97
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,780
You're injured.

98
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,800
Yes, I am severely injured.

99
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,140
But it's okay. The injuries I have

100
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,840
are the lessons that others taught me.

101
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,130
The person I wholeheartedly believed in before, who taught me Jianghu justice,

102
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,390
I no longer believe them now.

103
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,800
I will never be a hypocrite.

104
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,400
From now on, that Jin Xian is my sworn enemy.

105
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,350
I still want to build a sect. I even already have a name in mind.

106
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,310
It's called Wan Lu (Ten Thousand Road) Sect.

107
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,290
I want to use a knife to open

108
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,270
a blood path

109
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,970
and use the sword to fight for justice!

110
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,870
From then on, I became what people called

111
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,380
the evil and notorious demoness.

112
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,890
I kill people but also save people.

113
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,820
I let the entire Jianghu hate and fear my sect.

114
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,050
Those who suffered by their sect, I let them join my Wan Lu Sect.

115
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,720
I created the Eastern, Southern, Western, Northern, sect heads, and made the Immortal Sect my enemy.

116
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,650
I want all of Jianghu to know my name.

117
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,450
Finally, I sealed the immortal, Luo Mingxuan.

♫ Let the teardrops kiss my hair ♫

121
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,090
I ordered Mo Qing to guard the mountain entrance,

122
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,990
and I slowly forgot the past.

123
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,700
And I finally stabilized

124
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,190
my position as the leader of the Wan Lu Sect.

[Phoenix Mountain]

132
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,660
Everyone, tomorrow Demon King's Wanjun sword will resurface.

133
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,150
Everyone in Jianghu knows.

134
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,360
By then, there will definitely be chaos at the sword tomb.

135
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,990
My Immortal Sect will use tomorrow

136
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:08,340
to get rid of all the chaos altogether and make the world clean.

137
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,400
Now Wan Lu Sect is the biggest of them all.

138
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,650
Other sect disciples to them are like ants.

139
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,020
There's also that Lu Zhaoyao.

140
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,480
That year, that demonness got off of the mountain and fought with our sect by herself

141
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,690
and saved the so-called Demon King's son.

142
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,250
We haven't heard about the Demon King's son, but this Lu Zhaoyao,

143
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,640
became famous. From then on, as if God was helping her,

144
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,830
Wan Lu Sect expanded until today.

145
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,920
Jin Xiu, that demoness's past,

146
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,740
everyone has heard of it. No needs to mention it again.

147
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,320
That year, I saw it.

148
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,340
That demoness had just entered Jianghu,

149
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,150
yet just by herself, she managed to beat all the major sects

150
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,720
and then sealed Jin Xian.

151
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,000
Enough!

152
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,370
Fine, I won't mention the past anymore.

153
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,640
I heard she is already leading the Wan Lu Sect's army

154
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,160
straight to the sword tomb.

155
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,550
May I ask everyone here,

156
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,150
why do you think we can stop her?

157
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,230
How can you spread word of the power of that devil girl?

158
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,400
Deacon Chi, don’t be angry.

159
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,530
I understand Jin Xiu's worry.

160
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,430
To tell the truth, the other Sect Leaders and I have made arrangements for this.

161
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,470
If so, then you gathering us here

162
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,120
is to gain another force

163
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,190
in hopes that nothing will go wrong tomorrow.

164
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,430
That's right.

165
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,820
Whoever is scared of that devil woman can leave now.

166
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,910
During the battle many years ago, several people here lost enough face.

167
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,650
In order to prevent history from repeating,

168
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,450
and as I’m untalented, I don’t really want to wade through these muddy water.

169
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,990
I'll take my leave now.

170
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:31,670
- What do all the sect leaders think?
- I, Qing Yinge...

171
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,520
I, Guan Yulou...

172
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,580
will try our best.

173
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,830
Sect leader, my Xu Sect specializes only in medicine.

174
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,630
Battling and killing is not our strength.

175
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,990
If anyone gets injured during the battle, please bring them directly to us.

176
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,790
My Xu Sect will do all they can to treat them.

177
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,420
Qin Sect Leader.

178
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,120
My Qin clan shall be helping.

179
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,070
But my men are not very experienced.

180
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,170
I'm afraid we may drag you all down during the battle.

181
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,930
Qin Sect Leader sure knows his men well.

182
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,850
Wish, for the eternal Heaven.

183
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,170
Destroy the evil.

184
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,740
Destroy the evil!

185
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,480
Tomorrow, I want that sword tomb

186
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,960
to become Lu Zhaoyao's tomb

187
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,040
to get revenge for her sealing Mingxuan.

188
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,940
Suruo, you should not persist with hatred.

189
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,150
Lu Sect Leader, my dear brother,

190
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,070
you can only say that because

191
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,380
your heart doesn't yet have hate.

192
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,470
Sect Leader, you are very beautiful today. Everyone is saying

193
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,040
that you're the most beautiful bride out of all sects.

194
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,200
The wedding procession is coming. You must be nervous.

195
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,460
Naturally.

196
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,340
For this day, I've waited a long time.

197
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,650
Besides, he is Jin Xian.

198
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,580
The dragon and phoenix of the people, blessed and favored by Heaven and nature.

199
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm scared that this is just a dream.

200
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,860
You are beautiful and wise, and faithful only to Jin Xian.

201
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,670
Jin Xian is here!

202
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,580
Oh, Jin Xian is here!

203
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,930
Suruo, I've come to bring you back.

204
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,430
Mingxuan, back then

205
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,170
we were the couple that Jianghu praised.

206
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:42,000
But now... you left me alone in this sect.

207
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,040
When will you bring me back to Pheonix Mountain?

208
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,160
You said so. Phoenix Mountain is also my home.

209
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,830
If it wasn't for Lu Zhaoyao,

210
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,560
I wouldn't have to endure this pain.

211
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,310
Reporting to Sect Leader! Our lookouts in Shunan inform us that at the foot of the mountain,

212
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,340
there are nine highly skilled warriors gathering countless mobs

213
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,180
assembling in Shunan to plot the assassination of our sect leader.

214
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,230
Leader,

215
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,480
tomorrow is the day when the Demon King's sword, the Wanjun Sword, is coming to the world.

216
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,820
We await the moment when our leader obtains the Wanjun Sword

217
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,670
and can become the Supreme Hero, commanding the heroes of the world

218
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,800
those over-confident fools.

219
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,190
Sect Leader, this old man will abide by your orders!

220
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,020
Let me do this! I'll protect the leader!

221
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,190
No need. I'll do this myself.

222
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,300
Good! Excellent!

223
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,600
Mom, I want candied fruit. This one.

224
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,280
The demonness is here!

225
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,030
The demonness is here!

226
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,970
Run, quickly!

227
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,690
Hurry flee!

228
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,830
Look. We're here right now.

229
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,590
We will travel at night with fast horses

230
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,090
to take a rest here and analyze our situation.

231
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,150
Then we will take off from here

232
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,630
to here and kill Lu Zhaoyao when we find her.

233
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,530
- Right, kill Lu Zhaoyao!
- Kill Lu Zhaoyao!

234
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,390
Kill Lu Zhaoyao!

235
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,690
What is it?

236
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,530
What's this?

237
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,300
Lu Zhaoyao!

238
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,600
I heard that you guys wanted to make trouble.

239
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,170
Lu Zhaoyao, you dare to show up here!

240
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,470
I'm in a good mood today. Let's take a bet.

241
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,290
Huh? What bet?

242
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,380
I won’t fight back. You all can come and kill me.

243
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,940
If I die, I lose.

244
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,380
If I don't die, you guys lose. Losing side dies.

245
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,130
This arrogant?

246
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,860
I'll give you a candied fruit's time.
(The time it takes her to eat it.)

247
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,690
Lu Zhaoyao, don't be arrogant!

248
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,340
Making a move means we begin.

249
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,170
Five.

250
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,610
What a lame crowd.

251
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,930
You lost.

252
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,070
Sect Leader.

253
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,320
Sect Leader, it is time. We ought to set out towards the Sword Tomb.

254
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,200
The Sword Tomb?

255
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,660
Is it not the Sword Tomb, Sect Leader?

256
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,130
We are going towards my high peak.

257
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,790
[Changle Betting]

258
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,570
The Wan Lu Sect people are here!

259
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,300
You trash, are you not running yet?

260
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,640
Run?

261
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,180
You, Wan Lu Sect, are too arrogant!

262
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,610
So what if we're arrogant?

263
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,680
- Sect Leader.
- Guard the Sword Tomb's entrance.

264
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,410
Don't let even a fly in.

265
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,160
Yes, Sect Leader.

266
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,560
A trifling miasma. What can it do to me?

267
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,300
This is Immortal Sect's kill formation.

268
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,690
This venue is surrounded by our Immortal Sect. Hurry and surrender!

269
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,680
It is our duty to destroy demons and rid the world of evil. You should be eliminated!

270
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,500
Who's eliminating who? You shameless old fool who speaks such big words. Show your fists!
