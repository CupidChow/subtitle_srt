[Episode 24]

3
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,930
It's late in the night. You two, go back and rest.

4
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

5
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,510
You come late this evening; what is it?

6
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:04,830
Through the long night, small talk to while away the loneliness.

7
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,930
What do you and I have to talk about?

8
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,400
While I was gazing at the night sky, a major event compelled me to come to Jianghu and see you.

9
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,680
You don't believe me? How about we make a bet?

10
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,420
What shall we bet?

11
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,030
A kiss.

12
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,280
- Ah Wu!
- Ah Wu!

13
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
Why are you so heavily wounded?

14
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
We'll catch some Immortal Sect people to treat you.

15
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,030
So, what happened?

16
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,240
I am his "momentary slip." That's what he meant.

17
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,630
My biggest trouble now is not Li Chenlan,

18
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,250
but Qin Qianxian.

19
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,020
I have to retrieve my full strength.

20
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
Qin Qianxian,

21
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,570
I will kill you.

22
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,800
Jianxin Sect is destroyed.

23
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,240
You were instructed in the Teleportation Sword Technique, right?

24
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,900
Take us back to Wan Lu Sect.

25
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,170
Who would have thought that Li Chenlan

26
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,800
could actually shatter the Demon-Shield Ward.

27
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,510
Deacon Chi.

28
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,430
Where is the Revered One now?

29
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,730
Xin Ting and I were just searching.

30
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,110
Jianxin Sect is in ruins. If anything happened to the Revered One, I'll have you all answer for it!

31
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,650
Yes, Sir.

32
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,400
Come with me.

33
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,980
- Hanyue.
- Here.

34
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,840
You and Xin Ting speed away to Phoenix Mountain and carry the Golden Casket.

35
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,350
Jianxin Sect is broken. All the Immortal Sects must step forward.

36
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,810
At the moment, it is inadvisable to stir up more troubles.

37
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,990
Yes, Deacon Chi.

38
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,340
Liu Wei is lost.

39
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,540
Without Qin Yu's blood to wake up Jin Xian,

40
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,450
we only have 3 days left.

41
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,630
Li Chenlan, you actually destroyed Jianxin Sect.

42
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,250
The day Qin Qianxian will give Qin blood

43
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,510
to revive Jin Xian is close!

44
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,570
Only, it's a pity

45
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,990
for our Jianxin Sect, founded 100 years ago,

46
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,550
to be destroyed by him alone.

47
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,000
Just wait until Jin Xian lives again.

48
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,860
I'll make that Wan Lu Sect

49
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,120
repay their debts with blood!

50
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,710
Revered One, I've had the golden casket transferred to Phoenix Mountain.

51
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,400
It did not suffer any damage. Revered One, please take heart.

52
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,320
Jin Xian by definition has an invincible body.

53
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,670
I'm just unwilling to let him suffer any humiliation.

54
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,880
Only, Liu Wei... his inner power is completely depleted.

55
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,930
Take my older brother back to Phoenix Mountain. His sacrifice was for the greater cause.

56
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,900
Our Jian Xin Sect's losses, sooner or later, will be repaid by Wan Lu Sect.

57
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,340
[Jianxin Sect]

58
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,190
The pupils are here late. Pavillion Leader, please pardon us.

59
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,850
Why are you here?

60
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,250
We heard that Jiang Wu was in Jinzhou; Senior Suyan felt ill at ease and commanded us to come here.

61
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,920
I feel shame in my heart; I can't save Jianghu,

62
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,110
nor can I advise the troubled hearts.

63
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,680
- Prepare the formation.
- Yes.

64
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,690
The Pavillion Leader has a kind heart. He arrived so quickly.

65
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,860
Revered One, how about we...

66
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,660
It is not advisable to discuss that matter now.

67
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,210
The Pavillion Leader is comforting the souls of our fellow Jianxin Sect people right now.

68
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,210
It is inappropriate to mention further requests.

69
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,570
You and I shall first take the golden casket to Phoenix Mountain and complete all arrangements.

70
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,230
Afterward, notify all great Immortal Sects on my behalf:

71
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,290
in 3 days, I'll hold a meeting of the Immortal Sects.

72
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,710
We can discuss details then.

73
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,190
Yes.

74
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,060
Mingxuan, I'll wake you up. Soon.

75
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,830
Very soon.

76
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,040
I won't let you continue to sleep.

77
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,740
How can you be so clumsy? You couldn't even learn the Teleportation Sword Technique!

78
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,630
I was counting on you to take me and Li Chenlan back to the Wan Lu Sect. Instead, we fell down here.

79
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,440
I didn't mean to. It's the first time my sword carried so many people.

80
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,230
Little Monster!

81
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,700
Little Monster!

82
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,040
Father! How many flowers!

83
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,620
I want some Fruit Flower Cake.

84
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,610
Fine. When we go back, we'll have the cook make it for you.

85
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,870
Then, I want one this big.

86
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,090
No, I mean, this big.

87
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,960
Fine. All as you wish.

88
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,780
Yay! We're having Fruit Flower Cake!

89
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,580
Father! Father!

90
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,540
Father!

91
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,660
Help him along.

92
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,970
Save me, Father!

93
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,140
Save me! Save me, Father!

94
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,990
Demoness, what's up with him?

95
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,530
I don't know, either.

96
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,270
Demoness...

97
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,220
Moqing! Call him "Moqing!"

98
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,460
Moqing... Moqing!

99
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,510
Moqing! Moqing, calm down.

100
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,060
It's nothing. It's nothing.

101
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,600
Moqing...

102
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,840
It's nothing. It's nothing.

103
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,170
Moqing. Calm down a bit.

104
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,790
Demoness, whatever is it with him?

105
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,660
So scary!

106
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,300
Maybe he had some frightening dream.

107
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,130
It's nothing.

108
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,600
Captain, the Master...

109
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,930
How did the Master get hurt?

110
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,670
I didn't do it.

111
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,310
What are you afraid of her for? On what authority does she have to question you?

112
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,080
Master!

113
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,240
Go get South Hill Master right away.

114
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,710
Yes.

115
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,920
Qin Zhiyan, ever since you came to Wan Lu Sect,

116
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,380
the sect is rife with troubles.

117
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,550
The Master has gotten hurt because of you many times.

118
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,320
I am going to speak frankly. If this happens one more time,

119
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,560
I will use my life

120
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,690
to make sure you will disappear from Wan Lu Sect.

121
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,510
Let's go.

122
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,210
Demoness, what is the matter with you?

123
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,950
It's nothing. You go back first.

124
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,590
- Aren't you going too?
- I'll go take a look.

125
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,010
South Hill Master, Sect Master is wounded badly. Please hurry to Wu'er Hall.

126
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,950
South Hill Master.

127
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,930
I will chop my hand if I have to save him again.

128
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,830
I will chop my hand if I have to save him again.

129
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,350
Ansi, get my medicine chest.

130
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,990
Li Chenlan, have you ever taken in any of my words?

131
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,180
Doing this, do you want to die young?

132
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,670
No, this is the first time that I am grateful that I have a long life.

133
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,700
A long life.

134
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,330
I was able to wait and live to see today.

135
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,750
Before today, did you not want a long life?

136
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,160
Not wanting a long life?

137
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,220
Then, don't ask for me.

138
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,800
You should be like Lu Zhaoyao and die in a far off land,

139
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,150
so as not to ruin my reputation.

140
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,690
That's strange. Normally after these needle treatments,

141
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,180
your wound should be getting better.

142
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,140
But your wound is not improving at all.

143
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,150
Li Chenlan, what is the story behind the dark energy in your body?

144
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,790
If you don't tell me the cause of it, I will not be able to treat it.

145
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,360
All right, you don't have to tell me.

146
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,990
The God of Medicine can not save you, neither can the Lord of the Underworld.

147
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,540
Just to wait to die then.

148
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,190
South Hill Master, I still need to depend on you in the future.

149
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,700
This fight at Jinzhou City,

150
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,640
you didn't gain anything.

151
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,920
What is there to be happy about?

152
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,020
You've been seriously wounded.

153
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Did you hear?

154
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,530
The master of Wan Lu Sect, Li Chenlan, by himself,

155
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,050
was able to break up the Demon-Shield Ward at Jinzhou City.

156
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,200
Once the Wanjun Sword was unsheathed...

157
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,290
half of Jinxin Sect was destroyed.

158
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,450
Chi Tiangming, Liu Surou,

159
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,590
and also, the sect leader, Liu Wei: they all fell under his sword.

160
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,850
What about Qin Qianxian? Who is better?

161
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,300
That goes without saying, Li Chenlan is definitely better.

162
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,120
Once the Demon-Shield Ward is broken, then the Immortal Sect's nightmare shall begin.

163
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,330
Bullshit. What are the lackeys of Wan Lu Sect yammering about?

164
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,080
Our Changyu Leader already sent out invitations to all the Immortal Sects.

165
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,670
We will open the Grand Meeting to discuss how to vanquish the evildoers.

166
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,260
- Then we shall see whose nightmare it is.
- Today is your nightmare.

167
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:54,300
Tang Sect Leader, Immortal disciples are getting bullied, why aren't you getting involved?

168
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,180
A band of disorderly fools.

169
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,150
Not worthy of the bother.

170
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,540
Sect Leader.

171
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,190
I am guessing we received the same letter.

172
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,150
The Grand Meeting of Immortal Sects.

173
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,940
Reply to Revered Lady Changyu.

174
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,020
Mount Phoenix had been quiet for many years now.

175
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,670
We will definitely be there on time.

176
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,190
Yes.

177
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,150
The day I have waited for a long time.

178
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,710
[Qi and Huang reborn].
(Legendary masters of Chinese medicine)

179
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,610
Why can't Jianghu continue to be peaceful?

180
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,020
Sect Leader, do you plan to go to Mount Phoenix?

181
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,440
Yes, we must attend.

182
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,350
But rumors are circulating that this Grand Meeting has ulterior motives.

183
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,010
Should our Rain View Hall get involved with this mess?

184
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,800
[Rain View Hall]

185
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,220
This matter involves the rise and fall of the Immortal Sects, even if it is a mess.

186
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,700
We must attend it.

187
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,540
We have an important mission for you at Phoenix Mountain.

188
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,980
Do not disappoint me.

189
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,610
Were all the Immortal Sects notified?

190
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,010
Revered One, all the letters have been sent out.

191
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,050
All sect leaders replied except for Thousand Dust Pavilion.

192
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,230
All will attend on time.

193
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,900
Then, don't forget to remind Master Qin.

194
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,570
The stage has been set up, how can the main lead be missing?

195
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,090
I've heard that Qin Qingxian has been searching for Qin Zhiyan's whereabouts.

196
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,090
He's also been searching for news of another person.

197
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,360
Who?

198
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,400
Jiang Wu from New Mountain.

199
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,860
Jiang Wu from New Mountain?

200
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,270
The person that Thousand Dust and Wan Lu Sects collaborated on to target before?

201
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,820
Yes.

202
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,080
These movements from Leader Qin...

203
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,240
are very perplexing.

204
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,570
Pavilion Leader, Revered Lady Changyu sent us an invitation

205
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,290
for the Grand Meeting of Immortal Sects at Phoenix Mountain.

206
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,590
It's probably regarding the matter of Demon-Shield Ward and destruction of Jianxin Sect.

207
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,840
Do you plan to attend?

208
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,220
Yes.

209
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,740
Please forgive my plain speaking.

210
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,090
That fight at Jinzhou City is very suspicious.

211
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,760
Also, our investigation into the Manipulation Technique.

212
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,630
I think Revered Lady Changyu has secrets.

213
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,660
I am aware of that as well.

214
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,700
Except that many lives were lost when Li Chenlan destroyed that Demon-Shield Ward.

215
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,580
That derides the righteous path.

216
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,960
Our sect cannot be absent from this Grand Meeting.

217
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,170
I was too narrow-minded.

218
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,250
This is interesting.

219
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,200
What is it, Ah Wu?

220
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,630
The dog is biting another dog.

221
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,320
Deacon Chi.

222
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,330
Jianxin Sect has been pulverized.

223
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,050
You still have the mindset to meet with me.

224
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,960
Last time, I had already delivered the letter to Qin Zhiyan.

225
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,650
The two of us no longer have any business together.

226
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,480
The destruction of Jianxin Sect is part of our plan.

227
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,510
Did North Hill Master see Li Chenlan returning from there?

228
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,490
Go have a look, North Hill Master.

229
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,400
The chance you've been waiting is here.

230
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,880
But this time you need to give the letter to Qin Zhiyan.

231
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,300
You kill Li Chenlan.

232
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,290
Grab the position of master of Wan Lu Sect. If you fail...

233
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,500
What do you mean?

234
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,900
Nothing.

235
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,740
North Hill Master, one must complete the task of helping others.

236
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,490
If you do your best, we will also keep your secret.

237
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,000
What else do you want?

238
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,590
It's an easy task for North Hill Master.

239
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,330
We want the two Qin Zhiyan's.

240
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,490
Captain Lin.

241
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,930
North Hills Master, the Sect Leader is still in seclusion. He can't see you.

242
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,450
I don't want to see the Sect Leader.

243
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,230
Today, I came to see you, Captain Lin.

244
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,290
Xiao Ai, you're dismissed.

245
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,730
Yes.

246
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,550
North Hill Master, if you have something to say, say it.

247
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,280
Captain Lin, you've been on duty at the No Evil Palace for so long

248
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,930
and you've never seen anything strange about Qin Zhiyan?

249
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,330
Today, I'm not here to keep you in suspense.

250
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,250
Living in the Cleanse Dust Palace now

251
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,900
there are two Qin Zhiyan's.

252
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,430
Two Qin Zhiyan's?

253
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,820
In our Wan Lu Sect, there are three things we can't touch. We need to add another thing now.

254
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,260
First, you can't touch Sect Leader's sword.

255
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,570
Second, you can't touch South Hill Master's gird.

256
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,110
Third, you can't touch North Hill Master's beard.

257
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,680
And now, fourth, you can't touch Miss Zhiyan's maid's cloak.

258
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,480
The Sect Leader is currently not seeing the disciples.

259
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,880
In Wan Lu Sect everyone needs to be handled by you, Captain Lin.

260
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:03,320
My words end here. What needs to be done,

261
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,140
assess on your own.

262
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,760
Sister Ziyu, what did North Hill Master want this time?

263
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,440
Two Qin Zhiyan's.

264
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,310
That is to say, "In the day and at night, it seems like two different people"

265
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,760
- actually explains it thoroughly.
- Wha... What "two Qin Zhiyan's"?

266
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,510
[Cleanse Dust Palace]

267
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,260
Little girl, what are you grieving about now?

268
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,970
I thought about my father.

269
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,630
Only now do I feel that when people are with us,

270
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,180
we must cherish them.

271
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,180
Otherwise, when they leave, the greatest regret is our own.

272
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,530
Thinking back to when my father was here,

273
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,650
all day long, I only knew how to act spoiled, wanting this and that.

274
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,100
I never once fulfilled my filial duty,

275
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,680
even just to make a bowl of soup.

276
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,550
It's a matter of time for people to be alone in this life.

277
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,260
You must learn and experience loneliness.

278
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,510
When Brother Cangling was with me,

279
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,890
I also only knew how to lose my temper, making him coax me.

280
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,030
But I've never done anything for him.

281
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,000
I regret it so much.

282
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,540
Why couldn't I be a little better to him?

283
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,340
Even just a bit?

284
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,620
I just want to raise a living animal. On this mountain, other than you, old man,

285
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,740
we rarely see any other living thing.

286
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,240
When you die, I'll still have to be here alone.

287
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,910
Watch how you're speaking, you stinky girl. No respect.

288
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,130
Did I say anything wrong? I just want a living thing to accompany me.

289
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,390
A living thing? Those things will die in ten, twenty years.

290
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,770
It's a matter of time for people to be alone in this life.

291
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,400
You must learn and experience loneliness.

292
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,620
Then carry this regret to make yourself live better.

293
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,330
I will.

294
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,170
I will cherish even more all the people around me.

295
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,860
For my father, I'll live well.

296
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,830
Demoness, promise me, you must do it as well.

297
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,130
What must I do?

298
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,540
Cherish Li Chenlan.

299
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,090
You do meddle a lot.

300
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,640
This isn't meddling.

301
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,660
I believe if you keep treating Li Chenlan this way, sooner or later you'll regret it.

302
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,900
Enough. I won't say anymore. Lest you find me annoying again.

303
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,550
I'll go get some air outside. You consider this by yourself.

304
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,890

♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

321
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:50,120
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

322
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,380
♫ This uproar hasn't settled ♫

323
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:05,170
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

324
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:12,520
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

325
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:20,290
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

326
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:31,860
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
