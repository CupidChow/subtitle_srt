00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,800
[Episode 52]

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Mo Qing.

4
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,280

[Thousand Dust Pavilion]

6
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,390
I'm afraid I can not allow you this passage.

7
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,250
Looks like there's no room for negotiation at all.

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,840
There's absolutely no room for negotiation.

9
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,170
Thousand Dust Pavilion is no longer a member of the Immortal Sects.

10
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,710
Jin Xian's plan will cause unnecessary bloodshed.

11
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,880
I dare not agree.

12
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,430
Please go back, Sect Leader Chi.

13
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,950
All right. I will convey your message

14
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,790
to Jin Xian word for word.

15
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,660
You are an excellent chess player.

16
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,190
I will come again to learn from you.

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,470
As you predicted,

18
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,410
Qin Qianxian refused to let us through Jiangzhou.

19
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,810
The two demons of the Wan Lu Sect slaughtered men of the Immortal Sects.

20
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,280
They are heartless and unforgivable.

21
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,300
The Immortal Sects requested passage from the Thousand Dust Pavilion

22
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,410
and the Thousand Dust Pavillion's Qin Qianxian declined.

23
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,790
This means that he is taking sides with the Wan Lu Sect. His sense of justice is lost.

24
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,820
He is unjust and deviant.

25
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,170
We can't let the legacy of the Thousand Dust Pavilion

26
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,720
go to ruin in the hands of such a muddled man.

27
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,930
For this reason, as Jin Xian,

28
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,570
I shall gather all Immortal Sects at Mount Su

29
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,470
to purge Thousand Dust Pavilion.

30
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,270
You are wise.

31
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,650
In this case, Lu Zhaoyao

32
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,700
will be forced to come out of the Wan Lu Sect's base.

33
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,570
Is this your plan...

34
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,400
to kill two birds with one stone?

35
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,500
Qin Qianxian is a stumbling block to the Immortal Sects' great plan. We should have gotten rid of him sooner.

36
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,060
Li Chenlan has been on the loose for a long time as well.

37
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,440
This time, I'm purging the Thousand Dust Pavilion to capture Qin Qianxian and Li Chenlan.

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,730
As long as Lu Zhaoyao isn't around,

39
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,890
we can capture the son of the Demon King alive.

40
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,300
What if Lu Zhaoyao doesn't go to the Thousand Dust Pavilion?

41
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,550
She... will go.

42
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,240
Demoness, why don't you eat something first?

43
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm not hungry. Just leave it here.

44
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,490
Sect Leader went to the library again today?

45
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,140
Little Monster stays locked in the secret chamber every day.

46
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,860
Shouldn't he be healed by now?

47
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,530
Will the Demon Essence in his body get used up as time goes by?

48
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,180
I wish that were the case.

49
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,860
I hate a long-standing fight.

50
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,910
Maybe that Demon Essence will give up as easily as I do.

51
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,810
Even though I'm not fond of Little Monster,

52
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,760
seeing him locked up in the secret chamber every day...

53
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,500
I kind of feel bad for him.

54
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,620
Demoness goes to the library every day. Refusing to give up.

55
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,760
But there are so many books in the library.

56
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,360
And Sect Leader tends to get dizzy when she reads.

57
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,990
How can she possibly read all those books?

58
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,470
She hasn't slept for days now.

59
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,230
My heart aches for Sect Leader.

60
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,700
Mine, too.

61
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,670
Pull the sword out. I will give you the power

62
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,540
to kill these people.

63
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,230
Don't wait anymore. She won't come!

64
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,710
Pull the sword out. It is your destiny to merge with me!

65
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,040
This is your destiny.

66
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,720
You think you can free yourself from me so easily?

67
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,000
You can't escape me.

68
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,830
I will follow you no matter where you go!

69
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,840
We're already one!

70
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,440
Zhaoyao.

71
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,970
There's nothing I can do about it.

72
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,600
I have thought over and over again.

73
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,230
Since the Wanjun Sword is the one that demonizes Chenlan step by step,

74
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,910
perhaps we can take the Wanjun Sword back to the Sword Tomb again.

75
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,870
Although the seal placed by the old Demon King was broken,

76
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,140
in the Sword Tomb maybe we can find another way

77
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,810
to put the Wanjun Sword under control.

78
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,320
This is a futile resistance. Even attempting to be free.

79
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,740
We have already merged.

80
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,210
As long as I'm alive, you've no right to choose death!

81
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,470
I'll go to the secret chamber to check.

82
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,140
Demoness, Li Chenlan is at Wu'e Hall.

83
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,090
Is this all Li Chenlan's blood?

84
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,930
He already tried his best.

85
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,400
Chenlan, do not let your Demon Essence control you at any cost.

86
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
- Zhaoyao...
- You all, leave immediately.

87
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,560
Leave the Wan Lu Sect. You can't do anything to help.

88
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,150
What?

89
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,130
Zhaoyao, leaving this place won't help us save Chenlan.

90
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,380
I don't need you guys to save him.

91
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,960
But what about you, Sect Leader?

92
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,670
I must face this with him together.

93
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,510
This is not him.

94
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,580
- But...
- Stay out of my way.

95
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,390
Go!

96
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,890
Mo Qing, it's me.

97
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,270
It's you. So what if it's you?

98
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,140
Mo Qing!

99
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,570
Little Monster, you're awake!

100
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,800
- He's awake!
- Chenlan, how do you feel?

101
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,160
My body feels weak.

102
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,360
But my heart feels empty.

103
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,320
I can't feel the Demon Essence.

104
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,200
That's great! The Demon Essence is under control.

105
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,620
I'm finally relieved.

106
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,570
Little Monster,

107
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,640
you scared me.

108
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,140
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

109
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,290
Hurry up.

110
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,690
Don't worry. I am fine.

111
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,230
Mo Qing, I love you.

112
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,360
I know.

113
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,620
I can't let anything bad happen to you.

114
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,180
Me neither.

115
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,770
From now on, we must be well.

116
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,360
We will.

117

[Thousand Dust Pavilion]

118
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,310
Pavillion Leader!

119
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,650
Qianxian.

120
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,090
It's been a long time. How are you?

121
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,330
You came at the right time. I have something I need to clarify with you.

122
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,590
I hope, Jin Xian, you will stop fighting with the Wan Lu Sect.

123
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,260
Qin Qianxian, I believe you know the purpose of our visit.

124
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,870
Why do you still dare make such an absurd request?

125
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,290
I just hope everyone will rein in the horse before the precipice.
 [T/N: (Proverb) it means to stop before it's too late.]

126
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,120
Su Yan!

127
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,750
Pavillion Leader Qin, you've lost your integrity.

128
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,440
You're no longer qualified to be the leader of the Thousand Dust Pavilion.

129
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,830
Why don't you come with me to cultivate your mind in Mount Phoenix?

130
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,690
We will decide who our leader should be. No need for Jin Xian to worry about that.

131
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:49,260
Su Yan, I'm just a man that has lost his power.

132
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,970
It's fine.

133
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,290
It's all right as long as our men are unharmed.

134
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,820
I can cultivate anywhere in this world.

135
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,310
I don't mind going to Mount Phoenix.

136
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,890
Pavillion Leader Qin, please come with us.

137
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,880
Jin Xian...

138
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,890
The way of the deity is broken, will the deity's body remain?

139
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,190
Son of the Demon King,

140
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,190
you are the origin of all iniquity.

141
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,090
Getting rid of you means getting rid of evil,

142
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,990
then all this shall end.

143
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,700
Reporting! Luo Mingxuan went to the Thousand Dust Pavilion today with Chi Tianming and Xiong Tian.

144
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,880
In order to gain passage through the Thousand Dust Pavilion! He captured Qin Qianxian and purged the Thousand Dust Pavilion!

145
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,600
What?

146
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,130
These people are getting carried away and bullying Beautiful One! This is outrageous!

147
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,840
Sect Leader, I ask for permission to kill those bullies!

148
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,190
- You aren't allowed to go!
- Why?

149
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,340
Luo Mingxuan is there. You're no match for him.

150
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,380
Do we allow them to bully Beautiful One like this?

151
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,990
I can't accept this.

152
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,520
My niece, can you accept this?

153
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,810
- I will go.
- You can't.

154
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,890
It's too dangerous! What if Luo Mingxuan is after something else?

155
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,750
Luo Mingxuan wants to pass through the Thousand Dust Pavilion aiming to attack the Wan Lu Sect.

156
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,840
First of all, after the recent internal conflicts in the Wan Lu Sect, we're too weak to go to war with them.

157
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,260
Second, even if he doesn't attack us after occupying Jiangzhou City,

158
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,010
once Jiangzhou City is in Luo Mingxuan's hands,

159
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,680
the Wan Lu Sect will be cornered as if someone got us by the throat.

160
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,230
In addition, I'm indebted to Qin Qianxian.

161
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,750
No matter what, I can't turn a blind eye to this.

162
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,920
Zhaoyao, you...

163
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,490
Seventeen, you stay here to protect Mo Qing and the Wan Lu Sect.

164
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,580
Be careful with Luo Mingxuan.

165
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,570
I'm just going to rescue Qin Qianxian, not to start a fight. He won't get to kill me.

166
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,480
Be careful. If you sense danger, teleport back immediately.

167
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,010
All right.

168
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,000
You were a member of the Wan Lu Sect. Did you defect because you thought Li Chenlan was wrong about something?

169
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,640
Is that why you joined Luo Mingxuan?

170
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,450
I've never thought that Li Chenlan

171
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,800
did anything wrong in managing the Wan Lu Sect.

172
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,230
Then, why did you betray him?

173
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,930
Unrequited love.

174
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,250
You don't have to talk me out of this. I know myself very well.

175
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,930
I see the truth, but I still can't let go.

176
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,030
Pavilion Master, this way, please.

177
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,800
What did Luo Mingxuan do to Qin Qianxian?

178
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,360
Sect Leader Lu, you came late.

179
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,070
Both Jin Xian and Pavillion Leader Qin have returned to Mount Phoenix.

180
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,610
Who's there?

181
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,040
There's a problem. I'll go check!

182
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,270
So it's you?

183
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,200
We didn't come for you; and instead, you came to us?

184
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,350
Mere ants dare raise a clamor?

185
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,300
You're here at just the right time.

186
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,470
[Wu'e Hall]

187
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,820
You've actually lost your power.

188
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,180
Reluctant to use the Wanjun Sword, you are just crippled.

189
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,380
Who are you?

190
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,540
Son, in this life, I haven't done anything for you.

191
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,510
At the end,

192
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,010
let your father do this one thing.

193
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,560
Father...

194
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,820
Whatever he forgets, he won't forget you.

195
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,800
Father!

196
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,940
Father!

197
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,220
Enough.

198
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,430
Don't follow her. Let's go back to Mount Phoenix and regroup with Jin Xian.

199
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,800
West Hill Master.

200
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,960
West Hill Master! West Hill Master!

201
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,400
West Hill Master!

202
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,530
West Hill Master!

203
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,000
- Seventeen?
- I'm fine.

204
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,690
Luo Mingxuan snatched Little Monster away.

205
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
What happened?

206
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,780
Seventeen said that Luo Mingxuan took Li Chenlan away.

207
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,570
Luo Mingxuan!

208
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,420
Zhaoyao, don't be impulsive.

209
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,200
Impulsive? Luo Mingxuan dared to come to my Wan Lu Sect and grab people.

210
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,230
Whatever I do will not count as impulsive.

211
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,550
Since Luo Mingxuan dared to come to Wan Lu Sect and make prisoners,

212
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,900
it means he's already utterly confident.

213
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,210
Even if you go, it will be for naught.

214
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,570
Furthermore, when Luo Mingxuan snatched Chenlan away,

215
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,730
he already knew that Chenlan couldn't use any kind of power now.

216
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,590
- Not to mention he doesn't have the Wanjun Sword either.
- So what?

217
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,710
Since Luo Mingxuan didn't kill Chenlan on the spot,

218
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,110
it means he has another goal.

219
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,380
So, Chenlan won't be in any danger for the time being.

220
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,130
- Wait for now.
- Wait? Wait for what?

221
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,740
Wait for him to reveal his plan.

222
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
- I can't wait.
- Lu Zhaoyao!

223
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,820
Do you really want to abandon the Wan Lu Sect in this crisis?

224
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,940
Your planning goes no farther than an insect. What will you do after?

225
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,550
Don't forget! This isn't only your Wan Lu Sect.

226
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,690
It's his, too.

227
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,740
Twenty-four hours. I'll only wait that long.

228
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,910
Detain him in the dungeons. Set the date of the grand meeting for the demon extermination.

229
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,620
I will enforce Justice on behalf of Heaven.

230
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,330
All right.

231
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,200
Who is it?

232
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,600
Jin Xian, it's me.

233
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,120
You're back.

234
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,330
I was told that Jin Xian had already captured Li Chenlan.

235
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,180
Pass the order.

236
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,380
Three days from now, on our Mount Phoenix, we are calling a grand meeting on the subject of demons.

237
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,220
This time we'll absolutely not leave any way out to the son of the Demon King.

238
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,750
Yes. Immortal Sect's golden age is imminent!

239
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,990
You're all dismissed for now.

240
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,660
- Yes!
- Yes!

241
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,260
Luo Mingxuan is going to kill you in three days.

242
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,580
I can save you.

243
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,390
You will beg me to save you.

244
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,480
[Tea]

245
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,060
What is wrong? Is it not to your liking?

246
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,880
The last time I came it was when my master sent me to take a medicine to his junior.

247
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,290
But I couldn't have known that just a few days later

248
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,810
both of them would just...

249
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,910
Sect Leader, Phoenix Mountain sent news.

250
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:50,530
They say that in three days we'll hold a grand meeting about demons, and the trial of Li Chenlan.

251
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,970
The one who should be tried is not Li Chenlan.

252
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,320
Let's go.

253
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,820
We're going to the Wan Lu Sect immediately.

254
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,560
If we break into Phoenix Mountain how many chances do we have of saving Li Chenlan?

255
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,220
None.

256
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,990
None?

257
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,710
Luo Mingxuan has acquired the secret art and he's also holding the Liuhe Tianyi Sword.

258
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,460
Chi Tianming and Xiong Tian are loyal to the death to him.

259
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,990
Qingyin Sect Leader Tang Yun is in control of both Qingyin Sect and Tianxuan Sect.

260
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,570
In three days, she'll attend the grand meeting, too.

261
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,860
And recently our Wan Lu Sect

262
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,250
has been through internal strife and jolts, and has many problems to solve.

263
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,160
Seventeen was injured, too.

264
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,840
If we confront the Immortal Sect now,

265
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,100
I'm afraid it won't be easy at all.

266
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,180
Sect Leader Lu, Jianxin Sect Leader Liu is here for a visit.

267
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,570
Liu Cangling?

268
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,630
Brother Cangling?

269
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,610
Sect Leader Lu. West Hill Master.

270
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,210
Zhiyan?

271
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,110
Brother Cangling, why are you here?

272
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,810
I came for the matter of the Xu Zong Sect.

273
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,880
This is the personal pupil of the Xu Zong Sect Leader Jiang. He's called Li Yazi.

274
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,590
On the day the Xu Zong Sect was wiped out he was there, too.

275
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,640
He saw everything that happened.

276
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,790
My master was killed by Luo Mingxuan.

277
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,930
He seized my master's power and also stole the secret art.

278
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,240
Using the secret art, he stole the life of all our sect's people.

279
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,430
If that day I hadn't been hiding in a cabinet,

280
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,200
I'd probably also have been an aggrieved soul fallen at his hand.

281
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,160
How did he kill Gu Hanguang?

282
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,240
Luo Mingxuan stabbed South Hill Master; he persuaded my master

283
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,030
to imprison South Hill Master in the dungeons.

284
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,370
Afterward...

285
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,020
Afterward, I don't know, either.

286
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,610
So that's how it is.

287
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,310
On the way here, I received news from the Immortal Sect

288
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,930
that in three days Luo Mingxuan is calling a grand meeting for demon extermination.

289
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,530
A public trial on Sect Leader Li.

290
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,640
Did you all know this?

291
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,740
This is Luo Mingxuan's plan.

292
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,910
To blame all his crimes on Chenlan

293
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:38,860
and then bury the truth with his corpse.

294
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:45,600
If we have him as a witness to report the truth about the destruction of the Xu Zong Sect,

295
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,520
and unmask Luo Mingxuan's hypocrisy,

296
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,200
say we break into Mount Phoenix to save Mo Qing, how many chances do we have?

297
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,990
One in ten.

298
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,930
One in ten.

299
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,630
It's enough.

300
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,300
Luo Mingxuan is going to kill you publicly tomorrow.

301
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,570
He has laid an impenetrable net.

302
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,840
The Wan Lu Sect can't save you.

303
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,950
She can't save you, either.

304
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,400
The only one who can save you is me.

305
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,270
Through these years I was by your side,

306
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,100
all my thoughts were about you.

307
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,430
Why must it be her?

308
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,290
Can I really not take her place?

309
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,620
Nobody can.

310
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:17,230
Lu Zhaoyao is the only one.

311
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,510
Lu Zhaoyao is the only one.

312
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,240
But do you know

313
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,570
that Ziyu is the only one, too?

314
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:04,500
♫ If you don't personally seal that dream ♫

315
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:10,440
♫ you'll have the mark of being born a demon  ♫

316
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,920
♫ Cliffs of carnage blood like mountains and rivers  ♫

317
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,670

320
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:40,310
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

321
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:47,890
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

322
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:59,700
♫ This uproar hasn't settled, so what?  ♫

323
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:19,450
♫  If love is a thunderbolt's crushing roughness ♫

324
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:25,390
♫ Just stagger to the end of the world  ♫

325
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:32,960
♫ With no inscription, who would understand?
Let feeling carve your heart  ♫

326
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,340
♫ Unbreakable, is the wild wave in the hands  ♫

327
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:47,740
♫ On the remote road I'll always be there to trample the troubled times ♫

328
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:55,360
♫ To slash away fate's shackles  ♫

329
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:02,900
♫ To battle nature, breaking the swirl of gratitude and grudge  ♫

330
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:10,350
♫ This uproar hasn't settled  ♫

331
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:17,900
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and Earth are shaken  ♫

332
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:25,410
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

333
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:32,940
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

334
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:43,330
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
