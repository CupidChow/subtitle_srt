[Episode 32]

3
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,550
Little Yun, what song are you playing?

4
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,400
Why is the music so very pleasing to the ear?

5
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,620
"Remembrance of an Old Friend."

6
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,860
It sounds so sorrowful. It suits the occasion.

7
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,830
I think Yun is troubled by something.

8
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,490
After Jin Xian's death, Wan Lu Sect holds a dominant position.

9
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,350
Right now, there are many barbaric people in Jianghu

10
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,660
who committed crimes in the name of the Wan Lu Sect.

11
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,310
Little Yun Yun, don't worry. No matter how arrogant the Wan Lu Sect is,

12
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,030
they wouldn't dare to act rashly in front of you, the Leader of Qingyin Sect.

13
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,780
Besides you also have me, don't you?

14
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

15
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,890
Jianxin Sect is destroyed, and Jin Xian is dead.

16
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,220
Jianghu's righteous party is in a feeble position. The Immortal Sects are in difficult times.

17
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,110
The people will suffer the most.

18
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,610
If we allow this to go on,

19
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,300
neither you nor I are going to have peaceful days ahead.

20
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,980
Then, Little Yun Yun, you mean...?

21
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,190
You're always full of ideas. Judging from the current situation,

22
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,400
do you have any ideas to help balance the power in Jianghu?

23
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,620
I do have an idea.

24
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,770
Let's hear it.

25
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,790
The best way is to use other forces to attack the opponent.

26
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,300
The wicked will fall afoul of their own ilk.

27
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,630
I wonder if you still remember Jiang Wu from New Mountain?

28
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,980
Little brat, quickly check on my buddy.

29
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,050
Your master is a traitor. We won't treat a traitor's disciple.

30
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,710
You!

31
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,760
Why are you being arrogant? Just wait and see.

32
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,350
When the North Hill Master makes a comeback and rises again,

33
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,540
- ...you'll regret it.
- I'll serve the...

34
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,990
I'm not giving it to you, either. You helped resurrect Jin Xian.

35
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,720
You betrayed the Wan Lu Sect as well.

36
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
I...

37
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,830
Zhiyan.

38
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,220
Zhiyan!

39
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,600
Brother Cangling, are you feeling better?

40
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,960
Take your medicine first.

41
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,400
Come.

42
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,150
Zhiyan, what is the matter?

43
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,580
It's nothing.

44
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,730
I just feel like... like...

45
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,500
I've wronged the Demoness.

46
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,980
I have burdened her.

47
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,100
Right now, her life is left hanging in the balance, and Li Chenlan's life is also in danger.

48
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,180
It's all my fault.

49
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,590
Liu Suruo wants me to go to Phoenix Mountain in exchange for Brother Cangling.

50
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,590
You can't go.

51
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,410
I want to go.

52
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,080
If you go, you're just offering them your blood as a gift. Then all our efforts will be for nothing!

53
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,350
But they say they want to kill Brother Cangling! I can't ignore it!

54
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,490
With the power you have, you can't beat the most inept of any sect's disciple ! Who do you think you can save?

55
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,080
I...

56
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,890
I learned the Teleportation Technique! I can use it to bring Brother Cangling back with me!

57
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,670
What's the rush? I've already talked about it with Mo Qing.

58
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,080
As soon as his wounds are better, we'll save Cangling together.

59
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,650
I can't wait! They'll kill Brother Cangling in two hours!

60
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,540
They're lying. If you don't go, nothing will happen to Liu Cangling anyway!

61
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,180
No way. I don't care.

62
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,960
Zhiyan, if someone is at fault, it should be on me.

63
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,170
I am disturbing you.

64
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,270
It's time to change the wound dressing. Help me out with it.

65
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,690
All right.

66
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,530
[Xu Zong Sect]

67
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,430
Sect Leader Shen.

68
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,010
An Si, is Miss Zhiyan here?

69
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,160
Miss Zhiyan is in the room of Jianxin Sect's young master.

70
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,390
In some matters, there is no right or wrong.

71
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,920
For a physician, in between saving a life
and harming one,

72
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,260
we merely choose to save a life.

73
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,890
Give me the medicine.

74
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,020
Since you've saved him, what's there to regret?

75
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,040
But many a time there's also a price to pay to save a person.

76
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,620
It's so hard to make a choice,

77
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,600
and the consequences are so hard to bear.

78
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,780
When you saved Miss Shen back then, was it as painful, too?

79
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,590
How did you know?

80
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Sorry, sorry! I merely heard the rumors in Jianghu.

81
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,450
It's all right.

82
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,160
Actually, it's not such a painful thing.

83
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,850
Be it saving her...

84
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,520
or extracting the Cold Poison out of her,

85
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,210
or making her forget about me.

86
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,470
It's all better than doing nothing.

87
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,260
When there's only one path before you,

88
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,700
it's not that hard to make the choice.

89
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,700
The consequences... won't be as hard to bear.

90
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,180
Lu Zhaoyao!

91
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,350
Lu Zhaoyao!

92
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,040
Lu Zhaoyao!

93
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,620
Lu Zhaoyao!

94
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,090
Lu Zhaoyao!

95
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,310
Lu Zhaoyao!

96
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,820
Gu Hanguang, what are you doing here?

97
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,810
Help me save her.

98
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,180
Everyone, go out first.

99
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,490
Yes, Sect Leader!

100
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,590
Save her? Why should I save her?

101
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,060
You are the doctor, I am not.

102
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,580
I need someone with high power to help me.

103
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,730
Not that many people in the world can reach that level. You are one of the few.

104
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,230
I founded the Wan Lu Sect; it's not a charity.

105
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,830
I will agree to anything you ask of me.

106
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,290
What if I asked for you to stay in Wan Lu Sect as a physician? Would you agree?

107
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,540
For how long?

108
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,650
Your entire life.

109
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,080
Don't. Don't.

110
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,940
Don't agree to that.

111
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,600
All right, I agree.

112
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,760
Qianjin. Qianjin!

113
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,080
Hurry up, let's start!

114
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,750
Happily!

115
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,760
You shouldn't suffer the pain of Cold Poison for my sake.

116
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,820
The only solution now

117
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,770
is to make you forget all of this.

118
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,850
So that you can start afresh.

119
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,170
Hanguang, what are you doing?

120
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,620
Forget me. Forget all of this.

121
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,190
No.

122
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,060
You don't have to suffer the pain of Cold Poison.

123
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,760
It's enough that I am here to remember all of this.

124
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,060
Young lord, are you interested in a game of chess?

125
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,830
Gu Hanguang,

126
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:57,080
how much longer do you want me to forget about you?

127
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,910
You are remembering?

128
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,890
The Cold Poison is resurfacing. You can't recall anymore.

129
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,610
Qianjin... Qianjin!

130
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,570
Gu Hanguang!

131
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,830
Do you want me to forget you again?

132
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,420
Who are you to make the decision for me?

133
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,430
Sect Leader Shen, what's going on?

134
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,470
- Qianjin...
- South Hill Master!

135
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,830
- Qianjin...
- Sect Leader Shen, what are you doing?

136
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,000
Qianjin!

137
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,670
Gu Hanguang, let me tell you! I, Shen Qianjin, have never feared death.

138
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,620
But I am frightened at losing the memory of you again!

139
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,050
No!

140
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,410
Sect Leader Shen!

141
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,590
Don't, Qianjin! Qianjin!

142
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,990
Qianjin!

143
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,870
- Qianjin.
- Sect Leader Shen!

144
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,090
Qianjin!

145
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,440
Qianjin!

146
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,780
Qianjin.

147
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,260
Qianjin.

148
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,610
The martial power of Rain View House

149
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,690
requires one to never fall in love.

150
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,970
So I destroyed it in myself.

151
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,010
I don't have to... forget you anymore.

152
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,990
Qianjin.

153
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,330
Qianjin!

154
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,040
- Qianjin!
- Sect Leader Shen!

155
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,770
This is not the time to be in a daze.

156
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,860
Hurry, take Sect Leader Shen back to her room for treatment,

157
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,260
then notify the people from Rain View House to come over.

158
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,150
Yes.

159
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,580
Listen carefully. We are from Wan Lu Sect. If you don't pay us, you'll suffer the same fate.

160
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,690
- Hurry.
- What's the matter? Give me the money.

161
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,300
Give me all the money. Pay up! What are you looking up?

162
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,930
- I'm talking about you.
- Hurry!

163
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,800
Hurry. Fish out the money from your pocket.

164
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,890
Pay up.

165
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,340
We made a lot today. It's quite useful to use Wan Lu Sect's name.

166
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,590
Here. Let's divide it up.

167
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,250
Thanks, brother.

168
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,970
This is for you.

169
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,120
Let's go to the House of Thousand Flowers tonight.

170
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,250
It will be my treat. I miss pretty Xiao Cui so much...

171
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Sect Leader Jiang attends to numerous affairs every day.

172
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,380
But you still come to the free clinic every month, rain or shine.

173
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,950
It’s a blessing to the local people.

174
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,270
You are too kind.

175
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,780
This way.

176
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,560
This is the medicine to replenish and nourish the blood.

177
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,730
Take it based on my prescription. It'll take effect within three days.

178
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,400
Thank you, Doctor.

179
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,130
Let me check your pulse.

180
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,840
It's probably just the cold. I'll write a prescription for you.

181
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,210
Take one serving per day based on my prescription. Remember not to consume cold food.

182
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,600
Remember to come back again for a check-up next month.

183
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,470
You're such a saint.

184
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,760
- Go get the medicine.
- Thank you.

185
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,070
Madam, come to me to get the medicine.

186
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,770
Sect Leader Jiang, how have you been?

187
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,960
Jin Xian survived a great disaster. It's a blessing to the Immortal Sects.

188
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,090
That was quite a dangerous situation back then.

189
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,220
It's a regret I've yet to accomplish the work of a greater cause,

190
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,220
to give support to the world's righteous way.

191
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,620
Never did I expect

192
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,840
that I could make such a narrow escape from death.

193
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,020
Mingxuan.

194
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,440
Every single day that you were in a slumber I would keep thinking in my mind.

195
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:02,320
No matter the method, no matter the price to pay...

196
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,300
I must make you wake up.

197
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,520
The deepest wish in my life

198
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,380
was to become your wife.

199
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,750
I could watch you wake up every morning.

200
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:32,120
When you had time, I'd keep you company.

201
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:38,020
When you were busy...I'd wait for you at home.

202
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,420
I've betrayed our sect. I've betrayed our convictions.

203
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,810
I've harmed people who are dearest and nearest to me.

204
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,540
Finally, I managed to get you to wake up.

205
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,940
But I didn't expect

206
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,640
I'd be the one to leave first.

207
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,460
Suruo.

208
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,820
Look at that.

209
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,370
How beautiful is this world?

210
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,960
But I won't miss it at all.

211
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,040
Except for you.

212
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,400
You are my only affection, Mingxuan.

213
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,420
Suruo.

214
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,320
You're my husband.

215
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,010
Lu Zhaoyao, for the death of my wife

216
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,000
and the humiliation you caused me,

217
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,160
I'll surely make you pay back a hundredfold.

218
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,750
The heavens are giving their divine blessing to protect the Immortal Sects.

219
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,590
If you don't mind, you can recuperate in the Xu Zong Sect.

220
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,550
I have the medical knowledge. I can help you restore your vital energy, Jin Xian.

221
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,090
Thanks for your kind intention.

222
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,950
I'll take you up on your offer.

223
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,440
I'm really lucky to be able to run into you at this time.

224
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,160
Don't stand on ceremony.

225
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,030
With you back, you can bring the Immortal Sects together again.

226
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,250
You're the conviction of the Immortal Sects' people.

227
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,500
It's my duty to give support to the righteous way.

228
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,900
The news of me coming back to life will stir up turmoil in Jianghu.

229
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,230
We need to consider many things at length and make meticulous plans.

230
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,090
I hope that you'll not leak out the news about me.

231
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,850
Of course.

232
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,380
[Cleanse Spring]

233
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,620
Go on.

234
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,060
Can't we help her out?

235
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,310
It's her own path. She has to walk it by herself.

236
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,840
We can't help her.

237
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,300
Wish her the best of luck.

238
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,540
Mo Qing, wait for me.

239
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,890
Qianjin!

240
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,960
Zhaoyao, I will find you.

241
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,590
I will definitely find you.

242
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,620
Zhaoyao, wait for me.

243
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,880
What took you so long?

244
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,990
I'm late. Please forgive me.

245
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,720
Captain Lin, let's go.

246
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,710
[Xu Zong Sect]

247
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,030
I got caught in a disaster this time; thank you, Sect Leader Jiang for your help.

248
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,590
I am just doing what a physician should do.

249
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,530
It's your fate that is long-standing and shouldn't be cut short.

250
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,060
I'll never forget that you saved my life.

251
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:15,530
If you put it this way, I feel ashamed.

252
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,390
Because you were half sealed by Lu Zhaoyao,

253
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:27,120
the aura of the seal has permeated into the internal organs and bones.

254
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,020
As for now, I can only heal your physical wounds.

255
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,150
But the aura of the seal inside your bones and blood,

256
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,910
I cannot treat it.

257
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,830
Then... is there a way to cure it?

258
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,220
You got into a bloody battle with the Wan Lu Sect for the Immortal Sects.

259
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,760
Although what I can do is limited, I will do my best to treat you.

260
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:16,100
I've heard that all sect leaders of Xu Zong Sect are burdened by a forbidden skill.

261
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,020
Sect Leader Jiang has a yearly medical competition with the world's physicians.

262
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,390
I wonder if you've found the solution to it.

263
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,810
Although I use the name of a medical competition every year,

264
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:35,190
it is actually to ask for prescriptions. But...

265
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,560
the right opportunity has not appeared yet.

266
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,500
I hope, Sect Leader Jiang, that you'll take good care of yourself.

267
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,960
Yazi!

268
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,250
Get the medicine. Three times a day, no alcohol, no oily food.

269
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,440
You've come from very far, I will prepare the medicine for you now.

270
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,540
Thank you, Sect Leader Jiang.

271
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,420
Master, Jin Xian's body is very difficult to treat?

272
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,010
It is a bit difficult. Although his physical wounds are easy to treat,

273
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,140
the inner power of the Immortal Master may be difficult to recover.

274
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,080
That's right, Master. Why don't we try the Rebirth medicine?

275
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,360
How did you know the effects of the Rebirth medicine?

276
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,560
I... After South Hill Master threw me out of his house,

277
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,330
I accidentally learned that he used Rebirth to treat Li Chenlan.

278
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,100
And then I heard Li Chenlan went to Phoenix Mountain and defeated Jin Xian.

279
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,310
I thought he was probably cured, or else how could he be so powerful?

280
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,290
Master!

281
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,220
Stand guard here. No one is allowed to enter.

282
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,590
Yes.

283
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,810
If the effects of Rebirth are indeed that miraculous,

284
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,890
I can lift the forbidden skill's curse on the Jiang clan.

285
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,710
So my bloodline will not die out.

286
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,730
Master, you've finally come out.

287
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,550
Master, are you planning to use this Rebirth to treat Jin Xian?

288
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,820
Are you with Jin Xian or with Xu Zong Sect?

289
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,640
Why are you in such a rush?

290
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,360
Well, that's Jin Xian!

291
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,890
- I've heard of him ever since I was young.
- Did you complete the work I assigned you?

292
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,360
No.

293
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,180
Go. Get the medicine according to what I prescribed.

294
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,630
I will check on your work later.

295
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,300
Master, you're so mean.

296
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,450
Am I mean?

297
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,220
Your unfilial son has made a decision.

298
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,640
It's the only way to help the Jiang clan lift the forbidden skill's curse.

299
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,060
This is a last-ditch move.

300
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,810
If any of it goes against morality,

301
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,660
I hope that the ancestors

302
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,400
won't blame me.

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,540
♫ On the remote road, desolate, Heaven and earth are shaken  ♫

322
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:58,860
♫ Drinking cold snow, majestically, come back to me  ♫

323
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:06,640
♫ After the thorn's pain, a tender flower blossoms  ♫

324
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:16,690
♫ I'll go with you, to die and forget, forever together  ♫
