[Episode 40]

3
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,100
It's been a while since we last met, Miss.

4
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,050
Master is in the room. Please come with me.

[Thousand Dust Pavillion]

6
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,600
What are they doing?

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,100
Won't they disturb the Pavillion Leader's rest?

8
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,550
These followers volunteered themselves to pray for Master.

9
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,990
We hope that the Pavillion Leader can come to blessings from his misfortune.

10
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,900
Besides, these prayers have the function to calm the mind.

11
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,310
So, Miss Seventeen, you needn't worry.

12
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,560
This way, please.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Uncle.

14
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,820
The Pavillion Leader is a compassionate person.

15
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,450
For the sake of the followers, he was willing to risk his life.

16
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,990
Miss Zhiyan, please, don't worry.

17
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,600
The other followers and I will certainly find a way to make the Pavillion Leader regain consciousness.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,900
If my Uncle made such a choice,

19
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,430
it must have been as he wished.

20
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,700
I believe he didn't regret it.

21
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,320
Miss Zhiyan, the Pavillion Leader told me to pass this to you.

22
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,080
The Lotus Heart?

23
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,050
Su Yan, you must hand over the Lotus Heart to the Wan Lu Sect.

24
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,700
Don't worry, Pavillion Leader.

25
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,710
Pavillion Leader! Pavillion Leader!

26
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,470
Now, I've carried out the task that the Pavillion Leader entrusted to me.

27
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,310
When will he regain consciousness?

28
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,470
That depends on God's will.

29
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,400
Don't sleep. Get up and play with me.

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,430
It's boring to sleep by yourself. Beautiful One!

31
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,790
This item concerns Demoness's life. I think it can't be delayed.

32
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,560
Beautiful One!

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,230
Seventeen, we should return to the Wan Lu Sect.

34
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,150
Liar.

35
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,910
Didn't you say he would regain consciousness soon?

36
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,230
Return my drumstick to me.

37
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,540
Let's return to the Wan Lu Sect first.

38
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,610
Perhaps, Demoness and Li Chenlan have found a way to save my uncle.

39
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,550
That's right. Sect Leader will surely have a way.

40
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,790
Let's go! We're setting out now.

41
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,470
Jin Xiu,

42
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,200
since when have you been in charge on Mount Phoenix?

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,950
Also, who are you to summon us?

44
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,410
It looks like you didn't suffer enough humiliation with Jiang Wu.

45
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,570
Cut the crap.

46
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,450
If you there's anything, just say it.

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,500
After the incident with Qin Qianxian, you two might have greatly misunderstood me.

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,120
It did me no good to cooperate with Jiang Wu.

49
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,380
Jianghu needs balance.

50
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,620
The Wan Lu Sect holds a dominant position. We can't let it develop.

51
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,490
Isn't it perfect to let the two evil parties fight each other?

52
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,550
Cut to the chase.

53
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,030
Jiang Wu is an unreasonable person.

54
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,300
Working with him is like dancing with the devil.

55
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,470
We have to guard against him.

56
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,830
If one day he could really take down the Wan Lu Sect,

57
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,270
this Jianghu would just be his empire.

58
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,220
You and I wouldn't have any more chance to make a comeback.

59
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,030
You used Jiang Wu to do the dirty work, killing Qin Qianxian.

60
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,510
And afterwards, you want to watch a fight from a safe distance, and reap the spoils when both sides are exhausted?

61
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,090
Jin Xiu, this plan you made is sound indeed.

62
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,000
Deacon Chi is a wise man.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,610
Ponder over it...

64
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,050
and check whether what I said was right.

65
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,460
What are you planning to do?

66
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:28,520
That depends... if both of you are willing to work with me to carry out my plan.

67
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,780
Jin Xiu!

68
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,860
Why did you...

69
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,490
How could you do that?

70
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,450
I did it to save your life.

71
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,460
I don't need you to save my life this way.

72
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,080
Pavillion Leader Qin risked his life to save the Immortal Sects' disciples.

73
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,470
Now, he has lost consciousness. Jiang Wu deserves to die.

74
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,500
You actually took his side.

75
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,330
I can't do it.

76
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,390
Little Yun,

77
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,410
I admire your unyielding character.

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
But we played a part in this.

79
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,070
Now that we're involved... the winners will live,

80
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,190
and the losers will perish.

81
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,190
We need to make plans for ourselves.

82
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,600
I think you should stay here and have a good rest.

83
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,150
Jin Xiu!

84
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,480
Jin Xiu!

85
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,380
Jin Xiu, let me out!

86
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,450
Jin Xiu!

87
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,170
- Look after her.
 - Let me out!

88
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,630
Should anything happen, inform me at once.

89
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,980
- Jin Xiu!
- Yes.

90
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,240
Jin Xiu, let me out!

91
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,340
Xiao Ai!

92
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,430
- Sister Ziyu.
- Xiao Ai,

93
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,470
- how has Wan Lu Sect been as of late?
- Lu Zhaoyao seems to have some kind of illness.

94
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,460
Gu Hanguang keeps going to Wu'e Hall,

95
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,590
but I don’t know the inside story.

96
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,020
Xiao Ai, I didn't expect you to betray the Wan Lu Sect.

97
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,580
Sister Ziyu, they've seen us now.

98
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,060
If I don't get rid of them, I will never be able to return to the Wan Lu Sect.

99
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,220
Traitor! You can kill me or do as you wish.

100
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,990
Miss Lin,

101
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,890
this drawing of the troop's deployment in the Wan Lu Sect is taking too long.

102
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll give it to you tomorrow morning.

103
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,850
Fine. Then, I'll wait for you one more night.

104
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,400
Deacon Chi, is there anything else?

105
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,980
Today I hope you, Miss Lin, will not move about so much in Jianghu.

106
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,180
Our Immortal Sect joined hands with Jiang Wu to the defeat Wan Lu Sect together.

107
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,910
Of course, Immortal Sects won't let that little demon prevail.

108
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,330
So I hope, Miss Lin, that for a while you'll keep a low profile

109
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,870
waiting for the day when Jiang Wu and the Wan Lu Sect have weakened each other. We'll be watching

110
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,650
and then we'll kill them by surprise.

111
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,860
All right.

112
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,930
But, Sect Leader Chi, please also remember what you promised me.

113
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,430
When Wan Lu Sect is taken, Lu Zhaoyao will be mine.

114
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,990
Fine.

115
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,210
Today, I got the news that Qin Qianxian remains unconscious.

116
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,450
He's unlikely to wake up again.

117
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,530
Even though Seventeen and Miss Zhiyan got the Heart Lotus,

118
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,810
now I'm afraid no one else will have the power to activate it.

119
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,960
So, the Diamond Hexagram...

120
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,250
I know.

121
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,220
If Qin Qianxian doesn't wake up, getting the Heart Lotus is useless.

122
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,520
Zhaoyao's power can't be recovered.

123
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,280
She could face the risk of dying at any moment.

124
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,540
It doesn't matter.

126
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,660
Chenlan, I know you always endure in silence.

127
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,210
But when it comes to Zhaoyao, you completely lose your mind.

128
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,290
The fact you're willing to let me see your temper shows how much you trust me.

129
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,410
So, it doesn't matter at all.

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,410
I'll go to the Land of Sojourn again.

131
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,120
I just hope they have some clue at that Empty Shop.

132

[Pure Wave Palace]

133
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,130
Little Monster lost his temper with you.

134
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm actually a little envious.

135
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,890
You're really open-minded.

136
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,130
Through all these years that I was dead,

137
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,800
I'd lived, too. I've never really feared much.

138
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,730
If I have to say what is the only thing that I fear now,

139
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,590
it's just for that little monster to be hurt.

140
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,540
All right, enough talking to you.

141
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,550
I'll go look for him in the forbidden area in the red-stone forest.

142
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,540
Visiting my own grave really feels strange.

143
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,410
Don't talk like that.

144
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,060
I'll have someone put it down.

145
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,680
Why put it down? It looks nice, up.

146
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,780
You can consider it a beautiful keepsake.

147
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,690
Leaving you aside, there are many memories for me here, too.

148
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,900
After I woke up and came back to Chengji Mountain, the first time I met you again was right here.

149
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,140
That time I came rushing out of the tree.

150
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,680
You were standing here where I am now.

151
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,260
I was bent on killing you.

152
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,060
It's uncomparably worth to remember that scene.

153
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,130
Why did you come here?

154
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,510
I went to the Pure Wave Palace looking for you.

155
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,660
They said you weren't there. I guessed you'd be here.

156
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,700
Young man, how about we go for a drink?

157
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,690
All right.

158
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,360
Back then you used to sit here like this, too,

159
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,770
watching the bright moon and stars over the mountain gate

160
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,430
through wind, frost, rain and snow.

161
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,280
And you, too.

162
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,640
Then, today, I'm going to listen to what's in your heart.

163
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,420
It says you are worrying about me.

164
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,690
You want to take the pain in my place.

165
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,700
You're afraid you'll lose me.

166
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,600
I like that last sentence.

167
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,570
It says you love me.

168
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,680
Say, did I hear wrong?

169
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,400
Not one word wrong.

170
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,420
One, two, three, four!

171
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,160
One, two, three, four!

172
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,520
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader!

173
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,180
No need for ceremony.

174
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,980
Ah Da, come with me.

175
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,360
TO PROPOSE?!

176
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,990
Sect Leader, we in the Dark Guards are usually all occupied in official business.

177
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,210
What we normally do is to kill and capture.

178
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,880
How can we have time to be courting girls?

179
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,300
Let alone proposing to them...

180
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,690
What you mean is that you want a vacation?

181
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,430
No! No! No! Sect Leader, I didn't mean that at all!

182
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,350
I humbly think that if you really want to propose to the previous sect leader,

183
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,350
this is harder than climbing through blades or jumping into boiling oil.

184
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,320
Please forgive me, I'm at a loss.

185
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,140
Sect Leader, how about asking West Hill Master?

186
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,860
West Hill Master has seen the world.

187
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,020
This little matter will certainly not baffle him.

188
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:56,380
I think... considering Zhaoyao's personality, the best is to be straight.

189
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,190
Speaking directly would be most effective.

190
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,100
What if speaking directly is too direct?

191
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,590
How should I proceed, exactly?

192
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,560
It is said in the "Book of Odes":

193
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,050
"One cometh as a bride to be caressed, a hundred carriages have gone in quest."
(T/N: Book of Odes, "The Bride Cometh")

194
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,360
How about we gallop on horses and chariots to give it a bit of a grand style?

195
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,940
Zhaoyao's Cleanse Dust Palace is wall to wall with my Pure Wave Palace.

196
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,380
Galloping on horses and chariots... wouldn't that be too much?

197
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,240
"The peach tree is young and elegant, brilliant are its flowers."
(T/N: Book of Odes, "Peach bloom")

198
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,390
Chenlan, on the day of the proposal, the mood must be graceful and elegant.

199
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,030
How about bringing a peach blossom branch to Zhaoyao as a gift?

200
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,020
Long ago, I gave Zhaoyao the Heart Prying Mirror.

201
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,380
It bears the deepest significance.

202
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,750
How can another gift compare?

203
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,990
"The beautiful and good young lady, zithers and lutes greet her as a friend,

204
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,220
bells and drums delight her."
(T/N: Book of Odes, "guan cry the ospreys")

205
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,860
How about we express the intent of the proposal

206
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,390
with the song "Phoenix courtship"?
(T/N: Ancient zither song from Han period)

207
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,540
Ah Rong...

208
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,380
you've always been wise.

209
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,920
It might be better to think of some other way.

210
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,690
I, a wanderer in Jianghu,

211
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,770
alone and desolate to this day,

212
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,660
have only ever loved Yuezhu.

213
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,910
I'm afraid I've had no opportunity to propose to anyone.

214
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,480
I'm at the end of my wits.

215
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,420
However... South Hill Master was always refined.

216
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,220
Chenlan, if you feel that my ideas are not good enough, why not ask him for advice?

217
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,420
I want to propose to Zhaoyao.

218
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,640
You want to propose to Lu Zhaoyao?

219
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,320
Except, at the moment, I'm out of ideas on how to proceed.

220
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Ah Rong says you've always been refined.

221
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,390
So I came to ask you if you have any suggestions.

222
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,830
For things that are not on this board, I have no way.

223
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,330
I brought some refreshments. Please, continue your conversation.

224
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,400
No matter what, the atmosphere must be warm and beautiful.

225
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,240
It's best if it's mild and suggestive.

226
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm afraid the moon would shine in a ditch.
(T/N: means the effort would be wasted on deaf ears)

227
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,540
Lu Zhaoyao is completely careless.

228
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,120
She can't appreciate your thoughts.

229
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,030
Then, in your opinion...

230
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,300
In my opinion, Lu Zhaoyao's style is usually too elusive.

231
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,700
This matter of marriage must inevitably

232
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,670
catch her unaware, and strike when she's unprepared.

233
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,610
Give her a dose of fierceness.

234
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,360
I humbly think that a proposal is a happy event.

235
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,910
It doesn't suit such a violent mood.

236
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,810
It must be made big. Bigger and bigger.

237
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,610
Big? "Big" how?

238
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,830
It's just a proposal. It actually put you all in such a state.

239
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,500
May as well have a sip of tea and clear your throat.

240
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,030
They all say that a woman knows a woman's heart best.

241
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,640
Please, Palace Leader Shen, point to a way for Chenlan.

242
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,780
I dare not.

243
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,830
I only feel that, although sentimentality may prevail in women, everyone is different.

244
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,800
Especially a person as unique as Miss Lu.

245
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,930
She won't stand on ceremony, nor would she appreciate constraint.

246
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,430
As long as you are sincere, Sect Leader Li,

247
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,450
and let her feel your heart, you'll succeed.

248
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,980
All right. It's settled.

249
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,900
A soft and reserved style.

250
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,810
I want to do it at the mountain gate.

251
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,100
I'll give Zhaoyao a stick of candied hawthorn.

252
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,810
That's her favorite food.

253
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,660
Start with that.

254
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,520
Then, I'll speak my intentions and get straight to the point.

255
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,060
After that, let the flowers fly across the sky. Do it in style.

256
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:11,580
Master, why must you do it at the mountain gate?

257
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,290
Some things... are easier done than said.

258
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,020
What are you talking about? Why don't I understand?

259
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,100
All right. Quickly get to it.

260
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,060
Yes.

261
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,510
Brother! Let me tell you a piece of news.

262
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,220
I heard that Sect Leader is going to propose to the former leader.

263
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,720
We're close. That's why I'm telling you.

264
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,550
Don't tell others at any cost.

265
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,730
Don't worry. Don't you trust me?

266
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,060
I've things to attend to. I'll leave first.

267
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,480
He's going to propose?

268
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm looking for you.

269
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,570
You haven't paid me for the wine from last time.

270
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,810
Brother, give me two more days. All right?

271
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,600
No way. How many days has it been?

272
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,110
How about this? I'll give you news in payment for the wine.

273
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,460
- For real?
- Yes.

274
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,910
Open. Hurry, open it!

275
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,350
Stop gambling.

276
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,130
Something huge is going to happen in the Wan Lu Sect.

277
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,710
All is well. What's going to happen?

278
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,220
What are they doing?

279
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,410
I bought this news at a high price.

280
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,620
Could they be spreading gossip about the Wan Lu Sect?

281
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,080
That's interesting.

282
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,410
Stop keeping us in suspense. Tell us quickly.

283
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,400
Sect Leader is going to propose to the former leader!

284
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,320
What?

285
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,400
The Little Monster is going to propose to Sect Leader?

286
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,630
Says who?

287
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,890
I don't agree! I'll never agree to it!

288
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,570
Who said it...

289
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,330
Sect Leader wants to propose to the previous sect leader.

290
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,400
Don’t let the former sect leader know about it at any cost!

291
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,990
Do you understand?

292
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,410
- Yes.
- I understand.

293
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,590
What are you all doing?

294
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,010
Former Sect Leader.

295
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,060
What are you chatting about?

296
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,590
Captain ordered us, brothers, to proceed with tasks. We've said all about it.

297
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,830
Dismiss. Leave.

298
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,800
Are you messing around?

299
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,830
Miss Shen invited me to meet at seven.

300
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,390
But she's still nowhere to be found.

301
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,190
What a coincidence. Sheng Qianjin invited you for a stroll, too?

302
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,100
Tonight, the moon is beautiful.

303
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,380
Dark clouds covering the moon, sure offer the beauty of a dim moonlight.

304
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,900
Zhaoyao, are you in a good mood tonight?

305
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,780
Mood? Pretty good.

306
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,520
Don't you feel that the people of the Wan Lu Sect are acting strange?

307
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,900
Strange?

308
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,030
Forget about it if you didn't notice.

309
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,320
Why isn't Sheng Qianjin here yet?

310
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,190
What if she got lost?

311
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,830
I'm going to find her.

312
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,580
Wait!

313
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,890
Where did you buy candied hawthorns at this night hour?

314
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,850
I...

315
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,430
Zhaoyao...

316
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
I...

317
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,520
I...

318
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,420
You...

319
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,330
Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

320
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,550
Let me go! Let me go!

321
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,640
- I want to see Sect Leader!
- Hanguang,

322
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,570
Seventeen is too strong. Puncture her with needles to make her pass out.

323
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,590
Seventeen's constitution really defies reason.

324
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,730
Let me go!

325
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,720
Sect Leader!

326
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,270
- We're in trouble.
- Sect Leader.

327
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,380
Let me go.

328
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,890
Let go! Let go!

329
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,540
- Seventeen!
- Run! The Little Monster--

330
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,400
...proposing!

331
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,300
So all the nuisance was for proposing?

332
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,510
Fine, no problem.

333
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,640
In the past years, we have done so many things in Jianghu.

334
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,450
This time, let's just have a happy event.
(T/N: synonym for wedding)

335
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,090
I said let's have a happy event!

336
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,910
I said let's make a happy event!

337
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,190
Did you hear?

338
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,830
You all let me go! Let me go!

339
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,560
What did Lu Zhaoyao say?

340
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,020
The wind is too strong. I can't hear clearly.

341
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,920
Sect Leader! Sect Leader!

342
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,710
- Be quiet.
- You all let go!

343
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,300
Don't stop me!

344
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,850
He dares kiss my sect leader!

345
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,480
He's taking advantage of my sect leader!

346
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,660
I'll beat him to death! Beat him to death!

347
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,040
"See no impropriety"!
(T/N: Confucius's commandment)

348
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,970
Sect Leader!

349
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,830
Calm down! Seventeen!

350
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,660
Sect Leader! I'm going to beat him to death!

351
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,360
Sect Leader!

352
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,960
Let go! Let me go!

353
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,220
Sect Leader!

354
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:24,060
Brother Qin. Brother's Lady. You came so quickly!

355
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,380
I said, no rush. But this lady of mine

356
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,920
just pushed me from the study all the way to your house gate.

357
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,370
She said, "Let's have this marriage set with Brother Liu as soon as possible."

358
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,380
Now, it turns out I said all of it.

359
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,510
Aren't you very happy with Cangling, too?

360
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,980
Zhiyan! Zhiyan!

361
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,240
You...

362
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,480
are you not willing?

363
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,470
I... didn't...

364
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,270
I'm willing.

365
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,760
I'll take care of you all my life.

366
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,720
Little Niece, what are you crying for?

367
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,350
Looking at them together,

368
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,900
I'm happy for them.

369
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,720
If you're happy, why are you crying?

370
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,470
They're called "tears of joy."

371
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,170
I don't understand.

372
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,620
I tell you all: Sect Leader is mine!

373
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,520
You people are not allowed to be happy for Little Monster!

374
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:28,140
Zhiyan, you will find your happiness, too.

375
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,690
Yuezhu,

376
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,780
I know.

377
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,420
I'm fake.

378
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,610
Not the real Yuezhu.

379
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,400
The real Yuezhu didn't have wooden ears.

380
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,910
Ah Rong, there is only one Yuezhu.

381
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,220
I don't want to be a fake.

382
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,330
You are not Yuezhu.

383
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,640
But you are not fake at all.

384
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,140
In the end, you are you.

385
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,110
You are me not being able to let go.

386
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,650
Zhiyan?

387
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,280
Congratulations! You two are finally together.

388
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:39,090
This... My uncle sent it to you.

389
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,740
Is Qin Qianxian well now?

390
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,150
But it is fine. Under the guidance of Senior Su Yan,

391
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,350
Thousand Dust Pavillion is fully in order.

392
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,220
Don't be too sad.

393
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:20,400
