00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
Xiao En!

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,090
Xiao En!

5
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,870
Xiao En!

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,660
Xiao En!

7
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,630
Xiao En!

8
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,550
Are you all right, Xiao En?

9
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,230
It's all right. I'm here.

10
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,930
- Mo Qing.
- Xiao En!

11
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,830
- Hang in there, Xiao En!
- Xiao En!

12
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,690
- Xiao En!
- Xiao En!

13
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,700
Xiao En.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
Xiao En!

15
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,770
Mo Qing, come to your senses!

16
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,430
Mo Qing!

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Mo Qing, come to your senses!

18
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,570
Li Chenlan!

19
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,130
Jiang Wu! Fighting him now won't benefit you!

20
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,020
He killed my brother and you're still protecting him?

21
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,070
You can see his condition right now!

22
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,520
You won't get the answer you want!

23
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,460
Mo Qing. Wake up, Mo Qing. Come to your senses.

24
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,640
Mo Qing.

25
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,360
- Die, Li Chenlan!
- Jiang Wu!

26
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,930
Who is the one causing this problem today? Don't you know that clearly?

27
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,230
Let's cool down for now.

28
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,700
We'll meet up in Wu'e Palace at noon tomorrow to talk it over.

29
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,300
Mo Qing!

30
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,080
Ah Wu, isn't it meaningless for us to continue staying here?

31
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,150
They've yet to pay for the life they owe me.

32
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,960
Of course, I have to stay.

33
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,330
Why do we have to wait until tomorrow?

34
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,060
We're giving them time to come up with a plan.

35
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,410
Ah Wu!

36
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,090
Lu Zhaoyao is nothing but trouble.

37
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,760
There are many women in the world.

38
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,240
Kill her. I will find a better one for you.

39
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,080
I don't need you to make decisions for me.

40
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,000
Because of one woman,

41
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,090
you changed so much.

42
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
Don't you remember?

43
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,170
Don't you remember our brotherhood oath?

44
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,050
Save me.

45
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,920
May Heaven and Earth be my witnesses.

46
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,230
From today onwards, I, Song Yi, shall be sworn brothers with Li En and Jiang Wu.

47
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,890
From now on, we'll share joys and sorrows.

48
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,180
We weren't born on the same day,

49
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,940
but on the same day we hope to die.

50
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,090
Drinking blood, we vow. If there's treason, may we be as this ware.

51
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,090
For Xiao En, I must take revenge.

52
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,420
I will never let Li Chenlan go.

53
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,480
Li Chenlan... Li Chenlan!

54
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,380
Ah Wu! Why do you still not understand?

55
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,560
Lu Zhaoyao and Li Chenlan are on the same page.

56
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
If you don't deal with Lu Zhaoyao,

57
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,850
you can't deal with Li Chenlan, either.

58
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,830
Our brotherhood of so many years

59
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,830
can't compare with one woman?

60
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,820
She's Lu Zhaoyao.

61
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,250
This whole world

62
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,360
can't compare with one Lu Zhaoyao.

63
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,290
I'll say it again.

64
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,280
I must take this revenge.

65
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,670
Sect Leader.

66
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,210
Call your Hill Master to come here.

67
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,530
Yes!

68
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,430
Would you have left with Jiang Wu?

69
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Did you think I would?

70
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,930
This and he,

71
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,790
both make me into something that doesn't seem like myself.

72
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,000
Hill Master, Sect Leader is seeking treatment in the middle of the night.

73
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,960
Which Sect Leader?

74
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,780
It's Sect Leader Li. Sect Leader Lu brought him in. They are already in the hall.

75
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,980
What's with him now?

76
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,000
Sect Leader Li... he's completely enveloped in dark vapor.

77
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,190
Prepare the medical kit.

78
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,850
Yes!

79
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,770
What happened?

80
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,390
The two forces within you were balancing each other before.

81
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,910
Now even suppressing it will be strenuous.

82
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,130
What on earth have you done?

83
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,910
If he doesn't talk, you tell me.

84
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,560
Chenlan, what happened?

85
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,480
Why did you kill Jiang Wu's trusted friend?

86
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,370
Tell me the truth.

87
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,120
What will happen if you can't suppress the Demon Essence?

88
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,670
The only way I will have peace will be to kill me.

89
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,390
We don't need to panic. Last time, Hanguang told me

90
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,790
that he's just setting out to grow a plant of Rebirth.

91
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,620
However... we still have to wait for five years.

92
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,160
Ready to repay with life?

93
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,560
Repaying with life isn't possible. Anything else is fine.

94
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,200
I've waited the whole night just to get this answer?

95
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,450
I said that I wanted a life.

96
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,920
If he doesn't give me his life,

97
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,780
I want the life of one of his underlings.

98
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,330
No way.

99
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,180
This was my fault.

100
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,400
I can resign from my position as the Wan Lu sect leader.

101
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,590
I can leave, too. From now on, the Wan Lu Sect will be your empire.

102
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,060
Fine.

Mo Qing, calm down.

114

You owed me a life.

115

I wanted a life.

116
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,270
You wouldn't give it; I took it myself.

117
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,800
Starting today, all that you owe me,

118
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,080
I'll take them back piece by piece with my own hand.

Why would you kill him?

I will make Li Chenlan lose everything.

Brother Xiao Yi, we can finally go all out. Aren't you happy?

It's not that I'm not happy.

144
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,550
It's that, even though Xiao En died unjustly,

145
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,780
it wasn't worthless.

If I weren't unable to restrain my Demon Essence,

Ah Da wouldn't have been affected.

151

I really shouldn't have let him provoke me.

Mo Qing, you're only under the influence of your inner demon.

153

Gu Hanguang will set out today and go look for your medicine. When he comes back,

everything will be all right.

Palace Leader Shen, lately you've been tiring yourself too much.

156
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,720
Don't do it anymore.

157
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,980
It's not tiring. Look. This is all done.

158
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,180
It seems... it needs to be a little sweeter.

No problem, I'll make one more basket.

It should be all right.

Do you want to make yet another basket?

162
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,860
Hanguang is picky. Of course, I want to make the best.

163
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,160
What did you come for now?

164

In truth, it's for a matter hard to broach.

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,040
Give me three days.

168
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,360
Thank you for your hard choice.

169
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,590
Go back and tell Lu Zhaoyao and Li Chenlan

170
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,880
to wait patiently.

171
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,170
This is the last time. If it ever happens again,

172
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,190
I won't move a finger even if he dies.

173
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,380
All right.

174
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,630
Then... for today, I'll say goodbye.

175
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,330
As you please.

176
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,770
Hanguang.

177
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,560
You succeeded! I'll have a taste.

178
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,340
It's not successful, yet.

179
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,100
This batch... are not sweet enough. I'll make a new batch

180
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,930
and I'll add some sugar before I let you taste them.

181
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,260
If you made them, how could I be picky?

182
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,100
It's precisely because I'm making them for you

183
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,230
that I hope when you try them,

184
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,290
you can get the best taste.

185
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,840
You're still a perfectionist at whatever you do.

186
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,400
Right... In a couple of days,

187
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,290
I'll have to go depart for three days.

188
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,270
Where do you have to go?

189
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,120
To Xu Zong Sect. I'll ask for a medicine for Li Chenlan.

190
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,810
Can you obtain it?

191
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,950
I don't know. But I need to try.

192
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,920
You needn't worry too much. Whether I obtain it or not, I'll be back in two or three days.

193
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,560
Then... you must be careful.

194
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,880
Oh right! Qianjin,

195
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,730
whatever you make for me may be lacking something,

196
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,220
but it can't lack sweetness.

197
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,840
[Xu Zong Sect]

198
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,350
Here.

199
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,370
I heard that you are intending to leave, Jin Xian.

200
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,180
Why is that? Have I been remiss in my hospitality?

201
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,340
Sect Leader Jiang, your hospitality is complete in everything.

202
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,900
Only, I've lingered in Xu Zong Sect for a long time,

203
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,290
but my power is sluggish and can't be recovered.

204
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,610
I'm well aware that you've already done your best, Sect Leader Jiang.

205
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,260
Nevertheless, Jianghu is wide and large.

206
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,730
There may be a solution in some other place.

207
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,220
So, I came here for the purpose of taking leave.

208
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,160
Treatments always require a gradual process.

209
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,370
I still hope, Jin Xian, you won't be too hasty.

210
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,480
At present, the Wan Lu Sect is laying slaughter in Jianghu.

211
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,360
I really have no heart to dwell at ease here in convalescence.

212
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,110
If I can't fight for the people in the world,

213
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,140
what is the point of dragging on such an ignoble existence?

214
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,450
If Jin Xian speaks thusly,

215
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,490
our Xu Zong Sect dares not take such a responsibility.

216
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,960
But if we want to cure Jin Xian's illness quickly, there may be a way.

217
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,610
Only... this way is exceedingly dangerous.

218
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,200
Furthermore, it requires an extremely precious herb.

219
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,630
What herb?

220
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,130
Xu Zong Sect's secret medicine: Rebirth.

221
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:38,870
Sect Leader Jiang, for the people of the world, I'll fear no danger.

222
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,650
Please, Sect Leader Jiang, give me the medicine.

223
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,600
This method's success rate is half and half.

224
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,550
Success is life, failure is death.

225
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,260
Jin Xian, have you thought it through?

226
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,590
Please, Sect Leader Jiang, give me the medicine.

227
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,090
I will not fail Jin Xian's trust.

228
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,100
Master. Jin Xian.

229
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,550
Gu Hanguang from the Wan Lu Sect is seeking an audience.

230
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,660
He's probably here about the medicine contest.

231
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,020
I'll go send him off and be back in a short while.

232
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,580
Thank you for your trouble.

233
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,830
Let's go.

234
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,340
[Tradition of Medicine]

235
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,300
I still remember that year when you were under this plaque,

236
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,110
when you performed the ritual to be apprenticed.

237
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,780
Senior.

238
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:12,970
After so many years, the sect is still the same as before.

239
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,940
The world is forever mutating. There are some changes here, too.

240
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,810
In this year's medicine contest, I noticed you have yet new achievements in the medical art.

241
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,670
It was just a lucky win.

242
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,930
Rather, it was the Rebirth you sent, Senior, that filled me with surprise.

243
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,420
Yes. I can say I managed to grow it.

244
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,370
That's to say, Senior, that you know how to use it?

245
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,600
I haven't yet penetrated its secret. I still don't know how to use it.

246
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,400
This time I came back because I have an unreasonable request.

247
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,360
I want to borrow Rebirth and use it for a time.

248
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,790
Do you still remember the significance Rebirth has for me?

249
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,670
I do.

250
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,970
You do and you still ask to borrow it?

251
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,330
Back then, though I left Xu Zong Sect,

252
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,420
I never forgot my promise to you.

253
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,590
I guarantee I will return a stalk of Rebirth in time

254
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:42,040
and together with you, I'll unlock the mystery of this secret art.

255
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,770
So, coming here this time, I'll still ask you, Senior--

256
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:51,790
Junior, after this long trip, you must be exhausted.

257
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:57,090
Fortunately, I've always kept your room for you through all these years.

258
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,430
Today, the time's getting late. You go get some rest.

259
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,810
For anything, we'll further discuss it on another day.

260
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,880
Who's there?

261
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,590
It's you!

262
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,310
Stop there!

263
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,530
- Master!
- Master!

264
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,530
Senior, it turns out Luo Mingxuan is here with you.

265
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,830
Do you know that he used someone else's blood

266
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,200
to free himself from his seal? After such an act,

267
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,400
you'll still help him?
