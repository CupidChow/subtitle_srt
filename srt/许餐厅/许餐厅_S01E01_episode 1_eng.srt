1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,086
   

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:07,392
   

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:08,630
   

4
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:12,802
   

5
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,320
   

6
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,790
       

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,839
   

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,175
   

9
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,810
   

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,980


11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,982
Hey, Mal Bok, come here.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,010
What is he plotting this time?

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,049
Has that nobleman ever seemed sane to you?

14
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,365
It is strange how he is so close to lowborns.

15
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:12,727
That is what I am saying.

16
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:16,682
Is he really a nobleman from a prestigious family?

17
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:21,842
But he acts no different from Mal Bok.

18
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:24,506
Do not be so quick to judge.

19
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:27,992
Believe it or not, they say he was famous in Hanyang

20
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:30,836
for being bizarrely brilliant.

21
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:34,534
Are you sure they did not mean brilliantly bizarre?

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,650
Mother.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,292
Mother, I need to borrow this.

24
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:43,565
What now?

25
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:45,618
You little rascal, why do you need my skirt?

26
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:46,964
Hurry and bring it back.

27
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:51,277
He said that he would turn your old skirt into a new one!

28
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,810
Now!

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,327
The most important task remains.

30
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,336
- Are you ready? 
 - Yes!

31
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:07,836
Let us go!

32
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:10,876
Come here.

33
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:12,773
Come here.

34
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:15,691
Come over here! Come here!

35
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,491
My goodness! My goodness!

36
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,673
Everyone, look!

37
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,189
   

38
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,950
 Gyosan. 

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,228
 That man is like a fleeting shadow. 

40
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,656
His thoughts stray beyond reason,

41
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,746
and his actions follow no order.

42
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,305
He is like a goblin.

43
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:48,639
But is that not what makes him so charming?

44
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,215
Being free-spirited and relentless, that is.

45
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:55,754
This nation stands upon a traditional order that must be upheld.

46
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:59,431
Yet Gyosan sought to shake that very order to its roots.

47
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:02,690
   

48
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,860
 Your Majesty. 

49
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,532
 To neglect a virtuous and talented man solely because of his illegitimate birth 

50
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:11,018
 is a great loss to the nation. 

51
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,273
 The heavens do not favor noble birth in bestowing talent. 

52
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:19,059
 Yet in this land, only the legitimate sons of noble families may attain office. 

53
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:22,359
 Is it any wonder, then, that we are always in need of capable men? 

54
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:29,726
 I humbly ask that you extend your grace to these gifted illegitimate sons 

55
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:33,345
 so that their abilities may serve the nation to the fullest. 

56
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,470
 As expected, Mae Chang, you are the finest artist in Joseon! 

57
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:46,117
 Come now, let us have another drink. 

58
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,944
 Oh, Gwansong! 

59
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,560
 I have something to discuss with Gyosan. 

60
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,750
 Step outside with me for a moment. 

61
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,579
 Please sit with us. 

62
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,679
 Why not join us in conversation with my friends? 

63
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,572
 I am here to discuss national affairs. 

64
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:14,355
 This is not a discussion to be had with the likes of these illegitimate sons. 

65
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:20,120
 That is too harsh a remark. 

66
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,538
 Is this because of the petition I submitted to His Majesty today? 

67
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:29,533
 Do not waste your time chasing foolish dreams of ever holding office. 

68
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,893
 The traditional order of this land 

69
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:34,856
 will not be so easily undone. 

70
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,274
 I see it differently. 

71
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,302
 Should we not reform outdated traditions as times change? 

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,487
Did you not see it yourself that day?

73
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,387
The way Gyosan defied this nation's order?

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,002
Yet you know as well as I do

75
00:04:56,002 --> 00:05:00,132
that he is too brilliant to waste away in a place like this.

76
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:03,093
I, too, value Gyosan's talent.

77
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:07,381
That is why I sent him here.

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,272
When this horse first came to me,

79
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,465
it was impossible for any man to tame him.

80
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,920
He was no different from a wild horse,

81
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,180
but I made him obedient.

82
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,331
How did you manage to tame him?

83
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,767
I taught him a lesson.

84
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:33,260
One does not recklessly defy the world

85
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,036
without consequences.

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,797
Gyosan is a wise man.

87
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:04,421
By now, he must have understood.

88
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:07,204
I would like to believe so...

89
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,295
Inspector General!

90
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:22,793
To have you grace this humble and distant place is an honor beyond words.

91
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:27,885
We gathered renowned bondmaids to prepare a banquet for you to unwind...

92
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,667
I did not realize you had company.

93
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,594
I shall make arrangements so that the two of you may rest in private.

94
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:42,396
That will not be necessary.

95
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:44,196
More importantly...

96
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:49,339
There is something I wish to see at once.

97
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,861
If you sell these, you will have enough to afford a new skirt.

98
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:03,828
Oh my, you caught this many in such a short time?

99
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,958
There are more.

100
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,739
Share them with the villagers so that everyone can enjoy.

101
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:19,479
A nice, hot fish soup would be refreshing and delicious.

102
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,509
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,075
We should grill them! They are fresh!

104
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:26,507
Wait!

105
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:31,717
I know a recipe from my younger days.

106
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,112
So delicious, you would not notice if the person next to you dropped dead!

107
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:44,008
 First, scale the crucian carp, remove the bones and entrails, 

108
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:46,381
 and soak it in saltwater. 

109
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,848
 Soak dried radish greens in water, chop them finely, 

110
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:55,129
 and season with soy sauce, ginger, and sesame oil 

111
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,449
 before stuffing them inside the fish. 

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,819
 Then, blend a ripe pumpkin into a puree and pour it over the fish. 

113
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,919
 The salty greens and the pumpkin's natural sweetness create the perfect harmony. 

114
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:09,250
 Finally, steam it over boiling water. 

115
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,871
Goodness, this is unbelievably delicious!

116
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:16,447
I have never tasted anything like this before.

117
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:21,724
Amazing, amazing! Is this really the same crucian carp I know?

118
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,270
Because of the sweet pumpkin, it melts in your mouth.

119
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:34,283
According to the memory of this Transcendent Genius,

120
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:37,045
topping the fish with egg and beef garnish

121
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:40,288
would make the flavors even richer.

122
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:43,552
But those are hard to find here...

123
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:46,650
This should be delicious enough, so enjoy!

124
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,893
I have heard he shares a deep connection with Your Excellency.

125
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:11,666
I have ensured there will be no discomfort in his stay.

126
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:21,128
Are you confessing that you have been conspiring with an exiled criminal?

127
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,633
That is not what I meant.

128
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,330
Or...

129
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:30,566
Are you admitting your own incompetence in failing to control a criminal?

130
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:33,631
Your Excellency, I have committed an unforgivable mistake.

131
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:36,254
It was my poor judgment...

132
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,863
 Enjoy the food, everyone. 

133
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,407
It would be nice if we could all eat together,

134
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,703
but since you always keep to yourselves, I brought some over.

135
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:55,363
It tastes quite decent, so go ahead and try it.

136
00:09:55,363 --> 00:10:00,321
Look at you, pitying others when you cannot even see your own fate.

137
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:03,779
I am just sharing good food.

138
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,315
Why go for the sore spot?

139
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,480
But you are right.

140
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,108
Given my situation, who am I to pity anyone?

141
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,936
So this is not pity. It is just a small treat.

142
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:20,636
Satisfied?

143
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:29,859
You do not even realize your own life is hanging by a thread.

144
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,987
What do you mean?

145
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:43,937
What did you just say about my life?

146
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,119
Sir!

147
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:51,021
Do not waste your time talking to that madman! He is a terrible old man.

148
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:55,627
That is right! Stay near him too long, and misfortune is bound to follow.

149
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:57,987
Do not mind him and join us instead.

150
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,799
I will admit it is not bad.

151
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,900
Consider yourself lucky.

152
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,070
This mere treat just saved your life.

153
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,101
Oh! Magistrate!

154
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:31,001
What brings you here?

155
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:38,326
Arrest the criminal, Heo Gyun!

156
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:46,803
Whoa, Magistrate, what is all this about?

157
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,461
Are you upset because we did not share the good food with you?

158
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:52,218
I will catch more and cook for you, so...

159
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:54,456
From this moment forward!

160
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:58,003
Sinner Heo Gyun will be enclosed in a thorn hedge.

161
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:02,339
   

162
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:12,504
Bear in mind! Heo Gyun is forbidden from stepping even a foot outside his dwelling!

163
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,255
Whoa there!

164
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:35,435
My foot has not even touched the ground yet.

165
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,146
You almost stabbed me!

166
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,907
You are surprisingly quick.

167
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,394
I already feel suffocated.

168
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:04,929
How much longer must I stay trapped in here?

169
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,267
With your temperament, I doubt you will last even three days.

170
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,133
Oh, Gwansong!

171
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:20,398
Had I known you were coming, I would have gone to greet you.

172
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,128
Oh, wait.

173
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,168
I cannot go outside.

174
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:38,051
You have not changed. Still as lighthearted as ever.

175
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,779
I have missed you terribly.

176
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,571
You look even more dashing than when I last saw you.

177
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:49,614
Oh, how dazzling! My eyes, my eyes!

178
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,874
Oh, come on now...

179
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:57,582
Just look at yourself.

180
00:13:57,582 --> 00:14:02,388
A man as full of life as you, wasting away for the rest of his days

181
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:05,779
locked in a house without even a single window?

182
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:09,437
But what choice do I have?

183
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:12,278
Until His Majesty calls for me...

184
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:14,192
In other words,

185
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:19,135
it will be resolved if His Majesty summons you.

186
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,049
Did he ask for me?

187
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:26,451
Not yet.

188
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:33,646
But you can make him.

189
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:39,240
If you become someone His Majesty cannot do without...

190
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,496
Then, he will call for me.

191
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:48,259
Tell me, what does His Majesty need?

192
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,599
I will do whatever it takes! Anything!

193
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,502
You are not serious, are you?

194
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:10,315
Have I ever been anything but serious?

195
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:14,195
It is just... too absurd to believe.

196
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:17,835
Did you think becoming someone His Majesty needs

197
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,715
would be easy?

198
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:24,200
It is not about whether it is easy or difficult.

199
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,375
I cannot bring myself to commit an act that defies morality.

200
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:35,057
Then... are you content to live like this for the rest of your days?

201
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:39,987
Even if I were to leave this place by such means,

202
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,899
would I truly be free?

203
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,579
Who dares come here?

204
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:57,124
Please, calm down.

205
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,743
They are my friends, the ones who have helped me through exile.

206
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,258
You have not changed one bit.

207
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,938
In Hanyang, you wasted your time with illegitimate sons, and now...

208
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:14,308
you surround yourself with lowborns?

209
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,453
Even in exile, you refuse to come to your senses!

210
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:24,692
Do you not know that loitering near

211
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,932
the house enclosed in a thorn hedge is punishable by flogging?

212
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:33,760
Gwansong, they are just children.

213
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,892
I will speak to them and make sure they never return.

214
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:40,129
Please, just this once.

215
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,550
And yet you think you are in a position

216
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:49,063
to worry about those lowborns?

217
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:58,702
You will regret

218
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,913
turning down my offer for the rest of your life.

219
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:21,309
You little rascals! Did you miss me that much?

220
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:26,368
Oh, the price of fame...

221
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,054
But still, you must not come here anymore.

222
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:35,053
But you promised you would tell us a fun story at dusk!

223
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:38,584
Oh, that is right!

224
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:44,756
Well then, I should finish the story today.

225
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,277
Now, where did I leave off?

226
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:49,231
Right when Hong Gil Dong made a scarecrow out of straw

227
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:51,680
and tricked the Commissioner General!

228
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,360
Right.

229
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:04,271
Oh, yes! And so, Gil Dong rebuked the General, saying,

230
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,085
"You insolent wretch!

231
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,677
You know full well what you have done!"

232
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:10,222
Not you...

233
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,412
Gil Dong said that, not me.

234
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:19,667
"You brute! Being big does not mean you can do whatever you want!"

235
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,167
No, no!

236
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,199
To the Commissioner General, not you.

237
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:35,942
You have returned.

238
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,927
How did it go?

239
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,585
Is Gyosan safe and sound?

240
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:46,720
He is coming back to Hanyang with us now, is he not?

241
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,653
It was a waste of time.

242
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:51,245
I entertained a foolish hope.

243
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:55,406
We leave at first light. Prepare yourself!

244
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:57,503
Please.

245
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,568
Let me speak with him, Your Excellency.

246
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,600
Gyosan is a man who easily loses all reason when it comes to women,

247
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,883
but this is not something for you to meddle in, Mae Chang.

248
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,418
Please, just give me a chance.

249
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:17,580
Gyosan and I have been close friends for years.

250
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,298
If anyone can persuade him, it is me.

251
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:21,998
Friends?

252
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:27,652
Why is it that everyone Gyosan surrounds himself with is so...

253
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,014
completely useless?

254
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:34,921
The fool does not even realize what he has.

255
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,819
He always said

256
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,525
that every person holds value, a gift bestowed upon them by the heavens.

257
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:54,586
And that is precisely the kind of reckless thinking that led him here.

258
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:59,770
If exile has not taught him his lesson,

259
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:07,171
then I have no choice but to prescribe something far stronger.

260
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,371
When Gil Dong used his shapeshifting skills to turn into a tree,

261
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:20,652
he stood right before his pursuers, yet no one could find him.

262
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,087
Whoosh!

263
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:27,487
And when he fled, he covered vast distances in the blink of an eye.

264
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:29,458
How is that?

265
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,418
You cannot see my feet, is that so?

266
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,306
Then, one fateful night,

267
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:44,571
as Hong Gil Dong gazed at the night sky,

268
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:49,390
a shooting star streaked across!

269
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,944
The moment he saw it, he knew

270
00:20:56,357 --> 00:21:00,160
his father had passed away.

271
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:05,442
Though he was never allowed to call him "Father,"

272
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:10,193
he swore, through tears, to fulfill his final duty as a son.

273
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:26,797
After mourning for three years, Hong Gil Dong led his men to a land called Yuldoguk,

274
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:29,739
where they would make a new home.

275
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:31,147
Why?

276
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:32,551
Why, you ask?

277
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:36,984
Because... Yuldoguk was a land like no other.

278
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,771
What makes it so special?

279
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:42,808
Well... it was like paradise itself.

280
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:45,293
What is paradise?

281
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:47,205
How should I put it...

282
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:53,436
A place where there is no difference between high and lowborns,

283
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:59,891
where food is abundant so that no one goes hungry,

284
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,424
where the landscapes are as breathtaking as a painted folding screen.

285
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,403
So, Yuldoguk is a place that...

286
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:15,240
that is...

287
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,773
never mind!

288
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,603
I shall write the rest down for you!

289
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:24,122
But we do not know how to read.

290
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,054
You know how to read, do you not?

291
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,068
Ask that man to read it for you.

292
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:41,800
Can you not just keep telling the story?

293
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:44,834
I cannot.

294
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,220
If you keep coming here, you might end up getting flogged.

295
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:58,204
But if you really, really insist...

296
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,896
Guess they are more afraid of flogging.

297
00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:15,984
Yuldoguk...

298
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:18,465
Yuldoguk...

299
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:24,364
How could the imagination of this Transcendent Genius hit a wall?

300
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:29,818
This is all because my stomach is empty.

301
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:39,056
 In Yuldoguk, vast fertile fields stretch beyond the horizon... 

302
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:42,779
 From their rich soil, the finest white rice is harvested, 

303
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,419
 steamed to perfection, and served with a tender skewer of grilled meat... 

304
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:52,804
Wait, what am I even writing?

305
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,716
Again!

306
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:58,871
 In the lands of Yuldoguk, conquered by Hong Gil Dong, 

307
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:04,596
 vibrant flowers bloom and sweet birds sing in the mountains... 

308
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:08,016
 Pluck that bird's neck, skewer it, 

309
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:10,072
 season it with salt, and roast it over glowing charcoal... 

310
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:12,912
 So delicious, you would scorch your mouth and still keep eating! 

311
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:36,462
I should have kept that braised fish for myself instead of giving it away!

312
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:42,546
Look at you, pitying others when you cannot even see your own fate.

313
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:54,714
If I cannot stop thinking about food, I might as well write down every dish I crave!

314
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,419
Deliver this letter.

315
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:12,919
Yes, My Lord.

316
00:25:23,382 --> 00:25:25,088
What?

317
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,135
I would like to take a look at that letter.

318
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,927
You cannot.

319
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,132
If he finds out, I will be severely punished.

320
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:36,060
But would the punishment not be even worse

321
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,170
if he knew that you have been using his name

322
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,607
to slip in and out of courtesan houses?

323
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,632
Show me.

324
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:49,085
It will be fine as long as we keep this between us.

325
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,173
Shh.

326
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:03,531
   

327
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:07,805
   

328
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:14,661
Unbelievable!

329
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,625
I never realized there were so many things I desired to eat.

330
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:30,498
Well, given all the meals I have missed during exile, it is no surprise.

331
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:39,189
I shall capture how people gnaw on nothing but air while staring at a butcher's gate

332
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:42,629
to suppress their craving for meat

333
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:46,241
and name this book "Domundaejak."

334
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:51,800
   
 (T/N: The Great Work of Moral Principles) 

335
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:32,993
Is someone there?

336
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,393
A ghost?

337
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,188
It is Mae Chang, My Lord.

338
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,755
Mae Chang?

339
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:24,184
Is it truly you, Mae Chang?

340
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:31,890
Yes, it is me.

341
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,600
What dream did I have last night

342
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,110
to be blessed with so many familiar faces today?

343
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,016
But the guards must have been watching.

344
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:54,215
I found a way to distract them for a moment.

345
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:57,598
Then come inside.

346
00:28:57,598 --> 00:29:00,140
We shall speak of all that has passed.

347
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:05,407
I wish we could, but now is not the time.

348
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,740
The Inspector General was here, was he not?

349
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,708
And how would you know that?

350
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,556
You must listen to his request, My Lord.

351
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,431
Did Gwansong send you?

352
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,118
To persuade me?

353
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:25,868
No, I slipped away unnoticed.

354
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:30,150
Do not press me for answers. Just heed my words.

355
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,140
I cannot.

356
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,593
I refuse to even consider it,

357
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:37,451
so do not speak of it again.

358
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,610
But if you refuse now...

359
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,446
I know.

360
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:46,652
I will live out my days trapped within these walls.

361
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,490
I have accepted my fate.

362
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,970
Now leave.

363
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,939
And if that is all you have to say, do not return.

364
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:58,858
My Lord, your friends are in danger.

365
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,485
The seven illegitimate sons you cherish! They are in grave danger.

366
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:06,934
What did you say?

367
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:09,494
My friends? In danger?

368
00:30:09,494 --> 00:30:11,777
You know better than anyone

369
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:15,190
that once the Inspector General sets his mind on something,

370
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,790
he does not relent.

371
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:22,149
If you refuse, he will not waver.

372
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:24,582
He will simply use your friends instead.

373
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:27,930
That is not something my friends can do.

374
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,565
Are you saying

375
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:33,981
he is plotting something against them?

376
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:37,785
No, he would never.

377
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:42,393
But I saw it with my own eyes.

378
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:45,225
The letter written in his own hand.

379
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,533
My Lord!

380
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,065
My Lord!

381
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,983
My Lord!

382
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,813
 Does he mean to achieve his will 

383
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:11,711
 by sacrificing my friends instead? 

384
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,488
 It is my fault. 

385
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:17,008
 I rejected his offer, and now my friends... 

386
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:24,120
Your Excellency!

387
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,127
Heo Gyun escaped his dwelling.

388
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:29,056
What nonsense is this?

389
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:32,373
How could you have let this happen?

390
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:35,549
Bring her!

391
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,658
I only did as you wished.

392
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:55,141
I tried to change Gyosan's mind.

393
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:59,317
And so, I told him about the letter.

394
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,200
You fool...

395
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,031
Do you realize what you have done?

396
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:09,310
You have killed Gyosan.

397
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,259
I beg your pardon.

398
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:14,545
Killed him?

399
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:19,022
Now that Gyosan knows my plans, he cannot be allowed to live.

400
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,572
So tell me,

401
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:24,524
did you not kill him yourself?

402
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,593
I was blind to the consequences.

403
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,393
Please, I beg you, abandon this course.

404
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,552
You should worry about your own life.

405
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,430
Your Excellency.

406
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,880
We searched the entire village,

407
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,040
but he is already gone.

408
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,718
Shall I request cooperation from the neighboring villages?

409
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:56,142
No need.

410
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:59,185
He is heading for Hanyang.

411
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,820
All we need to do is block his path.

412
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,463
I have a trusted swordsman waiting ahead.

413
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,822
Words reach me soon enough.

414
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:38,172
Had I not been starving, I would have crossed this hill in half an hour.

415
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,828
You would not happen to have a rice ball, would you?

416
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:45,308
They say even ghosts look better when they have died on a full stomach.

417
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:48,743
Have a little mercy on a dying man.

418
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,401
Do not underestimate me. I once practiced the sword myself!

419
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,458
Let us see what you have got!

420
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:11,509
Check him.

421
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:22,330
Oh?

422
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:31,454
So books really are mightier than swords!

423
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:43,207
I take it Gwansong was the one who ordered my death.

424
00:35:44,148 --> 00:35:46,021
Tell him

425
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:49,775
that I accept my fate without resentment.

426
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:53,736
But in return, I ask that my innocent friends be spared.

427
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,788
Will you deliver that message?

428
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:04,782
I will. Now, it is time to go.

429
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,500
Go and stop him!

430
00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:25,560
You do not need to kill him!

431
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,944
Run now!

432
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,118
It is time to end this.

433
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,798
 I want to disappear. 

434
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:05,999
 I want to vanish. 

435
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,381
 Sink right into the ground and be gone. 

436
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,170
If things ever get tough, you can always speak to me.

437
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,636
You know where my office is, right?

438
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:22,216
Or what are you up to this weekend?

439
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:24,780
Where did you say you live?

440
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:28,932
Not too far from work, I hope?

441
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:32,320
 Don't do it, Eun Sil. 

442
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,529
 You already know how this ends. 

443
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,086
 Standing up to power and exposing corruption 

444
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:40,162
 will only get you fired, not those bastards. 

445
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,198
Drink up, up, up!

446
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:45,445
 Hold it in. 

447
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,900
 You have to... 

448
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,218
 hold yourself back. 

449
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:52,592
 Stay quiet, Bong Eun Sil. 

450
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,976
What the?

451
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,635
This is too good to keep to myself,

452
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:06,096
so I figured I'd capture the moment to remember the company dinner.

453
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:10,580
Sir, you look terrible right now. Smile!

454
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,060
Have you lost your mind?

455
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,212
Hey, turn the music off. Hey!

456
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,563
Turn off that music.

457
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:21,321
- Give me that! 
 - I can't!

458
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:24,421
I still have 20 months left on the payments, so it's practically brand new.

459
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,951
Don't you know who I am?

460
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:31,562
Of course I know who you are.

461
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,011
You're the CEO's one-and-only brother.

462
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,901
The almighty No. 2 of our company, Director Ko.

463
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,128
That's why even now you still get away with harassing female employees.

464
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:45,454
Do you have a death wish or something?

465
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:48,768
I very much want to live.

466
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:50,828
But if I have to go down...

467
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,679
I'm not going alone.

468
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,953
You're coming with me, Director.

469
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:14,248
Darn it.

470
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,793
 I'm doomed. 

471
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,873
 Thanks to you, My Lord, we are eating well today. 

472
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:42,056
 Gwansong! 

473
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:43,756
 How is that? 

474
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,853
 I remember falling asleep while writing... 

475
00:39:56,845 --> 00:39:59,314
 But where am I? 

476
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,930
No! My topknot!

477
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,099
Where did my topknot go?

478
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,178
What misfortune is this?

479
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:21,390
What on earth happened while I was asleep?

480
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:29,253
 A wretched world. 

481
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,652
 What the? 

482
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,071
Mister, you can't just sleep here like this.

483
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:50,111
Bong Eun Sil, mind your business!

484
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,901
Okay, stop being nosy!

485
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:54,733
Excuse me, young lady!

486
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:58,471
Where is this place?

487
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:00,906
You want to know where we are?

488
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:05,098
This is hell.

489
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,091
A living hell.

490
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,891
Hell?

491
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:13,183
Then, am I dead?

492
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,349
I got fired today, too.

493
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:22,576
Were you burnt at the stake?

494
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:27,723
But then, I... I have no idea why I have died.

495
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,397
Did I starve to death?

496
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:35,823
Mister.

497
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:39,263
In our next life,

498
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:43,088
let's be reborn as a CEO's little brother.

499
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:45,190
Promise.

500
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:48,934
If you're drunk, just come home quietly instead of making a fuss!

501
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:50,081
Go inside!

502
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:51,594
That was delicious.

503
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,454
Thanks, take care.

504
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,454
Excuse me!

505
00:41:56,221 --> 00:42:01,193
This is my first time in the afterlife, so forgive my boldness.

506
00:42:01,193 --> 00:42:03,481
Could you spare some food?

507
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:07,038
We're closed for today. Come back in the morning.

508
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:08,957
Madam, please!

509
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,729
Take your time eating.

510
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:29,480
I won't close up until you finish.

511
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,401
Thank you.

512
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,772
Your hair is in the way.

513
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:44,278
Try tying it back with this.

514
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:05,890
Hunger makes the best seasoning, but this is beyond amazing!

515
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,420
People might come to the afterlife just to eat this!

516
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,566
You're quite witty.

517
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:13,128
Are you a comedian?

518
00:43:13,128 --> 00:43:15,247
You surely look like one.

519
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:18,004
Gomedwian?

520
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:21,716
Is there such a public post in Joseon? I have never heard of it.

521
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:25,320
Mom, water.

522
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,464
Get it yourself!

523
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,344
Would you like some more kkakdugi? 
  (T/N: cubed radish kimchi) 

524
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:33,681
Ugh, my head...

525
00:43:51,681 --> 00:43:54,223
You are awake, my fellow afterlife traveler.

526
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:56,226
What fellow traveler?

527
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:58,507
Did you not say it earlier?

528
00:43:59,657 --> 00:44:01,457
That you got fired.

529
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:06,035
Keep it down! Mom will kill me if she finds out.

530
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:09,181
Are you not already dead?

531
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:14,542
Mister, do you even have money?

532
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,781
For the meal, do you?

533
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,957
I usually keep some coins right here...

534
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:31,264
I knew it.

535
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:34,447
You're obviously homeless.

536
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:41,339
No kkakdugi for you! Mom, this guy has no money.

537
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,183
Just eat. Don't worry about the money.

538
00:44:45,145 --> 00:44:47,199
Are we running a charity here?

539
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,337
This guy doesn't pay because he's broke.

540
00:44:49,337 --> 00:44:51,966
That guy eats for free because he's sick.

541
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:56,208
And that's why, no matter how hard you work, you never save a dime.

542
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,979
You talk like you run the place,

543
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,176
but you don't lift a finger, so stay out of it.

544
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:06,564
I'll run the restaurant. You just focus on keeping your job.

545
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:11,695
Don't mind her, just eat.

546
00:45:19,002 --> 00:45:24,365
Serving a warm meal to someone hungry is a good deed.

547
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:26,931
Yeah, yeah, I've heard that one before.

548
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:30,515
I'm going to run this place till I drop.

549
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:33,192
Ugh, my head…

550
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:36,228
If I may ask...

551
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:40,267
why do you two keep talking about life and death?

552
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:42,440
Can one even die twice?

553
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,881
I have not died before, but I surely feel as if I have.

554
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,830
So this is what being alive feels like.

555
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,347
I feel as if I could do anything!

556
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,852
Wow, he's completely lost it.

557
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,584
I may have nothing right now,

558
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:08,295
but I will return to repay the cost of this meal.

559
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:10,187
Until then...

560
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:16,005
Keep this as collateral.

561
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:19,236
I said you don't need to pay.

562
00:46:19,828 --> 00:46:21,628
Just take it.

563
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:26,103
Do you have a place to stay?

564
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:31,897
A man does not die just because he sleeps under the stars.

565
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,137
Many a time, I spent the night like that on my way to the state examination.

566
00:46:36,137 --> 00:46:38,500
State examinations...

567
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,300
Then...

568
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:48,281
Wow, he's really deep in character.

569
00:46:51,404 --> 00:46:53,204
Go inside.

570
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,750
 Incredible. 

571
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,286
 Houses towering higher than mountains... 

572
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,889
 Carriages swifter than horses... 

573
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:29,162
This place...

574
00:47:30,124 --> 00:47:32,308
This is not Joseon!

575
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:40,463
 They speak the tongue of Joseon yet wear foreign clothes. 

576
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:45,266
 Men and women mingle freely, without restraint. 

577
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:49,292
 Food is plentiful, and no one starves. 

578
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,240
This must be

579
00:47:53,991 --> 00:47:57,586
the Yuldoguk I dreamed of!

580
00:47:58,238 --> 00:48:00,992
Yuldoguk is real!

581
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:05,771
No, that cannot be...

582
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:07,859
   

583
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,676
   

584
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:11,987
Gwansong?

585
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:47,789
I'm sorry, Ms. Bong.

586
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:49,960
Because of me...

587
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,298
You're severely mistaken.

588
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,701
Do you think I did it for you?

589
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:58,097
It was for my own peace of mind.

590
00:48:58,097 --> 00:49:00,151
But still...

591
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:05,719
you should express yourself firmly.

592
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:10,468
Director Ko only preys on those who won't push back.

593
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:15,129
Ji Eun, about what I asked earlier.

594
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:16,969
You should get going.

595
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:29,697
Even while getting fired, I still can't mind my own business.

596
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,220
   

597
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,020
Hello.

598
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:50,035
Chef Lee Hyuk?

599
00:49:50,035 --> 00:49:52,646
Hello.

600
00:49:52,646 --> 00:49:55,160
You look even better in person.

601
00:49:57,017 --> 00:49:59,180
I've seen you a lot on TV.

602
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,906
Thank you.

603
00:50:00,906 --> 00:50:03,926
You must be the daughter of the diner owner, right?

604
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,700
Do you know me?

605
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,555
Of course, we're neighbors.

606
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,573
"We?"

607
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:17,603
Oh, do you have some time to spare?

608
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,600
Of course!

609
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:22,403
Please come inside.

610
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,348
Why is everything so expensive?

611
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:55,893
It's an appetizer made with truffles and sea bream.

612
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:57,490
Do you eat raw fish?

613
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,335
Only when I can get my hands on it.

614
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:04,902
But why all this for me?

615
00:51:04,902 --> 00:51:09,819
I've always wanted to serve my food to my neighbors at least once.

616
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:13,077
Wow, how thoughtful of you.

617
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:25,468
This is incredible.

618
00:51:25,468 --> 00:51:27,390
Does it suit your taste?

619
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,438
It's so refined.

620
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:31,948
A whole different level from diner food.

621
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,183
Not that I should be saying this...

622
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:40,726
Speaking of which...

623
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:44,774
I actually have some questions about your mother's place.

624
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:54,785
- Excuse me, may I ask you something? 
 - Yes?

625
00:51:54,785 --> 00:51:58,294
Do you know what "Dorae" is?

626
00:51:58,294 --> 00:52:00,162
Over there.

627
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:10,548
   

628
00:52:10,548 --> 00:52:12,556
Gwansong!

629
00:52:12,556 --> 00:52:14,968
I have come to the right place.

630
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,934
I never thought I would find Gwansong in Yuldoguk.

631
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:22,008
Oh, don't even get me started.

632
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:25,073
Can you believe it's only 5,000 won in this economy? Just 5,000 won!

633
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:28,317
We barely make 500 won per serving,

634
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:32,935
and on top of that, my mom keeps finding excuses to give meals away for free.

635
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:35,707
The more we sell, the deeper we sink into the red.

636
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:41,236
Why does your mother insist on continuing this profitless and tough business?

637
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:43,120
I have no clue!

638
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,781
I've been nagging her to close it down,

639
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:51,573
but my mom said she'll run the business till she drops.

640
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:53,713
She's unstoppable.

641
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,513
I see.

642
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:59,328
 Hello there. 

643
00:53:03,087 --> 00:53:05,730
Hello there.

644
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:09,139
Is anyone inside?

645
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,039
Hello there!

646
00:53:16,754 --> 00:53:19,027
- Who— 
 - Gwansong!

647
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:22,706
Why are you here again?

648
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:25,753
Don't be rude to the chef!

649
00:53:25,753 --> 00:53:28,761
Are you okay?

650
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:31,866
I'm okay.

651
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:35,189
Do you know him?

652
00:53:35,189 --> 00:53:36,768
Know him?

653
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:40,396
He ate at our place yesterday,

654
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:42,436
but he seems mentally unwell...

655
00:53:43,142 --> 00:53:46,476
Wait, you are the lady from last night...

656
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:53,480
Does this mean I have returned to last night's tavern?

657
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,660
What's he on about?

658
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:02,080


659
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,080

00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:25,240
♫  Only you, oh, only you  ♫ 
 ♫  So with you  ♫

664
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,430
♫  If I'm with you  ♫

665
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,430
♫  I'm happy no matter when  ♫

666
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:37,830
♫  With the pouring sunlight dazzling on you  ♫

667
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:42,700
♫  I will love you forever  ♫

668
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,990
♫  One, two, three, four, I hold your hand  ♫

669
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:51,720
♫  Five, six, our eyes meet  ♫

670
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,700
♫  Seven, eight, nine, ten, I only see you  ♫
