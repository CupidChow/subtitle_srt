1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,986
   

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:07,495
   

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:08,552
   

4
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:11,551
   

5
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,015
   

6
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,710
       

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,820


8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,739
   

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,675
   

10
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,810
   

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,550
   

12
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:39,206
Not bad for just four hours of work.

13
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,189
Should I expand the business?

14
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:46,428
   
   

15
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:57,913
This will be a franchise in no time.

16
00:00:57,913 --> 00:00:59,722
Oh, please...

17
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,122
I only have 33 locations so far.

18
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:03,959
33?

19
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:06,461
- Look over here, please. 
 - Perfect.

20
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,779
One more over here.

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,502
This wasn't my original plan, but now that I've started...

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,799
I might as well turn it into a franchise.

23
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,643
"How to turn your diner into a goldmine."

24
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:44,687
What's this?

25
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:00,342
Hello!

26
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:04,633
Do you want some grilled mackerel?

27
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:10,520
Why on earth... are you grilling mackerels on the street?

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,354
The whole neighborhood reeks of fish!

29
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:17,742
Mackerel is best when grilled over charcoal.

30
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:21,862
But since houses here don't have chimneys, this is my only option.

31
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:27,447
You seem pretty skilled at cooking.

32
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,692
Did you cook before coming here?

33
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,798
Not at all.

34
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:37,025
I only set foot in a kitchen for the first time a few days ago.

35
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,310
   

36
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:44,583
And she left the kitchen in his hands?

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,696
Unbelievable...

38
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:51,722
I may not have hands-on experience,

39
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:55,207
but I've traveled across the country tasting and recording all kinds of delicacies.

40
00:02:55,928 --> 00:03:01,512
In fact, as a Transcendent Genius, I can perfectly recreate anything I've tasted before.

41
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,440
Hello?

42
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,332
I must say,

43
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,845
Gwansong is truly a man of virtue.

44
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:28,742
He must have noticed I was busy and left without a word.

45
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,507
Such thoughtfulness...

46
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,349
Tonight, I must finish the conversation I could not earlier.

47
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,748
I knew this would happen!

48
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,489
Mr. Lee! Where's Mr. Lee?

49
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,430
He left this mess and won't even answer his phone?

50
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:49,664
Mister! Mr. Homeless!

51
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,023
Come with me.

52
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,506
You can't go there right now.

53
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,006
But he seems to be in trouble.

54
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:57,830
Should I not go help him?

55
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,198
Read the room!

56
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,804
This isn't something you can help with.

57
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,024
But...

58
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:06,964
   

59
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,120
Wait, Mae Chang!

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,550
Why is she inside such a tiny box?

61
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:14,605
I mean...

62
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:17,070
this must be another one of your advanced inventions.

63
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,991
I, the Transcendent Genius, have mastered this as well.

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,919
I just found out while browsing online.

65
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,980
Something major happened at Dorae.

66
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:35,870
But then, what is Mae Chang eating at this late hour?

67
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:39,466
Tell her to come out and speak with me.

68
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,140
This isn't happening right now.

69
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,770
This was recorded earlier today.

70
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,464
How dare you?

71
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:52,114
How dare you mock me for struggling with modern inventions?

72
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:56,744
Mae Chang is right here before my eyes.

73
00:04:57,284 --> 00:05:00,524
How can you claim this happened during the day? Enough!

74
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:04,269
 ...right here before my eyes... 

75
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,597
 How can you claim this happened during the day? Enough! 

76
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,976
What?

77
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,115
Wait, this...

78
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,128
 ...for struggling with modern inventions? 

79
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,203
 Mae Chang is right here before my eyes. 

80
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:18,576
 How can you claim this happened during the day? Enough!  

81
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,119
How marvelous!

82
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,421
So my past can be trapped inside this?

83
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:28,977
Come on out.

84
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,677
What's your plan now?

85
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:37,327
Rumors are already spreading outside that you used subpar ingredients.

86
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,915
We paid a fortune for this ad campaign, and you trashed the brand image!

87
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:45,317
Are you out of your mind, Mr. Lee?

88
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:49,143
It was an accident.

89
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:52,093
The food was perfectly fine.

90
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,449
You all know that.

91
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,689
And what good does that do us? The damage is already done!

92
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:01,918
Rumors can be corrected.

93
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,939
Forget it. I want my investment back.

94
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,983
Is that how all of you feel?

95
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,303
Very well.

96
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:33,590
Leave me your account details, and I'll return your investment.

97
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:41,020
But there will be no reinvestments.

98
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:46,865
This will be resolved by tomorrow, so if you pull out now...

99
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,067
don't expect to come back.

100
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,944
Tomorrow?

101
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,330
How?

102
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,925
Wait and see for yourselves.

103
00:06:55,471 --> 00:07:00,281
That is... if you're still investors by then.

104
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:25,030
   
   

105
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,800
Hello!

106
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,666
Why do things keep going wrong?

107
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,720
I told him to throw it away!

108
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:24,384
So you are saying what happened to Mae Chang earlier is captured here?

109
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:25,891
Yes.

110
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:31,196
She ate Chef Lee's food and threw up right in front of everyone watching.

111
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,533
No wonder. The usually gentle Chef Lee seemed to be on edge.

112
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,190
Mister, just stay out of his way for now.

113
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,737
He's already got enough on his plate, so don't make it worse.

114
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:50,366
I am not bothering him.

115
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,522
I simply wish to have a conversation.

116
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:55,630
That is bothering him.

117
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,998
   
   

118
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,979
But wait, look at these comments!

119
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,069
What?

120
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:12,358
"Junk food for 300,000 won?"

121
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:15,017
"We demand truth from Lee Hyuk..."

122
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:19,459
What do they know about the chef?

123
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:23,068
Haters, you're all doomed.

124
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
What are you doing?

125
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,852
Isn't it obvious? I'm protecting Chef Lee.

126
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:34,211
Doesn't look that way to me...

127
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:39,963
- It looks like you'll break something... 
 - Don't distract me, mister. You're confusing me.

128
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:47,489
I just hope Mae Chang is okay...

129
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:50,087
She looked extremely distressed earlier.

130
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,164
Mi Sol!

131
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:58,482
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,418
I should have checked on you first.

133
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:05,169
You must be having the hardest time.

134
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,961
Why are you being so loud in the middle of the night?

135
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:14,364
Mi Sol! Were you... asleep?

136
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,105
Of course I was. What else would I be doing at this hour?

137
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,647
How can you even sleep after what happened?

138
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:29,166
And what exactly changes if I stay awake?

139
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,135
Then, do you want me to stay up and suffer?

140
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,467
No, that's not what I mean...

141
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,695
Aren't you at least worried about the situation?

142
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,101
Why wouldn't I be?

143
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:42,374
I threw up on a live broadcast!

144
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:45,519
That clip is going to haunt me forever.

145
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,545
I already have enough memes about my poor acting.

146
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,851
That's not the problem right now.

147
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,569
Our CEO nearly had a stroke over this.

148
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,632
If Chef Lee sues us for damages, the whole company's screwed.

149
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,739
I've told you so many times. I didn't want to do this.

150
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:02,921
It was Chef Lee who forced it through.

151
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:06,074
If anyone, I should be the one suing for damages!

152
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:09,573
Wait, it's Chef Lee.

153
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,306
Give it to me.

154
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:13,570
What are you going to say? Don't make this worse.

155
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,920
Relax.

156
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:20,839
Hello?

157
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,178
This is Lee Hyuk.

158
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:27,505
I called to settle the issue regarding the advertisement.

159
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:31,603
Look, Chef Lee!

160
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,744
Chef Lee.

161
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:38,562
I did nothing wrong.

162
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:44,201
You're the one who changed the concept at the last minute.

163
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,984
So why am I the one paying for it?

164
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,686
Sue me if you want!

165
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:55,327
 I have no intention of suing you. 

166
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,484
But we should meet.

167
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,924
We need to settle this properly, don't we?

168
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,338
Young lady!

169
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,208
- Young lady! 
 - Yes?

170
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,809
What?

171
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,334
How do you expect to peel soybeans properly half-asleep?

172
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:31,031
To make good tofu, you must carefully peel every last skin.

173
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:35,103
But I was up all night fighting haters online.

174
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,457
I had to defend our chef.

175
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,164
A grown woman spending the night brawling.

176
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,002
If your mother knew, she would have given you a scolding.

177
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:51,077
Why are we even making tofu from scratch?

178
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:53,171
They sell it at the market!

179
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:56,346
You really have no sense of efficiency.

180
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,550
Back in Joseon, the people outside Changuimun

181
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,520
were known for their smooth, delicate tofu,

182
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:06,467
but such tofu is hard to find here, so we must make it ourselves.

183
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,047
Changuimun tofu?

184
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,842
That's a thing? I've never heard of it.

185
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,799
Did you not read the "Domundaejak" I gave you?

186
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,212
It is written in there.

187
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:20,425
"Domundaejak?"

188
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,513
Oh, the collateral?

189
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:25,882
How was I supposed to read it? It's all in classical Chinese!

190
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,233
But you didn't even write that, did you?

191
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,659
You copied it from somewhere, right?

192
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:35,055
How dare you question the integrity of a Transcendent Genius?

193
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,165
Regardless, good food begins with sincerity.

194
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,391
When I think about the customers coming all this way for our cooking,

195
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,763
how could I serve them anything less than my best?

196
00:13:46,763 --> 00:13:50,596
Yeah, yeah. You sound even more dramatic than my mom.

197
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,897
Mr. Homeless.

198
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:59,434
Then how about we raise the price just a little?

199
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,896
I mean, our prices are ridiculously low.

200
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:05,998
Where else can you get a meal for 5,000 won these days?

201
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,238
Impossible.

202
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,415
Why?

203
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,410
Your mother would not approve.

204
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,870
Which is exactly why we should raise it before she gets back.

205
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:18,039
I chose to cook here because I respect her wish

206
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,687
to serve affordable meals to the hungry.

207
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:25,826
- Just 2,000 won more. 
 - Impossible.

208
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,261
Oh, just 1,000 won.

209
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,970
Absolutely not.

210
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,155
Damn, I quit! I'm not peeling the beans!

211
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:35,093
You expect me to do this kind of labor for just 5,000 won?

212
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:39,126
It all tastes the same anyway. Let's just take it easy!

213
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,593
Taste it.

214
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,467
No thanks.

215
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,542
Just one bite.

216
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,937
I said I'm good.

217
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:11,014
- Just one bite! 
 - Oh, I said...

218
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:16,046
Is it that good?

219
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,818
It's hot!

220
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,326
Oh...

221
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:24,689
I forgot it was still boiling.

222
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,022
But then...

223
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:29,301
It's like hot ice cream?

224
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:37,472
It just melts instantly, leaving only the nutty flavor behind.

225
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:41,164
That is because you peeled the beans so thoroughly.

226
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:49,657
Fine, I'll keep peeling...

227
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,810
But we'll revisit the price talk later.

228
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,818
Agreed.

229
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:56,621
Keep peeling.

230
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,110
   

231
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,420
   

232
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,607
Mr. Lee will be with you shortly.

233
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,438
So he calls us here only to keep us waiting?

234
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,406
What kind of nonsense is this?

235
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:26,951
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,144
Tell him to hurry up.

237
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:39,224
But why insist on meeting in person?

238
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:41,229
What does he want?

239
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:46,047
You're giving me a headache. Just sit down.

240
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,943
You always overthink things.

241
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,627
Isn't it obvious?

242
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,540
What is?

243
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,730
Even if we're done for good...

244
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,401
He still wants to see me one last time.

245
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:04,105
You really do live in your own fantasy world.

246
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,392
- Welcome. 
 - Table for two.

247
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:14,052
Here are your two soft tofu stews.

248
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:16,216
Enjoy your meal.

249
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,393
Detective Kang!

250
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,151
So, you've reopened?

251
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:26,095
Yes, would you like to eat?

252
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,678
Sure, why not?

253
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:29,820
You!

254
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,477
You are the officer who locked me up without so much as an apology!

255
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,791
How dare you show your face here?

256
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:41,406
Don't tell me, he's...

257
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:46,188
Yes, he's in charge of our kitchen.

258
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,811
I refuse to serve him my food.

259
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,186
Oh, come on...

260
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:54,456
Yeah, well... I guess that means no food for me today.

261
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:57,118
Nonsense, have a seat.

262
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,786
No!

263
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,281
Go.

264
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:03,940
   

265
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,180
   

266
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,040
     

267
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,090
   

268
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:24,793
Would you like a bowl of soft tofu?

269
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,907
Yes, yes.

270
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,545
One soft tofu stew.

271
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:31,660
He's not coming.

272
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,107
Let's just go.

273
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:36,207
What? Just like that?

274
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:39,345
How long are we supposed to wait?

275
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,151
Seriously.

276
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:48,284
Apologies for keeping you waiting.

277
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,171
Chef Lee.

278
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,340
You railed at me when I was late,

279
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,559
but now look at you.

280
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:00,665
Please, have a seat, Mi Sol.

281
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,931
This won't take long.

282
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,675
Okay, let me explain the incident

283
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:17,497
behind the much-talked-about promotional video for Restaurant Dorae.

284
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:23,040
This is good.

285
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,754
How strange.

286
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,670
So?

287
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,594
Did you find the person she met right before the accident?

288
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:37,636
Oh, that?

289
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,471
You seem to be mistaken.

290
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,367
There was no one next to her that day.

291
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,642
Unbelievable!

292
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,808
I thought you were just a nasty officer, but you are an incompetent one too!

293
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:51,053
I saw someone with my own eyes!

294
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:55,143
There's footage of her walking alone.

295
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,500
So let's not go over this again, okay?

296
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,136
Footage?

297
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:06,921
Are you talking about the marvel that captures the past?

298
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,240
Let me see it, too.

299
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,622
Oh, please.

300
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:14,373
Not just anyone gets to see that.

301
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:17,077
I said there was no one, so drop it.

302
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,943
That cannot be right...

303
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,112
Wait.

304
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:26,123
Are you absolutely sure?

305
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:28,093
Yes, I am.

306
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,679
Mister, stop pestering the detective.

307
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,379
Could I have imagined it?

308
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,559
Thank you.

309
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,546
That was a good meal.

310
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,217
Thank you, detective. Come again!

311
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:46,241
She said, "Come again," but do not come again!

312
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,917
I thought they were closed today.

313
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,260
Then what's with all those cars?

314
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,891
The reason I've gathered you all here today

315
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:08,115
is at the request of Jung Mi Sol.

316
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:12,747
The statement you see now was sent by her company's CEO.

317
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:17,059
Since Mi Sol found it difficult to speak on her own,

318
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,077
they asked me to do so in her place.

319
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,303
Our CEO?

320
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:22,458
I had no idea...

321
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,654
Ow! That's hot!

322
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:32,799
Are you all right?

323
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:37,294
We should get this treated first.

324
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:38,855
We're closing for today.

325
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:41,185
Everyone, please leave!

326
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:42,696
What are you talking about?

327
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:45,311
It's all money sitting there!

328
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:48,842
We're still open, so please don't go.

329
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:51,653
How do you plan to work with that hand?

330
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,975
I'm fine.

331
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:56,588
Stop overreacting and go make soft tofu.

332
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,604
One more soft tofu, please.

333
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:00,437
- Got it! One more soft tofu! 
 - Yes.

334
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:02,048
Mister, hurry up.

335
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,885
How...

336
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,616
From a young age, Jung Mi Sol

337
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:14,084
captured the nation's heart as the Commercial Film Fairy.

338
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,492
 Why am I the only one having a hard time? 

339
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:22,043
 Why? 

340
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,300
But after transitioning to acting,

341
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,180
her career hit a slump due to criticism of her poor performances.

342
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:30,558
Desperate to reclaim her popularity, Mi Sol didn't focus on improving her acting.

343
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,897
Instead, she became obsessed with her appearance.

344
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:38,844
And that led her to develop an eating disorder.

345
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:42,863
In other words, she forces herself to vomit after eating.

346
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:46,893
These days, they call it "binge-purge syndrome."

347
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:51,260
 She came to the hospital, 

348
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,520
 fully covered in a hat and mask. 

349
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:56,935
 But I recognized Jung Mi Sol's voice. 

350
00:22:56,935 --> 00:23:00,630
 She kept saying she’d throw up everything she ate... 

351
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,090
 She also said it had been going on for years now. 

352
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:09,288
- Seriously? 
 - No way.

353
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,354
Oh, yes.

354
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:14,752
I know this may be hard to believe.

355
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:19,841
After all, Mi Sol has always claimed to maintain her figure solely through exercise.

356
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:23,730
 I just squeeze in workouts whenever I can at home. 

357
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,778
 That way, I never let calories settle in my body. 

358
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:33,602
 You can lose weight healthily, just like me! 

359
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,208
But it was all a lie.

360
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,033
I looked into it, and it turns out that the entire clip was a paid product placement.

361
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:46,625
PPL? Without me knowing?

362
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,054
That's not the issue right now.

363
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:52,541
And now, this case is no different.

364
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:57,168
Without disclosing her health issues, Mi Sol took part in the promotional video,

365
00:23:57,168 --> 00:24:01,298
tarnishing Dorae's image

366
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:05,001
and causing immense financial damage.

367
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:08,020
But neither I nor Dorae intend to

368
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,200
take legal action over the losses.

369
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,251
What we truly hope

370
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:18,908
is that Jung Mi Sol breaks free from her distorted obsession with beauty

371
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,070
and truly overcomes

372
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,820
her eating disorder.

373
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:31,449
Jung Mi Sol, is this all true?

374
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:33,139
Do you have anything to say in response?

375
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,697
How are you feeling right now?

376
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:38,534
Is it true that you force yourself to throw up?

377
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:43,456
What the hell do you know about me to talk like that?

378
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:46,740
Mi Sol!

379
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,000
- Jung Mi Sol! 
 - Jung Mi Sol!

380
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:49,359
Please say something!

381
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,437
Is this all true?

382
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,812
Give a comment, Jung Mi Sol!

383
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:00,906
So, this was your plan.

384
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:03,263
I had faith in you, Mr. Lee.

385
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:04,631
What did I tell you?

386
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:07,114
Didn't I say he would handle it just fine?

387
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:11,253
I know there's no one like Mr. Lee.

388
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,424
After that mess with the diner,

389
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,763
I was worried he'd just talk his way through again.

390
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:18,407
It was out of concern.

391
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:22,721
On my way here, I saw that the diner reopened.

392
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,090
Are you sure there's nothing to worry about?

393
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,861
If you mean the one across the street, there's nothing to worry about.

394
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:34,433
A man with zero cooking experience is running the kitchen,

395
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:38,054
but as you know, running a restaurant is not child's play.

396
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:40,023
There's no way that'll work.

397
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:43,744
They'll crash and burn soon enough.

398
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:47,650
Well, if you say so, I guess there's nothing to worry about.

399
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,961
We're counting on you, Mr. Lee.

400
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,652
Good work.

401
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,157
- Nice job. 
 - Well done.

402
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:08,489
Wow, I was wondering how you'd get out of the Jung Mi Sol mess.

403
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:10,501
That was impressive.

404
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:13,405
Glad you think so. Then...

405
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:18,513
But you seem a little too confident about that diner.

406
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:21,167
"They'll crash and burn on their own?"

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,605
That sounds a bit too optimistic, don't you think?

408
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:29,085
That's my professional assessment as a restaurant owner.

409
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:32,521
Someone like him can't revive a diner.

410
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:35,208
Have you tried their food?

411
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,882
You haven't, have you?

412
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,026
He probably just copied something he saw.

413
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:44,799
I wouldn't call that real cooking.

414
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,782
It was phenomenal.

415
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:49,659
How should I put it?

416
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:53,885
It's familiar yet oddly new.

417
00:26:55,347 --> 00:27:01,239
So why not put your pride aside and use me?

418
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,200
I'm offering to take care of the dirty work for you,

419
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,220
but you keep pushing me away. Kind of hurts my feelings.

420
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:14,463
It's because you keep crossing the line, Detective Kang.

421
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:17,530
So I have no choice but to draw it again.

422
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,794
From now on, stay out of my restaurant.

423
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:29,225
Unless I call for you first.

424
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,846
Then...

425
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,972
Mi Sol!

426
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,491
Where did Jung Mi Sol go?

427
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:50,693
Where is she?

428
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:52,297
Let's go that way.

429
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,789
To the right?

430
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:55,067
Hurry.

431
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,845
Are they gone?

432
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:01,067
They're gone.

433
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,332
Stay put for a bit longer.

434
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:10,461
- Is that Jung Mi Sol? 
 - Looks like her.

435
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:12,713
Yeah, I think it's her.

436
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,330
Three soft tofu, mister.

437
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:29,545
Where did he go? We're swamped here!

438
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:33,090
Mr. Homeless!

439
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:36,178
Mr. Homeless!

440
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:38,110
Stay here for a moment,

441
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,239
and I will tell you when the coast is clear.

442
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,404
Excuse me.

443
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:47,164
I appreciate the help from last time,

444
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:49,815
but I can't accept stalkers.

445
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,831
- Cannot accept what? 
 - Mr. Homeless!

446
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,553
Let us talk again later.

447
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,850
This is the last bowl of soft tofu.

448
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,888
Enjoy.

449
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,992
Goodbye.

450
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,900
That's it for today!

451
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,496
See? You are not okay at all!

452
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,691
My goodness.

453
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,756
Come over here.

454
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:17,334
How many bowls did you serve with your hand like this?

455
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,710
125 bowls!

456
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,399
We sold 125 servings today!

457
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,512
Sales are even higher than yesterday.

458
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,126
But your injury is serious.

459
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:33,366
I think we should close tomorrow so you can rest.

460
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,112
What are you talking about?

461
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,523
If we keep closing for every little thing,

462
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:39,623
when are we ever going to make money?

463
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:42,529
Health comes before money.

464
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:44,322
No, money!

465
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:46,763
Money always comes first!

466
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,750
We should push even harder while we're on an upswing!

467
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,010
Oh, first, let's name this diner.

468
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:59,206
We have done just fine without one.

469
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:01,960
Why do we need one now?

470
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,478
Because we need it for social media,

471
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:09,211
delivery apps, and GPS.

472
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:11,053
GP?

473
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,740
App?

474
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,533
I have no idea what you are saying.

475
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,301
Well...

476
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:19,217
it's hard to explain, but trust me,

477
00:31:19,217 --> 00:31:21,689
having a name is incredibly important.

478
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:26,415
Maybe I should go to a naming center and get one that brings in money?

479
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:28,801
Lady Eun Sil.

480
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:31,011
Do you know my name?

481
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,817
Mr. Homeless is Mr. Homeless.

482
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:40,925
What name?

483
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:44,519
I could have sworn I told you before.

484
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:51,036
I better go see Mom.

485
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,857
I'll be back.

486
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:59,192
She says names are important,

487
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:02,065
yet she does not even know the name of the person she is with.

488
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:04,672
What a contradictory woman.

489
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,465
   

490
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:14,075
   

491
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:15,590
   

492
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:20,139
The smear posts are gone now.

493
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:31,581
Good work. You can go.

494
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:45,347
Exactly worth 5,000 won.

495
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,989
 It was phenomenal. 

496
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:50,893
 How should I put it? 

497
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:55,358
 It's familiar yet oddly new. 

498
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:32,851
Mom, I made a lot of money.

499
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:35,438
Not as much as you did,

500
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:39,314
but I think I'll catch up soon.

501
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:43,871
Aren't I amazing?

502
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:48,341
When you wake up, I'll let you work at the restaurant just for fun.

503
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:55,492
Miss.

504
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,311
You need to pay for the interim bill today.

505
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:01,381
Oh, yes. I'll take care of it before I go.

506
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:03,110
Oh, did you get hurt?

507
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,770
This?

508
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,065
It's no biggie.

509
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,687
Just a little burn.

510
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:10,319
I applied some ointment at home.

511
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:12,931
The dressing looks professionally done.

512
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,440
♫    ♫

514
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,784
Well...

515
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:35,223
I did a decent job wrapping it up.

516
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,276
 Ow! That's hot! 

517
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,583
 Are you okay? 

518
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:42,300

Mr. Homeless, are you asleep?

526
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,973
I bought some bungeoppang.

527
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:21,420
Bungeoppang?

528
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,359
You have to eat them while they're hot.

529
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:31,699
Why give that to someone whose name you do not even know?

530
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,699
I do not feel like eating.

531
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:36,519
Are you still upset?

532
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,387
You tend to hold grudges.

533
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:45,734
Try one. I came running with them in my arms to keep them warm.

534
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,658
Here!

535
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:57,973
Since you insist...

536
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:12,564
I took care of the sign while I was out.

537
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:14,810
I picked a name for the restaurant.

538
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:17,461
What did you name it?

539
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,510
You'll see for yourself later.

540
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:30,430
They taste good, right?

541
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,045
But then, where is the fish?

542
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:38,049
I do not see it at all.

543
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:41,578
Bungeoppang doesn’t actually have fish in it.

544
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,667
Then isn't that fraud?

545
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:50,388
That's like selling beef gukbap with no beef in it!

546
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:02,194
It's me, Detective Kang.

547
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:07,561
I'll leave it in your hands.

548
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,590
   

549
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:37,042
"Side dish refills are self-serve!"

550
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:38,945
"Self-serve?"

551
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:43,344
Since my hand is injured, I might be slow serving food.

552
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:47,109
So I figured customers could help themselves to side dishes.

553
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,507
"Self-serve" must mean helping oneself.

554
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:51,908
That's right.

555
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:53,749
That is a great phrase.

556
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:57,761
Of all the words I have learned here, this is my favorite.

557
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:02,885
Now, shall we open the diner?

558
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,620
   

559
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:11,009
Get in line!

560
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:12,984
Side dish refills are self-serve!

561
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:15,468
More radish kimchi, please!

562
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,698
Side dish refills are self-serve!

563
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:20,533
Can we get three bowls of gukbap over here?

564
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,554
Got it, just a moment.

565
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,590
The radish kimchi is perfectly fermented.

566
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,555
Thank you for the meal.

567
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:31,155
Wow, beef gukbap!

568
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,051
- Some water here, please. 
 - Welcome!

569
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:34,223
Mister, water.

570
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:35,892
Okay.

571
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:15,233
Wait!

572
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:19,217
There's a cockroach in my soup, and that's your reaction?

573
00:39:19,217 --> 00:39:22,073
There is nothing wrong with my food.

574
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:25,237
Only the right ingredients ever go in.

575
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,844
Are you saying I'm lying?

576
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:30,689
Yes. Why cause trouble with a false accusation?

577
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:32,684
Get out of here!

578
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,799
Oh, look at this!

579
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,248
Maybe a health inspection report will knock some sense into you.

580
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,344
Mister, stay inside.

581
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:46,226
You want me to just stand by while this happens?

582
00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:48,214
Just go inside.

583
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:52,845
I sincerely apologize, sir.

584
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:55,305
Why are you apologizing?

585
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,832
Do you also believe that thug's lie?

586
00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:59,664
Hey, hey!

587
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,894
What is going on?

588
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:02,428
Young lady!

589
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:08,175
How dare you?

590
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:23,650
Chef, we'll serve the dessert for the main table.

591
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,606
No, I'll do it.

592
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,773
Is this the final course?

593
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,562
I've never had such a luxurious meal in my life.

594
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:49,201
You can't afford something like this with the salary of a civil servant.

595
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,103
Nice.

596
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:02,152
Wow.

597
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:05,402
Did you get the job done?

598
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,254
I told you.

599
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:19,013
By the time I finish this meal, it'll be done.

600
00:41:20,498 --> 00:41:24,484
The method may be outdated, but what matters is that it works.

601
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:27,108
Classic never goes out of style, you know?

602
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:31,761
They won't be able to reopen the diner for a while.

603
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:37,088
Well done.

604
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:38,700
But

605
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,910
why the change of heart?

606
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:45,217
I didn't think you'd reach out to me.

607
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:47,660
Because he irritates me.

608
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:50,149
 Gwansong! 

609
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:59,488
Everything about him.

610
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,554
Stop.

611
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:17,823
Your hand... you will make it worse.

612
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:20,521
We need to clean up quickly and get back to business.

613
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,716
You still want to run the diner in this situation?

614
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:31,353
If we throw out the gukbap and make a fresh batch,

615
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:33,712
we can still hit our sales target.

616
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:36,238
There is nothing wrong with my gukbap.

617
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:39,372
So, stop worrying about that

618
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:41,547
and focus on getting treatment first.

619
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,753
I'll go get groceries.

620
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,368
Why are you doing this?

621
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:54,145
We need to run the business.

622
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:56,458
Don't you want to make money?

623
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,262
You and your money, money, money!

624
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:03,098
Is that all you ever think about?

625
00:43:03,098 --> 00:43:06,082
Yes, that's right.

626
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:08,929
I only care about money.

627
00:43:10,783 --> 00:43:13,310
I'm not like my mom or you...

628
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,959
feeding the hungry out of some noble sense of duty.

629
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:20,201
I just want to make money.

630
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,926
Clinging to profit like that is the behavior of small-minded people.

631
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:30,212
You talk like such a free spirit.

632
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:36,148
Maybe in Joseon, being born into a noble family meant you could scoff at money,

633
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:38,330
but here...

634
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,918
money makes you noble!

635
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,741
The rich are the kings with power.

636
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,207
You need money to be treated like a person.

637
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:52,008
Without it, even the living get left to die.

638
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:57,318
This is the reality of your so-called paradise, Yuldoguk.

639
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:02,503
So stop talking and start cooking.

640
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:04,899
I refuse to go down like this.

641
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,175
So, in the end, I am just your means to make money?

642
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:13,096
If that is the case...

643
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:16,136
I do not want to be used anymore.

644
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,525
I am struggling too, you know.

645
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:57,000
 But here, money makes you noble. 

646
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,849
 The rich are the kings with power. 

647
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:04,366
 You need money to be treated like a person. 

648
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,936
 Without it, even the living get left to die. 

649
00:45:10,592 --> 00:45:14,643
 This is the reality of your so-called paradise, Yuldoguk. 

650
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:22,902
Does the world I dreamed of not exist even in the future?

651
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:40,317
Bungeoppang!

652
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:55,837
So this is how they are made.

653
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,764
The same flour batter and red bean filling,

654
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:02,043
but if you use a fish-shaped mold, it's bungeoppang.

655
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:04,846
A chrysanthemum mold makes gukhwa-ppang.

656
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:08,416
And a walnut mold makes Hodugwaja.

657
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,500
Is that so? That is fascinating.

658
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:16,386
How they are baked determines their names.

659
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,619
Give me ten fish-shaped ones.

660
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:36,419
I need to deliver them before they get cold, so...

661
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:40,923
Then, what mold are you using now?

662
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,795
Are you really okay with changing your name?

663
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,170
Where did he go?

664
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,433
Where did that old man go?

665
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:03,487
Old man?

666
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,901
The old man who made these for me.

667
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:08,761
You bought them from me just now.

668
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,397
Signboard delivery.

669
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:30,155
Where should I install it?

670
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:33,208
Signboard...

671
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:37,865
Just leave it there.

672
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:40,229
Are you not going to install it?

673
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:42,551
Please leave it there.

674
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:45,531
Okay. Then, I will leave it here.

675
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,020
   
   

676
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,750
Mi Sol!

677
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,900
- Hey, Jung Mi Sol! 
 - Let's check inside too.

678
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,310
Something definitely happened.

679
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,700
That's the only way to explain this.

680
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,000
- Hello? Is it you, Mi Sol? 
 - Hey.

681
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,620
 Why are you so hard to reach? 

682
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,903
 Do you know how worried I was? 

683
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:32,370
Did you see me on the front page of Issue Patch?

684
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:37,634
It's not a dating scandal, but hey, goal achieved.

685
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,900
You... are you okay?

686
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,688
 But then... 

687
00:48:44,495 --> 00:48:47,119
even with my dumb brain, I can tell

688
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,353
this is really the end for me.

689
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:51,106
I've got no talent, and now everyone hates me.

690
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:53,234
Who would ever cast me again?

691
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:58,467
So, you should find other ways to make a living.

692
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:00,140
You've got a family to take care of.

693
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,721
 Mi Sol, where are you? 

694
00:49:02,721 --> 00:49:04,174
 Mi Sol! 

695
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:37,950
Shall I start wrapping up?

696
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,912
Mi Sol, don't do anything reckless.

697
00:49:45,912 --> 00:49:49,428
You don't have to be a celebrity to live a good life!

698
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:53,296
 Why would you die? Why? 

699
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:55,439
Who said anything about dying?

700
00:49:57,677 --> 00:50:00,901
I'm going to get revenge on Lee Hyuk,

701
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:03,140
then I'll go to prison or straight to hell.

702
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,820
Live well!

703
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,440


704
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:04,980
♫  Even if everything flows away you are still by my side  ♫

705
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:11,160
♫  Don't let go of my hand, not ever  ♫

706
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:18,760
♫  When spring comes let's go there, together  ♫

707
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,660
♫  Let's never be apart again  ♫

708
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:45,670
♫  It always felt so distant the word “us”  ♫
