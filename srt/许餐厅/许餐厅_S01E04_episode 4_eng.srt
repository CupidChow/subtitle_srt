1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,870


2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,044
   

3
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:05,770
   

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,610
   

5
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:11,509
   

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,873
   

7
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:17,686
       

8
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,797
   

9
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:28,433
   

10
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,101
   

11
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,258
Let's do it.

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,161
Do what?

13
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:40,707
Let's run this diner together.

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,144
How's 2.5 million won a month?

15
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,445
3 million?

16
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:51,134
Okay!

17
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,514
3 million plus 10% of net profit, deal?

18
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,500
One-tenth of the earnings will be yours.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,023
What would I do with money in this world?

20
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:05,668
I am bound to return soon anyway.

21
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,341
Still living in a fantasy?

22
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,798
Always going on about Joseon.

23
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:13,426
I take it you still do not believe me.

24
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:17,044
How do you expect to work with someone you do not trust?

25
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,591
Me?

26
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,485
I totally believe in you, Mr. Homeless.

27
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:24,375
In what?

28
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,707
What?

29
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:29,045
What exactly do you believe in?

30
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,570
Well, that you're...

31
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:41,178
From Joseon and destined to return there.

32
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:43,265
You know me well.

33
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:47,618
I must figure out why I came here and how to return to Joseon.

34
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:50,145
I have no time to be tied down elsewhere.

35
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,467
Then...

36
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:56,613
Do you have anywhere to go?

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,969
It's freezing these days.

38
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,905
Are you planning to search for your reason and method out on the streets?

39
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,827
If you work here, food and lodging will be sorted out immediately.

40
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,481
So, let's run this place... together.

41
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:21,267
Whoa! You are really gripping onto me here...

42
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:25,317
Leaving now would be impolite.

43
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:27,700
I suppose I will hear you out a bit more.

44
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,424
Since you have much to do,

45
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:36,113
we'll only open for lunch, and the rest is your free time.

46
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,250
That is all?

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,065
I'll also give you vacation days by mutual agreement.

48
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,294
And?

49
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,794
And more?

50
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:50,170
Wait, I'm offering incentives, meals, lodging, break time, and vacation.

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,867
So, what more?

52
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:56,335
If that's what you're asking,

53
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,209
then how about working together,

54
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,501
not just as boss and employee but like a family?

55
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,814
"Like a family?"

56
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,870
That just sounds like empty flattery.

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,529
Not at all.

58
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:17,330
Maybe not in Joseon, but plenty of companies work this way here.

59
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:20,350
Like so-called families.

60
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,773
This is Yuldoguk, your paradise.

61
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:28,989
So why not give it a shot?

62
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:39,504
Can I think about it overnight?

63
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:41,635
You need more time?

64
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,386
Will that be a problem?

65
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:45,971
Of course not.

66
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,490
Think it over.

67
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,290
I'm not the type to pressure people anyway.

68
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:53,666
I see.

69
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:58,416
Then go ahead and make the bed.

70
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,853
I have had a long day, so I am exhausted.

71
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:14,654
Oh, and take care of this while you are at it.

72
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,132
What am I supposed to do with this?

73
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,527
Are you asking me to wash it?

74
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,312
Exactly.

75
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,331
"Like a family."

76
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:29,168
Yes, like a family.

77
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:34,977
Be gentle, like washing a baby.

78
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,271
It is cotton from the Ming Dynasty.

79
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,771
Got it.

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,389
Cotton from the Ming Dynasty?

81
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,401
I thought he was just a lunatic, but he's sly like a fox.

82
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,472
I better not let my guard down.

83
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:56,553
I need to stay sharp.

84
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,964
 This is the place where I first arrived, 

85
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:20,486
 and for some reason, I keep returning to it. 

86
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,767
 Madam! 

87
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:34,367
 Is there something here that I must find? 

88
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:39,429
If so, staying here would not be so bad.

89
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:43,580
It is quite warm and comforting.

90
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,096
Is anyone there?

91
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:19,408
Mae Chang!

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,672
Mae Chang, why do you look so sad?

93
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,746
What?

94
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:33,100
Speak a little louder.

95
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,427
Mae Chang!

96
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:38,657
 Mister. 

97
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,568
Mister?

98
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,152
Why are you here?

99
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,445
What about Mae Chang?

100
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:51,524
Where is Mae Chang...

101
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,595
I was worried for nothing.

102
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:57,867
You must've had a deep sleep, even dreaming.

103
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:03,708
Now that it's morning, we should wrap up our conversation from last night, right?

104
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,693
What do you mean...

105
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,065
I knew you'd play innocent.

106
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:11,678
So, I stayed up all night drafting an employment contract.

107
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:15,228
Since you don't have a signature or a seal,

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,836
you can just press your thumbprint right here.

109
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:22,687
Oh, a thumbprint.

110
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:27,241
In Joseon, we did not use fingerprints but rather drew the shape of the hand.

111
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,073
It was called a hand seal.

112
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:33,111
Oh, if Joseon had it too, no need for an explanation then.

113
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,035
Just stamp here.

114
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,937
Here and here...

115
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,376
Once you draw your handprint like that,

116
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:54,336
you and your descendants would live as servants of that household for generations.

117
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:56,651
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:56,651 --> 00:08:00,245
This is a standard contract. A standard contract!

119
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,711
Seriously, why would I do that?

120
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:07,027
Of course, I know you're not that kind of person.

121
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:17,044
But today, I have somewhere important to be.

122
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,967
So, let us talk after I return.

123
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,373
Putting it off again?

124
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:23,151
You said you'd give me an answer after sleeping on it!

125
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:25,457
I will be back soon.

126
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:27,758
Where are the clothes I left with you last night?

127
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,609
I washed them last night, so they're still wet!

128
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,861
How unfortunate...

129
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,610
â™«  A secretive heart  â™« 
 â™«  Why does my heart keep pestering me?  â™«

130
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,116
What is that?

131
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,526
What am I doing here?

132
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,707
Look at him.

133
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:00,315
He's no ordinary fox.

134
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,516
Mister, you're going the wrong way!

135
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:08,195
Take a pick.

136
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,208
How about this? Something trendy.

137
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,676
Like a hipster in a hip style.

138
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,088
What does "hip" mean?

139
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,549
It's this.

140
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:18,202
The colors seem rather dull.

141
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:21,882
It's dangerous. Move out of the way.

142
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:23,713
- Wait! 
 - Step aside.

143
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:25,968
How are you coming down?

144
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,566
What are you doing?

145
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,808
I have never seen such an array of vibrant fabrics before!

146
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,385
Welcome.

147
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,672
Hello.

148
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:42,459
I've been through too much to let him slip away today.

149
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,130
I will get my answer.

150
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,900
â™«  You, you, you in my heart  â™«

151
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,412
To think such colors can be created...

152
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,186
Mister, what about this one?

153
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,037
This looks nice.

154
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:16,298
I do not think it suits me.

155
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,098
Why?

156
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,643
How about this?

157
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:25,788
How much is this?

158
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,889
Come on, this is prettier.

159
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,843
Are you only getting one for the groom?

160
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,330
What?

161
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,901
You should get one for the bride as well.

162
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:39,261
I'll give you a discount if you buy together.

163
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,964
Bride and groom? Now that's just absurd!

164
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:46,182
I can tell even from a glance.

165
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:47,753
You're mistaken.

166
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,673
Let's just go with this one.

167
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,371
What do you think?

168
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:53,111
That's a great choice. Looks amazing!

169
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,289
- Is that so? 
 - Over there.

170
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,453
- Try it on over there. 
 - Oh, over there? Okay.

171
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:07,545
Oh, my goodness.

172
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,361
They say clothes make the man, but wow...

173
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:15,007
Bride, what do you think? Doesn't he look stunning?

174
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:17,687
I'm not the bride.

175
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:21,041
But then... before the wedding,

176
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,320
you should do something with his hair.

177
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:27,599
Can I just get the bill?

178
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,969
I was about to call you.

179
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:49,200
Everything should be wrapped up in a few days,

180
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,403
so go ahead as planned.

181
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:54,552
Yes.

182
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:58,026
I'll get in touch after the advertisement meeting.

183
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:06,862
I told you not to schedule anything in the morning. I have low blood pressure.

184
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,324
It's just for today.

185
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:12,074
It was hard to adjust the time because he had busy schedules.

186
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,051
Let's get this over with.

187
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,951
I'm exhausted.

188
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,202
Tell them I'm not taking pictures.

189
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,587
What?

190
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,633
Is he also a celebrity?

191
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,360
All together! Let's take a photo together.

192
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,879
- One, two, three. 
 - That's Chef Lee Hyuk.

193
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,836
And he's also the advertiser we're meeting today.

194
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,817
You seriously don't know him? He's huge.

195
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,538
Yeah, I can see that.

196
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,922
Think this could land on Issue Patch?

197
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,896
Issue Patch?

198
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,908
I mean, standing next to him in a two-shot doesn't sound too bad.

199
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,927
What are you talking about?

200
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,688
You said kids these days don't know me.

201
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,575
So, it's time I let them know who I am.

202
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:58,238
Nothing works better than a dating scandal.

203
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:00,192
Let's hit the salon first.

204
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:03,603
Hey, the meeting is in ten minutes.

205
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:06,673
Come on, think!

206
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:10,218
How am I supposed to fake a dating scandal looking like this?

207
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,853
How would you like your hair styled?

208
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,247
One's body, skin, and hair are gifts from one's parents.

209
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,579
But I have lost my hair.

210
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,500
I do not know how to atone for such filial disrespect.

211
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,070
However, as this is not Joseon,

212
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,984
if I were to tidy up what little remains,

213
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:54,679
perhaps I could redeem myself, even slightly.

214
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:57,929
Now, your hair...

215
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,499
 How did you end up being a pushover, Bong Eun Sil? 

216
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,952
 You were always so shrewd with numbers. 

217
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:09,507
 That fox must be a wily beast that humans are no match for. 

218
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:10,898
 That's it. 

219
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:13,325
 I need to cut ties while I still can! 

220
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:16,470
 There are countless talented chefs out there. 

221
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,401
 Why cling to a homeless drifter? 

222
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,661
   

223
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,457
 That's more like it! 
   

224
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,396
 Why would I rely on some vagrant 

225
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:34,213
 when there are seasoned professionals available? 

226
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,198
   
   

227
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:36,136
   
   

228
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:37,071
   
   

229
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:41,877
   
   

230
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:43,577
 It's okay. 

231
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,526
 Let's lower the standards. 

232
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,689
 A bit less experience isn't the end of the world! 

233
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:51,203
 Even a guy who's never set foot in a kitchen can cook... 

234
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:52,930
   

235
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,933
   

236
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,094
   

237
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:01,289
 Yeah, this should do... 
   

238
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,652
   

239
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,185
   

240
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,806
   

241
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,906
   

242
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:12,538
Miss?

243
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,251
Yes?

244
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:18,515
Your boyfriend doesn't seem to understand me.

245
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,171
How would you like his hair done?

246
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,653
A trim?

247
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,294
A perm?

248
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,669
Color? Or just a style?

249
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,530
All of it.

250
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,380
Pardon?

251
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:40,232
Just do whatever you can.

252
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,198
Why isn't she here yet?

253
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,917
Is she turning down the advertisement?

254
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:59,519
She seems to have her reasons.

255
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:03,311
They begged us to wait a bit longer.

256
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,111
What should we do?

257
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,626
Young lady.

258
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,734
Lady Eun Sil.

259
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,266
Young lady!

260
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,831
 Mr. Homeless? 

261
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,670
I'll get going.

262
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:56,889
Mae Chang!

263
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,814
What the...

264
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,477
Can I get the bill?

265
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,977
Go, quick! Hurry up!

266
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,331
Mae Chang!

267
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,963
Why does he keep following me?

268
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:36,526
Did you see that? I'm still popular.

269
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,137
I can't believe my heart skipped a beat for a drifter like that.

270
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,720
Heart, you better self-reflect.

271
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,338
Young lady.

272
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,632
You finally see me now?

273
00:17:57,632 --> 00:17:59,163
What do you mean...

274
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,481
You completely lost your mind over a woman

275
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,889
and left me behind.

276
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:06,435
Only to come back empty-handed?

277
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,119
You must be mistaken.

278
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,386
I thought I saw someone I knew.

279
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:15,091
Wow, what a classic pick-up line.

280
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:17,644
I bet even Joseon women wouldn't fall for that.

281
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,745
I am serious.

282
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,870
Mae Chang was an artist I cherished in Joseon.

283
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:28,096
But why are you so upset?

284
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,740
Do I not have a reason to be?

285
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,724
Do you have any ideaâ€”

286
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:38,839
how much money I've spent on you?

287
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:45,531
Yet, you haven't given me a definite answer.

288
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:51,229
I thought you did all that because we were like family.

289
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:54,395
Since when were we family?

290
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:57,904
Forget that "like a family" nonsense! It's canceled!

291
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:01,562
From now on, this is strictly business.

292
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,740
I understand.

293
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,791
What a shame. I actually liked it.

294
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:10,745
But then, what is "business?"

295
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:13,582
It means we're only connected through work.

296
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,951
So, give me a clear answer.

297
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:19,332
Are you in or out of the diner?

298
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:23,509
You are quite impatient.

299
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,149
Did I not say I would give you an answer after I got back from an important place?

300
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,577
Where are you off to this time?

301
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:50,042
I'm Jung Mi Sol.

302
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:52,318
You must be Chef Lee Hyuk.

303
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,356
Yes, I'm Lee Hyuk.

304
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:58,098
Where are we having the meeting?

305
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:02,466
The meeting... is over.

306
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,867
The scheduled time has passed.

307
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:07,730
Chef, we sincerely apologize for being late,

308
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,532
but we should still have the meeting...

309
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:12,909
You must be really upset.

310
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:15,628
I should've apologized first.

311
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:18,544
I'm sorry; we ran a little late.

312
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:25,886
Precisely one hour and forty-three minutes late.

313
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:30,776
That amount of time isn't usually referred to as "a little."

314
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:34,384
Please leave.

315
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,050
Leave?

316
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,984
Yes, please step out.

317
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,996
I have to start preparing lunch service now.

318
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:52,814
What are you all standing around for? Get ready for lunch!

319
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:55,673
We'll wait.

320
00:20:58,116 --> 00:21:01,493
We'll wait until lunch service is over.

321
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,106
Since you waited for us,

322
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:07,438
it's only fair that we wait for you too, right?

323
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:09,811
We'll come back during the break.

324
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:14,785
If you insist.

325
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,695
Let's go.

326
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,711
What?

327
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:30,520
Changdeok Palace is your important place?

328
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,930
You spent all that money to look decent just to come here?

329
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,234
You sure grumble a lot.

330
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:40,711
I told you there was no need to follow me.

331
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:42,735
And if you ran off again?

332
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,839
What, was I supposed to just stand there like a fool?

333
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,411
Ran off?

334
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:50,444
I told you, I am no shameless freeloader.

335
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,599
Take that back at once!

336
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,949
What's wrong with the weather?

337
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,360
Excuse me, would you mind taking a quick photo for us?

338
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,535
Oh, yes.

339
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,335
Thank you.

340
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:22,118
One, two, three!

341
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,826
I'll take one more.

342
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:28,561
One, two, three!

343
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:32,733
Thank you.

344
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:38,167
Gosh, I knew this would happen.

345
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,068
He ran off, didn't he?

346
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:47,960
 Your Majesty, 

347
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,880
 I, Gyosan, may have traveled far from you, 

348
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:55,851
 but my unwavering loyalty remains unchanged. 

349
00:22:55,851 --> 00:23:00,876
 I will find my way back to Joseon. 

350
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:04,953
 Until that day, I wish you peace and good health. 

351
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:08,452
What is he doing now?

352
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:26,383
Young lady.

353
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,961
The one who just took a step back.

354
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,367
Young lady, look at me.

355
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,685
I am not a runaway.

356
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:38,657
Looks like you aren't.

357
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:43,142
Now that I have fulfilled my duty as a loyal subject...

358
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:45,534
Then, the diner?

359
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:48,134
It is time to pay my respects to my father as a son.

360
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,722
Let us visit my late father's grave.

361
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:57,505
And where's that?

362
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:02,389
In Joseon, I laid him to rest in Yongin.

363
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:05,078
But since the land has changed,

364
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,446
I will need to find it first.

365
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,241
Unbelievable! That's it!

366
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,296
I'm done!

367
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,213
Since when was I ever the devoted daughter to protect my mom's diner?

368
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:16,699
I was out of my mind!

369
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,532
Go!

370
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:22,745
Go ahead! Go to your father's grave or Joseon or wherever!

371
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,888
How about grilled mackerel?

372
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:28,717
Oh, so now you're mooching a meal off me too?

373
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,970
Do you even have a conscience?

374
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,866
I meant for our first menu at the diner.

375
00:24:32,866 --> 00:24:37,151
I was not planning on searching for my father's grave today anyway.

376
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,870
Before such a significant moment, I wanted to pay my respects at the palace.

377
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,136
Even if my country has fallen, I am still from Joseon.

378
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,734
Then...

379
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:55,162
You had already made up your mind...

380
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,525
But still put me through all this?

381
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:02,936
You're unbelievable!

382
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,246
Stop!

383
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:07,859
People are staring.

384
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,988
Let us head back.

385
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:13,788
If we are opening tomorrow, there is much to prepare.

386
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,996
The weather is as unpredictable as ever.

387
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,115
Time is crawling, seriously.

388
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:28,766
If this dating rumor gets out, I'm ending it immediately,

389
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:32,882
saying that I dumped him in the cruelest way possible.

390
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,139
Dating rumor? I don't think so.

391
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:39,296
I feel like you've already hit peak public disfavor.

392
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:42,130
Let's just focus on the advertisement.

393
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,528
Hey, even hate comments are still attention.

394
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:49,333
That chef is already starting to take an interest in me.

395
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,169
Who dares to leave their palanquin blocking the entrance?

396
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:01,734
How utterly thoughtless!

397
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:04,605
The diner isn't even opening today. Just leave it be.

398
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,522
They'll move it soon enough.

399
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,645
That will not do.

400
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,303
Now that I have taken charge of this diner,

401
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,216
I shall not be careless in anything.

402
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:16,247
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,373
Come forth!

404
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,467
Come forth!

405
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,993
I am sure I sensed someone's presence.

406
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:41,633
Why is no one answering?

407
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,844
- This palanquin is so dark... 
 - Oh, my gosh!

408
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,236
I cannot see a thing inside.

409
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:47,536
Oh, my!

410
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:51,190
- Oh! That's the guy from the salon! 
 - Is anyone there?

411
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,902
Did he follow me all the way here? Is he a stalker?

412
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,009
- Come out at once! 
 - I'll chase him away.

413
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,040
Forget it.

414
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,710
Dealing with him will only make it worse.

415
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:03,045
This isn't his fault.

416
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:05,127
It's my fault.

417
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:10,301
Jung Mi Sol is a woman that's hard to forget once you fall in love with her.

418
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:14,616
Take a good look. This will be Chef Lee in the future.

419
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,199
Look at them!

420
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,770
If you have done something wrong, the right thing to do is to apologize!

421
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,366
They are so shameless...

422
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,895
Let's go.

423
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,194
We've reviewed the proposal you sent over,

424
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:39,399
and we think the third option would work best.

425
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,570
It aligns well with Mi Sol's image.

426
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:48,400
The third option requires acting, but you can't act.

427
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,572
We did some research, and it seems like the third option would be difficult.

428
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,631
Well... that's technically true.

429
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:59,630
But did you have to be that blunt?

430
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,006
Then, Chef Lee, what's your suggestion?

431
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,024
Forget all the previous plans and let's go with reality.

432
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,274
Reality?

433
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:17,455
Yes.

434
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:23,560
You'll eat my food, and we'll capture your honest reaction as it is.

435
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,447
Like a mukbang?

436
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:28,932
Yes, something similar.

437
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,523
That actually sounds good.

438
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,918
But Mi Sol hasn't really done anything like that before...

439
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,306
That's even better. It'll be fresh for the audience.

440
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:48,563
Sorry, but that's not going to work.

441
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,753
Why not?

442
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,790
I've never reacted to food before.

443
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,254
I have a very picky palate.

444
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:05,390
I've never thought something's delicious after eating.

445
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,214
That's true. I don't think I've ever seen her really enjoy food.

446
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,745
That won't be a problem.

447
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:15,947
Because I'll be the one making the food.

448
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,373
And what if it doesn't get the reaction you're expecting?

449
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,341
That won't happen.

450
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:30,251
I guarantee that I'll make Jung Mi Sol say,

451
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:33,184
"This is delicious."

452
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,146
Mister, come over here.

453
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,610
This place has the cheapest mackerel.

454
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,640
Welcome!

455
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,631
Sir, can we get 50 of these?

456
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,503
Will you give me a discount if I buy a lot?

457
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:55,772
Oh, of course! How would you like them prepared?

458
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:57,146
How should we?

459
00:29:57,146 --> 00:30:00,530
No. This mackerel will not do.

460
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,104
Why?

461
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:05,455
Look here. The gills are flared open.

462
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:08,040
The color is dark brown.

463
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,469
Let alone this fishy odor...

464
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,829
And there is no firmness at all.

465
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,519
I would not eat this even if it were free.

466
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,119
Really?

467
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,252
Shoo, shoo!

468
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:30,650
What is wrong with you?

469
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:32,252
Shoo!

470
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,498
How do you even know this stuff?

471
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,817
Never mind. You'll just say,

472
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:46,524
"This Transcendent Genius never forgets what he sees"

473
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:48,767
and go on and on.

474
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,334
I learned it from my father.

475
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,530
 My father loved charcoal-grilled mackerel. 

476
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,843
Why the sudden shift in mood?

477
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,504
Is that why you suggested grilled mackerel?

478
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:25,576
Because you couldn't visit your father's grave?

479
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:29,820
Well, I also just wanted to eat it. Might as well.

480
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,062
That is the one!

481
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,102
Hello.

482
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:44,388
These fresh, crimson gills, this greenish sheen.

483
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:47,288
This is exactly the mackerel I have been looking for.

484
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:49,892
   

485
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:52,414
But this is way too expensive!

486
00:31:52,414 --> 00:31:56,523
Then, are you suggesting we serve subpar food on our first day?

487
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,345
Can we get a discount?

488
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,220
Since this is our grand opening,

489
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,800
we should serve red bean rice cake to ward off bad luck.

490
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,148
Do you even know how tight our budget is?

491
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:21,657
We still have so much to buy. Forget the rice cakes.

492
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:24,443
In Joseon, it was customary

493
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,339
to eat red bean dishes on important days to drive away misfortune.

494
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,284
Think about it.

495
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:35,615
If you could ward off bad luck with just a little money, would you not?

496
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:38,238
I don't believe in such things.

497
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:41,883
Only weak-minded people cling to superstitions.

498
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:43,483
Let's go, hurry up.

499
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,531
These look delicious.

500
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:57,900
- I should add them to today's stew. 
 - Good idea.

501
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,268
Sir, we'll take all the zucchinis.

502
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:03,164
Thank you.

503
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,737
Thank you.

504
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:10,123
Have a nice day.

505
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,947
We got the mackerel

506
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,355
and zucchinis.

507
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,200
What's wrong? Did we forget something?

508
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:39,953
What is it?

509
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:41,490
That old man...

510
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,207
He is gone.

511
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:51,004
 You do not even realize your own life is hanging by a thread. 

512
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:54,900
 What do you mean? 

513
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,700
 What did you just say about my life? 

514
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,990
 Consider yourself lucky. 

515
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,900
 This mere treat just saved your life. 

516
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:23,222
He was right here... Where did he go?

517
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,529
Welcome!

518
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,669
- Can I ask you something? 
 - Sure.

519
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:34,853
Have you seen the old man who was selling zucchinis here?

520
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,317
What are you talking about?

521
00:34:36,317 --> 00:34:39,064
That's just our storage area.

522
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:44,887
Mister, do you remember where red bean rice cakes were sold?

523
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:50,340
We're going live?

524
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,776
Of course, it's a live broadcast.

525
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:56,613
How would we prove it's a reality if it's not streamed live?

526
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:04,107
Wait, and who are those people?

527
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:08,010
We invited influencers in this field.

528
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,665
They'll be eating the same dish as you to help set the mood.

529
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:15,271
You never mentioned that.

530
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:18,400
Are you saying you can't handle a little unpredictability?

531
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,883
Aren't you a professional?

532
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:30,429
If it weren't for that Issue Patch article, I swear...

533
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:34,537
What do I do if I can't warm up to my fake dating scandal partner?

534
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:36,777
You look pretty today, so just endure it.

535
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:44,093
Mom, I'm reopening the diner starting today.

536
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:49,216
Turns out, this guy can actually cook.

537
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,900
Guess even a dung beetle has its tricks.

538
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,700
How dare you compare a Transcendent Genius to a dung beetle?

539
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,000
He insisted on visiting you, so we came together.

540
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,600
Madam, I will be helping your daughter keep the diner running,

541
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,683
so get well soon.

542
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,186
Yes.

543
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:15,103
If you don't want to see me struggling, wake up soon, okay?

544
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:20,920
Visiting hours are over.

545
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,700
- Has it already been ten minutes? 
 - Yes.

546
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,492
Mom, I'll be back.

547
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:47,512
I have not forgotten the meal you generously gave me.

548
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:52,611
How can I possibly forget it when that meal saved my life?

549
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:57,782
So now, I will start repaying that debt.

550
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,382
Mister.

551
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:05,920
I will not let her struggle, so do not worry.

552
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,641
Then...

553
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:09,399
Wait for me!

554
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,440
â™«  The night you came to me  â™«

555
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,160
â™«  Ten seconds before my heart stopped  â™«

556
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,140
â™«  I knew I fall in love  â™«

557
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:38,590
â™«  Could it be that I fell in love?  â™«

558
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,910
â™«  One, two, three, four, I hold your hand  â™«

559
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,460
â™«  Five, six, our eyes meet  â™«

560
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,850
â™«  Seven, eight, nine, ten, I only see you  â™«

561
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,020
â™«  Only you, oh, only you  â™«

562
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,370
â™«  So with you  â™«

563
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,480
â™«  So with you  â™«

564
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,310
â™«  So with you  â™«

565
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,038
Okay, we're going live.

566
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:12,519
Five, four, three.

567
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:28,276
So gorgeous.

568
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:32,359
My hair and makeup are flawless. 
    

569
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,249
Ms. Mi Sol?

570
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:37,255
Please focus on the food.

571
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:38,476
   
   

572
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:41,188
   
   

573
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,162
Here's the appetizer.

574
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:47,395
Its flavor is just as vibrant as the plating.

575
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,594
It's delicious.

576
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:05,709
   
   

577
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,246
   
   

578
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:08,603
   
   

579
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:09,894
   
   

580
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,274
   
   

581
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:20,425
This dish is our honey hairtail dumpling soup.

582
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:24,611
Enjoy the dumpling first, then savor the broth.

583
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:31,605
   
   

584
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:32,791
   
   

585
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,043
   
   

586
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:36,418
   
   

587
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,927
Mi Sol is eating well today.

588
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:56,477
 Mom, I don't feel good. 

589
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:02,635
 Cut. 

590
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,300
 - She looks bigger. 
 - Yes, she does. 

591
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,542
 Director, she's a growing child. 

592
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,191
 You don't have a plan for that? 

593
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:16,965
 Let's move on to the next scene! 

594
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:19,062
 Bring the batteries here. 

595
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,461
 She's gotten way too big. 

596
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:39,919
 She was so cute as a kid, but now... 

597
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,919
 Mi Sol's done for. 

598
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,109
 Poor girl, really. 

599
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,904
 She's only doing this because her mom makes her. 

600
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:49,697
 Exactly, it's always about the money. 

601
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,077
 She's not even a child actor anymore. She's junior now. 

602
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,688
 Yeah, she could pass for a student now. 

603
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:10,437
   
   

604
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:12,797
   
   

605
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:15,146
This is our signature dish.

606
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:18,688
A Korean beef strip loin steak, delicately infused with saffron.

607
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:22,491
The plating takes inspiration from traditional ink-wash paintings.

608
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:26,098
First, feast with your eyes, then take in the aroma, and savor the taste.

609
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:30,000
All three sensations come together on a single plate.

610
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,100
Give me a moment. Just a moment.

611
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,390
Can we take a break for a moment?

612
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,791
We can't stop the broadcast.

613
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,254
People will suspect it's staged.

614
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:42,076
Please.

615
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:59,488
The rice is cooked so perfectly, I wonder who made it.

616
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:03,117
We are all set.

617
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:15,086
Get in line!

618
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:27,582
Not a single soul.

619
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:34,903
Did closing for a few days really drive everyone away?

620
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,808
We bought way too much mackerel.

621
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:45,640
Not to mention all this rice.

622
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,806
And that rice cake we didn't even plan for.

623
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:51,466
What are we going to do if we can't sell all this?

624
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:56,709
How deep in the red are we today?

625
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,771
 Why do I keep running into people here 

626
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:06,231
 who look exactly like those I knew in Joseon? 

627
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,656
I'm stressing over the business,

628
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:15,281
but look at you, all carefree.

629
00:43:16,771 --> 00:43:21,377
As long as you get paid, you don't care if we have customers or not, right?

630
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:26,483
There is somewhere I need to go.

631
00:43:27,086 --> 00:43:29,686
You're on the clock, so no.

632
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:34,273
I will go and share the rice cakes.

633
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:37,923
   
   

634
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,462
   
   

635
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:41,056
   
   

636
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,310
   
   

637
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,436
   
   

638
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:44,475
   

639
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:48,605
   
   

640
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,193
Mae Chang!

641
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,365
Are you feeling unwell?

642
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,146
I will call the doctor.

643
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:07,902
Hey, wait...

644
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:10,404
My hair, hold my hair.

645
00:44:10,404 --> 00:44:13,047
H-Hair?

646
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:17,471
Then, please excuse me.

647
00:44:21,713 --> 00:44:23,329
Yes, sir.

648
00:44:23,926 --> 00:44:25,288
Oh, the live broadcast...

649
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,181
I have no idea what just happened either.

650
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:31,298
I sincerely apologize.

651
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:33,726
Oh, that's better.

652
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:40,052
Wait, aren't you that stalker?

653
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,652
Do you know me?

654
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:45,043
I know you, too.

655
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:48,035
Mae Chang, do you remember me?

656
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:49,355
Oh, dear.

657
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:50,862
Jung Mi Sol!

658
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,988
What do you think you're doing?

659
00:44:52,988 --> 00:44:55,898
Are you trying to ruin my career?

660
00:44:57,463 --> 00:45:02,052
How do you plan to make up for this?

661
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:07,504
Look, I do not know what happened,

662
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,686
but it is not right to push someone who is clearly unwell.

663
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:13,640
And what brings you here again?

664
00:45:15,248 --> 00:45:17,525
- Jung Mi Sol! 
 - Please!

665
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:21,408
What's the meaning of this?

666
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:23,879
Here!

667
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,089
Have this to calm yourself.

668
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:29,732
It is for our opening.

669
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,762
Opening?

670
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:40,629
Welcome. Are you here to dine?

671
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:42,145
Yes, can I get the set menu?

672
00:45:42,145 --> 00:45:43,945
One set...

673
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,239
Oh, right! He's not here.

674
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:49,838
Seriously, this guy...

675
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:52,715
Please wait here. Don't go anywhere.

676
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:54,315
Okay.

677
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:01,536
How am I supposed to find someone who doesn't even have a cell phone?

678
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,541
What?

679
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,567
Isn't that Jung Mi Sol?

680
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:10,657
Come to think of it, I saw her at the salon as well...

681
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:14,219
 Mae Chang! 

682
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:21,087
Why, that mister...

683
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:26,653
Mister, you can't just run after a woman during work hours.

684
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,221
Are you going to keep doing this?

685
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:31,527
We have a customer!

686
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,531
Chef Lee.

687
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:39,144
I didn't know you were there.

688
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:43,244
Eun Sil... What's going on?

689
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:46,261
Am I supposed to believe what this man is saying?

690
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:50,678
You're reopening the diner?

691
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:52,297
Well...

692
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,527
Things got so hectic, so I didn't get a chance to tell you...

693
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:00,849
Mister, get back inside and take the customer's order.

694
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:05,642
I wanted to have a talk with him,

695
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:08,612
but let us save this conversation for later.

696
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:12,921
I will leave the rice cake here.

697
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:23,970
I hope Mae Chang is okay...

698
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:30,992
Oh, the customer!

699
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:34,839
I've decided to reopen the diner.

700
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:37,512
That man will be running the kitchen.

701
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:41,747
Wait, Eun Sil, you can't be serious...

702
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:46,331
You're really running the place with that man?

703
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:50,372
We shouldn't have a vagrant like that in our neighborhood!

704
00:47:50,372 --> 00:47:52,349
I thought we agreed on that?

705
00:47:53,258 --> 00:47:54,926
We did.

706
00:47:56,135 --> 00:48:00,093
I'm not usually this indecisive,

707
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:03,867
but he saved my mom, and...

708
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:07,122
Right now, he's someone I really need.

709
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:12,281
I thought you and I were on the same page, Eun Sil.

710
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:17,301
But I guess I was wrong.

711
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:20,606
I'll keep him in check.

712
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,603
I won't let him cause you any trouble.

713
00:48:29,714 --> 00:48:31,289
Just existing is a nuisance!

714
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:34,851
The existence of that diner itself!

715
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:42,177
Excuse me, sir.

716
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:44,303
Something has happened.

717
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:56,496
The meal isn't over yet.

718
00:48:58,826 --> 00:49:00,773
Please take your seats.

719
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:04,082
You should at least stay for the main dish.

720
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:21,226
Rosy seabass, found in deep waters,

721
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:26,183
is a delicacy known for its rich flavor.

722
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:27,904
The main dish of the day

723
00:49:27,904 --> 00:49:30,817
is rosy seabass hot stone pot rice.

724
00:49:37,803 --> 00:49:42,399
Wait, does this smell like mackerel?

725
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,609
Mackerel?

726
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:46,426
Oh? You're right.

727
00:49:46,426 --> 00:49:48,110
This smells like mackerel.

728
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,531
Is this really rosy seabass?

729
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:30,926
The restaurant is full, so don't let anyone else in.

730
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:32,540
All right.

731
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:37,757
Get in line!

732
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:48,420


733
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,882
Hello!

734
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,670
â™«  One, two, three, four, I hold your hand  â™«

735
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:08,300
â™«  Five, six, our eyes meet  â™«

736
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,530
â™«  Seven, eight, nine, ten, I only see you  â™«

737
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:18,850
â™«  Only you, oh, only you  â™«

738
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:23,930
â™«  So with you (Oh-woah, oh-woah)  â™«

739
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,690
â™«  Only you  â™«

740
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:32,810
â™«  One, two, three, four, five  â™« 
 â™«  My heart stopped when I met you  â™«

741
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,900
â™«  When I met you  â™« 
 â™«  So with you  â™«

742
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,390
â™«  The night I first met you  â™«

743
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,690
â™«  I lost my sight for ten seconds  â™«
