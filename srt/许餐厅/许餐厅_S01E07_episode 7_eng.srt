1
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,044
   

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:06,444
   

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,560
   

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:11,580
   

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,010
   

6
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:17,720
       

7
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:25,797
   

8
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:29,233
   

9
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,816
   

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,477
Let's work together.

11
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:36,273
I'll give you the best possible offer.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,860


13
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:55,937
As you said, the diner looks humble and has barely any customers.

14
00:00:55,937 --> 00:01:00,270
But still, I am the one in charge of the kitchen at that diner.

15
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:04,401
This place will be fine without me.

16
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:09,079
But the diner would not even be open if I were not here.

17
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:17,230
Lady Eun Sil, you see, has a knack for making inedible food.

18
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:24,524
You must care about her a lot.

19
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:29,638
She may put on a tough front,

20
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:32,236
but deep down she is quite delicate.

21
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:37,167
That is precisely why I'm saying this.

22
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:42,658
Right now, she must be feeling incredibly anxious about money.

23
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:48,567
From what I know, she can barely cover her mother's hospital bills.

24
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,373
Indeed.

25
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:55,341
Money is all she can think about these days.

26
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:59,358
If I accept your offer,

27
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:02,750
will you provide enough to cover the hospital expenses?

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,488
Of course. Haven't I promised you the best possible offer?

29
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:42,267
It is an offer I never once considered, so I cannot help but feel conflicted.

30
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:48,414
Then start considering it now.

31
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,157
Have a seat.

32
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:59,634
By the way, what should I call you?

33
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:02,349
Please call me Gyosan.

34
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,928
That is what Gwansong used to call me.

35
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:09,082
The one you said I resemble?

36
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,609
Yes.

37
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:16,681
Strangely enough, this moment feels like something I have seen before.

38
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,782
Gwansong once made me a special offer as well.

39
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,094
That was the last time I saw him.

40
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:28,110
What was he like?

41
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,536
The man who resembles me.

42
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,823
He was entirely devoted to his work,

43
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:40,389
a man completely different from a wanderer like me.

44
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,682
Yet, despite our differences, he always looked out for me.

45
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,221
I will always be grateful for that.

46
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:49,354
That's intriguing.

47
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:53,315
I'd like to hear more stories.

48
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,504
There's still some drink left,

49
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,774
so why not stay for a few more?

50
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:01,474
The night is long, after all.

51
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:50,130
What a pitiful display.

52
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,053
Confess now, and this will all end swiftly.

53
00:04:54,053 --> 00:05:00,542
How can we confess to a crime we never committed?

54
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:06,608
You conspired treason against the throne,

55
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,145
plotted to slay the king,

56
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,465
and sought to enthrone Prince Yeongchang.

57
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,974
Treason?

58
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:18,808
That is absurd.

59
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:21,573
We are mere illegitimate sons.

60
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:24,383
You, of all people, should know

61
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:28,723
we are utterly powerless to attempt such a thing.

62
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,735
Denying it will not make the crime vanish.

63
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:41,288
You are only prolonging your agony.

64
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,209
You are far more foolish than I thought.

65
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:59,692
Your Excellency!

66
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,135
Please summon Gyosan.

67
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:09,898
He will prove our innocence!

68
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:12,515
I would like to grant your request...

69
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:14,168
but unfortunately...

70
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,675
I have no means to summon the dead.

71
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:21,640
Gyosan...

72
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,250
is dead?

73
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:29,040
How? Why?

74
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,599
Unbelievable.

75
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:38,450
Even now, you choose to worry about others?

76
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,220
 Tonight, the moon's radiance is at its peak. 

77
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,777
I drink, reluctant to let the sight go to waste.

78
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:19,842
The wanderer's heart grows wistful.

79
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:24,881
Ancient souls must have gazed upon this same moon,

80
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:29,835
yet who among them still remains?

81
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,498
That is a truly beautiful poem,

82
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:41,951
and it fits the mood of tonight perfectly.

83
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,371
It feels a little embarrassing to say this myself,

84
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,785
but when it comes to literary talent,

85
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,198
this Transcendent Genius stands second to none.

86
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,474
You truly are a man of many talents.

87
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,030
The more I learn about you,

88
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,390
the more I want us to work together.

89
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:02,297
My goodness...

90
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:06,831
The less time you spend hesitating, the better.

91
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,848
Especially if you consider Eun Sil,

92
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:15,205
who's struggling to make ends meet as we speak.

93
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:17,620
I...

94
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,969
Sorry, it's my alarm.

95
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,778
Time has flown by.

96
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,385
Alarm?

97
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,520
It's music that wakes you up.

98
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,033
I wake up to this music every day at 4 AM.

99
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:50,620
Wait, so dawn has already broken?

100
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:55,755
Yes, we stayed up all night.

101
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:58,818
I didn't even notice the time passing.

102
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:01,185
I better get going now.

103
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,565
As for your offer,

104
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:08,102
I will give it careful thought and decide soon.

105
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:14,398
Good, I will be waiting for good news.

106
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,555
Oh, and...

107
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:26,930
about that music called "alarm."

108
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,650
It feels strangely familiar.

109
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,440
Never mind.

110
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,400
If I had heard it before, there is no way a Transcendent Genius like me would forget it.

111
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,737
It must be the drinks confusing me.

112
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,771
Then, I will take my leave.

113
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,549
Mr. Homeless?

114
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,631
What took you so long to get back?

115
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:24,594
Why are you not resting upstairs?

116
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:29,562
How could I possibly sleep when you left without a word?

117
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,128
Wait.

118
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:36,029
You stayed out all night.

119
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,231
Where have you been?

120
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,863
 Let's work together. 

121
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:43,381
 I'll give you the best possible offer. 

122
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,480
I was meeting a friend.

123
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,378
A friend?

124
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:52,540
You came from the past with no home or ties, and now you have a friend?

125
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,140
Yes.

126
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:03,868
- Hang on! You even had drinks. 
 - Enough!

127
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:08,066
You cannot condemn a man for enjoying drinks with a friend.

128
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,666
Must you pry so much?

129
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,487
So you waltzed out in the middle of work

130
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:15,585
while I was left painting and setting up all alone,

131
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,748
and now you stroll in the next day acting all high and mighty?

132
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:25,436
Well, you are the one who started it,

133
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,790
so it is only right you finish it.

134
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,715
Excuse me?

135
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,955
I am exhausted.

136
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,119
I should rest my eyes even for a bit.

137
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:56,324
 Perhaps among all places in the future, there is a reason I ended up here. 

138
00:11:56,324 --> 00:12:01,754
 And that reason is most likely tied to Gwansong. 

139
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,615
 Otherwise... 

140
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:10,222
 Are you content to stay in that shabby diner for the rest of your days? 

141
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:14,397
 Are you content to live like this for the rest of your days? 

142
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:16,540
 Could it really be a mere coincidence 

143
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,280
 that someone so much like him exists here? 

144
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,331
 If I work with him, perhaps I will find the answer, 

145
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:30,500
 and in doing so I may uncover 

146
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,220
 why I ended up here... 

147
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,637
 and how I can return. 

148
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:39,680
One thing is certain,

149
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,670
I will gain far more than I would by staying at the diner.

150
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:44,294
Gain what?

151
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,560
Gain what more than staying at the diner?

152
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,769
I heard everything!

153
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,861
Do not talk to someone who is asleep.

154
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,879
Who talks back in their sleep?

155
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:07,515
I am just talking in my sleep, that is all.

156
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:22,079
He's acting suspicious.

157
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,461
   
   

158
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,867
Mister, doesn't something look different?

159
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,482
Mister!

160
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:54,781
What did you say?

161
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:57,808
I asked if you noticed any changes!

162
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:05,698
The walls are cleaner, and so are the tables.

163
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,487
What else?

164
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:12,057
What else is there?

165
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:15,548
Take a close look.

166
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,355
Mister.

167
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:21,968
- Mister! 
 - Yes, yes?

168
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:25,129
Why are you so distracted?

169
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:29,032
Did you ask me if I noticed something?

170
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,285
Forget it, let's get ready to open.

171
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:10,802
 I thought today would be busy... 

172
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:14,283
We caught the culprit, cleared our name,

173
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:18,124
and even gave the place a full makeover.

174
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:24,372
I did everything I could, so why aren't there any customers?

175
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:14,202
Young lady, sit down for a moment.

176
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,897
Business is still slow, so instead of both of us waiting for customers who never come...

177
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:31,924
Would it not be better if at least one of us goes out and earns some money?

178
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,724
You said you were desperate for money.

179
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:39,510
I was already thinking of picking up a night shift somewhere.

180
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,104
Though it won't be much.

181
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:47,245
Instead of that, how about I work at another restaurant?

182
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:49,604
What do you mean?

183
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:57,065
Are you saying you're quitting?

184
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:03,477
Is this related to your overnight trip?

185
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,967
That's why you've been acting so weird!

186
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:10,606
I knew something was off!

187
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:16,102
I was offered a good deal last night.

188
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:20,707
If I go work for them, they will pay enough to cover all my concerns.

189
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,279
So...

190
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,220
what's your thought?

191
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,385
Do you want to go?

192
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:31,886
- There are no customers— 
 - Don't use that as an excuse!

193
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:34,772
I'm asking what you want.

194
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,551
I want to work there.

195
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:45,314
I feel like the answers I am searching for are there.

196
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:48,033
Where would that be?

197
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:52,510
Who is offering you so much?

198
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,302
Actually...

199
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,708
The one who made me that offer last night…

200
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,384
Oh, I'm starving!

201
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,800
So hungry I'm getting dizzy.

202
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,760
You did say I could come anytime, right?

203
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:17,344
Then why does it always feel so tense here?

204
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:19,595
Mi Sol, you're here.

205
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:22,087
Yeah, I'm here.

206
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,449
But I feel like I shouldn't be.

207
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:26,894
That's not true. Take a seat.

208
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:35,639
What's going on? Did you two fight again?

209
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,933
Are you eating well, Mae Chang?

210
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:43,928
If I were, I wouldn't be here.

211
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:48,358
I tried eating again after your porridge...

212
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,561
 Wait, that's Jung Mi Sol, right? 

213
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,100
 I heard she binge-vomits. Is she here to eat? 

214
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,860
 Is she here to eat? 

215
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:08,726
 Guess the rumors were true. 

216
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,750
I failed every time.

217
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,749
But what's worse is the people who film and upload videos of me.

218
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:21,937
They get off on other people's misery.

219
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:24,695
My faith in humanity is at an all-time low.

220
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:28,525
What do you feel like eating, Mae Chang?

221
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:31,143
Since you are here, have as much as you want.

222
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:33,147
Something quick, please.

223
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:35,705
I'm seriously starving.

224
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:38,228
When I wasn't eating at all, I didn't feel it,

225
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:41,636
but ever since I had your porridge, I've been getting hungry all the time.

226
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:45,154
All right, wait just a moment.

227
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:51,729
I wish someone would film me actually eating for once.

228
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,656
How is this place so empty?

229
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:00,366
It just happened somehow.

230
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,645
What is this diner's problem, anyway?

231
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:08,300
I mean, the food is good, the atmosphere is...

232
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:13,059
decent, and it's affordable.

233
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,268
I really don't know what more I can do at this point.

234
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:23,879
You might just be our last customer.

235
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,082
Here is the goldongban.

236
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,978
I mean, bibimbap.

237
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,662
We prepared quite a lot, expecting more customers.

238
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,446
I am glad you are here to eat some, at least.

239
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:52,135
Why are you two so down today?

240
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:54,546
You are not the only ones struggling here,

241
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,803
I'm flopping too!

242
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:02,808
So let's not sit here acting like it's the end of the world.

243
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,689
You're right.

244
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:07,549
It's not like I was ever a success anyway.

245
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:09,853
Let's do that!

246
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,691
Yeah, exactly.

247
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:14,780
By the way, is this soy sauce?

248
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,185
Where's the gochujang?

249
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,530
Try it first.

250
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,810
If you do not like it, I will switch it.

251
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,045
It's amazing.

252
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,947
Is this the same soy sauce I know?

253
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:42,437
I simmered it with clams and vegetables for a deeper flavor.

254
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,489
Take your time eating. There is no need to rush.

255
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:52,933
I need to show people how well I can eat.

256
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,677
Eun Sil.

257
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:58,695
Film me!

258
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,041
Me?

259
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,654
Just act as if you're not the owner,

260
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:07,057
as if you just happened to walk in for a meal

261
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,717
and stumbled upon the lovely Jung Mi Sol enjoying her food.

262
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,855
Something like that.

263
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:15,628
Why should I?

264
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:19,738
At least one of us should make it. We can't all go down together.

265
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,089
Make sure it shows clearly up to here.

266
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,254
Okay.

267
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,590
Here you go.

268
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,090
You do know I'm single-handedly raising your sales, right?

269
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,856
I should be your VIP.

270
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,567
A VIP at a diner?

271
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,952
What was that?

272
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,638
Nothing.

273
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:57,860
Don't fight when I'm gone.

274
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,540
I hope you two run this business peacefully.

275
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,694
Will do. Get home safe.

276
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:04,165
Okay, bye.

277
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,815
See you.

278
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,583
We should head inside.

279
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,360
Mr. Homeless.

280
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:23,138
I've been thinking.

281
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:25,554
You truly are gifted.

282
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:30,372
I knew your talent was something anyone would want.

283
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,715
And I've always felt bad for not giving you

284
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:37,155
the treatment you deserved.

285
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:42,484
But now that there's a place willing to do that,

286
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,794
I'm truly happy for you.

287
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:47,300
This works out well for all of us.

288
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:51,006
I will cover the madam's hospital bills.

289
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:55,256
Why would you do that?

290
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:57,665
You should be careful.

291
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,861
You can't go around giving money to someone you barely know.

292
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:03,516
Do this for the wrong person, and you'll be taken advantage of.

293
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:06,428
I do not need money.

294
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:10,467
I only considered another job because I needed to confirm something.

295
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,761
That is all there is to it.

296
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:18,246
- So, take my earnings for your mother's... 
 - I'll handle my mom's hospital bills myself

297
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:24,194
by selling this diner.

298
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,557
That should cover the cost.

299
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:33,924
But you said you would keep the place until she woke up.

300
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:36,500
Life doesn't go as planned.

301
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,064
Come to think of it,

302
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:43,218
I don't think it ever went as planned.

303
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:48,817
Enough talking.

304
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:54,756
I wish you all the best.

305
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:57,219
Young lady.

306
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:01,007
Thank you for everything.

307
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,269
Young lady!

308
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:23,876
She held onto this place all this time, but why...

309
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,152
Wait.

310
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:34,848
This is...

311
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:38,749
 I took care of the sign while I was out. 

312
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:40,414
 I picked a name for the restaurant. 

313
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,035
 What did you name it? 

314
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:45,168
 You'll see for yourself later. 

315
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,434
   

316
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:50,485
So, she knew my name.

317
00:25:56,772 --> 00:26:00,010
   

318
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:05,418
However, I must find a way to return.

319
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,749
I know you were always tied to the diner.

320
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,788
But Mom, we don't have a single photo of us on a trip together.

321
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:01,288
Back then, all I wanted was to escape this place.

322
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,521
Mom, I'm here.

323
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,090
I've decided... to close the diner.

324
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:24,660
Selling meals for 5,000 won barely makes any money,

325
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,096
and it's just too exhausting.

326
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:31,997
I guess this is just who I am.

327
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,103
I've never been able to see anything through.

328
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:42,865
I keep getting fired from jobs, one after another...

329
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:52,254
I'm sorry, Mom.

330
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:06,252
I wanted to hold out until you came back...

331
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,017
but I don't even know why I'm like this.

332
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,851
Miss.

333
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,147
Hello.

334
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:49,544
A little while ago, your mother's nephew came to visit.

335
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:52,923
- My mom's nephew? 
 - Yes.

336
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:56,127
He was very persistent, so I let him in just for a moment,

337
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:58,405
but I wanted to let you know.

338
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,571
I see.

339
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,783
He seemed really concerned about her

340
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,978
and asked a lot of questions about her,

341
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:06,542
but I didn't say anything due to medical privacy laws.

342
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:09,235
Okay, thank you.

343
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:12,340
Who could it be?

344
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,671
   

345
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,246
Eun Sil.

346
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,930
I'm sorry for dropping by unannounced.

347
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:31,230
There is no need to apologize.

348
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,047
Have a seat.

349
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:44,290
So, what brings you here?

350
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,382
I know this is shameless of me,

351
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:52,539
but I came to beg you to buy our diner.

352
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,499
You haven't forgotten, have you?

353
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,584
You once said you'd buy it at a good price.

354
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:07,921
Are you closing the diner?

355
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:10,667
Yes.

356
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,906
I should've never run a restaurant when I can't even cook.

357
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:22,297
Am I too late?

358
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:24,365
No, not at all.

359
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:27,999
I told you to come anytime, didn't I?

360
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:31,519
Let's move forward right away.

361
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,388
Right away?

362
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,636
Didn't you already make up your mind?

363
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:57,378
Yes, I did.

364
00:30:57,378 --> 00:31:00,467
I just didn't think it'd happen this fast...

365
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,281
You know what?

366
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,755
Let's just get it done and dusted.

367
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,812
- Do I sign here? 
 - Yes.

368
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:11,472
Right here.

369
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:14,307
Stop right there!

370
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:25,792
How did you know I was here?

371
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,683
Are you here to bother the chef again?

372
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:33,679
I told you to stop that!

373
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,415
I'm sorry...

374
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,636
But this will be the last time.

375
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:49,039
Mr. Homeless is leaving our diner for another place.

376
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,536
So, this won't happen again.

377
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:56,803
I need an explanation, young lady.

378
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,966
I'm handing over the diner to Chef Lee.

379
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,298
I've already made up my mind.

380
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,475
What should we do with this?

381
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:12,835
It's fine. I'll get you a new one right away.

382
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:17,992
Are you truly willing to sell the place your mother built with blood and sweat?

383
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:22,887
Stay out of this, mister.

384
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:24,476
The diner is my business to handle.

385
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,909
Excuse me, it is not just a diner.

386
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,710
It is Heo's Diner.

387
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:38,100
And since the diner bears my name and I run the kitchen as suksu,

388
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,441
I have a say in this. 
    

389
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,497
Let us go.

390
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,885
What do you think you're doing?

391
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:52,139
Let go of her arm.

392
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:58,103
Gwansong, I am very sorry.

393
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:01,656
I cannot stand by and watch this deal happen.

394
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:05,223
You said you were leaving for a better place, so why are you doing this?

395
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:06,779
No.

396
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:09,859
I am not going anywhere.

397
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,931
I am staying at Heo's Diner.

398
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,116
Even if you stay, there are no customers.

399
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:20,763
There's no hope!

400
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:24,702
Whether we make it or break it, let us at least see it through to the end.

401
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,513
Is that not what you want too?

402
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:30,324
No, I've had enough.

403
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:34,258
I'm sick and tired of it now. I don't want to do it anymore.

404
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:36,235
If that is true,

405
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:40,070
why did you cry your heart out in front of your mother?

406
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,689
How do you know that...

407
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,093
Let us go.

408
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,180
If you do not want to regret it later,

409
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,530
let us give it everything we have now.

410
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:56,094
I know this is what you want.

411
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:03,028
- Eun Sil! 
 - Young lady!

412
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:05,279
Wait a moment.

413
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,602
Gyosan, don't you still have unfinished business with me?

414
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:19,375
I regretfully decline your offer.

415
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,468
It pains me because I genuinely wanted to work alongside you,

416
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:25,337
to get to know you better, to grow closer.

417
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:27,565
Then, why?

418
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,537
Even a beast repays kindness when it is saved.

419
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,760
Turning my back at a time like this

420
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,540
would not be something a person should do.

421
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:41,043
Even if it means delaying my own path,

422
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:44,793
this is something worth staying for.

423
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:49,544
You said all you got at that diner was a single meal.

424
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:52,020
Yes, it was a single meal,

425
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,624
but it saved me.

426
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,911
Even if I cannot work with you...

427
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:02,767
if you ever need my cooking, I will always be willing to help.

428
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,328
Who do you think you are, offering to help me?

429
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,310
I was the one offering to help you.

430
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,690
I don't need your cooking.

431
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:15,789
I can make better food with my eyes closed.

432
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,500
Well, of course.

433
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,909
You are the finest suksu, after all.

434
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:23,464
Forgive my audacity.

435
00:35:27,345 --> 00:35:29,729
You will regret turning down my offer

436
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:32,504
- for the rest... 
 - "For the rest of your life?"

437
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:39,611
This may be your first time saying it,

438
00:35:39,611 --> 00:35:42,031
but I have heard it before.

439
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,905
What do you mean?

440
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:50,939
So please, do not resent me for this.

441
00:35:51,723 --> 00:35:55,449
I still need your help.

442
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,658
Seriously...

443
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:03,591
The more I learn about you, the stranger you become.

444
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,013
You went to see my mom at the hospital?

445
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,468
Yes, I visited her.

446
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:42,149
So, you heard everything I told her?

447
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:46,705
It was not intentional, but yes, I did.

448
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,362
This is so embarrassing.

449
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:55,338
 I never meant to make her cry. 

450
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,119
 I am to blame for everything. 

451
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:06,315
 I assure you, I will never be the reason for her tears again. 

452
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:08,735
 Rest assured. 

453
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:14,135
I heard you pretended to be my mom's nephew

454
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:17,035
to ask the nurse about her condition.

455
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,610
I sneaked inside, avoiding the nurses

456
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,368
because I learned my lesson last time.

457
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:28,006
Then, who was it?

458
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:33,100
Let us not waste time and prepare for business.

459
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,565
And who are we serving?

460
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,863
We need customers for that.

461
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,861
It looks like another day of twiddling our thumbs.

462
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,154
Again!

463
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:46,811
Did I not say that words have power?

464
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,663
Now then, repeat after me.

465
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:53,259
Heo's Diner, let us make it big!

466
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:55,825
No, why would I do such a thing?

467
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:59,129
Do you not want Heo's Diner to succeed?

468
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,194
Heo's Diner, let us make it big.

469
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,752
No! Louder!

470
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,347
Heo's Diner, let us make it big!

471
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:13,819
Heo's Diner, let us make it big.

472
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:16,298
Heo's Diner, let us go!

473
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:18,803
Heo's Diner, let us go!

474
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,244
Excuse me...

475
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:25,518
Is this the place Jung Mi Sol visited?

476
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,097
Yes, it is.

477
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,046
This is the place!

478
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:30,644
No way!

479
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:33,516
See? I told you.

480
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:35,749
Please take a seat.

481
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:38,110
Welcome.

482
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,416
Here are two pork kimchi stews.

483
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:47,269
Enjoy.

484
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:49,091
This looks amazing.

485
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:55,027
- How do you know Jung Mi Sol? 
 - Sorry?

486
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:58,798
You asked if this was the place she visited.

487
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:01,697
You haven't seen her bibimbap video?

488
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:04,769
She probably doesn't know it went viral.

489
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,030
When did she even get it edited and uploaded everywhere?

490
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:25,553
One million views in a day?

491
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:34,723
 Heo's Diner in Seonbuk-dong, approved by Jung Mi Sol. 

492
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:38,086
 You can find it on the search engine. 

493
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,170
 I've been there, and it was amazing. 

494
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,553
 Heo's Diner is the best! 

495
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,768
 Heo's Diner serves new menus daily. 5,000 won per serving. 

496
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:48,953
 Is this price real? 

497
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:53,688
 The owner of Heo's Diner shows up. 

498
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,525
- Welcome. 
 - Do you have a table for two?

499
00:39:58,525 --> 00:40:00,008
Yes.

500
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:21,480
Who's that?

501
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:29,719
What are you doing?

502
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,306
Your VIP is here, and you're just letting me stand around?

503
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:36,880
Come and sit over here.

504
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:43,591
You must've been working today.

505
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,503
No.

506
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:47,767
I was at home.

507
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,666
But your outfit...

508
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,570
This is just my neighborhood look.

509
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,053
A fancy face with a not-so-fancy palate.

510
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:00,455
This is what drives people wild.

511
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:04,480
Feel free to take pictures.

512
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,348
Please upload them.

513
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:11,635
Anyway, thanks.

514
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,944
It looks like the place is blowing up thanks to you.

515
00:41:15,944 --> 00:41:17,620
I know, right?

516
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,302
This type of celebrity marketing comes with a price.

517
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:24,701
But since we were all flopping together, I'll do it for free.

518
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,789
Yeah, okay.

519
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:31,438
From now on, you're the VVIP of Heo's Diner.

520
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,170
Mae Chang!

521
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:41,668
Here.

522
00:41:43,713 --> 00:41:46,364
I added extra meat to your stew, Mae Chang.

523
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:47,615
You're the best!

524
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:50,318
How did you know I was craving meat?

525
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:51,822
Thank you.

526
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,891
What a shame... if only he were as famous as Lee Hyuk.

527
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:02,693
I could've skyrocketed his fame with a dating scandal.

528
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:06,125
Who would he even date?

529
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,697
Who else? Me, obviously.

530
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:11,114
He's single, right?

531
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,782
Yeah.

532
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:15,536
Okay, then I call dibs!

533
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,806
Eun Sil, can you get me some water?

534
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:20,538
Water is self-serve! Self-serve!

535
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,640
What?

536
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,875
You said I was the VVIP!

537
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:38,530
 The dignitary wishes to showcase authentic Korean flavors to the state guests. 

538
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,053
She asked, "Can I eat this?"

539
00:42:58,053 --> 00:42:59,502
- Seriously? 
 - No, you can't!

540
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:01,567
What's that about?

541
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:09,476
Didn't I tell you not to interrupt me while I'm developing a recipe?

542
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:11,176
We're sorry.

543
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,871
 If you ever need my cooking, I will always be willing to help. 

544
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:38,181
How dare he...

545
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:43,705
Well, what do we have here?

546
00:43:44,724 --> 00:43:47,117
Aren't you Chef Lee?

547
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:48,420
Long time no see.

548
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,160
What brings you here?

549
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,512
Are you here to harm me again?

550
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:57,871
Let me be clear, if you try anything like last time...

551
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:01,883
I'll make sure you don't get to wander around so freely.

552
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:06,080
Relax, I'm not here to start trouble. I just came to eat.

553
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,726
Don't be so paranoid.

554
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:14,372
Jung Mi Sol, you're banned from ever stepping foot in my restaurant.

555
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:17,779
Who said I wanted to go in there?

556
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:19,899
I only eat at Heo's Diner.

557
00:44:19,899 --> 00:44:23,798
At least their food does not sit like a rock in my stomach.

558
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,583
Why couldn't they have put another restaurant across from Heo's Diner?

559
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:35,215
Anyway, as a VIP, I'll be visiting Heo's Diner often.

560
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,822
Let's do our best to avoid each other.

561
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:40,038
I'd rather not ruin my appetite.

562
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,622
Welcome.

563
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:05,107
Please have a seat over here.

564
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,481
Excuse me? Can we change seats?

565
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:20,356
I'm sorry, but there are no other seats available.

566
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,601
Then send this old man out.

567
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:24,756
How are we supposed to eat like this?

568
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:28,566
I'm sorry, but we can't ask a customer to leave for that reason.

569
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:33,107
If you feel that way, you're free to leave instead.

570
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:35,162
Would you like to cancel your order?

571
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,162
Unbelievable.

572
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:41,891
Come on, let's go.

573
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:50,264
Would you like a set?

574
00:45:54,446 --> 00:45:57,684
All right, one set coming right up!

575
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:16,677
Don't worry about it.

576
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:24,399
Do I look like a shameless old man who came to eat for free?

577
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:26,511
That's not what I meant...

578
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,747
Sir!

579
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,202
You should take your change.

580
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:35,460
Then take care.

581
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:39,051
How is your mother doing?

582
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:43,643
Do you know my mom?

583
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:46,512
I used to come here to eat from time to time.

584
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,600
She is a truly kind person…

585
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,061
It's such a shame what happened to her.

586
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,202
Thank you.

587
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:56,766
She hasn't gotten any better.

588
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:08,053
Why are you giving this to me?

589
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:14,321
Rain is coming, a heavy one.

590
00:47:26,556 --> 00:47:29,091
Excuse me...

591
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:33,036
I heard that the patient in the ICU is in critical condition.

592
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:35,673
Could you give me an update on her current status?

593
00:47:35,673 --> 00:47:37,810
I'm just really anxious...

594
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:40,732
One moment, please.

595
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,138
Which patient's guardian are you?

596
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:44,382
This one right here.

597
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:46,424
I'm her nephew.

598
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:48,397
We've taken all the necessary measures,

599
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:51,663
but we'll need to monitor the situation over time.

600
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:54,226
Okay, thank you.

601
00:47:58,324 --> 00:48:02,954
 Neither alive nor dead. 

602
00:48:03,857 --> 00:48:06,308
She's unconscious and unresponsive,

603
00:48:06,308 --> 00:48:09,279
still breathing just as she was at the time of the accident,

604
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:13,025
but her independent breathing is weakening.

605
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:15,913
How long do they think she has?

606
00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:17,401
Who knows?

607
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:20,325
They don't really share that kind of information.

608
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:22,298
Hospital staff are strict.

609
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:26,490
Even if you're the police, they'll tell you to bring a warrant.

610
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:30,519
This is all I managed to find out.

611
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,722
I wish she'd just disappear already.

612
00:48:39,091 --> 00:48:42,005
Come on, you shouldn't say such a thing.

613
00:48:47,317 --> 00:48:49,528
What did you just say?

614
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,320
It's nothing.

615
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,430
   

616
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:06,831
I know I'm running errands for him,

617
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:10,393
but I'm a cop. He should mind what he says.

618
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:17,840
   

619
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,461
Getting treated like a fool by some snot-nosed kid...

620
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,094
How much longer do I have to put up with this?

621
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,361
Hey there.

622
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,698
One moment.

623
00:49:56,698 --> 00:49:59,073
I was trying to slip by quietly.

624
00:49:59,073 --> 00:50:00,977
Forget that.

625
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:03,746
Go buy a set menu from the diner nearby.

626
00:50:03,746 --> 00:50:06,107
But why...

627
00:50:08,522 --> 00:50:11,590
I just noticed earlier that they were closed.

628
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:16,460
It seems they shut down as soon as they ran out of ingredients.

629
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:24,258
I see. You can go.

630
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,960
   

631
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:31,628
I have never seen colors like these before.

632
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,113
They are truly mesmerizing.

633
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,117
What kind of color is this?

634
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,403
- Would you like to see it? 
 - Yes, please.

635
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,272
- This one, too! 
 - This one as well?

636
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,975
I want to see it.

637
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:46,559
- This is... 
 - Mister.

638
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,533
Here, come over here.

639
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:51,762
Choose one from here.

640
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:53,420
Right here.

641
00:50:54,472 --> 00:50:59,122
With this, you can freeze moments in time, just like Mae Chang did?

642
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,097
Yes, you can film videos.

643
00:51:01,097 --> 00:51:02,958
And you can pick a fight, too.

644
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,301
Yes, you can leave comments.

645
00:51:06,301 --> 00:51:09,034
Can I also track down someone?

646
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:11,981
Yes, you can access the Internet.

647
00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:15,077
Splendid.

648
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:18,235
Then how about this...

649
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:20,664
They're all pretty much the same.

650
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,603
We'll take this one.

651
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:27,807
Got it.

652
00:51:27,807 --> 00:51:30,089
Yes, I'm Bong Eun Sil

653
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:32,324
and I can hear you clearly.

654
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:36,143
Can you still hear me?

655
00:51:41,008 --> 00:51:42,959
Can you hear me?

656
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:48,021
Can you really hear me?

657
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:50,819
This is unbelievable!

658
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:54,832
How does it sound so clear from afar?

659
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:57,540
We can talk without the phone now.

660
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,401
Oh, right!

661
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:02,893
It sounds so real, I nearly forgot!

662
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:08,090
Wherever you go, make sure you keep it with you.

663
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:12,565
Every time you disappear, my heart drops.

664
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:18,370
Because you fear never seeing me again?

665
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,339
Because I fear the diner won't open.

666
00:52:22,855 --> 00:52:24,410
Understood.

667
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,130
I will keep it in my grasp at all times.

668
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:38,696
But why are you carrying that around?

669
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:41,567
Someone said it might rain today.

670
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:43,233
Rain?

671
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:48,782
The sky is clear.

672
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:50,766
You're right.

673
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:54,047
Even the weather forecast said nothing about rain...

674
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:59,154
But for some reason, I felt like I should bring it.

675
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:10,333
Just what on earth is the problem?

676
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:17,331
Excuse me, sir.

677
00:53:18,473 --> 00:53:21,075
It's time to prepare for dinner service.

678
00:53:21,975 --> 00:53:24,241
Should I tell them to wait a little longer?

679
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:28,478
No.

680
00:53:28,478 --> 00:53:32,582
I'll just step out for a moment. Make sure everything's ready.

681
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,528
Anyone here?

682
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,839
Eun Sil?

683
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,963
Gyosan?

684
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:02,633
This is truly fascinating.

685
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,789
How can something so small...

686
00:55:08,478 --> 00:55:12,583
Can this also play music called an "alarm"?

687
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:15,026
How do you even know about alarms?

688
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:19,210
Yeah, you can set alarms and ringtones too.

689
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,307
What would you like?

690
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:25,360
I liked Gwansong's music.

691
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,620
It sounded strangely familiar.

692
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,964
Chef Lee's?

693
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:35,290
Then it's probably not a default tone. He must have saved it manually.

694
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,412
If you don't know the title, I can't set it for you.

695
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:39,115
Is that so?

696
00:55:39,115 --> 00:55:41,111
What a shame...

697
00:55:43,738 --> 00:55:45,298
It looks like it is going to rain.

698
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:47,180
Let us hurry.

699
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:37,230
Wow, it really is raining.

700
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,133
I got goosebumps.

701
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:41,523
How did that old man know?

702
00:56:42,513 --> 00:56:44,472
I despise rainy days.

703
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:45,856
Let us hurry.

704
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:47,213
Really?

705
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:48,899
I like the rain.

706
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:53,068
Try to listen. Doesn't it sound just like music?

707
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:56,598
You are sentimental for no reason.

708
00:56:56,598 --> 00:56:58,537
Let us hurry.

709
00:56:58,537 --> 00:57:01,075
It's coming down harder than I thought.

710
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:03,160
That was so sudden…

711
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,122
Oh, chef!

712
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:12,612
You must be freezing in the rain.

713
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:16,626
Gwansong, where are you headed?

714
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:21,291
Oh, well, I was...

715
00:57:26,433 --> 00:57:29,827
Where did you get this umbrella?

716
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:32,390
You should take this.

717
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,810
We can just run inside.

718
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:38,280
No, I...

719
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,618
Where did you get this?

720
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:44,392
Some old man gave it to me.

721
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:46,072
Why do you ask?

722
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:52,635
Mister, we should head inside.

723
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,096
 Try to listen. 

724
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:08,401
 Doesn't it sound just like music? 

725
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:13,661
 It's music that wakes you up. 

726
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:19,125
 I wake up to this music every day at 4 AM. 

727
00:58:20,548 --> 00:58:24,422
 I knew I had heard it before, but I could not remember why... 

728
00:58:26,672 --> 00:58:29,127
 The rain must have drowned it out. 

729
00:58:29,127 --> 00:58:30,735
 Wake up! 

730
00:58:30,735 --> 00:58:32,375
 Madam! 

731
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:39,190
 Help! Is no one around? 

732
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:42,577
 It was unmistakably... 

733
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:45,727
 in the hour of the tiger. 

734
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:15,610


735
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:31,330
♫  Even if everything flows away you are still by my side  ♫

736
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:37,530
♫  Don't let go of my hand, not ever  ♫

737
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:45,220
♫  When spring comes let's go there, together  ♫

738
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:51,770
♫  Let's never be apart again  ♫

739
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:12,100
♫  It always felt so distant the word “us”  ♫
