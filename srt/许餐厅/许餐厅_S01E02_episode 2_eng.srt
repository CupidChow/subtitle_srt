1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,810


2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,986
   

3
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:05,895
   

4
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:09,352
   

5
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:11,470
   

6
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:13,915
   

7
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,528
       

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,839
   

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,275
   

10
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:31,732
   

11
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:35,301
 Who is Chef Lee Hyuk? 

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,730
 Recognized for his exceptional culinary talent from an early age, 

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,780
 he set his sights high 

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,960
 and trained at the renowned CAA in Switzerland and Le Cordon Bleu in France. 

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,562
 Afterward, he became a professor at a prestigious culinary university in Japan. 

16
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:53,255
 However, driven by a sense of duty to promote Korean cuisine, he returned, 

17
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:57,028
 and within just three years he became the youngest Korean Master Chef! 

18
00:00:57,028 --> 00:01:02,772
 He then went on to sweep awards at numerous international culinary competitions. 

19
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:09,968
 Most recently, in his ambition to introduce a wider variety of dishes to more people, 

20
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:14,257
 he opened Dorae, a fine dining Korean restaurant in Seongbuk-dong, 

21
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,435
 and has thrived ever since. 

22
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,634
Do you get it now?

23
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:27,463
Chef Lee Hyuk is an incredible person.

24
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,981
Not someone a random homeless man like you would know.

25
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,774
Are you truly not Gwansong?

26
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,764
But you look exactly like him!

27
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,703
Do you not recognize me?

28
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,821
I am Gyosan.

29
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:46,929
I don't know you.

30
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,770
I don't believe we've ever met before.

31
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,565
Noâ€”

32
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:53,780
You've yet to come to your senses.

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,588
You should head inside, Chef Lee. I'll handle this.

34
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,199
You should come inside with me.

35
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,787
I'll have the staff take care of him.

36
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:05,140
No, I'm an expert at dealing with these types of people.

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,020
But still...

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,007
Going inside is the best way to help, so go inside if you want to help.

39
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,592
Quick.

40
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,017
Wait, Gwansong!

41
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:16,228
Please step aside!

42
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,382
- Gwansong! It is me! 
 - Hey!

43
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,416
I am Gyosan, the friend who passed the state exams with you!

44
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,938
Why do you not recognize me?

45
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:28,524
I have no idea who you're mistaking him for,

46
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:32,428
but do you think faces like his are common?

47
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:35,731
Do you know how rare it is to be that good-looking?

48
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,858
And clearly, he looks way too young for you two to have taken the exam together.

49
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,726
Perhaps I was mistaken after all...

50
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:49,590
Good. Now that you understand, please leave.

51
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,174
Then let me at least apologize in person!

52
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,956
Oh, come on!

53
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:58,479
What did you eat to be this strong?

54
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,372
Mister, did you bring the money?

55
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:05,211
The money for your meal.

56
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:12,674
I figured as much.

57
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:15,404
From the moment you left this as a "collateral,"

58
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,945
I knew you were a runner.

59
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:20,694
But I just didn't expect you to come back.

60
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:23,844
A runner? What's that?

61
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:25,807
Someone who eats and runs. Like you.

62
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,810
How rude! Runs?

63
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,130
What an undignified accusation!

64
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,095
I am no shameless freeloader.

65
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:37,285
I may not have money right now.

66
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:41,132
Is there a stream nearby?

67
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:43,643
I will catch some fish and repay my debt!

68
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,134
Mr. Homeless,

69
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:52,936
forget the money. Just stay away from here.

70
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,174
Understood?

71
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:56,950
Why did you put that there?

72
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,693
Domundaejak is not a book to be tossed aside like rubbish!

73
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:03,603
If you show up here again, I'll report you for dining and dashing, okay?

74
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:12,143
What brings you here at this hour?

75
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,511
I was working out of the office.

76
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,388
- I'm serious. 
  - Ma'am, can we get more kimchi? 

77
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:22,071
Perfect, help me out.

78
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,503
Take this to that table over there.

79
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:27,256
Didn't you say you'd handle the diner yourself?

80
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,808
Apologies, but I am taking this back.

81
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,538
Excuse me, young lady!

82
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:48,059
This book I gave you is not something to be treated so carelessly.

83
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:51,731
This transcendent genius, Heo Gyun, wrote about food for the first...

84
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:57,579
Wait, what is this scent?

85
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,062
You're back.

86
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:04,740
The aroma of cheonggukjang is more fragrant than flowers.

87
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,237
You must be hungry,

88
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:10,526
but I'm afraid you'll have to wait. There are many customers ahead of you.

89
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,017
This guy is unbelievable.

90
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:18,706
Didn't I tell you not to show up here again?

91
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:20,504
Do I sound like a joke to you?

92
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,084
That's enough!

93
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:25,122
If you're not helping, go upstairs and don't add to the chaos.

94
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,673
Mister, come back another time, okay?

95
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:29,599
Come back?

96
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:35,899
Try showing up here again and I swear I'll report you, okay?

97
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:40,026
Oh, for heaven's sake, that's enough already.

98
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,388
It is all saved.

99
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,753
Excuse me, where's our food?

100
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,927
Coming right up!

101
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,515
Stop pestering her.

102
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,717
Can you not see she is busy?

103
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:19,618
I thought only Joseon people were impatient, but Yuldoguk is no different.

104
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:22,328
Why don't you lend a hand?

105
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,601
I'll even pay you for it.

106
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,590
Mom!

107
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:28,077
Mom, go inside.

108
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:31,952
I am of noble birth. Such labor is beneath me.

109
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,475
Excuse me?

110
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:36,667
So you're saying people like my mom are lowborn?

111
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,390
No, I simply meant that nobles and commoners have different roles in society,

112
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,599
and since I have never done such work, I would only be a burden.

113
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,531
Please do not take offense.

114
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:50,607
Wow, I never thought I'd be bossed around by a homeless guy.

115
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:57,501
Keep talking like that and you'll be "poof." Gone before you know it.

116
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,514
- Poof? 
 - Poof!

117
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:03,499
Are you saying that in Yuldoguk, even nobles can do this kind of work?

118
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:04,913
No, they can't.

119
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:05,941
See?

120
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,680
Because there are no nobles.

121
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,290
There are no class distinctions.

122
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,020
Everyone earns their living by working.

123
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,072
No wonder you're still wandering around.

124
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,810
So, it is forbidding discrimination...

125
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,990
the very concept does not exist here?

126
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,050
I always thought of myself as open-minded,

127
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,830
but that never even crossed my mind.

128
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:41,983
Yuldoguk truly surpasses my wildest imagination.

129
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:45,446
Stop right there.

130
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:50,671
From this moment, anyone who isn't working or eating needs to leave this diner.

131
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,054
One.

132
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,831
Two.

133
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,802
I'll do my best.

134
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,807
This belonged to Eun Sil's late father, and it fits you perfectly.

135
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,655
Now, put on this apron.

136
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,879
Make use of your hands and take them yourself.

137
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,872
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,997
That's my credit card...

139
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:46,174
But you gave it to me.

140
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,301
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:52,857
Hurry and hand it over.

142
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,028
What is this?

143
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,027
Why is there cold air inside?

144
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,948
Mister, come over here.

145
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,750
Wait, what are you doing?

146
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,685
- Last dish. 
  - Yes, Chef! 

147
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,177
No more customers after this.

148
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:27,198
I have an important meeting.

149
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,142
 Had a course meal at Dorae for lunch. 

150
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:52,661
 The flavors and presentation were as flawless as Chef Lee Hyuk himself. 

151
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:56,254
 Beautiful, but ridiculously expensive! My wallet is in shambles. 

152
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:57,356
 Have you tried the diner across? Super cost-efficient. 

153
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,508
 The set meals there are amazing. 

154
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:00,751
 It's 60 times cheaper than Dorae? Unreal. 

155
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,570
 No wonder there's always a line. I'm going next week. 

156
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:13,468
I struck him down without a doubt...

157
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,595
but he vanished without a trace.

158
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,362
Vanished?

159
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:23,122
And you expect me to believe that?

160
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,840
Even I could hardly believe it myself.

161
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,602
It was as if I were bewitched...

162
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,907
As if you were bewitched?

163
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,474
So, you drove this blade straight into Gyosan's neck?

164
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:49,034
I am certain of it.

165
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,119
Unless I see it with my own eyes...

166
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,819
I cannot trust such words.

167
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:01,370
But if I kill you now,

168
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,450
I will never find Gyosan.

169
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:10,318
So bring him to me.

170
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:14,771
His body, his remains... find something.

171
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,201
If you fail...

172
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:24,230
you will prove with your own neck

173
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,100
how a dead man vanished without a trace.

174
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:30,923
Yes, My Lord.

175
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:50,221
Indeed, a goblin he is...

176
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:54,580
To take a blade to the neck

177
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,370
and simply disappear.

178
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,332
What's wrong? Something stuck in your throat?

179
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,967
It is so delicious.

180
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:13,052
I do not want to share it even with my own throat.

181
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:16,054
You sure have a way with words.

182
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:22,413
Maybe it is because I worked today, but the food tastes even more divine.

183
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:26,708
As expected, this transcendent genius, Heo Gyun, is truly a master of all trades!

184
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:35,587
What is that hideous smell before such precious food?

185
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,014
Hideous?

186
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:39,206
This is Chanel NÂ°5.

187
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,495
I splurged on this, okay?

188
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,407
Mom, I'm heading out.

189
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,746
Eat before you go.

190
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:48,093
Since when have I ever eaten cheonggukjang?

191
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:52,296
You never eat anything good for you.

192
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,596
Here's your pay for today.

193
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:03,357
Your share for today's work.

194
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,875
Hang on, let me do a quick audit.

195
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,367
Weren't you leaving?

196
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,218
I knew it.

197
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:20,686
Why is the hourly rate so high?

198
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:22,322
Let's see.

199
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:25,503
A total newbie worked six hours,

200
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:28,123
so minimum wage times six...

201
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,158
Then subtract three servings of gukbap from yesterday,

202
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:36,343
two servings of cheonggukjang todayâ€¦ and the dish you broke...

203
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,745
That leaves this much.

204
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,804
Is this Yuldoguk's currency?

205
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:46,449
Hey, are you the owner here? Give it back.

206
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:50,624
You're not helping by spoiling him like this.

207
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,943
He already has trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality.

208
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:56,468
You might be reinforcing his delusions.

209
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,249
You always think you're right.

210
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,936
Wait.

211
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:03,833
Is this person wearing gonryongpo? 
  (T/N: Dragon robe - royal gown) 

212
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,687
Why does Yuldoguk's currency bear a Joseon royal's portrait?

213
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:09,100
Of course it does.

214
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,563
That's Sejong the Great!

215
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,733
I failed to recognize His Highness.

216
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:17,762
I humbly implore your gracious understanding!

217
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,929
That's just too much to handle.

218
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,000
Give it back to him before you go.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,522
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Give it!

220
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,056
I'm going.

221
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:33,321
I humbly implore your gracious understanding!

222
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:39,959
This belongs to you, right?

223
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,561
Yes.

224
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,656
I'm usually not this careless, you know,

225
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:53,365
but I was so distracted earlier I can't believe I left these behind.

226
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:55,623
By the way, are you okay?

227
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:57,992
You must've been surprised.

228
00:14:57,992 --> 00:15:01,698
But thanks to you, I'm fine.

229
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:09,138
Can I call you by your name, Eun Sil?

230
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,755
I didn't expect you to know my name.

231
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,788
Call me all you want.

232
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:24,201
Well, you seem to know all about my career.

233
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,859
Well...

234
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:31,986
I was pleased.

235
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:36,265
And thank you for helping me when I was in a difficult situation.

236
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:40,739
Oh, it was nothing.

237
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,859
That's just what neighbors do.

238
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:58,177
Speaking of neighbors,

239
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:03,299
I'd rather not have dangerous people roaming around here.

240
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,163
My thoughts exactly.

241
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:09,877
How do you and I think so much alike?

242
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,135
To make that happen,

243
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:18,672
I believe this neighborhood needs a touch of refinement.

244
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:20,559
Refinement.

245
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,989
That's right.

246
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:31,697
Eun Sil.

247
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:36,254
Have you ever heard of the Broken Window Theory?

248
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,374
If a broken window is left unattended,

249
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,286
the whole area eventually turns into a slum.

250
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,588
Right?

251
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:48,148
I don't think we should...

252
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:52,221
let that broken window fester here.

253
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:55,204
I completely agree.

254
00:16:57,868 --> 00:17:01,336
Has your mother mentioned anything?

255
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,542
My mom?

256
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,731
About what?

257
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,816
It's nothing.

258
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:24,483
 I'll give you about a week to think it over. 

259
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:28,446
 There's nothing to think about. 

260
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:32,125
 The price I'm offering is far above market value. 

261
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:38,281
 With this money, you could open a much bigger restaurant somewhere else. 

262
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:41,665
 A bigger restaurant just means more work. 

263
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:45,465
 And why would I leave my own place to go somewhere else? 

264
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:51,803
 I'll double the price I've just offered you. 

265
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,893
 You really are persistent. 

266
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:56,372
 I told you, it's not about the money. 

267
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:59,612
 What exactly do you plan to do with this rundown little diner? 

268
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,287
 I intend to open a Korean dessert cafÃ©. 

269
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:07,069
 My goal is to turn this entire area into 

270
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,878
 a high-end Korean cuisine-themed village. 

271
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:13,887
 Every other store has already been secured. 

272
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,345
 This diner is the only one left. 

273
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:22,181
 And what about the people who eat here? 

274
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:26,306
 Some of my regulars rely on this place 

275
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,698
 because they have nowhere else to go. 

276
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:34,464
 Does it have to be this exact spot? 

277
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:36,316
 You could serve the same meals elsewhereâ€” 

278
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,830
 But doesn't that apply to you, too? 

279
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,078
 Why do you insist on having it here? 

280
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,750
 Look, I get it. 

281
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,072
 I feel bad about getting in the way of a young person 

282
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,319
 trying to make something of themselves. 

283
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,747
 So, I'll think about it. 

284
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,400
 But don't get your hopes up. 

285
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,323
 I have my own reasons for wanting to hold on to this place. 

286
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,062
So she hasn't even told her daughter...

287
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,104
Does this mean it's a no?

288
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,503
But why does Yuldoguk's currency bear the portrait of Sejong the Great?

289
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:50,770
Because he's a respected figure.

290
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,913
His achievements have spread even to Yuldoguk?

291
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:58,927
What kind of king does this land have to hold such noble admiration?

292
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,891
There are no kings anymore.

293
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,815
No kings, no nobles, no commoners... yet everything functions so seamlessly.

294
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:12,237
I think I am growing even fonder of Yuldoguk.

295
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,385
Good.

296
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:17,345
Then why not settle down here?

297
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:20,646
That will not do.

298
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:24,037
There is a saying that one must never forget their roots.

299
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:28,369
Even animals turn toward home in their final moments.

300
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,879
No matter how much I admire Yuldoguk,

301
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:32,868
I must return to Joseon, where my family and friends await.

302
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:34,739
Would you not agree?

303
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,280
I will go back and tell the world how remarkable this place is.

304
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,271
If Joseon could advance like Yuldoguk,

305
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:45,897
our people would suffer far less.

306
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:53,481
Speaking of which, how much does one of those ice storages cost?

307
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,579
The refrigerator?

308
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:01,235
Well, the latest models go for at least 3 million won.

309
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:02,826
Three million?

310
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,771
That means I would need 300 portraits of His Highness to afford one?

311
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:08,628
You'll earn that in no time if you work hard.

312
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:11,915
If you've got nowhere to go, why don't you work here?

313
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:13,466
- Mom! 
 - Oh, geez!

314
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:14,731
When did you get here?

315
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,445
Are you out of your mind?

316
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:19,652
You're letting a man with no background and questionable sanity work here?

317
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:27,111
I bit my tongue once today, but I can't hold back anymore.

318
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:30,396
Choose: is it me or that homeless man?

319
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,358
Wait, what's that?

320
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:46,146
Did you... You quit your job again, didn't you?

321
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,203
- That's not it. 
 - Get out.

322
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:50,266
- Get out, get out. 
 - Mom!

323
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,356
Go live however you want!

324
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,132
Young lady.

325
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:06,840
Madam wants you to return the money you stashed away earlier.

326
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:13,343
Tell her I wish her all the best after chasing her only daughter out.

327
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:15,056
Got it.

328
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:19,891
- Young lady! 
 - What?

329
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:22,837
Tell her it's too late to stop me.

330
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:26,053
She says 5,000 won is missing.

331
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:31,793
Happy now?

332
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:34,229
Now it is settled. Take care.

333
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:41,485
Lastly, the site for the Korean dessert cafÃ©

334
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,845
will replace an old diner

335
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:46,679
with a newly constructed four-story glass-walled building.

336
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,833
This will serve as an observatory overlooking the entire themed village.

337
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,590
Mr. Lee.

338
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:57,542
Mr. Lee?

339
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,675
Yes?

340
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:01,808
I asked about the cafÃ© contract status.

341
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,316
It will be finalized soon.

342
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:06,108
Didn't you say it would be done by today?

343
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,072
I apologize. I'll wrap it up as quickly as possible.

344
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:15,070
That diner, the one at the cafÃ© site, seems to be quite a hidden gem.

345
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,311
It doesn't even have a sign, but there's always a line of customers.

346
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,416
I doubt they'd want to sell.

347
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:24,368
You should give us immediate updates if it seems unlikely.

348
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,672
We're relying on you, but we're just wasting time at this point.

349
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:30,141
I said it would be done.

350
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,192
So please, leave the contract negotiations to me

351
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:43,078
and let's move on to reviewing other agenda items.

352
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,631
Have we finalized the promotional model for advertising?

353
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,695
Okay, nice.

354
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:14,451
Let's take a two-shot with our new model.

355
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,958
Excuse me, the other cast is coming through.

356
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:21,716
Other cast?

357
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:23,760
Yes, sir.

358
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,471
We'll make sure to adjust our schedule accordingly.

359
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:29,978
- No problem. 
 - Hey!

360
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,570
Why didn't you tell me?

361
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,445
Why didn't you tell me this was my last commercial?

362
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:42,765
If you had known, you wouldn't have done it.

363
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:44,170
This is unbelievable.

364
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,252
They're dropping me for some no-name old hag?

365
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,343
Don't you know who she is?

366
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:53,160
She just won Best Actress at Cannes.

367
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,275
Seriously?

368
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:58,280
Mi Sol, you are the no-name here.

369
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,370
Kids these days don't know who you are since they never saw you back in your prime.

370
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,587
You need to start taking adult roles.

371
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,634
How long are you going to rely on your childhood fame to shoot commercials?

372
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:10,273
It's not like I haven't tried!

373
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:13,963
Every time I do, I become a meme for my awful acting.

374
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:18,274
 Why am I the only one having a hard time? 
   

375
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:19,292
 Why? 
   
   

376
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,974
 Why? 
   

377
00:25:20,974 --> 00:25:22,414
   

378
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:24,949
   

379
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:28,255
   

380
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:34,128
   

381
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:37,893
 Young Master, do not abandon me. 
   

382
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:41,194
   

383
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:46,434
   

384
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:50,978
   

385
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:52,708
   

386
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,531
 My father. Bring him back! 

387
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:57,634
   

388
00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:01,919
   

389
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,880
   

390
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,597
   

391
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:09,832
Other than your crying scenes, you're not that bad.

392
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:11,450
Let's work on it.

393
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,169
Forget it.

394
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,090
Just get me another cosmetics commercial.

395
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,079
A higher-end brand than this one.

396
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,368
You're not in a position to be picky anymore.

397
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,508
Nonsense! I'm Jung Mi Sol, the CF fairy!

398
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:29,098
Ever since I was five years old!

399
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:35,904
If you want to keep doing commercials, take a look at this.

400
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,020
What's this?

401
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,925
What? A restaurant commercial?

402
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:45,736
Not just any restaurant. This is a fine dining restaurant.

403
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:48,230
Same thing.

404
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,367
I don't do food ads.

405
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:51,961
Why not?

406
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,749
Because I'll gain weight!

407
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,593
I'll have to be in shape!

408
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:01,758
Do you think it's easy to maintain how I look?

409
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,276
So you don't want dramas because you'll get roasted for bad acting

410
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:05,624
and you don't want ads because you might gain weight...

411
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,840
Then what exactly do you want to do?

412
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:14,756
Maybe I should just get married.

413
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:16,548
Got any decent guys around?

414
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:18,484
Hey, Jung Mi Sol!

415
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:21,072
I'm warning you. Pick one.

416
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,712
A drama or an ad.

417
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:46,691
Oh, you startled me!

418
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:48,790
Who are you?

419
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,758
How did you get in here?

420
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:54,917
The door was open.

421
00:27:57,191 --> 00:28:00,225
Oh, do not be alarmed.

422
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:03,118
I came to apologize for earlier today.

423
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:06,018
You resemble someone I know so closely

424
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,319
that I mistook you for him and acted discourteously.

425
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,548
Of course, Gwansong would not be here.

426
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:15,948
I must have been confused, being in a foreign place.

427
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,417
Get out.

428
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:23,129
I said, get out now.

429
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:27,665
That is no way to treat someone offering an apology.

430
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:33,084
I don't need your apology.

431
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:35,384
Just don't ever come back.

432
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:41,014
I was already planning to return to where I came from,

433
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:45,375
so you will not have to worry about seeing me again.

434
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,757
Regardless, I regret the misunderstanding.

435
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:54,850
Wait, this is...

436
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:59,361
This is Mae Chang!

437
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:02,586
Does that mean Mae Chang is here as well?

438
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:06,799
Then, as expected...

439
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,323
You are Gwansong!

440
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,727
It is you, Gwansong!

441
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:14,369
Why are you pretending not to know me?

442
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,007
What nonsense is this?

443
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,785
Gwansong!

444
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:27,964
 The offer is much appreciated, but I have a home to return to. 

445
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:32,649
 I will stay in Yuldoguk for a few days to write my travelogue, then return to Joseon. 

446
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:34,437
 So do not take it personally. 

447
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:37,339
 Return to where? Joseon? 

448
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:39,104
 That is right. 

449
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:44,259
 You won't be able to go back, so why not just stay here? 

450
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,919
 If there is a way here, there must be a way back. 

451
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:50,680
 Thank you for everything. 

452
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,708
 Even after I return, I will not forget your kindness. 

453
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,221
 If you ever visit Joseon, come find me. 

454
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,347
 I will repay this debt properly then. 

455
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,883
- Such a fine young man, yet out of his mind. 
 - Let go of me! What are you doing? Let me go!

456
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:08,704
- How painful it must be for his parents... 
 - Madam! Madam!

457
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:10,976
- Madam! Madam! 
 - Get him in, quickly.

458
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,840
- Madam! Madam! 
 - Oh, hurry inside!

459
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,220
Madam! Madam!

460
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:23,426
Madam!

461
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:28,652
Where on earth is Eun Sil? Why isn't she home yet?

462
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:31,014
She should know better!

463
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:33,388
Just wait till she gets here!

464
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:52,451
I'm getting wasted today,

465
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,869
so make sure to take care of the aftermath.

466
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:55,730
Why? What happened?

467
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,646
What happened?

468
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:59,446
I have a whole series of disasters.

469
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:01,742
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

470
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,995
Come on, spill it!

471
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:08,216
Which season do you want me to start from?

472
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:13,355
What's the matter?

473
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,734
 Defying a noble's will... 

474
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:18,092
 Come here! 

475
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,438
 Is there anyone inside? 

476
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:27,677
Sir, can you turn the TV off? I'm about to have a trauma flashback!

477
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:30,972
Stop.

478
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,494
Where are you taking me?

479
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:36,579
Mister, we're just taking you home.

480
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:39,031
So stop going to that restaurant, okay?

481
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,422
Stop!

482
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,204
I said stop immediately!

483
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:45,131
Stop! I said...

484
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:47,303
Do not stop.

485
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,807
This is my first time riding a Yuldoguk palanquin!

486
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:02,758
How does it move without horses or people?

487
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:05,692
What pulls it to make it so fast?

488
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:08,654
Just tell me where you live.

489
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:11,170
My home is in Joseon.

490
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,334
If I ride this palanquin,

491
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,107
I think I could reach Joseon in a few days.

492
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:18,323
Do you happen to know the way?

493
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:21,434
Do you think this is a joke?

494
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:28,996
 Jewelry store robbery at Seojong 3-ga, K Gold Shop. 

495
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,230
 Nearby units, proceed for urgent inspection. 

496
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,707
Who is it?

497
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:35,309
Where is this voice coming from?

498
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,218
Mister, just get out of the car!

499
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,611
Hurry and get out!

500
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,969
Hey!

501
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,666
Where am I supposed to go?

502
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,626
Excuse me!

503
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,258
What place could that be?

504
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,020
 The night is no different from the day. 

505
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,890
 Have the stars descended? 

506
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:39,739
 The songs of sleepless souls mock the moon itself. 

507
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:50,451
 A single drink shared between strangers, and time fades away. What does it matter? 

508
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:06,446
What a beautiful world this is!

509
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:15,004
He's hilarious.

510
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,269
Hold up!

511
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:17,623
Oh, man...

512
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,810
Hey, check this guy out!

513
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,381
Bro, can I interview you?

514
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:24,315
- Interview? What is that? 
 - A friendly chat.

515
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:27,776
- Oh, that... A friendly chat! 
 - Say hello. Hi.

516
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:29,641
Hi.

517
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:32,636
Got fired from work...

518
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,564
Kicked out of my house...

519
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:40,305
It's like getting kicked when I'm already down.

520
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:42,442
Don't you agree?

521
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,367
- Hey, check this out! 
 - What?

522
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:48,548
- What? What is it? 
 - Right?

523
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:52,021
Now even you guys are kicking me while I'm down?

524
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:53,730
No, it's not that.

525
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,013
Look at this.

526
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:59,400
Isn't this the homeless guy you were talking about earlier? It's him, right?

527
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,836
   

528
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:02,024
Gasp.

529
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:03,959
Yeah, it's him.

530
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,516
He must be nearby!

531
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,303
Yuldoguk is truly a marvelous place!

532
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:16,425
Everywhere I turn, marvels of progress surround me!

533
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:19,399
The air is filled with the scent of food and the sound of music, never fading!

534
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:22,697
So, I cannot help but smile.

535
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:26,837
And the drinks are absolutely exquisite!

536
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:33,000
Here, people of all ages and backgrounds mingle freely without class or rank.

537
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:38,799
If only the people of Joseon could see this wonder!

538
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:41,096
But soon, I will return to Joseon!

539
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:45,875
And when I do, I will spread the tale of Yuldoguk's wonders!

540
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:49,228
Hey, Mr. Homeless!

541
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:52,807
That insolent voice...

542
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:55,507
Stay right there!

543
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,901
Don't move!

544
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:04,696
I said don't move!

545
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:12,788
How did such a rude daughter come from such a refined mother?

546
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:14,853
Eun Sil, try this.

547
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:16,705
Eun Sil.

548
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:19,858
Eun Sil.

549
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,970
Eun Sil, wake up! Eun Sil.

550
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,614
Oh, my! Breaking news!

551
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:25,873
Thunder Boys are at a bar across the street!

552
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:27,484
What? For real? 
    

553
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:31,947
- We have to go! Now! 
 - How? She's totally wasted.

554
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:34,310
Eun Sil, Eun Sil!

555
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,194
Eun Sil, wake up, Eun Sil!

556
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,963
She's completely out!

557
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,519
Excuse me...

558
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,033
What is "wasted"?

559
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,829
Mister...

560
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:47,427
What is with that peculiar look?

561
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:49,546
Can you watch Eun Sil for a moment?

562
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:52,049
Just for a moment!

563
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:53,094
 Thank you. 

564
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,165
Excuse me!

565
00:36:56,643 --> 00:37:00,816
Oh! Why'd you hit me?

566
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:10,519
Oh, you again?

567
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:12,553
No!

568
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:13,748
It is a misunderstanding!

569
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,673
It was not me, it was...

570
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,117
Clean up everything before you go!

571
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,857
Mister.

572
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:04,071
You still smell like cheonggukjang.

573
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:07,308
That smell is coming from your mouth.

574
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:15,205
Can you go slowly? I feel nauseous.

575
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:19,403
Fine.

576
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:23,778
By the way, why do you keep calling me "Mr. Homeless"?

577
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:28,284
Am I not allowed to call a homeless guy Mr. Homeless?

578
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:32,872
I have a name, and I do not like being called homeless.

579
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:37,527
You call this place Yuldoguk without a second thought.

580
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:40,542
So let's just call things how we like.

581
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:46,508
Well, I suppose today will be the last time you call me that.

582
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:48,870
So, do as you please.

583
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,939
The last time?

584
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:54,815
I am returning to Joseon.

585
00:38:54,815 --> 00:39:00,081
So stop arguing with your mother over me and be a good daughter.

586
00:39:03,987 --> 00:39:05,745
Why are you laughing?

587
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:09,276
And just how are you planning to get back?

588
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:12,745
What, do you have a hidden time machine or something?

589
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,920
What is a machine?

590
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,934
Is that something people in Yuldoguk use?

591
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:27,323
Wait!

592
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,796
That looks familiar...

593
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:33,213
Don't tell me you don't know Changdeok Palace.

594
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:37,398
There is a Changdeok Palace in Yuldoguk too?

595
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:40,416
It looks exactly the same as the one in Joseon.

596
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:44,662
Of course it does, because it's the same one.

597
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:46,502
What do you mean?

598
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:53,168
That is the actual Changdeok Palace from Joseon.

599
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:06,442
But this is not Joseon.

600
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:09,771
Of course not! Joseon fell a long time ago.

601
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:11,505
Fell?

602
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:14,854
You insolent wench! How dare you speak such nonsense?

603
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:17,403
What? Wench?

604
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,304
Are you truly out of your mind?

605
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:21,830
If Joseon fell,

606
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,170
then what is this place?

607
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:28,792
If that's acting, he deserves an Oscar.

608
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,788
Or maybe he's actually crazy.

609
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:32,625
I am asking you, what is this place?

610
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:35,491
Why are you yelling at me?

611
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,238
Joseon fell over a hundred years ago.

612
00:40:42,238 --> 00:40:44,740
The Yi dynasty is gone.

613
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,279
This is the 21st-century Republic of Korea.

614
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:54,565
So pull yourself together

615
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:57,486
and start adjusting to reality.

616
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:06,160
Here, over here.

617
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:15,284
So this is the nation that followed Joseon?

618
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:20,516
I did not just end up in another country.

619
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:23,102
I have been sent to the future.

620
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,242
How could such a thing be possible?

621
00:41:29,577 --> 00:41:33,126
Mister, are you going to stay there?

622
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:40,701
Well, I guess that makes sense. You're used to sleeping under the open sky.

623
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,248
If you want a ride, come now before I change my mind.

624
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:01,343
I'm leaving for real.

625
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:09,171
Let's go.

626
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,974
You look like the world just ended.

627
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:36,172
If I hadn't thrown up, I would've just ignored you completely.

628
00:42:43,832 --> 00:42:45,542
Here.

629
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:51,563
Consider your debt paid.

630
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:10,462
 He won't just sit there all night... will he? 

631
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,791
 Not in this rain... 

632
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,722
What do I care?

633
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:19,896
Mr. Homeless, get out of my head!

634
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,851
Jeez!

635
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:38,854
Why are you just sitting there?

636
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:42,740
How could a mother sleep when her daughter isn't home?

637
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,267
Didn't you kick me out?

638
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:49,202
Don't pretend you care.

639
00:43:49,202 --> 00:43:52,331
Other people always come first with you.

640
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:53,840
You reek of alcohol.

641
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,434
If you're drunk, just go to bed.

642
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,376
Tell me I'm wrong.

643
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:01,574
Have I ever been your priority?

644
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,873
You never once took me on a trip.

645
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:08,409
Not even a school event.

646
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,450
The kids always teased me about smelling like food.

647
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,661
So I wore my gym clothes instead of my uniform at school.

648
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,964
You never even noticed, did you?

649
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,477
Why bring up old stories now?

650
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,924
Just like yesterday.

651
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,880
You never even asked what happened at work.

652
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,571
You just blamed me like always.

653
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:39,159
Did something happen?

654
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,798
Forget it.

655
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:43,427
It's not like you really care.

656
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:46,502
You told me to leave and live my own life.

657
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:50,024
Starting tomorrow, I'm looking for my own place.

658
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,262
I'm not living with you anymore.

659
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:11,020
No matter how far into the future this may be...

660
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,184
If there was a way here, there must be a way back.

661
00:45:21,957 --> 00:45:24,298
I must retrace my steps.

662
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:27,851
From the moment I first arrived in this place...

663
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:32,923
how could a transcendent genius like me fail to find a way?

664
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:36,603
Oh, it is freezing...

665
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:39,264
Ugh! Absolutely freezing!

666
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:44,404
I woke up somewhere around here...

667
00:45:45,457 --> 00:45:48,204
but the rain has washed away any trace.

668
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,446
Perhaps the madam would know.

669
00:45:58,364 --> 00:45:59,902
Madam!

670
00:46:09,378 --> 00:46:11,104
Excuse me...

671
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,558
I was just a moment too late.

672
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:19,479
She could not have gone far.

673
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:30,490
Why is it pouring so hard?

674
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,079
It is time for you to go.

675
00:47:11,316 --> 00:47:14,133
What a vivid dream!

676
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:35,435
Am I still half-asleep, hearing things?

677
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:39,243
I thought I heard something...

678
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:53,410


679
00:47:58,654 --> 00:48:00,099
Madam!

680
00:48:02,553 --> 00:48:05,087
Madam! Wake up!

681
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:06,660
Madam!

682
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:11,978
Help!

683
00:48:11,978 --> 00:48:14,064
Is no one around?

684
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,064
She's dying!

685
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,350
Please, someone help!

686
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,880
