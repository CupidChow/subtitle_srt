1
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,044
   

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:06,444
   

3
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:08,540
   

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:11,580
   

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,070
   

6
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:17,750
       

7
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,797
   

8
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:28,990
   

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,792
   

10
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,722
Mister!

11
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,685
Mr. Homeless!

12
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,364
What are you doing? Let's go inside.

13
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,160
Dry yourself.

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,501
You said you hated the rain, so why did you let yourself get soaked?

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,134
 Madam! 

16
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,971
 Excuse me... 

17
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:54,528
 The one who was with the madam right before the accident was him. 

18
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:00,131
 Madam! Wake up! 

19
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:01,730
 Madam! 

20
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,988
 Help! 

21
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,172
 She is dying! 

22
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,482
 Please, someone help! 

23
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:22,137
 If he was there at the time of the madam's accident... 

24
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,262
 Perhaps her accident was... 

25
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:29,965
You really are a handful.

26
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,561
If you fall sick, I'll be the one to suffer.

27
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,436
Stop, young lady!

28
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,853
I was in the middle of something important,

29
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,828
and you interrupted my train of thought.

30
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,967
What were you thinking about?

31
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,790
The madam's...

32
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,379
Never mind.

33
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,811
Why stop mid-sentence? Don't leave me hanging.

34
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,698
What is it?

35
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,958
I am not sure if I should tell you this first.

36
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,786
But I think...

37
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:13,416
Go get changed now!

38
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,170
Did he...

39
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,700
really see me?

40
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,657
 Madam! 

41
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,351
 Madam! Wake up! 

42
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:18,003
 Madam! 

43
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,485
 Help! 

44
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:23,699
 Is anyone around? 

45
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,527
 She is dying! 

46
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,546
 Please, someone help! 

47
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,136
 Madam! 

48
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,101
 Madam, get up! 

49
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,994
 Madam, wake up! 

50
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,357
 Madam! 

51
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,278
 How could this happen? 

52
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:46,936
How much did he see?

53
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:12,233
What is the matter?

54
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:16,316
The jar my mom cherished...

55
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,425
Why is it broken?

56
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,478
Did you do this?

57
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:25,120
I was out with you and just got back.

58
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,529
When would I have had the time?

59
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,141
Someone has been rummaging through the kitchen.

60
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,829
A thief?

61
00:06:25,878 --> 00:06:29,760
Other than the broken jar, is anything missing?

62
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,225
I don't think so.

63
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,761
The cash at the counter is untouched,

64
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,213
and all the ingredients are still here, right?

65
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,799
That is right.

66
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:41,464
But someone definitely went through the kitchen.

67
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:43,045
Really?

68
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:48,694
By any chance, do you know how much that broken jar is worth?

69
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,730
I'm not sure.

70
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,081
My mom treasured it so much she wouldn't even let me touch it.

71
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,256
I'll file a report for now.

72
00:06:57,256 --> 00:07:01,272
Check again for any other missing items and let me know.

73
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,347
Thank you, detective.

74
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:07,156
You've been through a lot. Would you like a cup of coffee?

75
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:08,821
No, I'm good.

76
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,911
I no longer drink coffee.

77
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:12,916
Then maybe the others...

78
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,479
No.

79
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,569
They all quit, too.

80
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,341
I'll go upstairs and check if anything else is missing.

81
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,347
You got all the fingerprints, right?

82
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:31,294
- Yes, sir. 
 - Okay.

83
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,277
- Goodnight. 
 - Excuse me!

84
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,637
What is it this time?

85
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:44,864
Are you trying to drag up the past and start another argument?

86
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:50,041
I have something important to tell you.

87
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,058
What could possibly be so important?

88
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:55,475
Why are you acting so seriously?

89
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,783
It is about the madam.

90
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,621
Not that again.

91
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,688
I told you, she was alone that day.

92
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:08,563
No, she was not alone that day.

93
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:13,124
She had company, and I think I know who it was.

94
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:51,119
You said you didn't see the person's face.

95
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,027
That is right.

96
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:56,832
But I remember everything else,

97
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,806
and I have found someone who matches.

98
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,809
Come on.

99
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,121
Without the face, it could be anyone.

100
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,378
How can you identify someone just by their body shape?

101
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:14,486
Do not underestimate the memory of the Transcendent Genius.

102
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,117
I am certain.

103
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:19,794
It was him.

104
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:22,494
Do you have any proof?

105
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,623
   

106
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,033
The evidence I have

107
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,464
is what I saw and heard.

108
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:45,412
So I need your help.

109
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,823
Please investigate him thoroughly.

110
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:51,001
Find out why he met the madam just before the accident

111
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:54,230
and what exactly happened on those stairs that day...

112
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,517
What did you just say?

113
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:04,634
Who did my mom meet just before the accident?

114
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,318
Well, that is...

115
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,321
I asked you a question. Who was the person my mom met?

116
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,744
This has gotten out of hand.

117
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,603
What should we do?

118
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:45,551
What else?

119
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:48,389
Detective Kang, you need to contain it again.

120
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,820
A witness has come forward, and the victim's family will take action.

121
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,284
What exactly do you expect me to do?

122
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:59,000
Believe it or not, I'm a cop.

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,100
I can't ignore procedures

124
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:04,998
and keep covering for you.

125
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,419
But you've been doing exactly that all this time.

126
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,565
And willingly, at that.

127
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:17,667
There's only so much I can sweep under the rug.

128
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,300
Now that it's come to this,

129
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,610
I have no choice but to investigate you.

130
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:30,241
Investigate me based on the words of someone with no clear identity?

131
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:36,620
Even if we ignore him, what about Bong Eun Sil?

132
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,373
You really think the victim's daughter will just let this go?

133
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:44,888
So, you're saying she's suspecting me just because of what he said.

134
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:48,435
Then, all we need to do is invalidate what she heard.

135
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:53,244
How do we invalidate something that she has already heard?

136
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:56,064
Try to make some sense.

137
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,402
Eun Sil.

138
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,556
I figured you'd come, so I waited.

139
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:22,536
You should've called me instead of waiting outside in the cold.

140
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:25,214
This isn't something to talk about over the phone.

141
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:28,120
Let's go inside.

142
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,741
Thank you so much for earlier.

143
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:43,354
I was caught off guard when it suddenly started raining.

144
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:50,207
I'll buy you a new umbrella.

145
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:55,568
I left yours in front of the restaurant, but I can't find it anymore.

146
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,298
That's not what I'm here for.

147
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:10,023
Chef, I heard you met my mom.

148
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,202
Just before her accident.

149
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,238
That's true.

150
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:22,219
I saw her that morning, just before dawn.

151
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,594
Then why didn't you tell me?

152
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,348
I wanted to.

153
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,278
I wanted to tell you so many times, but...

154
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:35,623
Every time I tried, that person was there.

155
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:38,258
That person? Who?

156
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:42,564
Oh, do you mean Mr. Homeless?

157
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:49,905
I assume he's the one who told you that I met your mother.

158
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:54,266
Yes, that's right.

159
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,094
He's keeping me in check.

160
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:03,518
Why would he do that?

161
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:07,522
Because he's afraid of the truth I know.

162
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,315
He wanted to make sure you wouldn't trust me.

163
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:24,112
What is taking her so long?

164
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:39,836
   

165
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,190
 The recipient is unavailable. 

166
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,480
 Please leave a message after the beep. 

167
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,900
 A service charge may apply. 

168
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,717
Who is speaking?

169
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:02,310
Where is Lady Eun Sil?

170
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,740
Call her here at once!

171
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,919
Excuse me?

172
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,965
   

173
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:16,604
Go on.

174
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:21,929
The truth is... your mother called for me that night.

175
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,045
She said she had something important to discuss.

176
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,563
At that hour?

177
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:34,498
She seemed restless, unable to sleep, and for good reason.

178
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,897
She told me she had been scammed.

179
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,471
My mom... was scammed?

180
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,717
Yes.

181
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:49,604
By the man you're working with now.

182
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,968
It was Gyosan.

183
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,831
What?

184
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,105
Mr. Homeless?

185
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,664
Chef, what are you trying to say?

186
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,883
That man isn't the type to do something like that.

187
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,721
Then...

188
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,278
Do I look like someone who would lie to you?

189
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,688
That's not what I meant...

190
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,330
He barely even knows how the world works.

191
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,430
What kind of scam could he pull?

192
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,094
That naivety is exactly what deceived your mother.

193
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:29,615
That night, she told me

194
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,793
she had helped him out of pity...

195
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,287
Only to have him stab her in the back.

196
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:43,523
Now, do you understand why I never trusted him?

197
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:49,856
I've been trying to warn you all along.

198
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,029
You must be mistaken.

199
00:16:55,236 --> 00:17:00,061
- The Mr. Homeless I know... 
 - And what exactly do you know about him?

200
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:05,586
- Well... 
 - That he came from Joseon?

201
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,610
That a man who supposedly never cooked before

202
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,180
can suddenly make quality dishes overnight?

203
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:15,752
All those ridiculous lies.

204
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,071
How could you...

205
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:23,013
possibly believe them?

206
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:25,716
It wasn't his words I believed.

207
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:30,184
I believed in the character he revealed through his actions.

208
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:32,219
His character.

209
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,836
Sure, your mother must have thought the same.

210
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:39,594
And yet, she was deceived and came to me.

211
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,075
That day, your mother and I met for a brief moment.

212
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:50,902
And I...

213
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,754
I regret that more than anything.

214
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:59,630
If I had just walked her home that night...

215
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:05,254
this accident wouldn't have happened.

216
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,746
I understand what you're saying,

217
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,657
but I need to confirm it myself.

218
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,441
Eun Sil.

219
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:21,187
Don't you find all of this suspicious?

220
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,880
That man, Gyosan, was there when your mother had her accident.

221
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,305
Do you think that's just a coincidence?

222
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,898
 But what were you doing there last night? 

223
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:37,199
 Didn't we part ways in front of Changdeok Palace? 

224
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,285
 I was merely looking around the neighborhood... 

225
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,402
What if he was involved in your mother's accident?

226
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:48,311
That's enough!

227
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,370
I don't want to hear it anymore.

228
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:59,974
I have no idea what's going on.

229
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,036
You must be confused.

230
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:05,808
I understand.

231
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:09,966
If you can't trust me...

232
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,538
Then ask someone else.

233
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,436
For example...

234
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,277
The police.

235
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,729
 Please leave a message after the beep— 

236
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:27,706
It's the other lady again.

237
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:29,859
She says the same thing every time!

238
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,312
Young lady!

239
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:40,610
Where have you been this late at night?

240
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,657
Do you know how worried I was?

241
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:45,131
You were worried about me?

242
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:47,691
Of course I was.

243
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:51,727
Why did you not answer your phone?

244
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:54,736
You told me to always keep this with me, and pick up when you call.

245
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,452
Mister.

246
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,356
Are you hiding anything from me?

247
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:03,405
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

248
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,835
Something about my mother.

249
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,470
Is there really nothing you need to tell me?

250
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:18,059
 She is better off not knowing until I am certain. 

251
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:23,682
No.

252
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:28,590
The day my mom had her accident...

253
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,388
Why were you there?

254
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,800
That is...

255
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,804
Give me an honest answer.

256
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:40,194
Fine, I will tell you the truth.

257
00:20:40,194 --> 00:20:44,225
That night, I returned to that place because I was trying to go back to Joseon.

258
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:48,215
Enough with that nonsense about Joseon!

259
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,354
Give me something I can actually believe!

260
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:53,611
Tell me why!

261
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,381
Why were you there, at that time, at that exact place?

262
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,717
Give me a reason that makes sense!

263
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,492
Everything I have told you is the truth!

264
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,221
Wait...

265
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,260
Young lady,

266
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,656
are you doubting me?

267
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,398
I want to believe you.

268
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,377
So give me an answer I can believe.

269
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:25,103
If you refuse to accept the truth...

270
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:29,631
then there is nothing more I can say.

271
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,090
♫  On a day when the clouds fade away  ♫

272
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,730
♫  A night I wish to fill completely, just as it is  ♫

273
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,278
 Great! Isn't this fun? 

274
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,420
 You need to match the line. 

275
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,742
 Heo's Diner, let us make it big! 

276
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,610
 Heo's Diner, let us make it big! 

277
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,151
 Heo's Diner, let us go! 

278
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:11,494
 Heo's Diner, let us go! 

279
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,017
Everything I saw was a lie?

280
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,433
That can't be true.

281
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,280
♫  Even a forgotten wish might be okay  ♫

282
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:37,340
♫  Did my little cloud, holding you, convey my heart?  ♫

283
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:45,190
♫  Was it too small and blown far away by the wind?  ♫

284
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:52,190
♫  If someday it brushes past you, it will be a clear breeze  ♫

285
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,530
♫  If you feel that breeze  ♫

286
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:02,190
♫  Please tell me you love me  ♫

287
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:09,356
Where did he go?

288
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,165
   

289
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,962
 Help! 

290
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,745
 Is anyone around? 

291
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:50,513
I need solid proof.

292
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:54,894
Only then can I reveal the culprit and clear the young lady's misunderstanding.

293
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,563
But too much time has passed, and there were no witnesses...

294
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,284
What should I do?

295
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:18,836
Young lady, this is the first time you've called me.

296
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,939
Did you sleep well?

297
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:24,048
- About yesterday, we both misunderstood each other. 
 - Mister, where are you?

298
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,639
I am out to find...

299
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:30,881
I am out buying groceries.

300
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,532
 You're at the market? 

301
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:33,891
Yes.

302
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,103
I will take care of it myself, so you should rest a little longer.

303
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:46,431
So... you're at the market right now?

304
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,031
I understand.

305
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,810
   
   

306
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:00,899
Detective Kang.

307
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:07,888
Bong Eun Sil.

308
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:12,273
I'm sorry for dropping by so early...

309
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:19,518
 So, you're saying she's suspecting me just because of what he said. 

310
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,574
 Then, all we need to do is invalidate what she heard. 

311
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:26,847
 How do we invalidate something that she has already heard? 

312
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:29,720
 Try making some sense. 

313
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:40,758
 Before long, Bong Eun Sil will come to you 

314
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,100
 asking about that man, Gyosan. 

315
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,270
 When that happens, Detective Kang, 

316
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,010
 just handle it the right way. 

317
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,116
No need to apologize.

318
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,553
Tell me what's on your mind.

319
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,364
Today's guest on Talk Lounge is someone at the center of all the buzz lately.

320
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:03,048
From a beloved CF fairy to a rising actress, please welcome Jung Mi Sol!

321
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:07,150
Hello, everyone. I'm actress Jung Mi Sol.

322
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,203
The studio already feels so much brighter with you here!

323
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,943
Oh no, already?

324
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:16,741
What if it reaches dangerous levels by the time we're done?

325
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,003
You're as cheerful as ever.

326
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:24,429
But I heard you went through a tough time recently.

327
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,679
Yes, because of the eating disorder I was struggling with.

328
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,406
There were some misunderstandings, and I ended up worrying a lot of people.

329
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:36,533
First and foremost, I want to sincerely apologize for that.

330
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,982
But I'm doing so much better now,

331
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:41,849
I even have a go‑to restaurant.

332
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:57,227
I wish it were all just a misunderstanding.

333
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,026
   

334
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,075
Yes, detective.

335
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,205
 Bong Eun Sil? 

336
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:11,825
I looked into the identity you asked about.

337
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,532
Yes, please go on.

338
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,744
 Just so you know, sharing this information is illegal. 

339
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:20,091
 So you cannot say that you heard this from me 

340
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:23,046
I swear, I won't say a word.

341
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:26,160
That man has quite the record.

342
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,162
 Fourteen prior convictions, all for fraud. 

343
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:39,752
Young lady, what are you doing out here?

344
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:41,706
Let us go inside.

345
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,733
Detective Kang.

346
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:03,883
Yes?

347
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,264
What are you doing here?

348
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:07,705
Just looking for something real quick.

349
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:11,064
Where did I put my phone? Jeez...

350
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:17,620
Oh, it's in my hand.

351
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,360
Pull yourself together.

352
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,128
You've been acting strange lately.

353
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:24,240
There's nothing strange about me.

354
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,900
Let's just go.

355
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,540
When I was young,

356
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,910
so many people adored me for being cute and charming

357
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:39,172
I think I felt pressured to maintain that image

358
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:41,704
for as long as possible.

359
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,853
As a result, whenever I ate something

360
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,448
I'd think, "What if I lose this look?"

361
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:49,227
"What if people no longer like me?"

362
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,502
That fear... it got to me.

363
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:56,933
And before I knew it, I was caught in a cycle of eating and purging...

364
00:28:56,933 --> 00:29:00,489
Cut! Let's take a short break.

365
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,957
Well done.

366
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,607
Jung Mi Sol.

367
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:09,225
The content is great, but you're saying it too flatly.

368
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,678
Try to bring out more feeling, okay?

369
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:15,964
What? More feeling?

370
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,356
Make the audience feel the struggles of a child model.

371
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,640
Get emotional, maybe even shed a few tears.

372
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,375
We need viewers to connect with you.

373
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,963
Got it?

374
00:29:27,763 --> 00:29:29,303
Yes, okay.

375
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,832
Okay, let's go again.

376
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,394
You can do this!

377
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,230
Let's begin. Okay, cue!

378
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,740
Okay, cue!

379
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:42,030
I think I felt a lot of pressure

380
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,359
to maintain my childhood image for as long as possible...

381
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,236
So...

382
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:55,908
Whenever I ate something, I'd...

383
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:04,897
I'd be afraid...

384
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,292
Darn it.

385
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,164
I quit!

386
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:15,515
Why do I have to act when I'm talking about my own story? Seriously!

387
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:18,518
Even back then, I never cried about it. So why should I now?

388
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:20,440
Let's go.

389
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,067
I'm really sorry! Really sorry!

390
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:40,216
We're here to eat. Are you open?

391
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,266
Have a seat.

392
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:46,286
Thank you. Sit.

393
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:00,858
- Hey, mister. I'm here. 
 - Mae Chang.

394
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:03,432
Excuse me, can we get two set menus?

395
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:04,916
Of course.

396
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,764
Please wait a moment.

397
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,870
Where's Eun Sil?

398
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,582
Why is she making him do all the hard work?

399
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,455
Could we get some more side dishes?

400
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:17,701
 Side dish refills are self-serve. 

401
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,989
I'll help you with serving the food.

402
00:31:34,989 --> 00:31:36,730
You stay in the kitchen.

403
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,930
At this rate, everyone's going to leave.

404
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,478
But you are also a customer. I could not possibly...

405
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:45,201
I'll just ask Eun Sil to pay me, so don't worry.

406
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:48,382
Very well, then.

407
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:56,031
- Mi Sol, you're so pretty. 
 - Thank you.

408
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:58,517
- I'm your fan. 
 - Enjoy.

409
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,380
Thank you.

410
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:08,700
Chef Lee.

411
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,599
You were right about everything.

412
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:17,361
That man...

413
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:20,226
He was...

414
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:25,177
You must be in shock.

415
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,953
Sit down, take a breath, and tell me everything.

416
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,706
Why didn't I think to check sooner?

417
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:44,943
Why did I just laugh off all the strange things he said?

418
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:48,900
Don't blame yourself.

419
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,090
When people like him set their minds to deception,

420
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,512
it's almost impossible not to fall for it.

421
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,960
This isn't your fault, Eun Sil.

422
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,432
Did he really do that to my mom?

423
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:06,462
Did he really try to hurt her?

424
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,580
That's how I see it.

425
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:14,960
He's a very dangerous man.

426
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,883
You should avoid being alone with him for now.

427
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:23,033
But it doesn't make sense.

428
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,607
If he really did that to my mom,

429
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,226
why didn't he run? Why is he still here...

430
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:33,524
working at our restaurant?

431
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:36,296
I don't know...

432
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:40,600
But do you remember the day you came here,

433
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,690
saying you wanted to sell the diner?

434
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:46,756
Yes.

435
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:48,363
But he stopped me...

436
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,875
Yes, so it wasn't concluded.

437
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:55,786
Back then, he said something like this...

438
00:33:57,142 --> 00:34:01,537
It's not a diner, it's "Heo's Diner."

439
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:03,723
 Stay out of this, mister. 

440
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:05,509
 The diner is my business to handle. 

441
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,845
 Excuse me, it is not just a diner. 

442
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:12,708
 It is "Heo's Diner." 

443
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:18,566
 And since the diner bears my name and I run the kitchen as suksu, 

444
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:20,657
 I have a say in this. 

445
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:22,889
Then, he...

446
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:26,186
He wasn't trying to protect the diner.

447
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:29,655
He was trying to take it for himself.

448
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:33,091
I had no idea.

449
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:36,564
I went and named the diner after him.

450
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:39,989
At least you know now.

451
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,044
I'll help you.

452
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:52,112
Thank you, Chef Lee.

453
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,050
Ugh, why is this so exhausting?

454
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,160
I'll pass out at this rate.

455
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:11,110
I'm sorry, today's service is over.

456
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,433
What are you saying? There is still food left. How can you just close up?

457
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:17,195
If Eun Sil finds out, she will be furious.

458
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:20,966
She skipped work today, so who is she to get mad?

459
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:23,596
Anyway, I can't do this any longer.

460
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,150
I guess there is no other choice.

461
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,780
I suppose we will have to call it a day early.

462
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:33,029
Apologies, today's service is over.

463
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:39,048
It is a bit late, but let us eat.

464
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:42,455
I was so busy that I forgot how hungry I was.

465
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:44,949
Seriously, you're the best.

466
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,117
By the way, do you know where Eun Sil went?

467
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,914
I made her hear something unnecessary yesterday,

468
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:02,375
and it is been weighing heavily on her mind.

469
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,182
You two fought again?

470
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:07,042
You're like a couple of kids.

471
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,614
It was not a fight...

472
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,898
What's going on?

473
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:21,769
Should I follow him?

474
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,800
I need to talk to him and find out what he really wants.

475
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,242
I told you, he's dangerous.

476
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:32,043
If you insist on seeing him, take me with you.

477
00:36:32,043 --> 00:36:33,768
Young lady.

478
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:40,023
Why are you with this man?

479
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,660
"This man?"

480
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,233
Just yesterday, you were clinging to me, calling me "Gwansong."

481
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:50,617
Now, your whole attitude has changed overnight.

482
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:53,777
I know what you have done to the madam.

483
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:57,533
I will no longer call you a friend.

484
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:00,485
Young lady, come with me.

485
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,761
This man is dishonest.

486
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,300
- The one I can't trust is you. 
 - What are you saying?

487
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,300
Who are you, really? Tell me the truth.

488
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,144
You approached me and my mom to deceive us, didn't you?

489
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:18,175
Deceive you?

490
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:22,148
I have never lied to you or your mother.

491
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:25,113
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

492
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:27,913
What have you done to my mom?

493
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,990
And after everything, why are you still here?

494
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,100
Why are you still at the diner? What do you want from me?

495
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,220
I have no idea why you are doing this.

496
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,450
You!

497
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,900
You have been manipulating her!

498
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,447
You were the one who harmed her mother!

499
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,192
It's not worth listening to him anymore.

500
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:52,939
Make sure he never sets foot in your mother's diner again.

501
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,809
Mister.

502
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:01,646
Please leave our diner.

503
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:05,419
Young lady, you cannot let him fool you.

504
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,078
Let us talk, just the two of us.

505
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,069
Eun Sil has made her decision.

506
00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:15,885
So, leave the diner.

507
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:20,209
How dare you?

508
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:23,080
Face me fairly and fight me head-on!

509
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,112
Do not hide behind her and twist the truth!

510
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:30,192
 Are you saying he is plotting something against them? 

511
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,550
 It is my fault. 

512
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,900
 I rejected his offer, and now my friends... 

513
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:44,141
Mister!

514
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,097
What is all this about?

515
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:50,265
Eun Sil, why are you treating him like this?

516
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:55,332
After everything he's done for this place, you're just kicking him out?

517
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:59,552
You don't know anything, Mi Sol.

518
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:02,002
Stay out of this.

519
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:04,340
I'm really disappointed in you.

520
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,600
Mister, let's go. I'll find you another restaurant.

521
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,488
You don't need to cling to this second-rate diner.

522
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,274
Make yourself at home.

523
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:28,215
Thank you.

524
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:30,245
Come sit over here.

525
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:33,631
How are you feeling?

526
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I am feeling much better, thanks to you.

527
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:44,293
This whole thing is making me so mad.

528
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:47,910
Why is Eun Sil even siding with that smug jerk, Lee Hyuk?

529
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,732
People like him aren't worth getting upset over.

530
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:55,869
Just forget about it.

531
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,054
Anyway, get some rest.

532
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:16,261
 No, he would never. 

533
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:20,792
 But I saw it with my own eyes. 

534
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:23,567
 The letter written in his own hand. 

535
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:27,303
 Is this a piece of memory I had lost? 

536
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:33,412
 What exactly happened to me and my friends? 

537
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,700
 Lady Eun Sil. 

538
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:57,130
 Taste this. 

539
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:02,120
♫  It was my first time feeling that way  ♫

540
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,380
♫  The noisy moments came to a stop  ♫ 
 ♫  And I got to know you  ♫

541
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,930
♫  The moment I wandered in a long dream  ♫

542
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:15,340
 Did you sleep well? 

543
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:22,220
♫  Even if everything flows away you are still by my side  ♫

544
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:27,470
♫  Don't let go of my hand, not ever  ♫

545
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:35,750
♫  When spring comes let's go there, together  ♫

546
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:41,560
♫  Let's never be apart again  ♫

547
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,557
Mister, sit here for a second.

548
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,915
 - Why am I the only one having a hard time?  
 - Hilarious, right?

549
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:04,892
Everyone laughs while watching my wooden acting.

550
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,420
Come on, lighten up a little.

551
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,600
Being gloomy doesn't suit you at all.

552
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,932
But what does wooden acting mean?

553
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:20,931
Acting stiff like wood.

554
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:23,494
It means my acting is terrible.

555
00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:28,828
I kept trying to become an actress,

556
00:42:28,828 --> 00:42:30,968
but I was always just a joke to people.

557
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:34,294
I do not see what is so funny about this.

558
00:42:35,607 --> 00:42:38,985
Mocking you is not amusing at all.

559
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:42,466
You really know how to say the right things, don't you?

560
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:47,100
But they're right, my acting is wooden.

561
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:51,230
I don't really understand what feeling sad really is.

562
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,192
That's why I'll never make it as an actress.

563
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,710
That is not true.

564
00:42:57,282 --> 00:43:00,203
You are a gifted artist, Mae Chang.

565
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:04,180
The Mae Chang I knew was brilliant in poetry, in music,

566
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,310
in every instrument.

567
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:11,488
Was she really that incredible?

568
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,120
Yes.

569
00:43:13,702 --> 00:43:17,843
I was a huge fan of her talent.

570
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,362
Did she resemble me that much?

571
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:25,544
You resemble her so much, it is almost as if you are the same person.

572
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:28,630
That's not exactly common, you know?

573
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,381
Anyway, my name is Jung Mi Sol.

574
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:37,560
Jung Mi Sol doesn't have any of those talents.

575
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,695
Take my word,

576
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:41,500
Mae Chang.

577
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,330
No, Jung Mi Sol...

578
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,958
is a gifted artist.

579
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,640
Even the most beautiful melodies...

580
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,881
If no one hears them,

581
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:30,773
they are no different from the fleeting whispers of the wind.

582
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:33,726
My Lord, Gyosan.

583
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:45,272
My Lady, terrible news!

584
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,384
Stop! Stop!

585
00:44:56,384 --> 00:44:59,441
Please stop.

586
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:03,210
I will confess everything!

587
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,989
Please stop.

588
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:21,832
So, do you finally remember?

589
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:27,496
Do you recall the crime you and your men have committed?

590
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:30,506
I...

591
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,382
I have committed treason.

592
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,136
I defied the King

593
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:44,147
and I conspired to place Prince Yeongchang on the throne.

594
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:47,693
I am guilty of high treason.

595
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:50,104
So please.

596
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:53,058
Just end my life.

597
00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:58,763
The criminal has confessed.

598
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:01,519
For the crime of treason,

599
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,185
he shall face the severest punishment.

600
00:46:07,345 --> 00:46:09,701
On the coming new moon...

601
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:15,046
carry out their execution.

602
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:16,886
 Yes, Your Excellency! 

603
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,824
I have to go.

604
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,115
Go where?

605
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:35,170
Gwansong.

606
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,508
No, Lee Hyuk is a dangerous man.

607
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:42,530
I cannot let Lady Eun Sil stay by his side.

608
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:46,401
She made her choice.

609
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:49,594
It's her life. Let her deal with it.

610
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:51,554
I have to go.

611
00:46:54,173 --> 00:46:56,220
You're not even in good shape.

612
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,830
Rest today and go tomorrow.

613
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:03,158
If I wait and something happens to her...

614
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:05,990
I will not be able to live with myself.

615
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,230
Thank you for everything.

616
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,473
Fine.

617
00:47:12,473 --> 00:47:14,824
I'll take you there.

618
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:20,619
Mom, I'm here.

619
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,903
Chef Lee is here with me, too.

620
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,389
I heard everything about Mr. Homeless.

621
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:40,399
I can't believe I was so clueless…

622
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,428
Thinking he was protecting our diner, I was grateful to him.

623
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:48,013
I feel so stupid.

624
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:55,300
But thanks to Chef Lee,

625
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,717
at least I know the truth now.

626
00:47:58,717 --> 00:48:02,555
I kicked him out of the diner.

627
00:48:02,555 --> 00:48:07,325
And I'll make sure he pays for what he did to you.

628
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:14,019
I'm going to talk to the nurse for a bit.

629
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,282
That man might try to come see my mom again.

630
00:48:17,282 --> 00:48:20,135
So I need to warn them.

631
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:23,723
Okay, I'll wait here.

632
00:48:23,723 --> 00:48:25,249
Okay.

633
00:48:27,178 --> 00:48:29,486
Mom, I'll be back.

634
00:48:41,196 --> 00:48:44,253
And you don't know where he went?

635
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:57,102
Yes.

636
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:58,898
I understand.

637
00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:00,598
Yes.

638
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:04,040
Is she not at home?

639
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,270
I called the restaurant, but they said Lee Hyuk is out.

640
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,946
Looks like they went somewhere together.

641
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:17,191
I hope nothing bad happens...

642
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,740
Let's just go back, mister.

643
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,940
We don't even know when they'll return.

644
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:25,430
No, I have someone else I need to meet.

645
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,570
You should head home, Mae Chang.

646
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:29,296
Thank you.

647
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,714
And for the clothes, too.

648
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:39,720
   

649
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,291
 Congratulations, inspector! 

650
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,851
You there, officer!

651
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:04,636
What?

652
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,592
How did you know I was here?

653
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:11,269
I come from the police station.

654
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:14,223
They said you were in this area, so I searched everywhere.

655
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:18,578
Let's talk outside.

656
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:21,889
How is the investigation on Lee Hyuk going?

657
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:24,027
You cannot afford to waste any more time.

658
00:50:24,027 --> 00:50:26,310
That man not only harmed the diner's madam,

659
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:29,130
but now he is targeting Eun Sil!

660
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:32,194
Why have I not heard any updates?

661
00:50:32,194 --> 00:50:34,515
Hey, Kang.

662
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,631
What's going on?

663
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:39,569
It's nothing.

664
00:50:40,775 --> 00:50:42,567
Follow me.

665
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:45,794
Where are you going?

666
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:47,612
Hey, officer!

667
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,532
You're doing this to me on purpose, aren't you?

668
00:50:50,532 --> 00:50:54,940
You deliberately came to a police gathering to spout that nonsense, didn't you?

669
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,872
I only spoke the truth, so why are you so upset?

670
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:03,795
I've got enough on my plate as it is!

671
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:05,989
I have made a formal request for an investigation.

672
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:09,108
You need to reveal the truth about Lee Hyuk's crimes.

673
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,213
- We have no time to lose. 
 - Reveal what, exactly?

674
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:14,874
You are the suspect!

675
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:16,657
What did you say?

676
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:21,780
Bong Eun Sil thinks you were the one who hurt her mother!

677
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,381
How would you know that?

678
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,177
Because I'm the one who's supposed to arrest you.

679
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:30,565
But if you go down, I go down with you.

680
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:35,316
Ever since I helped you in the beginning, letting an unidentified person walk free

681
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:37,413
and today's identification...

682
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:40,883
Forget it.

683
00:51:40,883 --> 00:51:43,429
Can you please...

684
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:46,120
just disappear?

685
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,445
I'm begging you. Don't make things worse and just go.

686
00:51:49,445 --> 00:51:53,197
Lee Hyuk isn't someone you can take on.

687
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:57,596
So you never planned to investigate Lee Hyuk at all, did you?

688
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,818
How long have you been his lapdog?

689
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,404
What?

690
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:07,580
Lapdog?

691
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,128
Say that again.

692
00:52:09,128 --> 00:52:10,760
Say that again!

693
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,418
Move out of the way.

694
00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:16,779
I have nothing more to say to someone like you.

695
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:19,310
I will find help elsewhere.

696
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:24,618
I told you not to make things worse!

697
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:26,336
I said, move!

698
00:52:26,336 --> 00:52:28,287
Why, you...

699
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,779
What are you doing?

700
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,632
I should have just...

701
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,460
Let go of me!

702
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:37,038
You bastard!

703
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:43,959
Come on, why did you have to do that?

704
00:52:56,514 --> 00:52:58,805
 It is time to end this. 

705
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:07,567
Hey.

706
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:10,399
What's the matter?

707
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:12,073
What?

708
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,696
Kang!

709
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,243
 My Lord, your friends are in danger. 

710
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:29,340
 The seven illegitimate sons you cherish! They are in grave danger. 

711
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,622
 My friends? In danger? 

712
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:33,457
 It is my fault. 

713
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:36,420
 I rejected his offer, and now my friends... 

714
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:41,131
 I take it Gwansong was the one who ordered my death. 

715
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:46,410
 Now, it is time to go. 

716
00:53:53,670 --> 00:54:00,540


717
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:10,460
♫  Even if everything flows away you are still by my side  ♫

718
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:16,570
♫  Don't let go of my hand, not ever  ♫

719
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:23,800
♫  When spring comes let's go there, together  ♫

720
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,700
♫  Let's never be apart again  ♫

721
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:50,880
♫  It always felt so distant the word “us”  ♫
