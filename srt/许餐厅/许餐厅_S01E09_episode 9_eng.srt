1
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:05,086
   

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:06,486
   

3
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,249
   

4
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:12,802
   

5
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,715
   

6
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,428
       

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,839
   

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,175
   

9
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:32,452
   

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,284
Now that we have uncovered those conspiring to enthrone Prince Yeongchang,

11
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:45,127
all those who once stood behind him

12
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:48,508
will cower in fear.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,090
Yes. If this has eased His Majesty's concerns,

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,087
I have nothing more to wish for.

15
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:06,621
And to think that all those traitors turned out to be illegitimate sons.

16
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:09,875
How remarkable is that?

17
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:16,463
We have triumphed without so much as staining our hands with blood.

18
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:21,948
Your acumen never fails to impress me.

19
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,337
You flatter me.

20
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:31,106
I suppose the blood of illegitimate sons

21
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:34,985
must be as clear as this wine, so that you fail to see it.

22
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,410
What?

23
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:43,465
A great cause often demands minor sacrifices.

24
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:51,464
It is merely the reckless words of a lowly girl who knows nothing of state affairs.

25
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:54,057
So please pay it no mind.

26
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,132
Speaking of which...

27
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:05,682
When do you plan to conclude this matter?

28
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,676
The traitors...

29
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:18,345
will be executed on the night of the coming new moon.

30
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,132
 I... 

31
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,568
 I must return. 

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,375
I must return and set everything straight.

33
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,703
 Was I mistaken? 

34
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:05,617
 But if she really did move... 

35
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,136
 If, by any chance... 

36
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:18,976
 If she regains consciousness, everything will be over. 

37
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,158
- Hello. 
 - Oh, you're here.

38
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,747
I was just about to contact you.

39
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,535
Pardon?

40
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:43,832
Why?

41
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:47,058
I'm afraid we'll need to free up the ICU.

42
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,469
We're short on beds, and…

43
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,182
There's nothing more we can do for your mother here.

44
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:58,084
Then what happens to my mom?

45
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,081
Well...

46
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:01,881
Excuse me.

47
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:16,600
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,990
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, are you okay?

49
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,852
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol!

50
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:25,655
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, sir!

51
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:28,253
Sir, can you hear me?

52
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:32,194
Lee Sang Cheol, are you okay?

53
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,848
Sir!

54
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,956
What did they say about your mother's condition?

55
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:47,858
There's been no improvement.

56
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:49,040
No improvement?

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,875
No response or movement of any kind?

58
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,575
None.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,173
They said continuing ICU treatment is meaningless now

60
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:04,753
and advised moving her to a general ward.

61
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:12,466
Once she's moved, she'll need someone by her side at all times.

62
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,876
Then, what about the diner?

63
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:19,132
Well, with Mr. Homeless gone...

64
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:22,400
I can't run the diner alone.

65
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,534
I'll have to focus on taking care of my mom.

66
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:27,879
I see.

67
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,660
Then, Eun Sil, let's proceed with the contract...

68
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,499
Chef Lee!

69
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,434
Could you pull over here for a moment?

70
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,156
What?

71
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,116
Hey, be honest with me.

72
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,415
What's going on?

73
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:53,995
It's no big deal.

74
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,717
You didn't have to come all the way here.

75
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,656
Cut the act.

76
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,227
It looked like you were arguing with someone.

77
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,631
You've been acting strange lately.

78
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,240
It's just some unstable guy bothering me, that's all.

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,283
I'll reason with him, so don't worry.

80
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,165
You mean that, right?

81
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,700
Yes, of course! Don't you trust me?

82
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,033
You should return to the gathering or you'll get an earful.

83
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,415
Go on ahead. I'll be right behind you.

84
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,968
Okay, don't take too long.

85
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,419
Okay.

86
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,044
Excuse me...

87
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,846
We're closed.

88
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:00,944
I just have a quick question.

89
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:03,690
Have you seen an elderly man around here?

90
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,490
Short in stature, slightly hunched?

91
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,972
You again? Didn't you ask the same thing last time?

92
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:10,265
I already told you I've never seen anyone like that.

93
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:12,005
Is that so?

94
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,876
Excuse me, old man!

95
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,093
Yes?

96
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:31,833
Apologies…

97
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:51,613
A thief broke into our diner and smashed a jar my mom cherished.

98
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:56,325
I wanted to see if it could be restored

99
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,007
and also find out what exactly it is.

100
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,399
I see.

101
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,535
But I could've come alone.

102
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,374
You've been stuck with me all day and couldn't even work.

103
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:10,402
You should head home, Chef.

104
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,451
It's fine.

105
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:17,993
You're making me feel bad...

106
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:20,123
I told you I'd help.

107
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,171
Don't worry about it.

108
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,330
Do you think this will take long?

109
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:35,011
I think it's a Joseon-era white porcelain piece.

110
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,318
Do you think it can be restored?

111
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:42,501
My mom treasured it so much…

112
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,491
How much do you think it's worth?

113
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,246
It's got a couple of zeros.

114
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,253
A couple of zeros…

115
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,871
Is it 100 million won?

116
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,398
Or 10 million won?

117
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,372
It's worth 10,000 won.

118
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:10,827
A mass-produced, low-grade piece.

119
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:14,471
So, do you still want to restore it?

120
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:19,979
Why did Mom treasure a jar worth only 10,000 won?

121
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,727
She must not have known.

122
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,921
I guess this makes it awkward to ask the police to track down the thief...

123
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,936
Thank you for everything today, Chef.

124
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,729
I'll head in now.

125
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,584
Wait, Eun Sil...

126
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,631
I'm exhausted.

127
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,845
Can I have a cup of coffee before I go?

128
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:18,558
Of course, come on in.

129
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,466
Old man, show yourself!

130
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,551
If you were the one who brought me here

131
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,612
then surely, you are the one who can send me back!

132
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:53,471
I must return!

133
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:57,024
The lives of my friends depend on it.

134
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,344
So, please...

135
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:02,877
Send me back to Joseon!

136
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,750
Oh, my goodness!

137
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,879
Who are you?

138
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,951
Wasn't it you who came looking for me?

139
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,429
Old man!

140
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,705
All the memories I lost have returned.

141
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:45,845
I now clearly remember what happened...

142
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,642
before I ended up here.

143
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:52,068
But I do not belong in this place.

144
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,644
Please send me back to Joseon.

145
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,888
I saved you from drowning

146
00:12:57,888 --> 00:13:00,854
and now you demand I grant your wishes?

147
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:03,780
Was saving your life not enough?

148
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,717
I cannot thank you enough for that.

149
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:12,790
But I will not stand by

150
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,070
and let my friends die so I can live.

151
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,446
I told you I would save your life.

152
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:22,236
I never said I would send you where you wish to go.

153
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,371
I beg you, old man.

154
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,376
There are people I must protect.

155
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:38,292
And what can you offer me in return?

156
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,287
What do you want?

157
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,292
Name your price, and I will pay it.

158
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,767
Very well, I give you my word.

159
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,506
So, send me to Joseon...

160
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:06,004
One thing, though...

161
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:11,038
If you return this time, you will never be able to come back.

162
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:15,194
I understand.

163
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:47,829
 You! You have been manipulating her! 

164
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,820
 You were the one who harmed her mother! 

165
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,548
 It's not worth listening to him anymore. 

166
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:57,205
Wait! Stop!

167
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,263
Why?

168
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,747
Have you changed your mind already?

169
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,155
No.

170
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,417
I will return.

171
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:10,337
But there is something I must do first.

172
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,529
Really?

173
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,393
But by then, your friends will all be dead.

174
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:19,981
Then send me back to before they die.

175
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:25,324
Do you think time bends to your will?

176
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:30,349
As the moon waxes here, so it waxes there.

177
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:35,195
Also as the moon wanes here, so it wanes there.

178
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:46,180
Your friends will be executed on the night of the coming new moon.

179
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,168
The new moon?

180
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:52,556
That is far too soon!

181
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:55,239
So, make your decision.

182
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,850
Will you return to their side?

183
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,261
Or will you stay here?

184
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:06,403
 There are only six days left until the new moon. 

185
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:11,345
 Even if I return now, I may not be able to save them. 

186
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,017
 However... 

187
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:17,015
I cannot return like this.

188
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:19,158
Give me a few more days.

189
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,635
I enjoyed the coffee.

190
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,658
Thank you, Eun Sil.

191
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:43,058
I should be the one thanking you.

192
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,891
Drive home safely.

193
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,923
Was this house always this quiet?

194
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:41,677
So careless...

195
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,104
What if another thief breaks in?

196
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:49,234
This is why I cannot leave with ease.

197
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:00,657
What was that?

198
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:03,665
No way... another thief?

199
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:22,818
Is someone there?

200
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,999
I'm calling the police!

201
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,767
Fortunately, everything looks fine.

202
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:07,974
Time for round two!

203
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,396
Let's go.

204
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:10,694
We had enough.

205
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:13,542
- But still, let's go for one more! Second round! 
 - I'm in!

206
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,545
- Let's go, let's go! 
 - Where to? Karaoke?

207
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,694
Sounds good!

208
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,152
We need to unwind today.

209
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:20,923
What's this?

210
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:23,589
Why aren't you picking up?

211
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:27,374
It's my wife...

212
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,168
She'll just nag me to come home early.

213
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,719
Give it to me, I'll talk to her...

214
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,662
No, no, no!

215
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,435
I'll handle it.

216
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:37,087
Why go the hard way?

217
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:42,182
Yes, honey.

218
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,431
I told you, it's a work dinner.

219
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:48,569
What?

220
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,438
You can't just barge in like this.

221
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,789
Do you know how many eyes are on us?

222
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:16,484
Didn't you say she was neither dead nor alive?

223
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,760
What?

224
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,774
The owner of the diner.

225
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,716
You said she was unconscious and unresponsive.

226
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,834
Yes, I did.

227
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,560
She moved.

228
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,500
What?

229
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,610
I saw it with my own eyes.

230
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,149
She moved.

231
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,540
We should get out of here first.

232
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,620
Let's talk somewhere else.

233
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:55,517
I told you to keep a close watch on her.

234
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,542
Detective Kang.

235
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:00,302
Is there anything you can do properly?

236
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:03,732
Excuse me?

237
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,287
At the diner, Heo's Diner or something

238
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:22,597
there was a break-in, and I was investigating.

239
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,493
And somehow, you're involved again.

240
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,945
I had my reasons.

241
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,428
I'm too anxious to sleep.

242
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:51,540
This never happened when Mr. Homeless was around.

243
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,316
What are you saying, Bong Eun Sil?

244
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,144
He's the one you should fear the most!

245
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,175
Should I ask my friends to come over?

246
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:17,995
   

247
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,624
 Who is speaking? 

248
00:22:27,624 --> 00:22:30,186
 Where is Lady Eun Sil? 

249
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:32,630
 Call her here at once! 

250
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,257
 Excuse me? 

251
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,599
 If Lady Eun Sil is there, please tell her. 

252
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,352
 I am waiting for her at home, worried. 

253
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:48,191
 Please tell her to come home soon. 

254
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:55,605
 I must have troubled her by bringing up what should have been left unsaid. 

255
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,673
 Despite her tough front, she is a soft-hearted lady... 

256
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:09,170
What's with this mister?

257
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,013
This is so confusing.

258
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:15,819
 Young lady, you cannot let him fool you. 

259
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,671
 Let us talk, just the two of us. 

260
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:22,476
What was he trying to say then?

261
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,420
 Mr. Homeless. 

262
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:40,403
 Hello? 

263
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:44,003
 Eun Sil? 

264
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:48,466
It's you, Mi Sol?

265
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:52,596
I guess you're with Mr. Homeless.

266
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:54,383
 Why are you asking about him? 

267
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,603
Well...

268
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,919
You kicked him out so heartlessly earlier

269
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,542
so why are you looking for him now?

270
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,408
 You're right. 

271
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:07,585
 I shouldn't have called. 

272
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,262
I'll hang up.

273
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:12,078
 He's not here. 

274
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:14,553
He left his phone behind.

275
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,513
He wasn't feeling well but he still went back to Seonbuk-dong

276
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:19,658
because he was worried about you.

277
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,428
 What? 

278
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:25,024
If I were him, I would've cut ties with you without a second thought.

279
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,836
What's so great about you—

280
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:28,157
Hello?

281
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:29,751
Hello?

282
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:32,980
Did she hang up?

283
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:36,715
Wow, this girl has no manners!

284
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:40,521
Mister?

285
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:43,835
What mister?

286
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:46,115
Do you have some mister I don't know about?

287
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:47,675
That's not funny.

288
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:51,711
Didn't I tell you to call before coming?

289
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:55,835
I did, but you didn't pick up.

290
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:58,029
What are you mad about this time?

291
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,285
Why are you here?

292
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:02,531
If you're not feeling well, we can talk later.

293
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:04,167
It's important.

294
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,995
Just say it and go. I'm exhausted.

295
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:09,752
I came to give you this.

296
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,194
What is it?

297
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,554
A script?

298
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:18,535
I told you I'm not acting.

299
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:19,601
Take it back.

300
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,167
I never said you had to accept it. Just read it.

301
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,922
- I'm leaving. 
 - Take it with you!

302
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,717
Throw it away then.

303
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:15,638
   
 (T/N: A thought filled with worry and concern.) 

304
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:20,097
Why did you go to Heo's Diner?

305
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:22,953
It was nothing.

306
00:26:23,903 --> 00:26:26,264
The door was open, so I stepped in

307
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:28,648
and I accidentally broke a jar.

308
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:32,294
Turns out it was just a cheap knockoff.

309
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,846
So closing the case won't be an issue.

310
00:26:37,265 --> 00:26:40,281
You say things so easily...

311
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:43,071
Well, fine.

312
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:44,603
Let's say that checks out.

313
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,567
But that man, Heo Gyosan, or was it Heo Gyun?

314
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,601
He knows what's between us.

315
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,384
What are you going to do about this?

316
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,187
It doesn't matter.

317
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:59,558
No one's going to believe him now.

318
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,778
So stop worrying about useless things

319
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:07,163
and focus on keeping tabs on the diner owner's condition.

320
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,880
As long as...

321
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,873
As long as she doesn't wake up

322
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,878
everything will be fine.

323
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:24,160
What the hell happened that day between you and the diner owner?

324
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,620
I need to know what I'm covering for

325
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,260
if you want me to defend you properly.

326
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,701
Don't cross the line.

327
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:38,824
Just do as I say.

328
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:51,964
What?

329
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,174
That's the chef's car…

330
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,340
He hasn't left yet?

331
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:20,033
Do Chef and Detective Kang know each other?

332
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,927
 The moon will wane soon… 

333
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:33,695
 There is far too little time. 

334
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:35,341
 And on top of that, Lady Eun Sil... 

335
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:37,562
 The one I can't trust is you. 

336
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:40,243
 Who are you, really? 

337
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:42,930
 Tell me the truth. 

338
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:46,223
She does not trust me.

339
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:56,117
If I fail to turn this around

340
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,794
I cannot call myself a Transcendent Genius.

341
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:02,016
I must settle these matters quickly

342
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:04,546
and return to save my friends.

343
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,940
Just hold on a little longer...

344
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:51,798
Chef Lee, what a brilliant idea!

345
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:54,761
Donating lunchboxes. How thoughtful.

346
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:57,848
I'm flattered you're here to visit

347
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:00,459
for something so insignificant.

348
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,861
You donated such a large quantity of meals and at the exact time

349
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:06,937
of the dignitary's visit to the underprivileged.

350
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,759
Of course, I had to come see you in person.

351
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:15,536
Were you aware of the dignitary's schedule in advance?

352
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:19,941
If I overstepped, I apologize.

353
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,361
Not at all.

354
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,919
Even the dignitary will be pleased.

355
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,961
And it reflects well on me, too.

356
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:29,405
Thank you.

357
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:33,013
Actually, I'd like to discuss with you in private...

358
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,287
Oh, what a shame.

359
00:30:36,287 --> 00:30:38,162
I really should be heading out now.

360
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:42,105
The menu for the state banquet has been finalized.

361
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:43,813
Really?

362
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,792
I'll only be available until late tomorrow.

363
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,970
Then please stop by whenever you can.

364
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,883
I'll clear my entire evening.

365
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:59,400
Okay, then I'll give you a call when I leave tomorrow.

366
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,103
Understood.

367
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,385
So, the guy who just left... that was the Secretary-General?

368
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,696
That's what they're saying.

369
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,088
How does Mr. Lee know someone like him?

370
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:16,891
Seriously, his business skills are something else.

371
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:18,854
When did he manage to build such golden connections?

372
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:20,300
Exactly.

373
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,588
Mr. Lee, what brings the Secretary-General here?

374
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,171
I'm...

375
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:41,817
Set to be appointed as the head chef

376
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,735
for the state banquet hosted by the President.

377
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:51,480
It will serve as a crucial platform to introduce Dorae to the world.

378
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,147
The day when Dorae and the Korean Cuisine Theme Village

379
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:58,483
become the heart of the Hallyu is not far off.

380
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,169
Wow!

381
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,796
But it's too soon to be impressed.

382
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:10,044
There's even better news that will delight you all.

383
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,191
The final piece...

384
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:19,935
of the Theme Village puzzle has finally fallen into place.

385
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:23,213
You did a great job, Mr. Lee.

386
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:26,871
You never disappoint.

387
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:31,526
 This is all I have to offer... 

388
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:33,796
 It might not be to your taste. 

389
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:37,263
 It's okay. 

390
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:48,446
 This is good. 

391
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,294
 Really? 

392
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:52,983
 You must be tired. Go ahead and drink up. 

393
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,846
 Want another? 

394
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,679
 No, no, it's okay. 

395
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,989
 Well... Eun Sil. 

396
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:18,473
 I know taking care of your mother must be a heavy burden, 

397
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:21,939
 so I want to help lighten it for you. 

398
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:36,164
 I'm sure your mother would want the same. 

399
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,035
Since we finally secured the diner after years of waiting,

400
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:45,014
I'm going to create a Korean dessert café,

401
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:48,203
a place so remarkable it will leave everyone in awe.

402
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:53,512
I would like to thank you all

403
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,908
for being patient and believing in me.

404
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,324
I knew we could count on Mr. Lee!

405
00:33:58,324 --> 00:34:01,161
I've never doubted him once.

406
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:03,241
So this was it!

407
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:10,202
This is why you harmed the madam.

408
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,047
Mom.

409
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:26,596
They're moving you to a general ward this afternoon.

410
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:30,197
Once you're there, I'll be by your side all day.

411
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:32,007
Isn't that nice?

412
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:39,561
I sold the restaurant.

413
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,710
Chef Lee offered a good deal.

414
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,780
If this was how it was going to end,

415
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,960
I should've just sold it sooner.

416
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,062
Then I wouldn't have met that mister…

417
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:04,596
From now on, I'll focus only on taking care of you.

418
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:08,503
I'll make sure you wake up, Mom.

419
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,752
Detective Kang!

420
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:28,461
Detective Kang!

421
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:34,337
I should've asked if he caught the culprit

422
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:36,563
but we keep missing each other since yesterday.

423
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:42,551
 I have something to say! 

424
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:43,721
You can't go in here!

425
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:45,173
Let go of me!

426
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:46,857
I said, let go!

427
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:49,159
I must speak with him!

428
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:01,947
   

429
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,351
I knew you had your reasons to harm the madam.

430
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:13,007
However, was it all just to get your hands on the diner?

431
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,402
Is that why you left her to die?

432
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:21,793
Yes, I took over the diner.

433
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:24,801
But the rest of your claims are nothing more than wild theories.

434
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:27,802
Eun Sil thinks you are the one responsible

435
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:31,962
for what happened to the diner owner.

436
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:41,363
That day, I heard music at the scene of the accident.

437
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:45,032
It was the alarm you set

438
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:49,125
the one that rings at the same time every day to wake you up.

439
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,720
You were there at that very moment.

440
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,590
And yet, you did not rush to the injured madam.

441
00:36:55,591 --> 00:37:00,877
Which means... you were hoping for the worst,

442
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:03,593
so you could take over the diner without a hitch!

443
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:18,501
If you're going to make such absurd accusations

444
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,432
you'd better bring proof.

445
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:29,631
Achieving your desires by all means...

446
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,874
Gwansong was just like you.

447
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:37,718
Fine.

448
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:39,936
I will bring the evidence.

449
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:44,084
Evidence so undeniable, you will not be able to talk your way out of it.

450
00:37:56,098 --> 00:37:58,742
There's no such thing.

451
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,990
This is my attorney. He'll be assisting us with the process.

452
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,738
Hello.

453
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:11,309
Yes, hello.

454
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:14,914
Let's discuss things comfortably.

455
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:18,727
For the real estate transaction to be fully completed on behalf of your mother

456
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:21,398
you'll need a court ruling to appoint you as her legal guardian.

457
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:24,410
Since your mother is completely unconscious

458
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,318
and you have no other family,

459
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:30,110
the process should move relatively quickly.

460
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,684
I see.

461
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:35,440
How long will it take?

462
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,210
It usually takes around six months,

463
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,400
but I'll try to get it done within three.

464
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,435
Three months?

465
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:52,720
That's far too long.

466
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,775
That's the standard time frame.

467
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:58,405
I explicitly told you this is a priority.

468
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:01,670
Did I not make myself clear?

469
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,481
Do you think I'm paying your high legal fees just to be delayed like this?

470
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:13,260
Get it done in a month.

471
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:16,485
Chef.

472
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,949
There are business matters involved.

473
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,814
Was it that urgent?

474
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:33,509
Why didn't you tell me before?

475
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:36,413
You don't need to worry about it, Eun Sil.

476
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:39,975
Attorney.

477
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:41,846
Is it possible?

478
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,583
Yes, I'll do my best to shorten it to a month.

479
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,370
Did you bring the documents I requested?

480
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,936
Yes.

481
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,012
This is the agreement regarding the real estate contract.

482
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:04,948
An agreement?

483
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:11,239
It includes the penalty clause in case you decide to cancel during the review period.

484
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:15,666
A penalty... ten times the damages?

485
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:20,237
If the contract is terminated you'll have to pay ten times the deposit amount.

486
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:23,901
You're not planning on backing out, are you?

487
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,897
No, of course not.

488
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:47,135
I've sent 150 million won to you.

489
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:49,142
Please check.

490
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,118
   

491
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:59,067
Yes, I received it.

492
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,559
I guess there's no turning back now.

493
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:08,726
Well then, I'll get going.

494
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,532
I'll be on my way as well.

495
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:22,274
Stay for some tea before you go.

496
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:23,466
No.

497
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:27,080
No, I don't want to take up your time.

498
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,434
I still have to clear out the diner and take care of my mom.

499
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:39,537
You're personally taking care of her?

500
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:48,250
I was thinking of arranging a caregiver for your mother.

501
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,995
I appreciate the thought...

502
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:56,242
but now that I have nothing else to do, I'd rather just stay by her side.

503
00:41:56,242 --> 00:41:59,585
Besides, I have someone who can check in when I step out.

504
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,317
I see.

505
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:08,901
Oh, by the way!

506
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,317
About the break-in at our diner...

507
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:15,589
Could you ask about it for me?

508
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:18,275
I haven't been able to get in touch with Detective Kang.

509
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:22,166
Me?

510
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:27,044
I can't reach Detective Kang.

511
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,235
You know Detective Kang, right?

512
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:33,826
No.

513
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:35,721
Who is he?

514
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,247
You don't know him?

515
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:44,336
- But yesterday... 
 - I don't know... anyone by that name.

516
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,073
I see.

517
00:42:48,073 --> 00:42:50,482
I must've been mistaken.

518
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:08,337
 That's far too long. 

519
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:13,805
 Do you think I'm paying your high legal fees just to be delayed like this? 

520
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:17,713
 I never expected to see that side of Chef Lee... 

521
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:20,630
 What could be so urgent? 

522
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,903
 You know Detective Kang, right? 

523
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,410
 No. 

524
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,317
 Who is he? 

525
00:43:30,122 --> 00:43:33,068
I'm sure it was the chef's car.

526
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:36,698
I couldn't have been mistaken.

527
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,000
   

528
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:05,940
Mister!

529
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,910
Mae Chang, I am here to retrieve the phone I left behind.

530
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,203
What?

531
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:14,728
Why not just say you came because you missed me?

532
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:16,918
That is also true.

533
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:19,518
I had to twist your arm to hear that.

534
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:24,181
Thank you. This is essential for what I must do.

535
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:27,781
But then... I'm hungry.

536
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,094
There is nothing I can do for you because you have no ingredients at home.

537
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:43,330
Mae Chang, instead of starving,

538
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,890
use sesame oil and salt to make rice balls like this.

539
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:48,906
Here, go ahead.

540
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:52,423
No, I'll just eat what you make me.

541
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:58,517
I am telling you this because I cannot cook for you anymore.

542
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:00,103
Why?

543
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:04,354
Because I am leaving this place.

544
00:45:04,354 --> 00:45:06,659
You got a job, didn't you?

545
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:10,189
Which restaurant? I'll come visit you.

546
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:12,320
It is a place you cannot come to.

547
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,097
How far is it?

548
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,125
Somewhere in the countryside?

549
00:45:16,956 --> 00:45:19,974
Or are you going abroad?

550
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:22,014
Much farther than that.

551
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:26,117
Then, just find a new job in Korea. I'll help you look.

552
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,438
I must go.

553
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,012
So, learn how to cook for yourself.

554
00:45:36,012 --> 00:45:38,797
You must never skip your meals.

555
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:42,259
Way to kill my appetite…

556
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,220
You will change your mind after you taste it.

557
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:52,500
Come, let us eat before it gets cold.

558
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,140
   

559
00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:59,144
What is that?

560
00:45:59,144 --> 00:46:00,775
Nothing important.

561
00:46:01,464 --> 00:46:03,260
It looked like a book.

562
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,263
I got offered a role in a movie...

563
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:11,314
But I'm not going to take it

564
00:46:11,314 --> 00:46:13,614
because I'll probably ruin it again.

565
00:46:13,614 --> 00:46:14,814
Nonsense.

566
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,945
How can you say that without even trying?

567
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:19,575
I know myself better than anyone.

568
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,230
They'll just mock me for bad acting again

569
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,640
because of another crying scene, anyway.

570
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:27,828
So you are afraid.

571
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:31,144
Whatever, let's just eat.

572
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:40,113
Wait, this is really just sesame oil and salt?

573
00:46:40,113 --> 00:46:42,742
It's so good!

574
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:47,512
Before coming here, I never knew I could cook.

575
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:52,196
I was reluctant even to enter the kitchen.

576
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:55,725
But once I did, I realized it was nothing at all.

577
00:46:55,725 --> 00:47:00,943
If I had let my hesitation stop me, I would not be here now

578
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,644
sharing this meal with you.

579
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:27,969
Miss.

580
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:30,020
Hello.

581
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,541
I stopped by during shift change.

582
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,943
How's your mother doing?

583
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:36,718
Well...

584
00:47:36,718 --> 00:47:39,400
She seems calm... Almost like she doesn't even realize

585
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,183
she's in a different room.

586
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:45,498
By the way, did her nephew leave?

587
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:47,001
Pardon?

588
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:48,764
Nephew?

589
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:51,096
He visited this morning as well.

590
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:54,302
- He came to see my mom? 
 - Yes.

591
00:47:54,302 --> 00:47:58,334
He asked when she'd be moved, so I assumed he'd be here.

592
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:05,701
What does he look like?

593
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:14,023
Mister, do you have to go?

594
00:48:16,591 --> 00:48:18,402
I do.

595
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,370
Thank you for everything.

596
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,074
Why are you talking like we'll never see each other again?

597
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:30,024
Even if you're going overseas, it's just a few hours away.

598
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:32,759
Give me your phone.

599
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:43,408
I saved my phone so you can call me.

600
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:45,731
And if you ever get curious about what I'm up to

601
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,246
just search "Jung Mi Sol."

602
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:51,458
Like this.

603
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,551
You can look me up like this, okay?

604
00:48:55,995 --> 00:48:58,227
So many words and pictures…

605
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:01,714
If I type in my name, will things about me show up as well?

606
00:49:01,714 --> 00:49:03,656
Come on, your name won't show any results.

607
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:06,910
This is only possible for celebrities like me... So...

608
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,506
Only famous people can be searched for.

609
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:12,272
Is that so?

610
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:16,112
Be sure to call me.

611
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:19,263
And return as soon as possible.

612
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:23,994
That might not be possible.

613
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,164
Stay healthy and live without regrets, Mae Chang.

614
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:30,779
I mean,

615
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:34,067
Lady Mi Sol.

616
00:49:41,534 --> 00:49:45,065
 He looked to be in his late 30s… 

617
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:50,279
 Quite tall, with sharp, striking features. 

618
00:49:50,803 --> 00:49:53,731
 This morning, he was wearing a navy padded jacket. 

619
00:49:56,157 --> 00:49:58,050
 Detective Kang! 

620
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:01,627
 Detective— 

621
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:07,265
 Why would Detective Kang pretend to be my mom's nephew? 

622
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,366
 You have been manipulating her! 

623
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:19,830
 You were the one who harmed her mother! 

624
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,458
What if he was telling the truth

625
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:26,093
and the chef was lying?

626
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:33,184
That would mean he really did come from Joseon.

627
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,040
That's ridiculous.

628
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,271
Excuse me...

629
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:53,166
Oh, you're the owner of the 10,000-won jar.

630
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,443
Are you here to restore your jar?

631
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:58,904
No, this time, I brought this.

632
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,290
It's a new book.

633
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,630
Just from this, I could learn everything there is to know about Lady Mi Sol.

634
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,258
Oh! Oh my...

635
00:51:57,368 --> 00:51:59,382
Wait.

636
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:03,132
If I can find every piece of information on someone...

637
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:09,981
   

638
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:13,464
   

639
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,098
   

640
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,584
   

641
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:29,688
I cannot give a value to this.

642
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,691
As I expected.

643
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,765
Is that so?

644
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:36,623
This is "Domundaejak."

645
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:40,161
It was written over 400 years ago

646
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:44,511
and only the manuscripts remain to this date.

647
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:46,490
But this...

648
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,957
This seems to be the original version, no matter how much I look at it.

649
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:54,212
Let alone the content, this handwriting...

650
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,839
The paper looks new,

651
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:01,741
but it's undoubtedly made using a technique from the mid-Joseon Dynasty.

652
00:53:03,753 --> 00:53:06,495
Then, the person who wrote this is...

653
00:53:06,495 --> 00:53:08,010
Heo Gyun!

654
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:11,489
Look.

655
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:15,770
Where did you get this?

656
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:19,700
Can I take the book back?

657
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,038
What have you done?

658
00:53:22,038 --> 00:53:25,702
How did you store a book from 400 years ago

659
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,643
to make it look like it was written only a few days ago?

660
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,589
Give it to me.

661
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:32,506
How much do you want?

662
00:53:32,506 --> 00:53:34,616
Tell me, I'll give you as much as you want.

663
00:53:34,616 --> 00:53:36,515
Oh, give it to me!

664
00:53:36,515 --> 00:53:38,917
I need to return it.

665
00:53:41,442 --> 00:53:43,718
You stole that, didn't you?

666
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:09,413
   

667
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,280
 Heo Gyun was a civil servant of the Joseon Dynasty. 

668
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,024
 In the 27th year of King Seonjo's reign, he passed the state civil service exam. 

669
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:17,931
 In the 30th year, he passed the special examination again 

670
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:22,697
 and served as the Magistrate of Gongju but was impeached, dismissed, and exiled. 

671
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:25,417
 He sought to resist the rigid social hierarchy 

672
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:29,500
 and discrimination against illegitimate sons. 

673
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,521
 However, his plan was discovered, and he was executed by dismemberment. 

674
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:50,040


675
00:54:52,366 --> 00:54:53,941
   

676
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:55,275
   

677
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:58,392
   

678
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:10,140
♫  Even if everything flows away you are still by my side  ♫

679
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:16,280
♫  Don't let go of my hand, not ever  ♫

680
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:23,950
♫  When spring comes let's go there, together  ♫

681
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:30,320
♫  Let's never be apart again  ♫

682
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:50,880
♫  It always felt so distant the word “us”  ♫
