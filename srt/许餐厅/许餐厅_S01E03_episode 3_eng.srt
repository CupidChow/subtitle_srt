1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,870


2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,944
   

3
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:05,720
   

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,510
   

5
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:11,509
   

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,873
   

7
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:17,610
       

8
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,697
   

9
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:28,433
   

10
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,790
   

11
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,669
Mom.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,002
Mom.

13
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:42,820
Mom...

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,392
This area is off-limits.

15
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,581
Mister...

16
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:55,847
My mom will be okay, right?

17
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,314
It's not serious, is it?

18
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:06,500
I only said awful things to her...

19
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,230
What if something happens to her?

20
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:14,724
I told her I didn't want to live with her anymore.

21
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:18,344
But I didn't mean it. I need to tell her that...

22
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:22,591
What if she just leaves me?

23
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,322
Life and death are in the hands of the heavens.

24
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:33,465
No amount of worry can change fate...

25
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,705
So let us wait patiently.

26
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:46,523
Excuse me.

27
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,703
   
   

28
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:51,693
We received a report from a resident.

29
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,677
I'd like to ask a few questions about the incident.

30
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:58,861
Are you the first witness?

31
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,546
That is correct.

32
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:03,793
I was the first to find the madam injured.

33
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,923
Do you recall what time it was?

34
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,987
The rain made it difficult to tell,

35
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:14,781
but dawn had yet to break.

36
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,854
It must have been around the hour of the Tiger.

37
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:18,490
Tiger...

38
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,505
Hour of the Tiger?

39
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,289
It was probably around 5 AM.

40
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,003
Five, okay.

41
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,073
Now that I think about it, she usually prepares to open the diner around then,

42
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:37,324
so I don't understand why she was there.

43
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,837
Isn't that her usual route?

44
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,914
No, she barely had any reason to go that way.

45
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,742
Oh, I see.

46
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:53,110
Well, have you noticed anything unusual about your mother lately?

47
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,453
Unusual?

48
00:02:57,183 --> 00:03:00,484
She found out yesterday that I quit my job.

49
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:06,762
But what were you doing there last night?

50
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:09,767
Didn't we part ways in front of Changdeok Palace?

51
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:15,339
Why are you all looking at me like that?

52
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:19,282
I was merely looking around the neighborhood...

53
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,286
If there is a way here, there must be a way back.

54
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,443
Even a fox turns toward home in its final moments.

55
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,408
What?

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,140
   
   

57
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,869
ID, please.

58
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,688
Hand over your ID.

59
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:46,440
Oh, you mean my identification tag?

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,338
Even our descendants still use identification tags?

61
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,874
Yes, yes, whatever. Just hand it over.

62
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:54,647
But mine was confiscated when I was exiled.

63
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,839
What about your social security number?

64
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,716
Or at least your name and date of birth?

65
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:07,865
That, I have!

66
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,467
Tell me.

67
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,456
I am Heo Gyosan, born on the day of the black dog

68
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,459
in the month of the red rat, the year of the snake.

69
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,367
Year of the snake...

70
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:20,025
Are you messing with me?

71
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:22,637
I am utterly serious.

72
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,035
Fill this out. 
    

73
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,125
Write everything down. No missing details. Understood?

74
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,547
Understood.

75
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,732
Now, bring me a brush and ink.

76
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,977
A brush and ink in one?

77
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:10,047
To write so fine and long with such ease...

78
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,873
It fits neatly in my pocket, and it does not even smudge.

79
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:15,592
This must be the dream of all scholars!

80
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:20,859
To acquire such a marvel, I'd need hundreds of His Late Highness' portraits.

81
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:28,258
What are you all looking at? Get back to work!

82
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,930
Seriously, I...

83
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,412
Just take the pen

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,976
and fill it out properly, got it?

85
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,296
You are just giving me such a precious item.

86
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,657
No take-backs later!

87
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:52,249
Yeah, yeah, just write already!

88
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:53,949
All right.

89
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,608
Wait!

90
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:00,934
Wait, this is...

91
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,623
Oh, what is it this time?

92
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,969
I'm delighted to see this name.

93
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:13,685
The protagonist of my story shares the same name, Hong Gil Dong.

94
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,852
Are you saying you're Heo Gyun or something?

95
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,697
How did you know?

96
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,072
That is, in fact, my real name.

97
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:32,904
Why are you doing this?

98
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:35,330
Why am I being locked up?

99
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,986
As of this moment, you're a suspect.

100
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:40,861
We couldn't verify your identity, and you have no clear residence.

101
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:44,118
You'll stay here until the investigation is complete.

102
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:45,400
Release me at once!

103
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,866
My only crime was saving a life!

104
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,467
If you want to get out sooner, then cooperate.

105
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,340
Faking insanity to get a lighter sentence? That won't work with me, got it?

106
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,200
That won't work with me, got it?

107
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,954
Listen while I'm being nice.

108
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,407
Wait.

109
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,900
- Say that again. 
 - Are you insane?

110
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,843
What the hell are you doing now?

111
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,747
Again.

112
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,856
Like this, do it again!

113
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:16,664
Wow, have you completely lost it?

114
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:19,339
You think you can mock the law?

115
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,939
That expression!

116
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:25,221
Have we not met before?

117
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,781
I've never seen a lunatic like you in my 15 years as a detective!

118
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:34,112
No, I am certain we have met.

119
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:37,667
A Transcendent Genius like me never forgets a face!

120
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,251
Where on earth have we met?

121
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:51,161
Was it in a dream?

122
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:59,161
♫  Shy emotions that I've been hiding, I'll give them all to you  ♫

123
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,926
Oh, honey, yeah...

124
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,426
Yeah.

125
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,750
Keep running your mouth,

126
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,090
and I'll add obstruction to your charges!

127
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,392
Seriously...

128
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:18,680
My Lord, we found it.

129
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,613
You are certain it belonged to Gyosan?

130
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,505
Yes, without a doubt.

131
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:55,310
We searched as far as we could,

132
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,252
but no one has seen a man with his topknot severed.

133
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,759
Gyosan, are you truly gone?

134
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,280
How meaningless...

135
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,003
 To neglect a virtuous and talented man solely because of his illegitimate birth 

136
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:20,554
 is a great loss to the nation. 

137
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,987
 I humbly ask that you extend your grace 

138
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:26,671
 to these gifted illegitimate sons 

139
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:30,325
 so that their abilities may serve the nation to the fullest. 

140
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:34,411
 What are your thoughts? 

141
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,885
   

142
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:40,034
 The request to abolish discrimination against illegitimate sons? 

143
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:42,109
 Such a notion is unthinkable. 

144
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,998
 The prohibition of government positions for illegitimate sons 

145
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:49,186
 has been firmly established since the reign of King Taejong. 

146
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:54,784
 And yet, Gyosan's words moved me today. 

147
00:10:55,734 --> 00:11:00,480
 Has the court not suffered from a constant shortage of talent since the war? 

148
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,106
 If we could use capable illegitimate sons to fill those ranks... 

149
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,360
 But, Your Majesty... 

150
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:15,341
 Now, I find myself curious about the very men 

151
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,718
 Gyosan so tirelessly praises. 

152
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,006
 Let us drink! 

153
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,706
 Let us drink! 

154
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,985
 My friends, 

155
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:44,169
 let us not waste our lives in drink alone. 

156
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:47,077
 Gyosan, 

157
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:51,082
 if you take away even this small solace 

158
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,436
 from the wretched lives of illegitimate sons, 

159
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:57,135
 how shall we endure the long years ahead? 

160
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:07,610
 Today, His Majesty has shown favor toward the appeal you submitted. 

161
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:14,198
 He intends to open a path for illegitimate sons to serve in office. 

162
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,829
 Is this true? 

163
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,913
 It is likely to happen. 

164
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:23,766
 His Majesty is a reasonable man. 

165
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,100
 Did I hear that correctly? 

166
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,402
 Perhaps it is time we lay aside revelry and turn to our studies. 

167
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,514
 You truly worked hard for this! 

168
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:36,080
 Come, let us drink to this! 

169
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,185
 A toast! 

170
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,227
 Shall we join them? 

171
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,728
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

172
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,621
 Gyosan, the opposition will not yield so easily. 

173
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,418
 Can this truly be achieved? 

174
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,186
 My friend... 

175
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,179
 I told you, His Majesty is different. 

176
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,740
 Well, if you think about it! 

177
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,084
 Is His Majesty himself not of illegitimate birth? 

178
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:04,961
 I shall tear out the tongues of those insolent wretches, Your Majesty. 

179
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,290
 Why do you waver, Gwansong? 

180
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,990
 That is unlike you. 

181
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,870
 Does it trouble you as well 

182
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,680
 that I was born of a concubine? 

183
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:20,024
 Perish the thought, Your Majesty. 

184
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:24,220
 You, of all people, have always recoiled at the idea of illegitimate sons. 

185
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,351
 And yet, despite Prince Yeongchang being the rightful heir to the throne, 

186
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,080
 not once have you entertained treasonous thoughts? 

187
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,469
 Your Majesty was rightfully enthroned by the late king himself. 

188
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,077
 No one... 

189
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,383
 No one would dare harbor such disloyalty. 

190
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,810
 Yet my father, even in his final moments, 

191
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:49,017
 clung only to Yeongchang. 

192
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:54,194
 Had Yeongchang been a little older, I... 

193
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:57,419
 Your Majesty, trust in me. 

194
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,281
 I will root out every last speck 

195
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:03,335
 of defiance before you. 

196
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:14,316
Inspector General, I am here to report.

197
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,244
What is the situation?

198
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:20,330
Have the so-called Seven Riverside Friends confessed?

199
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:23,381
My apologies, sir.

200
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,822
They endured three days and nights of interrogation,

201
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,304
but they refused to speak.

202
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,333
Then push them harder.

203
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,500
Until Prince Yeongchang's name

204
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:39,791
leaves their lips.

205
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,697
Understood, sir.

206
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,863
Wait, speaking of which...

207
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:56,367
Mae Chang, were you not acquainted with those seven?

208
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,289
Well...

209
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:03,420
I merely filled their cups as a gisaeng, nothing more.

210
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:06,709
I see.

211
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,917
It is best to keep your distance from traitors like them.

212
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,341
I would hate to see their misfortune

213
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:15,055
drag you down with them.

214
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,810
My Lord...

215
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,691
Oh, dear.

216
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,501
Your face is clouded with worry.

217
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,849
If you want to resent someone, resent Gyosan, not me.

218
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:33,169
Had he only listened to me back then,

219
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,428
those illegitimate sons would not have been branded as traitors.

220
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:44,884
 If you become someone His Majesty cannot do without... 

221
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:48,927
 Then he will call for me. 

222
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:53,891
 Tell me, what does His Majesty need? 

223
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:56,101
 I will do whatever it takes! Anything! 

224
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:08,696
 Lately, His Majesty has been unable to sleep through the night. 

225
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:14,045
 Even before you were exiled, the signs were there, 

226
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:17,628
 but they have only worsened over time. 

227
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,586
 That is troubling indeed. 

228
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:28,007
 What is the cause? 

229
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:32,196
 Worry, what else? 

230
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:36,880
 There are still factions within the palace loyal to Prince Yeongchang. 

231
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,599
 As long as they remain, His Majesty will never be at peace. 

232
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:46,206
 But I thought most of them had already been purged. 

233
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,165
 As long as the seed of treason remains, 

234
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:52,590
 His Majesty's worries will never fade. 

235
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,955
 Which is why... 

236
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:02,522
 I need you to root it out. 

237
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,851
 Are you suggesting... the prince? 

238
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,756
 You are not serious, are you? 

239
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:17,738
 Have I ever been anything but serious? 

240
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,605
 It is just... too absurd to believe. 

241
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:25,295
 Did you think becoming someone His Majesty needs 

242
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,112
 would be easy? 

243
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:31,066
 It is not about whether it is easy or difficult. 

244
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:36,850
 I cannot bring myself to commit an act that defies morality. 

245
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,850
 Then... 

246
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:44,481
 are you content to live like this for the rest of your days? 

247
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,920
 Even if I were to leave this place by such means, 

248
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,590
 would I... 

249
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,670
 truly be free? 

250
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:02,267
Because of his stubbornness, he doomed not only his friends...

251
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:07,912
but himself as well.

252
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:15,776
How foolish can one be?

253
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:32,579
Today, the wine tastes especially sweet.

254
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,316
The rice is not sticky at all!

255
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:46,793
The kimchi is as salty as pure salt!

256
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,447
And the doenjangguk is so scorched, it is barely edible!

257
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,697
This isn't a place for complaints.

258
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,006
Eat what you're given, and stop whining.

259
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,899
I cannot put this filth in my mouth!

260
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:05,005
I miss her cheonggukjang...

261
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,191
Speaking of which, I wonder how she is doing.

262
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,842
I hope she regained consciousness.

263
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,273
 Madam! Wake up! 

264
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,767
 Madam! Excuse me... 

265
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,586
You there!

266
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:29,437
Can you call the officer who questioned me?

267
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:35,601
Doctor! How's my mom?

268
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,854
We took all the necessary measures,

269
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:42,419
but due to severe intracerebral hemorrhage, we can't guarantee anything.

270
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,352
Are you... are you saying she might not make it?

271
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:53,615
Doctor... please save my mom!

272
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:58,122
The surgery went well, so let's wait and see.

273
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,998
 She was fortunate to have been brought in right after the accident. 

274
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:07,980
 If she had arrived any later, it might have been too late. 

275
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,757
 Mom, I think someone's at the store. 

276
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,142
 Mom, can you check outside? 

277
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,356
 Where did she go? 

278
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,434
 I'm coming! I'm coming! 

279
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:01,842
 Who is it at this hour? 

280
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,507
 Young lady! 

281
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,667
 - Oh, seriously— 
 - Your mother is in danger! 

282
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,167
 Hurry! 

283
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,153
Who on earth is that homeless guy?

284
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:19,299
Is he a friend or foe?

285
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:22,395
As far as I recall...

286
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,885
the madam was with someone right before the accident.

287
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:30,445
You can't just make things up

288
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,168
to get yourself out of this.

289
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,121
I am not making it up!

290
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:38,903
There was someone

291
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:42,599
 standing next to her. 

292
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:45,006
I never forget what I have seen.

293
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,899
Are you sure?

294
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:50,797
I stake my honor as a Transcendent Genius on it.

295
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:52,790
Did you see the person's face?

296
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:56,641
No.

297
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:00,357
It was raining, and the person was holding a syurup.

298
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,601
But I swear, she was not alone.

299
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,632
Syurup? Kim Hye Soo's...

300
00:22:06,632 --> 00:22:08,442
Oh, an umbrella?

301
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:15,403
Was that person still there when you found her?

302
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:22,823
 Help! Is no one around? 

303
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,993
 She is dying! 

304
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:26,624
 Please, someone help! 

305
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:27,986
That is right.

306
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,464
There was no one around then.

307
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,953
I should check this out.

308
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,721
Good idea!

309
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,839
I will take the lead.

310
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,184
Why am I locked up again?

311
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,580
How could you do this to me?

312
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:56,134
No wonder he looked so ominous in my dream.

313
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:00,394
Apparently, this place is amazing.

314
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:01,563
I'm starving.

315
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:05,245
A place this cheap and delicious is hard to find.

316
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:06,735
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:10,248
The diner is closed for now. I apologize.

318
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,233
We came all this way.

319
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:14,145
Let's just come back another time.

320
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,319
Eun Sil.

321
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,360
Oh, Chef Lee?

322
00:23:30,855 --> 00:23:33,225
I heard the news

323
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,341
about your mother's injury...

324
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,811
How is she?

325
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,273
She's...

326
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,040
she's unconscious.

327
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,534
Have you eaten?

328
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,268
You shouldn't skip meals.

329
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:00,743
I don't feel like eating.

330
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:05,873
At times like this, you need to stay strong.

331
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,120
I'll cook something for you.

332
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,935
Come with me.

333
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:20,636
The family must stay strong to take care of the patient and pay hospital expenses.

334
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:23,466
Hospital expenses...

335
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:27,685
Sorry, but I just remembered I have something to take care of.

336
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:50,913
Darn it, every one of these is an overdraft account.

337
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:54,545
What was Mom doing without even getting general insurance?

338
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:58,890
So nosy, yet far from substantial.

339
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,414
Let's see.

340
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:07,374
These two add up to 5.3 million won.

341
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,293
This should be enough...

342
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:20,039
Gyeong Won! It's me, Eun Sil.

343
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,704
 Eun Sil, is your mother okay? 

344
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:27,713
She's unconscious.

345
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:34,109
Speaking of which, can you lend me some money?

346
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:36,349
 My credit card's been overdue for three months. 

347
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:38,078
Oh, really?

348
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,480
Sang Eun, can I borrow some money?

349
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,714
 I maxed out my loans preparing for my wedding. 

350
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:49,317
No, no, never mind. It's nothing urgent.

351
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:52,514
Uncle, it's me, Eun Sil.

352
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:54,036
What?

353
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,752
Cancer?

354
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:58,918
How did that happen...

355
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,631
Didn't you say feeding people at a low price was a virtue?

356
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:11,718
You're in debt, Mom.

357
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:15,681
This must be a dream.

358
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,579
Wake up, Bong Eun Sil!

359
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,547
Snap out of this nightmare already!

360
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,389
I'm from Seonbuk Police Station.

361
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:45,153
Can I check the surveillance footage from outside your store?

362
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:06,048
I need this for the investigation.

363
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,651
Can I get a copy of this video?

364
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,940
   

365
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:24,445
This must be the diner.

366
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,245
Detective.

367
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:39,270
Oh, thank you.

368
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,400
- You're here about my mom's case, right? 
 - Yes.

369
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,976
Well...

370
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:55,966
I checked all the nearby surveillance cameras,

371
00:27:55,966 --> 00:28:00,228
but there was none at the accident site.

372
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:03,560
However, we found footage from a different street.

373
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:06,279
Did you find anything?

374
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:09,026
Well...

375
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,200
Oh, chef! Are you okay?

376
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,890
Oh, no! You're bleeding.

377
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,900
What should we do? Oh, my.

378
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,700
Stop fussing and get back to work.

379
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,500
- Sous chef, finish this up. 
 - Got it.

380
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:32,357
Are you okay, sir?

381
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,929
I'm fine. It's just a small cut.

382
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,638
Leave it here. I'll take care of it.

383
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,986
Yes, sir.

384
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:48,767
You must've come in early this morning.

385
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:52,011
Excuse me?

386
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:54,090
It wasn't raining when I came in,

387
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,400
but I heard it poured in the morning.

388
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:01,222
Should I dry this outside?

389
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:06,027
- No, throw it away. 
 - Pardon?

390
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,276
It looks new.

391
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,100
- Toss it. 
 - Understood.

392
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,970
There was nothing unusual.

393
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,892
Your mother was alone the entire time.

394
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:34,018
And the man who was with you at the hospital earlier...

395
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:35,568
Mr. Homeless?

396
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:41,072
Yes, the footage shows him heading toward the stairs after the accident.

397
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,666
Oh, is that so?

398
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,800
- He was a friend, then. 
 - Pardon?

399
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,066
Never mind.

400
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:54,158
So, your mother's case will be processed as an accident.

401
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:57,800
But why was she there in the rain...

402
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,400
- Anyway, I'll take my leave now. 
 - Okay.

403
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:08,967
By the way! What will happen to Mr. Homeless?

404
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:14,614
You locked up an innocent man and did not even apologize!

405
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:18,090
I have something to say to that grumpy officer!

406
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,700
Let go of me! Wait! Let go of me!

407
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:34,211
The team leader's out on duty.

408
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,646
You made such a fuss to be freed, so what now?

409
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,579
Just leave already!

410
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:42,599
Actually...

411
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:49,536
I have nowhere to go.

412
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:58,907
 Joseon fell, and in its place... stands a nation of our descendants. 

413
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:05,006
 I do not know how I got here 

414
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:07,066
 or how to return. 

415
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:20,545
Ma'am, why can't we cross the road?

416
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,272
Because the light is red.

417
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:24,289
Why is it red?

418
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,456
Because the green light went off.

419
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:29,144
Why did the green light go off?

420
00:31:29,144 --> 00:31:31,944
Because it was time for the red light to come on.

421
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:37,955
Why are you wearing a hanbok?

422
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:42,087
Why are your clothes so dirty?

423
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:43,318
Don't you go to work?

424
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,016
- Why? 
 - Why?

425
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,391
Why?

426
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:50,063
 The pedestrian light is now green. 

427
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:52,544
 You may cross. 

428
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:57,762
 Okay, let us change the question. 

429
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,692
 Not "how," but "why." 

430
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:04,561
 Why did I end up in the land of our descendants? 

431
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,870
 There must be a reason. 

432
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:13,426
 And maybe, just maybe... that reason will lead me back to Joseon. 

433
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,860
   

434
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:39,739
You actually let that lunatic go?

435
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:41,620
Yes.

436
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:44,646
We had no evidence,

437
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:47,472
so I had to release him.

438
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,490
He said he saw me.

439
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,900
How could you let him go?

440
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:57,628
He only claimed to have seen someone,

441
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:59,592
not you.

442
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,663
This case will be closed as an accident,

443
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:07,595
so we can't have him claiming he saw someone at the station.

444
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:15,566
Still, I don't like how I keep crossing paths with him.

445
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:19,439
He didn't even seem sane.

446
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:22,491
Wouldn't it be better to put him in a hospital?

447
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:26,574
Why are you so uneasy about this case?

448
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,674
This case.

449
00:33:30,753 --> 00:33:34,417
It was just an accident, right?

450
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:40,668
 Chef Lee, I'll get going now. 

451
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:51,375
 Madam. 

452
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,960
It was an accident.

453
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,563
Right?

454
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,663
Even if it was...

455
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,402
just being there with her is enough to start rumors.

456
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:09,497
And rumors alone can ruin someone like me.

457
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:14,719
That's why I'm here to deal with troublesome matters.

458
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,984
The surveillance footage is gone,

459
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:19,080
and the case will be closed soon.

460
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,520
So don't worry.

461
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,240
Just focus on your business.

462
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:28,162
You're already running behind schedule.

463
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,921
I'll handle my business my way.

464
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:35,414
Come on, don't be like that.

465
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:38,834
Even if it's a small stake, I am part of this business.

466
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:41,849
Don't I have the right to an opinion?

467
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:48,096
Well, I guess that puts us in the same boat.

468
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:57,035
Please get out.

469
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,281
What?

470
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:02,561
I need to go and resolve the delayed business,

471
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,679
so get out.

472
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,529
I thought he was just some cook,

473
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:26,569
but he's got some bite.

474
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:44,141
Are you dissatisfied with the offer?

475
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,937
No, it's far too much.

476
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,528
Are you sure this is the correct sum?

477
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:55,652
Yes, it's the amount your mother agreed to.

478
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:58,609
All that was left was her signature,

479
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:01,532
but then the accident occurred.

480
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:05,469
It's truly regrettable.

481
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:09,983
Did Mom really agree to sell this place?

482
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,427
That's strange.

483
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:17,524
She always said she'd run this place till she drops.

484
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:19,594
Was she just bluffing?

485
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,956
Well, she could've changed her mind.

486
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:26,617
Working at a restaurant is demanding.

487
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,480
That's true.

488
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,211
Eun Sil.

489
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:37,591
Can you run this restaurant alone without your mother?

490
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:39,991
No.

491
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:42,529
I'm a terrible cook.

492
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:44,474
No skills at all.

493
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:50,878
Even instant noodles taste bitter when I cook them.

494
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:54,162
Then, why are you hesitating?

495
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:58,919
But selling it with my own hands feels...

496
00:36:59,627 --> 00:37:02,613
My attorney will handle the paperwork.

497
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:05,249
You can sign on behalf

498
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:09,514
of your unconscious mother.

499
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:11,661
That's not what I meant.

500
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,159
Let's sign the contract after she wakes up.

501
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,121
That's the right way to do this.

502
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:18,682
Then...

503
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:22,014
What about the hospital expenses?

504
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,215
Eun Sil.

505
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:29,314
Aren't you in desperate need of money?

506
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:33,084
I really do need the money.

507
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,372
When matters are pressing and you have no other family members,

508
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:39,583
the legal procedures can be processed much faster.

509
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,377
So...

510
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,764
all you need to do is sign it, Eun Sil,

511
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:52,801
and leave... the rest to me.

512
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,424
I'm just signing what my mom already agreed to, right?

513
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,769
Yes, that's right.

514
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:12,556
I can't do it.

515
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,787
What's the matter?

516
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:21,452
Eun Sil, you said you were sick of this place.

517
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:23,472
I did.

518
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:27,883
It was my goal to break away from this diner.

519
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:30,637
Then, what's the problem?

520
00:38:30,637 --> 00:38:32,669
I don't know.

521
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:37,264
My mom has been working here all her life.

522
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:44,015
She always said she'd run this place till the end.

523
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:48,683
If I sell it, she'll have nowhere to return to.

524
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,205
And if she has nowhere to return to...

525
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,313
she might never wake up.

526
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:57,913
Wait, what kind of stupid—

527
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:16,030
I guess this isn't the right time.

528
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,134
You must be troubled enough with your mother's accident.

529
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:23,016
You should take a few more days to bring yourself together,

530
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:25,452
and let's talk again then.

531
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:27,709
Okay.

532
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:31,564
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:36,431
 Wake up, Bong Eun Sil. 

534
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,631
If you don't sell this,

535
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:42,379
do you plan to cook meals instead of Mom or something?

536
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,976
Why not?

537
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,873
It's just that I never tried. But if I do, cooking?

538
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:02,065
It's just grilling and stir-frying, right?

539
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:13,007
I wonder if the madam has regained consciousness.

540
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:15,840
I owe her a favor.

541
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,300
A visit is the least I can do.

542
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:22,423
Honey!

543
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:25,815
- Honey! Wake up, honey! 
 - Can I ask you something?

544
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:30,799
- I am looking for the madam who runs a diner— 
 - Excuse me. Patient incoming!

545
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:32,406
Are you a patient?

546
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:34,421
Where are you injured?

547
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,002
I am not injured.

548
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:42,990
How many fingers?

549
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:44,940
Three?

550
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,595
What's the date today?

551
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:48,558
Today is...

552
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:50,457
That is what I want to know.

553
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:53,227
Tell me, what year, month, and day is it?

554
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,732
Emergency over here! Get a CT scan of his brain first!

555
00:40:57,732 --> 00:41:00,169
Take off your shoes and lie down.

556
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:05,080
Lie down, please.

557
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:07,526
Wait!

558
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,478
Where are you taking me?

559
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:14,915
You're not going anywhere. Just lie down.

560
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:18,010
Hold your breath and stay put.

561
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,584
Hold my breath?

562
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,475
You said it is not taking me anywhere!

563
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:27,945
Where is it taking me?

564
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:29,158
I...

565
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:32,248
I am here to look for the madam!

566
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:41,195
Why does no one listen in this place?

567
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:43,095
 Sir! 

568
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,344
Sir!

569
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:57,561
 Chop the cleaned vegetables into large pieces. 

570
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:00,867
Why won't these chop properly?

571
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:04,672
Ow! That's hot!

572
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:06,943
 Remove the kelp once it starts to boil. 

573
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,981
Ow! It's hot!

574
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,180
Why can't I hold it?

575
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:21,611
Wait, why aren't they telling me how to remove the kelp?

576
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:24,404
Now, stir-fry the vegetables.

577
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,827
 Of course, you know you need to remove the moisture before stir-frying, right? 

578
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:37,709
Why are you telling me this now?

579
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:42,585
Hello?

580
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:45,641
Who is it?

581
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:54,198
Did something happen to my mom?

582
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:56,025
Well...

583
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,426
Young lady!

584
00:43:01,426 --> 00:43:05,735
We told him he couldn't visit, but he entered the ICU...

585
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:11,053
I only wanted to see how she was.

586
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:21,960
Why are you in a patient's gown?

587
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,195
Are you injured?

588
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:28,564
It is a long story.

589
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,140
I am not injured.

590
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,320
I came here to visit your mother.

591
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:36,704
The madam is yet to wake up.

592
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:39,849
You must be worried.

593
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:43,983
The doctor said that if it weren't for you,

594
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,838
my mom wouldn't have been able to have surgery.

595
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:52,261
I'm sorry for doubting you earlier.

596
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:56,226
Wasn't it rough at the police station?

597
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:58,732
Do not even get me started.

598
00:43:58,732 --> 00:44:00,716
They locked up an innocent man.

599
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:02,737
The food was so awful.

600
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:05,288
I could not even eat it.

601
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:09,097
Then, have you been starving all along?

602
00:44:14,981 --> 00:44:18,436
Want me to make you something?

603
00:44:32,992 --> 00:44:36,782
Why does it sound like you are fighting a war in the kitchen?

604
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:41,144
Ta-da!

605
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:45,695
I made it.

606
00:44:56,253 --> 00:45:00,777
But why are you being so nice to me all of a sudden?

607
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:03,417
You did not even let me set foot in the restaurant.

608
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:06,855
I mean, you helped my mom.

609
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:09,823
I feel grateful and bad for this and that.

610
00:45:09,823 --> 00:45:11,945
And I needed a guinea pig.

611
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:15,064
What did you say?

612
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:16,946
No, nothing.

613
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:18,769
Hurry and try it.

614
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:21,855
Then, I will enjoy the meal.

615
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,279
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

616
00:45:43,735 --> 00:45:45,938
No, that was unintentional.

617
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:50,490
The rice was so smoky, I thought I was chewing on gunpowder.

618
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,281
Why?

619
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:55,259
Did I add too much pepper?

620
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:07,721
 I cannot suffer alone. 

621
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:11,078
What on earth did you do to the rice?

622
00:46:11,078 --> 00:46:12,760
I need to see what went wrong.

623
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,560
Do it again.

624
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:18,018
All I did was stir-fry kimchi and scallions,

625
00:46:18,018 --> 00:46:20,356
then toss in some meat, rice, and seasoning.

626
00:46:20,356 --> 00:46:24,411
How did you turn such great ingredients into a culinary disaster?

627
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:28,451
It is a talent the Minister of Defense would desire.

628
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:32,810
Look at that!

629
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:36,150
You do not even know the basics of chopping!

630
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,511
If you mash the scallions like that, they lose their texture and just taste spicy.

631
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:43,709
Why don't you come and try it yourself, know-it-all?

632
00:46:44,994 --> 00:46:47,248
That is impossible.

633
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:49,039
I am an honorable man, so I cannot enter the kitchen.

634
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,412
There you go again!

635
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:52,492
Stop talking like such a fuddy-duddy!

636
00:46:53,623 --> 00:46:55,428
A fuddy-duddy?

637
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:57,902
That clearly sounds offensive.

638
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:02,542
People who are stuck-up and outdated like you are called boomers!

639
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:06,326
And you're the worst fuddy-duddy!

640
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:09,824
That is the most insulting thing I have ever heard!

641
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:16,037
I was said to be liberal and ahead of my time!

642
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:20,317
Ahead of your time? You can't even step into a kitchen!

643
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:23,966
Hey, don't tell me you actually believe something falls off

644
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,595
if a man enters the kitchen.

645
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,691
Something falls...

646
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,506
How crude and shameless!

647
00:47:34,506 --> 00:47:37,334
All this time, you're scared to come in.

648
00:47:38,894 --> 00:47:40,537
Is that correct?

649
00:47:40,537 --> 00:47:42,407
What are you doing?

650
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:45,848
It's because... I'm crude and shameless!

651
00:47:45,848 --> 00:47:47,629
Stop!

652
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:49,498
What if I don't?

653
00:47:49,498 --> 00:47:51,938
Are you going to come inside to chase after me?

654
00:48:19,468 --> 00:48:21,857
You must be stunned

655
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:26,006
by my bold and non-fuddy-duddy steps!

656
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:28,669
Wait.

657
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:44,046
Get out.

658
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,173
Excuse me?

659
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,995
I said get out of the kitchen.

660
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:52,124
I will show you what real food tastes like.

661
00:48:57,252 --> 00:49:01,962
 The taste, aroma, and warmth of the food I remember. 

662
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,662
 I will serve all of them in a single bowl. 

663
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:41,664
Well, you made something pretty close.

664
00:49:41,664 --> 00:49:46,012
But then, cooking isn't just about theory.

665
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,828
I'll judge you fairly, considering it's your first time in the kitchen.

666
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,604
Why did you stop eating?

667
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:18,044
Does it taste bad?

668
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:25,814
Tastes fine to me.

669
00:50:29,614 --> 00:50:31,528
It's the same.

670
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,827
It tastes just like Mom's gukbap.

671
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:44,276
I can't eat it because it reminds me of her.

672
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:50,131
That is because... I, a Transcendent Genius, never forget the flavors

673
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,008
I have had before.

674
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,488
So, I figured out the recipe in reverse...

675
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:57,225
Mr. Homeless, shut up.

676
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:00,103
What a mood-killer...

677
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,287
Let's do it.

678
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:09,690
Do what?

679
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:16,118
Let's run this diner together.

680
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:23,850


681
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,590
 "10 Seconds" by 2Z 

682
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:32,930
♫  One, two, three, four, I hold your hand  ♫

683
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,520
♫  Five, six, our eyes meet  ♫

684
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,850
♫  Seven, eight, nine, ten, I only see you  ♫

685
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:48,160
♫  Only you, oh, only you, so with you  ♫

686
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,880
♫  Only you  ♫

687
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:04,380
♫  One, two, three, four, five  ♫ 
 ♫  My heart stopped when I met you  ♫

688
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,740
♫  The night I first met you  ♫

689
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,050
♫  I lost my sight for ten seconds  ♫
