1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,986
   

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:06,486
   

3
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:08,500
   

4
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:12,702
   

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,040
   

6
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,790
       

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,839
   

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,732
   

9
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:30,752
   

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:42,040


11
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,759
Old man!

12
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:58,612
I found out how and when my friends and I have died.

13
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,289
Surprisingly

14
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,692
they were all recorded.

15
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,494
   

16
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:10,160
That's nothing new.

17
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:20,260
Can I change this if I return to Joseon?

18
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:25,909
Tell me, old man. I'm asking you.

19
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,367
If I go back, can I save my friends?

20
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:31,843
And can I...

21
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,658
Can I escape execution by dismemberment?

22
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,430
Old man!

23
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:51,539
By its nature, water flows from high to low.

24
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:55,017
No matter how much you struggle

25
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:58,168
can you really make it flow upward?

26
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:04,494
Then, even if I return, is there truly nothing I can do?

27
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:09,196
No matter what I try, am I destined to meet the same gruesome end as recorded?

28
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,934
Is that what you mean?

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,753
Yes.

30
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,283
Unless a miracle happens...

31
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:27,421
Like the miracle that brought you here.

32
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:29,316
Could I possibly...

33
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,730
be granted such a miracle twice?

34
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:40,533
If miracles happened so often, they wouldn't be called miracles.

35
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:53,936
If you choose not to return you will never have to face those horrors.

36
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:56,340
So, what will it be?

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,657
Do you still wish to return?

38
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,349
 I am returning to Joseon. 

39
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,679
 What have you done? 

40
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:21,286
 How did you store a book from 400 years ago 

41
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:25,132
 to make it look like it was written only a few days ago? 

42
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:26,821
Mom.

43
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,818
If there's something I can't believe

44
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:34,099
but can't be explained otherwise

45
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,049
could it be the truth?

46
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,870
   

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,811
The diner owner's condition hasn't changed since the accident.

48
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,369
She hasn't moved, let alone shown any basic response.

49
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,180
Did you check properly?

50
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:20,508
Are you sure you weren't mistaken?

51
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:22,960
Did you actually see it?

52
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:27,096
I saw it with my own eyes.

53
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,353
She definitely moved.

54
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,390
Couldn't it have been your guilt playing tricks on you?

55
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:39,351
Guilt?

56
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:44,215
Are you assuming I have something to feel guilty about, Detective Kang?

57
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:48,263
If not, why the hell am I doing this?

58
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:52,333
And say she does wake up, what happens next?

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,720
Are you going to ask me to kill her?

60
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,187
Hey, Mr. Lee, what exactly are you planning?

61
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:04,931
Tell me, what are you thinking?

62
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,965
Relax.

63
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:11,026
I wouldn't ask you to do it.

64
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:15,148
Mr. Lee!

65
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,114
There are plenty of people who can take your place.

66
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:20,297
If you're not up for this, you can walk away now.

67
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:27,185
I have an important evaluation coming up, so I'll excuse myself.

68
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:34,166
You're far more terrifying than I thought, Mr. Lee.

69
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,812
I'm simply someone...

70
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:45,194
who understands that a great cause

71
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,325
often demands minor sacrifices.

72
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:57,476
   

73
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,100
You're here, Detective Kang.

74
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,863
I heard you visited my mom quite often.

75
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:30,681
Even went as far as pretending to be her nephew.

76
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,503
That's because...

77
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,201
Was it because of Chef Lee?

78
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,836
How did you know...

79
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:46,324
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

80
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:53,819
Mr. Lee asked me to do it.

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,589
He wanted me to check on your mother's condition.

82
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:00,694
And that's all he asked you to do?

83
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:04,454
Yes, that's all.

84
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:08,192
Just to monitor her condition.

85
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:11,470
Even if he had asked for more, I wouldn't have done it.

86
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:14,863
Not when it comes to my mom.

87
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:17,332
I'm talking about Mr. Homeless.

88
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,955
I'll just cut to the chase.

89
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,893
Mr. Homeless.

90
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:39,545
No...

91
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,005
the man who worked at our diner, Heo Gyun.

92
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:46,551
He's not an ex-convict, is he?

93
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,665
Tell me the truth.

94
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:55,612
Did you actually dig up anything on him?

95
00:07:56,448 --> 00:08:01,779
The truth is... I couldn't find anything about him.

96
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,442
Then, why did you lie?

97
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,365
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:13,793
I let money cloud my judgment.

99
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:19,674
But now that I've told you everything, I actually feel relieved.

100
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:21,798
I knew this wasn't right.

101
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:24,444
And all this time, I hurt him so much

102
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:27,075
without even knowing the truth.

103
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,517
Then, everything he said was true.

104
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,991
If he was telling the truth...

105
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:40,623
Does that mean Lee Hyuk is the one who did this to my mom?

106
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:44,225
That's...

107
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,103
I don't know, either.

108
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:52,610
However, one thing is clear,

109
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,140
Lee Hyuk doesn't want your mother to wake up.

110
00:08:56,142 --> 00:09:00,290
That alone is suspicious.

111
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,678
Because if she does

112
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,217
she'll expose everything he did.

113
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:13,671
But the problem is, I don't have solid proof.

114
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,900
If only we had surveillance footage from the accident site...

115
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:22,086
How could he...

116
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:28,119
It's not from the exact site, but I do have footage from a nearby area.

117
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,323
If you want, I'll give you the file.

118
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:38,217
Looking back, that was where I went wrong.

119
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:41,647
I should've never covered for him.

120
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,590
Please tell Heo Gyun

121
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,410
that I'm sorry.

122
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,854
Chef Lee is running away.

123
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,909
Something must've happened when he met Mom.

124
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:17,988
And Mr. Homeless was aware of everything.

125
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,270
I must meet him.

126
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:37,343
Please answer the phone.

127
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:48,841
 Then, even if I return, is there truly nothing I can do? 

128
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:53,529
 No matter what I try, am I destined to meet the same gruesome end as recorded? 

129
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,244
 Is that what you mean? 

130
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,172
 Yes. 

131
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:15,174
Lady Eun Sil.

132
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,229
Mister?

133
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,578
 What a relief. 

134
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:25,220
 Where are you? I need to see you. 

135
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,220
Did not you say you could not stand the sight of me?

136
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,063
 Not anymore. 

137
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:33,940
 Where are you? I'll head there right now. 

138
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:41,705
I do not know where I am.

139
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:45,297
Tell me what you see, anything.

140
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,271
All right.

141
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,842
Don't move and stay right there.

142
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,872
You're here.

143
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,280
   

144
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,684
What's this?

145
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,936
Pass this on to the chief.

146
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,203
Your resignation letter?

147
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,614
Team leader!

148
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:17,884
I'm too embarrassed to continue being a cop.

149
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:20,864
Why? What's the matter?

150
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:23,908
You know what?

151
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:26,420
I thought I could make easy money

152
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,122
as long as I put my mind to it.

153
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,456
But nothing is free in this world. You should also keep this in mind.

154
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,444
But still, this is...

155
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:36,826
Please do me a favor.

156
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,016
Hey, team leader Kang!

157
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,689
Mister!

158
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:12,123
I finally understand that everything you said was true.

159
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,282
I'm sorry for doubting you and believing others instead.

160
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,355
You must have resented me.

161
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:25,899
I did.

162
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,279
I was deeply disappointed.

163
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:33,931
You refused to hear me out, but trusted Lee Hyuk without question.

164
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:36,738
It drove me mad.

165
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:41,822
I'm not usually this slow to catch on.

166
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,688
But the things you told me…

167
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:49,214
They were beyond anything I could comprehend.

168
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,437
So, do you believe me now?

169
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:58,191
Honestly, I can't say I trust you 100%.

170
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,570
   

171
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,229
But I'm ready to believe

172
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,700
that you wrote this book,

173
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,215
that you are Heo Gyun

174
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,207
and that you came from Joseon.

175
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,644
You are quite the skeptic.

176
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:23,178
I have never once lied to you.

177
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,964
I know.

178
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,903
Everything happened just as you said.

179
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:33,858
You even said it was Lee Hyuk who hurt my mom.

180
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,373
That is right.

181
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,796
And I have no doubt about it.

182
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:39,643
But why?

183
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,846
Why would he do that to my mom?

184
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:47,294
My mom never wronged anyone.

185
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:50,527
It is because of the diner.

186
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,755
The diner?

187
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:57,338
He has wanted that place for a long time.

188
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:02,345
He needed Heo's Diner to expand his business.

189
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:04,877
And when your mother refused to sell,

190
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,731
he tried to get rid of her.

191
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,106
I should have never let go of the diner...

192
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,951
I was such a fool...

193
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,154
Don't blame yourself.

194
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:19,532
If you had refused

195
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:23,400
you might have met the same fate as your mother.

196
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:27,078
I can never forgive Lee Hyuk.

197
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,865
I have to make sure he pays for what he did.

198
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,909
Is there a way?

199
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:38,728
I will find the proof to bring him down.

200
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,401
You will?

201
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:41,933
How?

202
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:46,993
Tonight, lend me the kitchen at Heo's Diner.

203
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:24,984
Sir.

204
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,779
Did you stay in the kitchen all night?

205
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,206
Let's all focus on today's state banquet evaluation.

206
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,817
 Yes, sir! 

207
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:49,228
You said you were looking for evidence. So why are we at the market?

208
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:51,661
And why do you need the kitchen?

209
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:56,353
I know Lee Hyuk's nature all too well.

210
00:16:56,353 --> 00:17:00,379
He stops at nothing to get what he wants.

211
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,726
If anything stands in his way

212
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,528
he will do whatever it takes to remove it.

213
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,536
- I will take this. 
 - Okay.

214
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:15,439
That'll be 5,000 won.

215
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,062
Here.

216
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:23,984
Then, is it also true that you're returning?

217
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,635
Do you have to go?

218
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,611
Can't you stay?

219
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,661
Let us not talk about that now.

220
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:41,644
Don't go, mister.

221
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:49,587
I must've made you work at the diner so much you're eager to leave.

222
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:53,763
But that's just because you don't know the sweet delights of this place!

223
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:56,313
"Sweet delights?"

224
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:59,277
They sound delicious.

225
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,600
Come over here.

226
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,111
What should we wear?

227
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:16,081
Wait, why are we coming here instead of going to the diner?

228
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:19,370
This looks nice. It's nice and hip.

229
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,943
Try it on.

230
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,885
Let's try this, too.

231
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,214
Okay.

232
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:30,496
I'm going with something cute.

233
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:35,725
What do you think? Do I look cute?

234
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,000
I cannot see a thing.

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,338
Smile, smile, smile.

236
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:40,556
Cheek heart! Do a cheek heart!

237
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,298
Cheek heart? What is that?

238
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:50,205
Look at this! You look ridiculous!

239
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:52,654
What on earth are we doing?

240
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,336
I have important matters to take care of.

241
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:55,824
Mister, look at this.

242
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:57,521
Isn't this hilarious?

243
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,707
Is this what you meant by a sweet delight?

244
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,887
I thought it was going to be something delicious.

245
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,299
Oh, there's plenty of good food as well.

246
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,835
Let's go.

247
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,950
Now for the final touch,

248
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,700
crack an egg right in!

249
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,557
Fascinating.

250
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,601
Here.

251
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:34,321
Nothing beats a hot bowl of ramyeon by the Han River in winter.

252
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:38,969
It looks delicious.

253
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,215
Once we finish, we should head back.

254
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,583
No.

255
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,827
There's still so much left to do.

256
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:50,153
We have to go to the arcade, karaoke,

257
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:51,817
and even a ski resort!

258
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,444
I do not have time for that.

259
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:58,426
I need to return to the diner and prep the ingredients.

260
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:03,310
Then hurry up and say you're not going back to Joseon.

261
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,678
I cannot do that.

262
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:10,437
Don't go.

263
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:15,048
If you return to Joseon...

264
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,224
You'll die.

265
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,871
You'll face a horrible fate.

266
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,935
I know.

267
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,085
I know exactly how I die.

268
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:32,160
I, too, have tracked down myself.

269
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,342
You knew?

270
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:41,831
Yet you're still going back?

271
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:44,027
I have made up my mind.

272
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:50,477
Let us eat while it is still warm.

273
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:03,570
 If you choose not to return 

274
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,069
 you will never have to face those horrors. 

275
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,502
 So, what will it be? 

276
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,899
 Do you still wish to return? 

277
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:25,314
 I guess living a new life under a new name... doesn't sound so bad, does it? 

278
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:35,053
 I will return to Joseon. 

279
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:37,582
 Are you hoping for a miracle? 

280
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,808
 I will return to my friends 

281
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,917
 to the people of Joseon 

282
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:49,699
 and tell them what I have seen, heard, and experienced in this world. 

283
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:54,190
 That there is no difference between highborns and lowborns, 

284
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,690
 that those of legitimate and illegitimate birth are no different, 

285
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,095
 and that a world without kings is drawing near. 

286
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:04,639
 They must know. 

287
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,600
 You really have a knack for saying things that could get you torn apart. 

288
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,467
 I will choose the time and date of my return. 

289
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,265
 There are still people here I must protect. 

290
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:24,783
   
   

291
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,916
 Ta-da! Isn't it pretty? 

292
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:35,716
What is this?

293
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,096
Did you change your clothes because you're leaving?

294
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:42,373
I just changed into fresh clothes for an important occasion.

295
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:45,504
I like the embroidery, too.

296
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:54,547
This must be one of those sweet delights.

297
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,521
Are you giving this to me?

298
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,845
Well... yeah.

299
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:05,121
If I take it with me when I return, I will not forget your face.

300
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,638
I should just tie you up so you can't leave.

301
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:15,188
I look forward to working with you.

302
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:24,873
Next is Jung Mi Sol.

303
00:23:24,873 --> 00:23:27,440
Jung Mi Sol? As in the one we know?

304
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,623
Oh, yes.

305
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:31,984
But she informed us that she won't be auditioning.

306
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,491
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:37,486
I'm not good with directions, so I got lost for about 30 minutes out front.

308
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:40,486
Your manager told us you weren't auditioning.

309
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,596
That was the plan.

310
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,515
But I'm here.

311
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:50,336
Is there a reason you changed your mind?

312
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,988
I wanted to see if I had talent.

313
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:59,074
And live without regrets.

314
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:20,093
Please come inside.

315
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,705
This is pumpkin porridge, served as an appetizer.

316
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:38,358
The natural sweetness of the pumpkin will whet your appetite.

317
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,200
Wow.

318
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:56,644
The sweetness really comes through beautifully.

319
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,754
For the main course, we have eel japchae, pine mushroom skewers, grilled galbi patties,

320
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:10,718
beef bone soup, and a trio of seasoned vegetables.

321
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:43,809
I can tell you've put in a lot of effort, Chef Lee.

322
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,688
But then...

323
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,325
Is there something that doesn't meet your expectations?

324
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:56,326
No, I believe there will be good news.

325
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:00,782
Thank you, sir.

326
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:14,341
I am Gyosan, preparing dishes across the street at Heo's Diner.

327
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,271
Please, don't waste your time on him.

328
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:25,021
I heard you were looking for traditional cuisine.

329
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:27,413
How was the food there?

330
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,222
Excuse me, Gyosan.

331
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:34,839
What are you trying to do here?

332
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,246
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

333
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:48,628
I can confidently say that what you just ate was nothing more than an imitation.

334
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:49,693
What?

335
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,315
I beg your pardon?

336
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:56,294
I mean to offer you a chance to taste real, authentic cuisine.

337
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:06,266
Do you think the Secretary-General would eat food made by someone like you?

338
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,455
Let's try it.

339
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:15,011
I've heard quite a bit about the restaurant across from Dorae.

340
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,753
Please come inside.

341
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:54,022
This is bangpungjuk, known for its rich aroma.

342
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:58,067
I've never had porridge like this before.

343
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:15,966
The flavor is truly surprising.

344
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:19,049
Wait.

345
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,159
I'd like to try a bit more.

346
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:45,824
Serving such uninspired food to national guests would be

347
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,536
disrespectful.

348
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:52,444
Indeed, the plating does feel a bit lacking.

349
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,485
This is samseok eoaltang, a three-colored fish stew

350
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,729
enjoyed by noble scholars of Andong.

351
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:03,171
The five traditional colors in the broth reflect the wisdom of the literati.

352
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,153
What's this?

353
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,766
It's japchae.

354
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:13,124
This is japchae?

355
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:15,465
During the reign of King...

356
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:19,220
I mean, the reign of Gwanghae,

357
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,410
japchae was first introduced at a royal banquet.

358
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:26,139
It was originally made by mixing assorted vegetables and meat,

359
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,936
seasoned with doenjang, then combined with wheat starch sauce.

360
00:29:56,423 --> 00:30:01,979
The taste is impressive, but the story behind it makes it even more special.

361
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:08,614
It seems this is exactly what's missing

362
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:10,789
in Chef Lee's dishes.

363
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:17,215
Sir, I know it's a bit late to say this,

364
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,321
but this man's identity is completely unverified.

365
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:25,913
How can we entrust such an important meal to someone we know nothing about?

366
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:27,605
Is this true?

367
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:30,808
Then, what about you?

368
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:36,594
Are you someone who can be trusted to cook?

369
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,403
Eun Sil?

370
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,254
You tried to...

371
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:47,499
You tried to kill my mom.

372
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:54,345
What nonsense is this? What are you talking about?

373
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:55,718
I know everything.

374
00:30:55,718 --> 00:31:00,521
You had Detective Kang keep an eye on her, afraid she might wake up.

375
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:07,709
Chef Lee, I thought I emphasized

376
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:11,177
how important this state banquet is.

377
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,311
It's a misunderstanding, sir.

378
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:19,425
Whatever it is, I do not want any trouble.

379
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:25,251
I'm afraid we can't entrust you with the job until everything is resolved.

380
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,650
What was your name again?

381
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,367
I'm Heo Gyosan.

382
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:35,015
Is it true that your identity is uncertain?

383
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:36,798
Yes, it's true.

384
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,545
That's unfortunate.

385
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:41,616
Your dishes were outstanding.

386
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:48,198
Sir.

387
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,853
Sir!

388
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:54,201
Young lady.

389
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:57,511
Do not let this shake you.

390
00:31:58,423 --> 00:32:01,758
From now on, you must face these battles alone.

391
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:04,076
Stay strong.

392
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,442
Sir, this is all a misunderstanding!

393
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,805
I'm being framed, sir!

394
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,085
Who the hell are you?

395
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:30,239
How long have you been planning this?

396
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,633
How long have you been scheming to ruin me?

397
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,138
It is too early to be angry.

398
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,379
What?

399
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:43,917
Did I not tell you?

400
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:46,917
That I would bring undeniable evidence you could not escape from.

401
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,131
Don't be ridiculous.

402
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:58,061
There is no such thing because...

403
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:01,181
I didn't do anything.

404
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:05,730
Well, in that case, I will have no choice but to...

405
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,830
What was it called?

406
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,848
The Internet!

407
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:15,709
I suppose I will have to post it there first.

408
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,552
Wait.

409
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:32,387
Let me see what it is.

410
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,683
Not just yet...

411
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:47,199
I will call you when the time comes.

412
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,859
Mister, I need to go see my mom.

413
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:09,470
You're not going to disappear to Joseon while I'm gone, right?

414
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:15,657
Even if you must go, you have to say goodbye before you leave.

415
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,312
I understand.

416
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:18,858
You mean that, right?

417
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:21,143
It's a promise.

418
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,089
You have my word.

419
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:27,838
Wait, young lady.

420
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,284
Take this with you.

421
00:34:51,144 --> 00:34:52,662
What's this?

422
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:55,274
This is the evidence of your mother's accident.

423
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:58,379
Come on, how can this be?

424
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,781
Keep it safe.

425
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:23,505
What on earth is this?

426
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,154
Now is the time.

427
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:04,776
Come to the place I tell you.

428
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:27,279
 From one end to the other... 

429
00:36:27,906 --> 00:36:30,876
 This will be Dorae Theme Village. 

430
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,646
 And right in the center is your diner. 

431
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:53,086
 Our diner just happens to be right in the middle... 

432
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:55,834
 Yes. 

433
00:36:55,834 --> 00:37:01,727
 As you can see, if your diner remains 

434
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:06,237
 my entire plan will fall apart. 

435
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:10,285
 I understand your situation 

436
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:13,978
 but I have my reasons for wanting to hold on to my diner. 

437
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,520
 That diner may be old and run-down, 

438
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,514
 but it's a legacy passed down for generations. 

439
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,050
 Generations ago, my great-grandfather 

440
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,080
 opened a tavern right there. 

441
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:33,470
 And it has been passed down ever since. 

442
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:48,213
 Chef Lee. 

443
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,073
 Are you listening? 

444
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:19,343
You are here.

445
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,531
You look like you have not slept from sheer anxiety.

446
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:35,174
Cut the nonsense and show me the evidence.

447
00:38:37,552 --> 00:38:39,614
Is this the place?

448
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:43,113
Where you pushed Eun Sil's mother.

449
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,122
The madam fell all the way down there,

450
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:49,444
and I was rushing over from this direction.

451
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:53,164
Enough talking. Just show me this so-called evidence.

452
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,283
Right now!

453
00:38:57,088 --> 00:38:59,816
The time should be just about right.

454
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,320
I heard this sound,

455
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,354
and while I ran off to find help, you fled the scene.

456
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:25,107
And I have it all recorded.

457
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:33,634
There's no surveillance camera here.

458
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:38,907
Then what do you think this is?

459
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,826
Give it to me.

460
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:47,908
If you did nothing wrong

461
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:50,736
there is no reason to be this desperate.

462
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,015
Hand it over!

463
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,713
Hold it! What do you think you are doing?

464
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:56,430
Step aside!

465
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:10,078
What's this sound?

466
00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:13,854
Pay the price for hurting the madam.

467
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,903
 I do not want any trouble. 

468
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:26,398
 I'm afraid we can't entrust you with the job until everything is resolved. 

469
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:30,240
This is...

470
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:36,134
Old man!

471
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,162
Old man, are you there?

472
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,542
May I ask something?

473
00:41:56,542 --> 00:42:00,682
Is this the right way to Yukjo Street?

474
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:02,346
That is right.

475
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:17,858
Well, this is a disaster.

476
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:26,540
What brings you here?

477
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,657
I have come to see His Excellency.

478
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:31,342
He has yet to wake.

479
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:34,794
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

480
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:43,270
What is all this commotion so early?

481
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,349
Forgive me, but there is an urgent matter.

482
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,618
What is it?

483
00:42:56,944 --> 00:43:02,613
There are reports of a man without a topknot roaming within the Four Gates.

484
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,569
What?

485
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,681
Could it be...

486
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,979
Are you saying Gyosan is here?

487
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:14,997
Based on the description, it seems to be him.

488
00:43:14,997 --> 00:43:19,894
You swore he was struck down, a blade through his throat!

489
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:22,603
I cannot explain it myself.

490
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:27,849
Seize him at once and bring him before me!

491
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:29,949
Yes, Your Excellency.

492
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:32,023
There is no need

493
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:34,489
to bring him back alive.

494
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,574
They say he ran away.

495
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:53,652
I am almost at Yukjo Street.

496
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,051
I am almost there.

497
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:03,187
Wait.

498
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:06,016
I made a promise to the old man.

499
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,976
But saving my friends comes first.

500
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:22,008
However...

501
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:55,396
This should be the right place.

502
00:44:58,091 --> 00:44:59,921
That must be her.

503
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:04,705
- Excuse me. 
 - What?

504
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:07,279
Oh my, who might you be?

505
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:09,410
Just a passing traveler.

506
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,930
I have a message to deliver to you.

507
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:14,289
To me?

508
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:16,867
What is it?

509
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:21,549
Your father, who built this tavern, asked me to deliver a message to his daughter.

510
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:24,639
Oh, well then...

511
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,577
I only work here.

512
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:32,586
The daughter is over there.

513
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,328
Thank you.

514
00:45:44,415 --> 00:45:46,378
What a waste.

515
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,019
But then...

516
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:54,982
He looks awfully familiar.

517
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:02,986
Are you the owner of this place?

518
00:46:05,706 --> 00:46:08,816
I bring a message from your father.

519
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:12,532
My father passed away last year

520
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:15,091
so how could he have sent you?

521
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:21,326
He told me there was something he never got to say to his daughter.

522
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,810
 Pass this tavern down 

523
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,160
 not by son or daughter 

524
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,509
 but to the child with the kindest heart, the one most deserving. 

525
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,870
 Let it remain a place of warmth 

526
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:45,000
 and generosity for generations to come. 

527
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:50,914
 And I... I shall watch over it even in death. 

528
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,013
 And as for your mother's ring... 

529
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:07,787
 Dad. 

530
00:47:12,993 --> 00:47:14,906
 Dad! 

531
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:25,051
How could a mere traveler possibly know that?

532
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,430
♫  Did my little cloud, holding you, convey my heart?  ♫

533
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,560
♫  Was it too small and blown far away by the wind?  ♫

534
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,360
♫  Was it too small and blown far away by the wind?  ♫

535
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,990
♫  If someday it brushes past you, it will be a clear breeze  ♫

536
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:46,777
Young lady!

537
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,783
I knew it.

538
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,628
If you are trying to pull a trick, get lost!

539
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:09,476
I see now. This place will one day become Seonbuk-dong

540
00:48:09,476 --> 00:48:12,797
and this very tavern will turn into the diner.

541
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,536
Do you need a bucket of water on your head to make you leave?

542
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:18,565
According to your father,

543
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:23,443
Your late mother's ring was not lost to gambling...

544
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:26,396
 Every time I looked at it, I wanted to follow her to the afterlife. 

545
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:28,947
 So I hid it inside the soy sauce jar. 

546
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,208
 Please tell her that. 

547
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:47,151
Could it really be true?

548
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:50,831
You are just as doubtful as Lady Eun Sil.

549
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:55,627
 His smooth face resembles the man on the wanted notice! 

550
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:58,875
 Hurry over! 

551
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,328
Are the royal guards after you?

552
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:07,616
It seems so.

553
00:49:07,616 --> 00:49:09,536
Hurry, this way!

554
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:16,736
Do not come out until I tell you.

555
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:30,508
Mister!

556
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:33,839
Mister!

557
00:49:34,582 --> 00:49:36,578
Mister!

558
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,896
No...

559
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:55,498
 The number you have dialed is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep. 

560
00:49:55,498 --> 00:49:59,070
Why isn't he picking up?

561
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,497
Excuse me.

562
00:50:02,497 --> 00:50:04,226
I'm here for the demolition estimate.

563
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:08,286
Can I check the kitchen for the gas and water lines?

564
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:11,456
Wait a second.

565
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:13,575
What are you doing in my diner?

566
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:15,329
It's now...

567
00:50:16,177 --> 00:50:18,222
my diner.

568
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,764
Please continue.

569
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:28,268
The contract hasn't been finalized. Don't you think you're overstepping?

570
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:30,648
This eyesore needs to be torn down

571
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:36,410
to make way for something better.

572
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:41,228
You really do wipe out anything in your way, don't you?

573
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:44,889
Just like how you put my mom in a coma.

574
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:47,627
Stop being stubborn

575
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,439
and go live somewhere nice.

576
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:56,020
You can't run this place alone anyway.

577
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,360
You talk like Mr. Homeless is gone for good.

578
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:05,984
What do you mean?

579
00:51:05,984 --> 00:51:08,216
You met with him, didn't you?

580
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:11,703
Where is he right now?

581
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:15,543
Why ask me that?

582
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:21,464
You didn't do something to him, did you?

583
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:24,217
I'm done here.

584
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:29,003
Yes, let's go.

585
00:51:43,902 --> 00:51:47,860
Detective Kang, it's me, Bong Eun Sil.

586
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,318
Yes, Bong Eun Sil.

587
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:51,451
Daddy!

588
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,720
Lee Hyuk again?

589
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,661
Well, I understand your situation,

590
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,814
but I'm not a cop anymore.

591
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:07,483
 You should report it in person. 

592
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,957
Oh yeah, he was unidentified.

593
00:52:14,937 --> 00:52:19,493
 All right, I'll see what I can do. 

594
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:21,925
Thank you, detective.

595
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:24,010
Please help me with this.

596
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:00,375
Wasn't this what was in the jar?

597
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:10,127
Yes, detective.

598
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:12,058
 I looked into it, 

599
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:15,342
 and it turns out his phone's last signal before shutting off 

600
00:53:15,342 --> 00:53:17,965
 was detected near that area. 

601
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:28,442
Mister!

602
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,577
Mr. Homeless!

603
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:32,822
Who are you looking for?

604
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:34,713
Mister!

605
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:40,548
Where is he?

606
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,308
Come on out.

607
00:53:43,308 --> 00:53:44,859
- Haven't you seen Mr. Homeless? 
 - You need to leave.

608
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:46,390
Wait, let go of me.

609
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,111
I said, haven't you seen Mr. Homeless?

610
00:53:49,616 --> 00:53:52,392
Haven't you seen Mr. Homeless?

611
00:53:52,392 --> 00:53:54,764
We really haven't seen him.

612
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:06,255
Did something really happen to him?

613
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:10,522
Did he return?

614
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,250
 Wait, young lady. 

615
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,114
 Take this with you. 

616
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,562
 What is it? 

617
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:34,180
 This is the evidence of your mother's accident. 

618
00:54:55,463 --> 00:54:58,312
It should be somewhere around here.

619
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:01,714
Why did he have to draw the map like this?

620
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:04,339
How am I supposed to find anything with this?

621
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,792
This was recorded at dawn.

622
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:25,854
He filmed for over three hours.

623
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:30,114
No wonder the battery ran out.

624
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,407
Lee Hyuk...

625
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:59,357
So, he did meet Mr. Homeless.

626
00:56:02,336 --> 00:56:04,284
 Is this the place? 

627
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:07,888
 Where you pushed Eun Sil's mother? 

628
00:56:09,678 --> 00:56:10,849
 Give it to me. 

629
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,023
 If you did nothing wrong 

630
00:56:14,023 --> 00:56:16,219
 there is no reason to be this desperate. 

631
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,513
 Hand it over! 

632
00:56:17,513 --> 00:56:19,158
 Hold it! 

633
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:28,158
You can come out now.

634
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:33,580
The guards might return,

635
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,544
so you should leave quickly.

636
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:42,214
You will be caught if you go out like that.

637
00:56:42,214 --> 00:56:43,890
Here, take this.

638
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:47,975
Why are you helping me?

639
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:51,323
For all you know, I could be a dangerous criminal.

640
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:53,615
I do not know about that.

641
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,770
But you delivered my father's final words to me

642
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,103
and found my mother's ring...

643
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:02,811
I cannot just stand by and let you be captured.

644
00:57:03,573 --> 00:57:06,129
You really are just like her.

645
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:09,211
Who are you talking about?

646
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:12,557
Someone I know.

647
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:18,084
She is full of doubt and very nosy.

648
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:26,300
I have a favor to ask.

649
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:36,566
Gyosan.

650
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:40,504
Where have you been hiding all along?

651
00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:46,423
He is unpredictable, which makes him even more dangerous.

652
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:54,047
And yet, still no sign of him?

653
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:56,068
My apologies, Your Excellency.

654
00:57:57,982 --> 00:57:59,760
Shall I release more men?

655
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,960
That is unnecessary.

656
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,735
His goal is clear,

657
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:07,588
so all we have to do is to ruin it.

658
00:58:08,946 --> 00:58:11,892
We must hasten the execution of the illegitimate sons.

659
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,894
To when?

660
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:17,883
Immediately.

661
00:58:18,552 --> 00:58:20,383
Yes, Your Excellency.

662
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:32,121
So they are finally executing the traitors?

663
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:34,068
- It is happening today. 
 - The whole town is in chaos.

664
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:36,289
Why has the market been so restless lately?

665
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:37,418
I do not know.

666
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,977
But they say they will wipe them all out.

667
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:42,478
People are talking about it non-stop.

668
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,650
It is a mess.

669
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:48,018
Excuse me, what...

670
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:52,151
What is going on?

671
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:57,482
The Office of Inspections is executing the illegitimate traitors today.

672
00:58:57,482 --> 00:58:59,399
What did you just say?

673
00:58:59,399 --> 00:59:01,679
But the new moon is not today!

674
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:07,408
That man!

675
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:11,247
That is the traitor on the wanted notice!

676
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:18,522
Lord Gyosan.

677
00:59:22,217 --> 00:59:26,075
Have you seen this man?

678
00:59:26,527 --> 00:59:29,938
He is said to be in the area, so report immediately if you find him.

679
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:48,639
My Lord!

680
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:51,766
My Lord!

681
00:59:51,766 --> 00:59:52,940
Mae Chang.

682
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,528
There is no time to waste, they are at the Office of Inspections.

683
00:59:57,382 --> 01:00:00,435
Leave this to me and go now!

684
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,387
Seize him!

685
01:00:03,387 --> 01:00:04,961
- Seize him! 
 - Seize him!

686
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:08,583
Seize him!

687
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,235
Seize him now!

688
01:00:19,142 --> 01:00:21,931
Thank you, Mae Chang.

689
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,649
Excuse me.

690
01:00:57,083 --> 01:01:00,418
If you clear the way, I will give you this.

691
01:01:03,762 --> 01:01:05,491
You have 15 minutes.

692
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:16,030
My friend.

693
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:18,706
Gyosan...

694
01:01:19,983 --> 01:01:22,355
I thought you were dead.

695
01:01:22,355 --> 01:01:25,994
I never imagined we would meet again, not in this world, but in the afterlife.

696
01:01:25,994 --> 01:01:30,724
I have not been in the afterlife but in the future.

697
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:32,316
The future?

698
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:35,958
I came back to clear your names

699
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,558
and stop this execution.

700
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:43,182
But unfortunately, I do not have the power to do that.

701
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,865
Forgive this useless friend of yours.

702
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:58,470
Do not say such things.

703
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:04,685
Even when our own families cast us aside

704
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:10,254
you stood by us as a true friend.

705
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:13,639
I do not know if this will bring you any comfort.

706
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:17,499
But the future I saw

707
01:02:18,092 --> 01:02:21,522
had no prejudice about the origin of birth.

708
01:02:21,522 --> 01:02:24,005
It is free of high and lowborns.

709
01:02:24,005 --> 01:02:28,264
People could become whatever they wished

710
01:02:28,264 --> 01:02:30,502
regardless of their birth.

711
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:33,730
You...

712
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:39,396
You mean you went to such a wondrous place alone?

713
01:02:42,182 --> 01:02:44,394
In the next life...

714
01:02:47,419 --> 01:02:49,549
In the next life, we will...

715
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,996
Wait, that is...

716
01:02:57,996 --> 01:03:01,763
Is that not Gyosan, whom His Majesty cherishes?

717
01:03:01,763 --> 01:03:04,572
It seems to be...

718
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,767
But what happened to his hair?

719
01:03:11,964 --> 01:03:13,956
Gyosan!

720
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:20,524
Do you have any idea how much I worried

721
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:22,602
about you?

722
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:28,084
I am relieved to see you safe.

723
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,182
Do not be reckless.

724
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:39,568
You are not foolish enough to act in vain.

725
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,440
Where have you been hiding all this time?

726
01:03:57,674 --> 01:04:02,582
Who helped you disappear without a trace?

727
01:04:02,582 --> 01:04:07,897
I was never in hiding. I was traveling.

728
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:11,173
Traveling where?

729
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:15,318
To a place where houses towered higher than mountains,

730
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,312
carriages moved faster than horses,

731
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,676
and night was as bright as day.

732
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:25,424
Unbelievable.

733
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:29,489
Still wasting time with your fantasies.

734
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:36,739
Have I not told you before? It is all pointless.

735
01:04:38,058 --> 01:04:40,651
This is no fantasy.

736
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:44,218
I returned without a single wound

737
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:48,254
after being stabbed by an assassin you sent.

738
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,885
That itself is proof.

739
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:04,010
Our entire lives, yours and mine, were recorded in mere lines.

740
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:10,589
When we were born, what we did, and how we would die.

741
01:05:14,308 --> 01:05:18,049
Do not look away and watch carefully.

742
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:22,513
Soon enough, you will take their place.

743
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,541
What?

744
01:05:27,002 --> 01:05:30,074
Lee Yi Chum, the one who ruled with tyranny,

745
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:32,293
was overthrown by anti-government forces.

746
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:35,372
While fleeing to a different province,

747
01:05:36,438 --> 01:05:38,863
he was captured and beheaded.

748
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:43,752
That was your record.

749
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,093
How dare you?

750
01:06:36,128 --> 01:06:38,659
Everything has been taken care of.

751
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:43,611
I sincerely apologize for the trouble, sir.

752
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:45,883
Can I trust that it's truly resolved?

753
01:06:47,316 --> 01:06:53,365
In business, you sometimes attract unwanted attention.

754
01:06:57,938 --> 01:07:00,089
Excuse us.

755
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:04,209
We're from Seonbuk Police Station. Are you Lee Hyuk?

756
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,649
We need you to come with us.

757
01:07:13,547 --> 01:07:15,782
Why would I need to go to the police station?

758
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:21,823
We received a report with a video showing you pushing a man down the stairs.

759
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:25,037
Sir.

760
01:07:25,037 --> 01:07:26,522
Sir, this is a misunderstanding!

761
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:27,566
Sir.

762
01:07:27,566 --> 01:07:29,351
Sir, this is a misunderstanding!

763
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:31,235
Sir!

764
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,004
- There he is! 
 - It's Chef Lee!

765
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:47,038
Are you the man in the video?

766
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:48,291
What happened to the victim?

767
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:50,568
Did you intend to kill him?

768
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:53,542
How can there be a case where no victim exists?

769
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:55,731
This entire situation is absurd.

770
01:07:55,731 --> 01:07:57,752
This is nothing but speculation.

771
01:07:57,752 --> 01:07:59,714
I will cooperate with the investigation and clear my name.

772
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:00,868
Was it spontaneous?

773
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,232
Or was it premeditated?

774
01:08:02,232 --> 01:08:03,631
Please say something.

775
01:08:03,631 --> 01:08:06,087
Just one statement!

776
01:08:06,087 --> 01:08:08,001
A comment, please!

777
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,411
Where did you get this umbrella?

778
01:08:09,411 --> 01:08:13,231
I swear I got rid of it! Where did you get it?

779
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:16,958
What umbrella?

780
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,095
Is the conversation in the video real?

781
01:08:26,095 --> 01:08:28,555
Please say something!

782
01:08:31,947 --> 01:08:33,611
Mi Sol.

783
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:37,068
Our movie is making headlines, eight articles already!

784
01:08:37,068 --> 01:08:38,720
Let me see.

785
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:43,022
Why did they use this photo?

786
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:44,644
Is the journalist my hater?

787
01:08:44,644 --> 01:08:46,107
You look great.

788
01:08:46,107 --> 01:08:47,258
Come on.

789
01:08:47,258 --> 01:08:51,464
Anyway, do you think you'll be able to handle the emotional scene this time?

790
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:54,504
   

791
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:56,069
Whoa, no way!

792
01:08:56,069 --> 01:08:57,907
Lee Hyuk is in trouble!

793
01:08:57,907 --> 01:09:00,696
I knew he'd get caught someday.

794
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:03,709
Hey, focus! You need to stay composed for your scene.

795
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:06,855
Okay, okay.

796
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:08,542
These comments are pure gold.

797
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:11,151
Everyone's just tearing him apart.

798
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:13,951
Oh, what's this?

799
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:15,885
Looks like there's even a video clip.

800
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,662
 Jung Mi Sol, we're ready for you. 

801
01:09:17,662 --> 01:09:19,273
Yes, we're coming.

802
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:21,995
Mi Sol, put your tablet away, and let's go.

803
01:09:36,277 --> 01:09:38,251
Why are you acting like this?

804
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:42,093
It really feels like I'm the only one in love these days.

805
01:09:42,093 --> 01:09:46,765
You're always the one who's late, but I'm always the one worrying.

806
01:09:58,412 --> 01:10:01,088
She's not supposed to cry here...

807
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:02,783
Leave her alone.

808
01:10:19,312 --> 01:10:23,301
I wanted Mr. Homeless to stay.

809
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:27,061
But perhaps it's for the best that he returned safely.

810
01:10:27,722 --> 01:10:29,301
Still...

811
01:10:30,086 --> 01:10:33,440
I wish I could have seen him one last time.

812
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,512
I don't know what's better.

813
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:52,680
♫  For you, who hold a smile full of spring  ♫

814
01:10:52,680 --> 01:11:00,050
♫  I'll write a love poem in the sky  ♫

815
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:08,090
♫  Even a forgotten wish might be okay  ♫

816
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:14,520
♫  Did my little cloud, holding you, convey my heart?  ♫

817
01:11:14,523 --> 01:11:18,288
 Please pass this embroidery down for generations. 

818
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:20,412
 It is a treasured piece. 

819
01:11:23,982 --> 01:11:27,342
He must have returned safely.

820
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,310
He said he wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

821
01:11:32,505 --> 01:11:34,380
He's such a liar.

822
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:40,740
♫  Please tell me you love me  ♫

823
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:05,710
Mom, do you recognize me?

824
01:12:15,888 --> 01:12:18,992
Mom, do you really recognize me?

825
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:26,266
Doctor!

826
01:12:27,457 --> 01:12:30,767
 Mom quickly recovered after regaining consciousness... 

827
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:33,840
 which led to the dismissal of my guardianship hearing. 

828
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,274
   

829
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:38,950
 Naturally, the contract for Heo's Diner was voided. 

830
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,284
Enjoy.

831
01:12:40,284 --> 01:12:42,199
   

832
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,368
Enjoy.

833
01:12:44,368 --> 01:12:45,641
Have you seen this?

834
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,907
He tried to kill the owner of this diner.

835
01:12:47,907 --> 01:12:50,348
- Seriously? 
 - Yeah.

836
01:12:51,782 --> 01:12:53,896
 Lee Hyuk, who coveted Heo's Diner, 

837
01:12:53,896 --> 01:12:57,681
 was acquitted due to insufficient evidence regarding Mr. Homeless. 

838
01:12:57,681 --> 01:13:00,957
 However, he was convicted for attempting to murder Mom. 

839
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,676
- Take care. 
 - Thank you, we enjoyed the meal.

840
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:19,864
Eun Sil, I'm here.

841
01:13:19,864 --> 01:13:21,346
Hey, Mi Sol.

842
01:13:21,346 --> 01:13:24,060
You've been ordering to-go a lot these days. You must be busy.

843
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,934
My schedule is absolutely hectic.

844
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:30,224
You won't see me much from now on, so take a good look while you can.

845
01:13:30,224 --> 01:13:31,858
All right.

846
01:13:31,858 --> 01:13:34,754
- Mom, to-go! 
 - Yes, I'm all done.

847
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,989
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

848
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:39,430
I'll carry it for you.

849
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:41,304
Since you're our VVIP.

850
01:13:41,304 --> 01:13:43,556
Forget it, my car is right outside.

851
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:44,920
Thank you for the meal, ma'am.

852
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,359
Enjoy!

853
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:48,334
Take care.

854
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:53,749
That makes 50, including Mi Sol's order.

855
01:13:53,749 --> 01:13:55,655
We're sold out for the day!

856
01:13:56,866 --> 01:14:00,477
Ma'am, your spinach is here.

857
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,671
Enough for three days!

858
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,770
They're fresh, right?

859
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,353
Of course.

860
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:08,192
I only deliver the best to Heo's Diner.

861
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:10,665
Eun Sil, what are you doing? Go get Mr. Kang some coffee.

862
01:14:10,665 --> 01:14:13,899
- Oh, coffee! 
 - No, no! I quit coffee!

863
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,450
I'm behind on deliveries. See you next week!

864
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,449
Drive safely!

865
01:14:20,108 --> 01:14:22,394
Detective Kang's business must be doing well.

866
01:14:22,394 --> 01:14:24,283
I guess so.

867
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,064
- Thank you, take care. 
 - Thank you for the meal.

868
01:14:39,064 --> 01:14:40,202
Thank you for the meal.

869
01:14:40,202 --> 01:14:42,343
Take care.

870
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,410
   

871
01:14:55,417 --> 01:14:58,442
 It wasn't until long after Mr. Homeless left 

872
01:14:58,442 --> 01:15:02,933
 that I realized he had already said goodbye. 

873
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:07,272
 Lady Eun Sil. 

874
01:15:07,272 --> 01:15:11,368
 Please forgive me for bidding farewell in writing. 

875
01:15:13,782 --> 01:15:18,253
 Living in this world and the other, I came to understand... 

876
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:25,120
 that whether in the past or the future, 

877
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,600
 one can only live in the present. 

878
01:15:28,252 --> 01:15:32,595
 So do your best to be happy. 

879
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,963
 Happiness is self-service. 

880
01:15:43,397 --> 01:15:46,210
- We're closed today. 
 - Welcome.

881
01:15:47,956 --> 01:15:51,388
- Mom. 
 - Don't complain and take the order.

882
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:56,561
Would you like a set meal?

883
01:15:56,561 --> 01:15:58,211
Yes, please.
