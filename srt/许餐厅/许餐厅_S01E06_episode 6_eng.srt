1
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:05,086
   

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:07,492
   

3
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:08,640
   

4
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:11,560
   

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,060
   

6
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,730
       

7
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,839
   

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,175
   

9
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:32,474
   

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:43,150


11
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,798
Are you okay?

12
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:54,720
Yes, I think so.

13
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,075
What about you?

14
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:02,518
I am fine.

15
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,980
What a relief. That was close.

16
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:13,038
Bungeoppang... what a waste.

17
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:20,127
If you have the energy to worry about that, I guess you are all right.

18
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:23,110
I will buy you more next time.

19
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,210
Who the hell drives like that?

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,262
You almost hit someone!

21
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,286
Get out of the car now!

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,067
I said, get out!

23
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:47,589
Wait...

24
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:49,249
You're...

25
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:52,881
- Thank you— 
 - Mae Chang!

26
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,529
Oh, Mae Chang!

27
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:05,699
Mae Chang, wake up.

28
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:20,105
Jung Mi Sol, I know you're awake.

29
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:24,702
That's it. I'm calling the police.

30
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,416
Oh, don't!

31
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:30,178
Mae Chang, you are awake.

32
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:32,302
Thank goodness you regained consciousness.

33
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:35,606
Didn't I hit you with my car earlier?

34
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,345
As you can see, I am perfectly fine.

35
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:40,235
No one got hurt.

36
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:42,973
Still, why would you do something like that?

37
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,370
That was way too dangerous.

38
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,887
I have to ask, did you drink?

39
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:51,394
You're already caught up in enough scandals.

40
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:53,520
Are you really adding drunk driving to the list?

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,825
What?

42
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:57,527
I didn't drink a single drop!

43
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:02,788
Lee Hyuk was my target. You two just got in the way.

44
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,028
No way.

45
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:06,908
Then you tried to hit Chef Lee on purpose?

46
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:11,154
He ruined my life, so I better give him a taste of his own medicine.

47
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:14,110
Oh, I wanted revenge on Lee Hyuk...

48
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,751
But you two ruined my plan!

49
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,923
Don't slander him.

50
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,259
He's a good person.

51
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,888
What?

52
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:23,830
That is true.

53
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,005
He is not a bad person.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,585
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:31,345
Do you have any idea what he put me through?

56
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,803
I thought you were my fan, mister.

57
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:35,526
If you're my fan, you should take my side.

58
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,963
You keep calling me a "fan."

59
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,340
What does that mean?

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,423
Oh, wow.

61
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:43,384
Did you already leave my fandom now that my career is over?

62
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,459
What is leaving a fandom?

63
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,536
Okay, that's enough.

64
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:52,115
Jung Mi Sol, this guy stopped me from calling the cops.

65
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:56,261
So just drop the revenge act and live your life properly.

66
00:03:57,186 --> 00:04:00,363
I've had a rough day too.

67
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:03,301
But I wouldn't act as recklessly as you.

68
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:04,679
She is right.

69
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:08,449
One moment of anger can bring a hundred days of regret.

70
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:11,286
Hurting him will not fix anything.

71
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,694
What a joke!

72
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:16,047
Neither of you even know what he's really like.

73
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,820
Oh, Mae Chang!

74
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:23,944
You are still weak. Lie down a little longer.

75
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,098
Here?

76
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,179
This is my room!

77
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,703
Where am I supposed to sleep, then?

78
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,041
My, my!

79
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,670
Do you have no compassion, young lady?

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,647
Are you going to kick Mae Chang out

81
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,780
into the freezing cold when she looks this pale?

82
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,892
That is heartless.

83
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:43,043
You can't be serious.

84
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:46,401
Who's been feeding you and giving you shelter this whole time?

85
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:50,850
Now I see why they say never to take in a black-haired beast.

86
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,056
Forget it, I don't want to rest in this shabby room any longer.

87
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:58,731
Did you say, "shabby?"

88
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,418
I can't get myself behind the wheel today,

89
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,904
so can you take me home in my car, mister?

90
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,168
Let's go.

91
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,902
Hang on!

92
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:08,886
Why are you taking Mr. Homeless?

93
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:11,342
Call your manager.

94
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:15,774
I don't have a manager.

95
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,576
I fired him.

96
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,335
I couldn't stand seeing him cry because of me anymore.

97
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:22,507
So, take me home.

98
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:24,453
All right.

99
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,916
I will take her home.

100
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,623
What do you mean, "all right?"

101
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:30,618
You don't even have a driver's license!

102
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:32,980
What? He doesn't have a license?

103
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,521
There are a lot of things he doesn't have.

104
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,724
I guess I need something called a driver's license.

105
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:46,995
Don't... I'm Jung Mi Sol.

106
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,576
Look at her, sleeping soundly in this shabby room.

107
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:05,562
How is she so carefree after causing so much trouble?

108
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:11,655
And yet, I can't sleep just thinking about reopening the diner tomorrow.

109
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,152
Wait!

110
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:24,632
There's a cockroach in my soup, and that's your reaction?

111
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:26,714
Oh, my head hurts.

112
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,094
Why is it so cold?

113
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,697
I better repair this soon.

114
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,419
Oh, it's freezing.

115
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,198
Aren't you cold, Mr. Homeless?

116
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,587
 - Thank you— 
 - Mae Chang! 

117
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:58,293
 Do you have no compassion, young lady? 

118
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:03,024
 Are you going to kick Mae Chang out into the freezing cold when she looks this pale? 

119
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:06,122
Who cares if he's cold?

120
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:15,833
Mister, Mr. Homeless!

121
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,038
Mister!

122
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,561
He's freezing.

123
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:25,010
Mister, wake up.

124
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,085
You'll freeze to death if you sleep here!

125
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:29,114
Mister!

126
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,171
Young lady, what is the matter?

127
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,449
Why are you grabbing a man like that?

128
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,942
Are you in heat or something?

129
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:42,151
I should've just let you freeze.

130
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:50,462
But why is it so cold here?

131
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:56,957
Until I get that window fixed, you should sleep upstairs.

132
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:02,685
Come on, just go up.

133
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:06,111
I am not ready for this.

134
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,865
Fine, then stay here and freeze.

135
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,973
On second thought, I am ready.

136
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:28,043
What is that sound?

137
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,799
Is it Mae Chang?

138
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,514
Yes.

139
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,788
So much for getting any sleep tonight.

140
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:39,102
At least she seems to be sleeping well.

141
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,108
Even her snoring makes you happy, right?

142
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,382
Wow, your dedication as a fan is next-level.

143
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:46,221
Again, with that "fan" thing!

144
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,388
What does that even mean?

145
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:53,803
It just means liking and supporting someone.

146
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:58,524
So that is why Mae Chang keeps calling me a fan.

147
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:01,695
Among them, lunatic fans like you, who chase after celebrities

148
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,196
as if their life depended on it, are called stalkers.

149
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:07,909
My mind is perfectly sound!

150
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:11,472
Of course, I cherish Mae Chang as an artist.

151
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,135
But that is purely—

152
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,943
Okay, stop right there.

153
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:18,290
I don't need to hear the details.

154
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,891
I left a blanket here, so lay it down and sleep.

155
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:24,983
Wait, this is...

156
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,479
You washed my robe.

157
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:33,603
It is spotless, perfectly cleaned.

158
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,845
Of course.

159
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:39,642
I almost dislocated my shoulder trying to hand-wash that thing.

160
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:41,926
What?

161
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,882
What is this?

162
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,830
It was ripped, so I stitched it up.

163
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,571
And no, I wasn't the one who tore it.

164
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,766
I know.

165
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,987
But this...

166
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:57,035
I was just bored.

167
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:58,708
Is this... bungeoppang?

168
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,956
Wait, what is with half of this one?

169
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,477
I ran out of thread.

170
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,145
If you don't like it, I can take it out.

171
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:08,244
Who said I didn't like it?

172
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,572
I was just making an observation.

173
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,045
Then go to sleep.

174
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,474
Thank you.

175
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:23,618
The more I see you, the more I realize you are truly a warm-hearted person.

176
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:30,392
I cannot tell you how relieved I am that I met you instead of someone else in this unfamiliar world.

177
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:38,294
Didn't you call me heartless earlier?

178
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,833
You even stormed out, saying you didn't want to be used for money.

179
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,728
And yet, here you are again.

180
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,707
Come to think of it, you're surprisingly spineless.

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,068
How did you know?

182
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,035
If there is one thing this Transcendent Genius lacks,

183
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:57,101
it is exactly that.

184
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,961
And I'm the fool for taking you seriously.

185
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,150
I came back

186
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,628
because I realized you were right.

187
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,150
After hearing what you said, I looked again.

188
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:16,452
And this place isn't the Yuldoguk I dreamed of.

189
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:22,459
Now, I think I understand why you are so desperate for money.

190
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,557
I'm sorry for pushing you earlier.

191
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,652
I was just anxious about not being able to pay my mom's hospital bills

192
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,755
if the diner failed.

193
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:39,195
However, money can be earned.

194
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:44,092
If it helps you make money, I will gladly lend a hand.

195
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:47,830
Because I never want to see you cry

196
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:50,975
over money again.

197
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,824
You don't want to see me cry?

198
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,332
Why?

199
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,735
Why, you ask?

200
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,613
Because...

201
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,268
Excuse me.

202
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:36,757
About the car parked out front, have you seen Jung Mi Sol by any chance?

203
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,574
Oh, she's upstairs...

204
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,865
Hey, aren't you Mi Sol's stalker?

205
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:43,358
Where's Mi Sol?

206
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,506
Watch your mouth!

207
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:47,598
I am not some lunatic!

208
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,238
You're here for Jung Mi Sol, right?

209
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:53,818
Yes, I'm her manager. I've been looking everywhere for her.

210
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,288
So that's what happened.

211
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:05,119
She was acting strangely during our last call, so I was worried sick.

212
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:08,988
Thank goodness nothing happened.

213
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,512
This guy deserves a lot of credit for that.

214
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:15,575
Thank you.

215
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,487
I am not a stalker, just a regular fan!

216
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,571
Mae Chang is sleeping soundly.

217
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,346
So do not wake her. Come back in the morning.

218
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:29,837
Still, I can't just impose like this.

219
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:33,156
She's been through a lot lately.

220
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:35,753
At least let her get some proper rest.

221
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:39,555
Then...

222
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,152
Please contact me when she wakes up.

223
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:45,617
Got it.

224
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:57,115
Let us go upstairs and get some rest.

225
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:58,631
It is late.

226
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,432
Wait.

227
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:05,432
We need to finish our conversation first.

228
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,711
What conversation?

229
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:12,001
That thing you were about to say earlier.

230
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:15,613
What exactly did you mean...

231
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:22,582
when you said you don't want to see me cry?

232
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,723
Well...

233
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:31,036
When you cry...

234
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:40,066
I'll just go first.

235
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,229
Mr. Homeless, I think I...

236
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,235
Because it is ugly!

237
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,094
What?

238
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:50,402
Your crying face is so ugly

239
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:54,926
that I could not possibly bear to see it twice!

240
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,090
Excuse me?

241
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,283
I have seen a lot of ugly faces back in Joseon,

242
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:05,656
but compared to your crying face, they were practically noble...

243
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,140
♫  I remember how you looked back then  ♫

244
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:17,422
I am someone who has to return.

245
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:21,138
I cannot afford to let myself have useless emotions.

246
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:26,470
♫  You're a trace that won't fade  ♫

247
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,910
♫  Cause we are  ♫

248
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,070
♫  The moments I spent with you  ♫

249
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,620
♫  Cause we are  ♫

250
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,190
♫  Because our hearts are the same  ♫

251
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,750
♫  (Back then and even now)  ♫

252
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,260
♫  When I close my eyes  ♫

253
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,210
♫  I remember even the smallest things  ♫

254
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,600
♫  All the time that has passed  ♫

255
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,720
♫  I wonder if you're still in it  ♫

256
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,391
What's with the vibe here?

257
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,450
Mae Chang, did you sleep well?

258
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,332
I couldn't sleep a wink because it was uncomfortable.

259
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,174
But this feels even more awkward.

260
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:16,818
Says the person waking up at noon.

261
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,281
It's already that late?

262
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:24,909
But why isn't there a single customer?

263
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,473
Is it closed today?

264
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,013
No.

265
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:31,311
We're open, but we're having a slow day.

266
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:35,295
You'll go out of business soon.

267
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:38,160
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

268
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,834
I'm just saying, it's a shame.

269
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,855
If this were back when I was still popular, I could've promoted the place.

270
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:47,768
But now, that's not even an option.

271
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,368
All right!

272
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:51,843
Instead of waiting around for customers who may never come,

273
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:54,152
we should eat.

274
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:56,367
I'll prepare something special.

275
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,484
No thanks. I'll just throw it up anyway.

276
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,410
You two enjoy your meal.

277
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,810
I'll get going now.

278
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,823
That will not do!

279
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:15,788
This is a diner, after all, so I cannot let you leave on an empty stomach.

280
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:19,836
I saw in a video that you have nausea issues.

281
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:24,311
Even if you throw up, you need to eat something to keep going.

282
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:30,105
Not sure I want to eat food from this kind of place...

283
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,059
And what exactly do you mean by "this kind of place"?

284
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,959
It's lunchtime, and the place is empty.

285
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,794
Isn't that a sign the food's bad?

286
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,354
For crying out loud...

287
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,722
Our food tastes amazing.

288
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:48,068
Mr. Homeless, show her.

289
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,685
I will.

290
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,897
Please give me a moment.

291
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:03,341
Wait.

292
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,511
Your "special dish" is just porridge?

293
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:08,295
I don't even like porridge.

294
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,509
Did you say "just porridge"?

295
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,799
This is no ordinary porridge!

296
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,970
It is Bangpungjuk, made from wild parsnip sprouts that survive harsh winters before sprouting.

297
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,463
Not only is it known to prevent strokes,

298
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:24,106
but it also improves circulation

299
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:26,730
and relieves pain.

300
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,155
And it tastes really good.

301
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:33,354
The rich aroma fills your mouth and lingers for days,

302
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:36,194
leaving you in a good mood long after you have eaten it.

303
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:40,383
That is why, despite having tasted all of Joseon's finest dishes,

304
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:43,077
this remains one of my personal favorites.

305
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,176
Fine, I'll try it.

306
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:49,079
This guy must've sold a lot of snake oil in his time.

307
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,382
What the...

308
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,184
This is delicious!

309
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,224
See? I told you so.

310
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,366
Mr. Homeless is an amazing chef.

311
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,311
Eat as much as you like.

312
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,657
If the food is this good, then why aren't there any customers?

313
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:24,532
There was a cockroach incident yesterday.

314
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,443
That is absolutely false!

315
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:31,213
 From the ingredients to the cooking tools, 

316
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:35,218
 every part of my dish is meticulously controlled. 

317
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:41,684
Nothing enters my kitchen unless I allow it.

318
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,230
I swear on my honor.

319
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,839
No, my very life, this is the truth!

320
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,263
It's really strange, isn't it?

321
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:53,248
I've lived here since I was a kid

322
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:56,290
and I've never once seen a cockroach.

323
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:59,292
My mom was really sensitive about it.

324
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,345
And yet somehow, one magically appears in our soup?

325
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:03,890
A paparazzo must've scammed you.

326
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,280
- Paparazzo? 
 - Paparazzo?

327
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:11,022
You know, those people who stalk celebrities and wait for dirt to use against them?

328
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,929
They snap a bad photo, then demand hush money.

329
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:17,395
Didn't they ask for money?

330
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:25,086
Detective Kang.

331
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,565
You guys go on ahead.

332
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,242
Let's go.

333
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,143
You punk...

334
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:41,936
How dare you come here? How?

335
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:45,713
Come on, a job well done deserves fair pay, doesn't it?

336
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,790
You're just gonna ghost me like this?

337
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,000
Look at this punk...

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,250
Are you crazy?

339
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,527
Have you lost your mind?

340
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,406
Why? Should we go inside together?

341
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:59,952
What, missed the taste of prison food after a few years?

342
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,912
If people find out what you had me do...

343
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:06,682
I doubt it'd be good for you either.

344
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,072
And you think anyone would believe you?

345
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,660
A punk like you, who has been swindling

346
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,666
and threatening people for a lifetime.

347
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,117
Beat it, you punk.

348
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:20,133
And don't even think about showing your face around here again.

349
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,797
And especially that alley, stay the hell away.

350
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,432
You heard me.

351
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,792
I said, do you hear me?

352
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:42,580
 He didn't ask for money. 

353
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,842
Well, some reporters publish articles without demanding money.

354
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:51,586
All done.

355
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:57,847
You finished the whole bowl.

356
00:21:57,847 --> 00:22:00,688
Strangely enough, this porridge is amazing.

357
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,627
I told you.

358
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:05,377
Bangpungjuk is a true delicacy.

359
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,128
Mi Sol!

360
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:09,982
Hey...

361
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:12,821
How did you even find this place?

362
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:16,661
He was here last night, too, while you were sleeping.

363
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,509
I told you to find other ways to make a living.

364
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,725
Why won't you ever listen?

365
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,729
We're on the same boat.

366
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:28,311
I practically raised you on my back.

367
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,623
Look at your face. All worn out.

368
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:33,314
You haven't been eating well, have you?

369
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:37,410
Sorry.

370
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,477
She slept well and had a good meal, so do not worry.

371
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,342
Is that so?

372
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:47,980
Thanks anyway.

373
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,153
Mi Sol, let's go.

374
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:53,018
Sit and wait a little.

375
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:00,048
As you can see, I just ate.

376
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:02,822
If I leave now and throw up, that'd be a waste.

377
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:06,116
You know how expensive my car's Italian leather seats are.

378
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:08,925
If you've been dealing with this, you should have told me.

379
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,482
Why hide it from me as well?

380
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:12,789
It's nothing I'm proud of.

381
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,420
Mi Sol, can't you stop making yourself throw up?

382
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,961
It's ruining your body.

383
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:21,977
You're not even working right now.

384
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:23,402
Why not take a break from dieting?

385
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,176
It's not because I'm on a diet!

386
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:27,748
No?

387
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,429
I wish that were true.

388
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,218
Don't tell me Lee Hyuk fooled you too.

389
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:39,247
Then why do you throw up everything you eat?

390
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:47,471
Back when I was doing a lot of commercials as a kid,

391
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:50,530
everyone wanted me to stop growing.

392
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,419
Directors, advertisers,

393
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,472
and even fans.

394
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,087
But especially my mom.

395
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:03,671
 Jung Mi Sol! 

396
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:08,518
 Mi Sol, are you out of your mind? 

397
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:11,081
 Did you hear what the director said? 

398
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:15,843
 Everyone here is relying on you 

399
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:20,177
 and you can't even stop eating? 

400
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,511
 Open your mouth. 

401
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:28,164
 Open up and spit it out! 

402
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,690
 Mom... 

403
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,513
 If you keep growing, 

404
00:24:37,513 --> 00:24:40,317
 your career is over. 

405
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,697
 No one will even look at you. 

406
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,029
 Is that what you want? 

407
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:54,661
 As your mom, I believe in you. 

408
00:24:57,015 --> 00:25:00,713
The pressure not to eat kept getting worse.

409
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:04,203
Eventually, my body started rejecting food.

410
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,192
 Yes, mom. 

411
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:09,843
 She's gotten way too big. 

412
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,852
 She was so cute as a kid, but now... 

413
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,408
 Growing is the end of a child model. 

414
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:17,902
 Why put so much pressure on a kid? 

415
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:23,865
 As your mom, I believe in you. 

416
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:28,659
At first, it only happened sometimes,

417
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:30,583
but then it became constant.

418
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:34,908
Now, no matter what I eat, I throw it back up.

419
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:38,623
I've been to so many doctors,

420
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:40,873
but nothing helps.

421
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,387
I had no idea...

422
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:47,815
I'm sorry, Mi Sol.

423
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,741
So, it comes from deep pain.

424
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:54,937
It must have been hard for you.

425
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:58,547
Wait...

426
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:02,324
It's been a while since you ate.

427
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:04,770
Shouldn't you have thrown up by now?

428
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:07,251
You're right.

429
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,766
It's weird.

430
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,442
Do you feel sick? Are you okay?

431
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:13,538
Yes.

432
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,105
This has never happened before...

433
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,992
I made plenty, so take some home with you.

434
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:30,417
Here you go.

435
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:34,208
Come by anytime you are hungry.

436
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,008
There will always be a meal waiting for you here.

437
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:41,140
I really wasn't planning on taking in a stalker.

438
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,197
But you keep impressing me.

439
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:47,049
I am not a stalker.

440
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,202
I am just a fan.

441
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:54,347
Take care of yourself, Mi Sol.

442
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,121
Both your body and your heart.

443
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,906
Can I call you Eun Sil?

444
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:01,067
Thank you, Eun Sil.

445
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,521
So, how long have you two been living together?

446
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:08,880
What?

447
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:13,735
Live together? It's nothing like that!

448
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,790
Mister, why are you just standing there?

449
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,843
Say something.

450
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:22,554
We are, oh...

451
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,362
We are strictly business partners. Business.

452
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:30,345
I see.

453
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,609
That's perfect.

454
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,217
Thank you.

455
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:45,039
Take care.

456
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:50,594
"That's perfect?"

457
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,506
What's perfect?

458
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:57,554
What's wrong?

459
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:01,193
Did my ugly face startle you after looking at pretty Mi Sol for too long?

460
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:03,444
There you go again!

461
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:05,668
You are not ugly.

462
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,337
Just your crying face is.

463
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:11,559
Why, you!

464
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,608
Never mind.

465
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:17,325
There's something more important right now.

466
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,992
More important?

467
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,719
Like what?

468
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:32,495
What are you doing?

469
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:35,355
Are you picking fights with those haters again?

470
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:36,846
No.

471
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:38,461
Like Mi Sol said,

472
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:43,560
if the guy who claimed to find a cockroach in our food was after money...

473
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,277
Then he probably pulled this scam before.

474
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:48,153
If I dig through similar cases,

475
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:51,055
I might find a lead.

476
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:54,371
So you can pick fights and track down criminals

477
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:58,133
all on that tiny plank?

478
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,561
What an enchanting object.

479
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:05,670
Mister, can you untie this for me?

480
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:09,989
You should keep it on a bit longer.

481
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:12,055
This is life or death for our diner.

482
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:13,728
Hurry.

483
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:16,385
All right.

484
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,377
Let us see...

485
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,021
Luckily, it looks like it is healing well.

486
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,878
You should be fine.

487
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:54,739
I better go buy ingredients for tomorrow.

488
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:51,810
Did you enjoy the meal?

489
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,690
I enjoyed it very much.

490
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,990
But then...

491
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,230
How should I put it? The dishes feel a bit modern.

492
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:06,304
The dignitary wishes to showcase authentic Korean flavors to the state guests.

493
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:08,595
Yes, I understand.

494
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,897
I'll revise the course menu to focus on traditional elements.

495
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:16,188
I know you're deeply invested in globalizing Korean cuisine, Chef Lee.

496
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:18,693
Taking charge of this state dinner

497
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:21,462
will be a great opportunity for you as well.

498
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,146
It would be a tremendous honor.

499
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:29,262
I'll do my best to craft a menu that meets your expectations.

500
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:36,060
I heard you're working on a Korean cuisine-themed project.

501
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,027
Is everything going well?

502
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:40,584
Yes, it's in the final stages.

503
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:42,509
I'm looking forward to it.

504
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,448
No need to see me out.

505
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,416
Sir.

506
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,143
There's a call for you.

507
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:56,770
Who is it?

508
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,010
Well... he didn't give a name,

509
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,282
but said he works with Detective Kang.

510
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,589
Hang up.

511
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:12,239
From now on,

512
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:16,604
handle these calls without informing me.

513
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:27,032
   

514
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,540
Found him.

515
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:39,622
   

516
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:41,030
   

517
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,573
Chef Lee!

518
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:53,817
No customers...

519
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:56,036
Again.

520
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:59,005
We only had one table earlier, and that was it.

521
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:01,611
Keeping the place open with no customers every day...

522
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,917
The losses must be piling up.

523
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,927
At this rate, we really might go under.

524
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:11,441
Would you like some coffee?

525
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:13,007
No,

526
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:14,525
but thank you.

527
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,426
Please have a seat.

528
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:23,820
Once a bad rumor spreads,

529
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,700
it's hard to recover.

530
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,071
I've experienced it firsthand,

531
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:32,361
so I know how it feels.

532
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,954
You mean Jung Mi Sol's case?

533
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:41,340
Eun Sil, even with things like this...

534
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,010
do you still want to keep running this place?

535
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:49,122
I can cover all your losses.

536
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:52,812
With that money, you wouldn't have to struggle.

537
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:56,253
You could focus entirely on caring for your mother.

538
00:33:57,264 --> 00:34:00,175
It's a generous offer,

539
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:02,348
but I can't just walk away.

540
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:05,731
This is the place my mom built from the ground up.

541
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:08,827
Even if I have to close, I need to restore its reputation first.

542
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:12,356
But your losses will only keep growing,

543
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:16,503
and restoring a reputation is easier said than done.

544
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:19,522
That's why I started looking into that guy.

545
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:22,224
Turns out, he's a repeat offender.

546
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:25,587
I posted his photo in restaurant owner communities.

547
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,383
Want to see?

548
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,860
No, that's okay.

549
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:33,891
Well...

550
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:38,175
But... will catching him really change anything?

551
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:41,259
At the very least, it'll stop him from targeting other restaurants.

552
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,820
That's reason enough for me.

553
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,716
I'll make sure he gets caught.

554
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,545
And once we clear our name...

555
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,362
Even then...

556
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:57,355
If things still don't improve...

557
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,719
then you have to buy this place at a good price.

558
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:05,668
I will.

559
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:09,292
But if it ever gets too hard, don't hesitate.

560
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,672
Come straight to me.

561
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,720
Hello!

562
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:27,168
You seem to be in a good mood.

563
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:30,291
Not really.

564
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,952
If it is something good, you should share it.

565
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:36,678
Just like bungeoppang.

566
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,983
I'm fine, really.

567
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:41,987
It is still warm.

568
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:46,252
I'm not feeling too well.

569
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:49,830
Oh, that is concerning.

570
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,993
Could it be from the accident?

571
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,091
Oh, right!

572
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:57,971
Thank you for letting it slide back then.

573
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:02,588
It's nothing. I didn't want things to go out of hand, either.

574
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:05,729
As expected, you are a man of great generosity!

575
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:09,211
I made sure Mae Chang understands not to pull anything like that again

576
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,363
so you do not have to worry.

577
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,740
Yes, then...

578
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:24,409
I hope he stays healthy.

579
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:43,489
Traditional flavors...

580
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,202
Mister.

581
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:05,526
If the diner really goes under, what will you do?

582
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,173
Watch your words!

583
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,496
Do not say such things!

584
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:11,570
They say words have power.

585
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:16,575
The truth will come out eventually,

586
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:19,315
and customers will return.

587
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,199
Easy for you to say.

588
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:27,249
Why are you cooking so hard when we barely have any customers?

589
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:31,791
That man said he was not feeling well, so I am making Bangpungjuk for him.

590
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,230
Chef Lee said he's unwell?

591
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,380
He seemed to be in a good mood, but he did say so.

592
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:41,985
He seemed fine earlier.

593
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:46,389
All right, then...

594
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,121
How should I pack this for him?

595
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,238
This looks perfect!

596
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,652
Oh, not that!

597
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:04,396
This is my mom's prized jar.

598
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:07,569
It's been passed down to the daughters in our family.

599
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:09,958
Really?

600
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:13,753
I just thought it would be perfect since it has a lid.

601
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,966
Close it now!

602
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:22,219
If you open it, my mom will flip out.

603
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,483
There is something inside...

604
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:29,459
She said it's an heirloom from our ancestors.

605
00:38:29,459 --> 00:38:33,450
If it's been passed down that long, it must be worth a fortune, right?

606
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:37,655
Should I take it to a TV show for appraisal?

607
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:40,672
It does not seem all that valuable...

608
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:42,339
Excuse me?

609
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:47,099
Anyway, what should I use to pack the porridge?

610
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:03,058
Sir.

611
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:05,131
You have a visitor.

612
00:39:11,745 --> 00:39:13,467
Who are you?

613
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:15,913
Oh, Chef Lee Hyuk!

614
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:21,281
I've tried calling you several times, but you're not easy to reach.

615
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:25,629
I asked, who are you?

616
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:30,234
Come on, you don't recognize me?

617
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,626
You must've seen the video I sent Detective Kang.

618
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:37,317
I have no idea what you're talking about.

619
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:40,514
I knew something was up the moment Kang started snooping around

620
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:43,870
this fancy restaurant of yours.

621
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,933
The guy seriously underestimates me.

622
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:52,659
By the way, this place is impressive.

623
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:55,008
You must be making good money.

624
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:59,089
Please stop blathering and leave

625
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:01,297
before I report you for business interference.

626
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:09,265
It was you.

627
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,606
The one who ordered to shut down that diner.

628
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:16,620
Look...

629
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,060
I didn't want to come here and cause a scene.

630
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:23,131
But now the entire nation knows my face, thanks to someone.

631
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,517
So now I can't even make a living.

632
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,123
Let's cut to the chase.

633
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:32,572
Just pay me what I'm owed,

634
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:35,650
and I'll walk away quietly.

635
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:42,983
Whatever you've done has nothing to do with me.

636
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:45,470
Take your complaints elsewhere.

637
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:48,987
Over here!

638
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:51,691
Send this man out right now.

639
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:53,272
- Please leave. 
 - Please leave, sir.

640
00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:55,621
- Come on out! 
 - Thank you.

641
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,962
- Coming through. 
 - Let go of me!

642
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:07,906
Detective Kang, how the hell...

643
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:11,354
are you planning to handle this?

644
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:14,198
- Get out! 
 - Why are you doing this to me?

645
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:15,190
Careful!

646
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,764
Watch yourself! You nearly spilled the porridge!

647
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:22,476
Wait, you are...

648
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:27,344
You are that pyeonsa who falsely claimed there was filth in my food!

649
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,306
   

650
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:31,266
Hold this for me.

651
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:34,874
I have been waiting for this moment!

652
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:37,976
What do you mean, false claim? I just said what I saw!

653
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:40,283
Then why did you run away back then?

654
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:43,280
Let us settle this once and for all.

655
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,082
A fraud like you deserves to be paraded around Gwanghwamun!

656
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:48,679
You got proof, right? Where's your proof that I was lying?

657
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,159
- You have none, do you? Now let go! 
 - You are still spouting lies!

658
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,572
- Let go of me! 
 - How long do you plan on lying?

659
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:56,497
Why are you like this? Let's talk it out!

660
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:58,391
Oh, let go...

661
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:00,750
You?

662
00:42:01,596 --> 00:42:04,370
What are you doing here?

663
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,580
Chef Lee, what should I do?

664
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,220
Should I spill the beans or not?

665
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,893
- Go inside. 
 - Okay.

666
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:18,147
Chef, do you know this man?

667
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,627
This is the bastard who lied about finding a cockroach in our food—

668
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:25,947
I mean... this is the guy.

669
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:28,908
Who said I was lying? Where's your proof?

670
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,295
All you do is serve dirty food.

671
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:32,216
How dare you?

672
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,153
How dare you spew more lies?

673
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,164
You want proof?

674
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:41,703
Take a good look.

675
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:45,947
It's the cries of the restaurant owners you've scammed!

676
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,195
Darn it.

677
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,047
So, you're the one who put my face all over the internet!

678
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:58,869
Chef, how do you know him?

679
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:03,565
I don't know him.

680
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,207
Of course.

681
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,861
He would not be involved with trash like him!

682
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:09,551
Oh, really?

683
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:14,198
Then why was he coming out of Dorae?

684
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,139
That's because...

685
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:32,978
You, punk...

686
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,171
Didn't I tell you not to set foot in this neighborhood again?

687
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:36,827
You are...

688
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,113
that officer!

689
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:43,031
What brings you here, Detective Kang?

690
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,966
He tried the same stunt at our restaurant.

691
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:50,689
I just called the police on him.

692
00:43:51,354 --> 00:43:54,178
- What the hell are you talking about? 
 - You, punk.

693
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:57,736
I didn't know he was the man you were looking for, Eun Sil.

694
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,425
This is great.

695
00:43:59,926 --> 00:44:03,184
So, after messing with our place, you went after his too?

696
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,600
What a scoundrel!

697
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,495
Oh, you want me to talk?

698
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:08,815
Should I start spilling who the real scumbag is here?

699
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,670
You, punk...

700
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,849
Save it and just come with me.

701
00:44:28,814 --> 00:44:33,828
Chef Lee, you just saved our diner.

702
00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:36,926
Did I... save your diner?

703
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:42,180
Once the police confirm his crimes, our diner will finally clear its name.

704
00:44:44,346 --> 00:44:46,941
You've saved us!

705
00:44:48,058 --> 00:44:51,758
You could say that from a little further away.

706
00:44:53,454 --> 00:44:56,525
I'm glad I could help.

707
00:44:57,122 --> 00:45:01,164
Now I feel like I can keep going.

708
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,848
It's all thanks to you.

709
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:06,447
Oh, wow!

710
00:45:06,447 --> 00:45:09,363
I do not even know how to express my gratitude!

711
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:14,174
I get it. Enough of that.

712
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:17,867
I won't give up and I'll do my best.

713
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:20,331
Thinking of you, Chef Lee.

714
00:45:24,062 --> 00:45:25,799
I can do this!

715
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:32,210
Someone in hanbok dropped this off earlier...

716
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,789
Come to think of it...

717
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:07,984
I can still get rid of him to bring down that diner.

718
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:20,719
What is all that?

719
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,798
We can't just sit around waiting for customers.

720
00:46:23,798 --> 00:46:25,697
What's the point of saying that we're clean?

721
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:28,684
We have to show it.

722
00:46:28,684 --> 00:46:30,727
That makes sense.

723
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:33,159
Seeing is believing, after all.

724
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:39,107
You said words have power, right?

725
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:43,675
One step back for two steps forward! Let's turn crisis into opportunity!

726
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,743
Let's do this!

727
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:50,782
That is quite a bit of enthusiasm.

728
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:55,310
Down, like this.

729
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:58,558
Okay?

730
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,973
- Going up! 
 - No, not up! Go down.

731
00:47:04,973 --> 00:47:06,577
Great! Isn't this fun?

732
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:09,421
You need to match the line.

733
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,510
♫  Why is the sky so clear today?  ♫

734
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,890
♫  Shall we now hold hands  ♫

735
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:21,611
My goodness, look at me.

736
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:23,627
I almost missed my mom's visiting hours.

737
00:47:23,627 --> 00:47:27,458
I'll be back soon, so make sure to finish painting all of this.

738
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,019
All of it?

739
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:30,397
- All of it. 
 - Alone?

740
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:31,730
I'm off!

741
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,716
Finish everything!

742
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,764
Have a safe trip.

743
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:52,233
Was it like this?

744
00:47:56,091 --> 00:47:57,570
Hello!

745
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:04,077
I was wondering if you had a moment.

746
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:08,049
The young lady went to the hospital.

747
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:11,628
But I'm not here to see her.

748
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:13,577
I'm here for you.

749
00:48:14,284 --> 00:48:16,181
Me?

750
00:48:17,252 --> 00:48:21,053
Never thought I would see the day you would seek me out first.

751
00:48:21,053 --> 00:48:23,118
I am all yours.

752
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:27,480
This isn't the best place to talk.

753
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,812
Shall we head to my restaurant?

754
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:32,741
What is this about?

755
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:36,798
Mom, I spread that guy's photo all over the place

756
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:39,127
so he can never pull that trick again.

757
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:42,734
But can you believe it?

758
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:46,973
He tried it again at Chef Lee's restaurant and got caught.

759
00:48:46,973 --> 00:48:51,409
Guess the saying is true: "Bad guys always get what they deserve."

760
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:54,194
Maybe there is some truth to that.

761
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,761
Well...

762
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,514
This time, it wasn't heaven that punished him.

763
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:01,858
It was Chef Lee.

764
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,480
He's such a generous person.

765
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:16,099
Mom, we're remodeling the diner right now.

766
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:20,173
You'll be surprised when you see it.

767
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:23,055
If you're curious, wake up soon.

768
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:24,867
I'll get going now.

769
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:45,074
Where did Mr. Homeless go?

770
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:59,538
Where is this chill coming from...

771
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:14,349
I don't think we ever had a chance to sit down and talk.

772
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:20,265
I thought it'd be good to talk openly at least once.

773
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,166
I have been wanting that for a while, my man.

774
00:50:24,723 --> 00:50:29,845
A proper talk needs a drink between men.

775
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:31,508
Here, have some.

776
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:45,756
I should be finishing the paint job...

777
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:51,924
But I suppose one glass would not hurt.

778
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:00,967
Wait...

779
00:51:01,582 --> 00:51:03,690
Did you...

780
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:08,808
Yes? Does something seem off?

781
00:51:08,808 --> 00:51:11,402
Did you add honey to the liquor?

782
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:15,121
There is no way I can stop at one.

783
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:19,453
Drink as much as you like.

784
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:22,455
We have plenty of liquor.

785
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:32,926
Where did he go and why isn't he back yet?

786
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:36,124
Did he run away just because I made him paint?

787
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,648
   
   

788
00:52:05,442 --> 00:52:09,434
Your cooking skills are exquisite.

789
00:52:10,762 --> 00:52:12,531
The porridge was truly delicious.

790
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:14,915
Really?

791
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:19,009
Hearing that from you, I feel like I am soaring.

792
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:23,312
If you don't mind me asking,

793
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:26,125
what's your secret?

794
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,829
There are no secrets.

795
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:31,478
If there is anything, it must be the palate,

796
00:52:31,478 --> 00:52:37,621
memory, and touch of this Transcendent Genius.

797
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:42,548
With such talent,

798
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:45,939
why waste it in a rundown diner

799
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,896
with no customers?

800
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:52,924
 Just look at yourself. 

801
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:57,595
 A man as full of life as you, wasting away for the rest of his days 

802
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:01,790
 locked in a house without even a single window? 

803
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:05,415
What's the matter?

804
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,351
Nothing.

805
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:13,121
After a few drinks, you seem to resemble my friend even more.

806
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,511
Is that so?

807
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:18,570
I...

808
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:21,683
don't look that old, do I?

809
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:24,481
It is strange, is it not?

810
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:30,892
You are not him but you are just like him.

811
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:38,567
 The dignitary wishes to showcase authentic Korean flavors to the state guests. 

812
00:53:56,602 --> 00:54:00,048
Leave that diner

813
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,454
and join me.

814
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:09,644
I'll turn you into the finest Korean chef.

815
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,238
Pardon?

816
00:54:13,364 --> 00:54:16,181
You have quite the sense of humor when you are drunk.

817
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:22,515
I have always been anything but humorous.

818
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:27,461
 Have I ever been anything but serious? 

819
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:32,288
It is been a while since I drank,

820
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,313
and it is really getting to me.

821
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,053
I should call it a day.

822
00:54:39,053 --> 00:54:41,405
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

823
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:48,009
Are you content to stay in that shabby diner for the rest of your days?

824
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:49,749
 Then... 

825
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:54,353
 are you content to live like this for the rest of your days? 

826
00:54:55,193 --> 00:54:57,038
Gwansong.

827
00:54:58,345 --> 00:55:00,731
I missed you.

828
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:10,993
This will guide Mr. Homeless even on the darkest nights.

829
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:14,186
Let's work together.

830
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,833
I'll give you the best possible offer.

831
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:27,230


832
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:46,790
♫  Even if everything flows away you are still by my side  ♫

833
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:53,010
♫  Don't let go of my hand, not ever  ♫

834
00:55:53,010 --> 00:56:00,090
♫  When spring comes let's go there, together  ♫

835
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:06,060
♫  Let's never be apart again  ♫

836
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:27,040
♫  It always felt so distant the word “us”  ♫

837
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,630
♫    ♫
