[Xu Jianshe]

4
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,190
Today may be an ordinary day

5
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,520
in the calendar.

6
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
But for them

7
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,030
today is such an important day.

8
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,800
The groom is Mr. Zhang Quanquan.

9
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,230
Today,

10
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,920
you take

11
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,350
Qiu Hua to be your lawfully wedded wife,

12
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,120
to have and to hold,

13
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,070
from this day forward,

14
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,920
for better, for worse,

15
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,070
in sickness and in health,

16
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,240
until death do you part.

17
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,330
So,

18
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,000
do you want to be his wife?

19
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,880
Yes, I do.

20
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,830
Applause for the groom.

21
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,830
His firm answer

22
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,680
shows the man's sense of responsibility

23
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,830
and his promise.

24
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,330
Congratulations, Qiu Hua.

25
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,390
You're going to be his wife soon,

26
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,920
and you'll spend the rest of your life with him.

27
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,830
So,

28
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,270
do you want to be his wife?

29
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes, I do.

30
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,120
"Yes, I do."

31
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,480
They're the most beautiful words at a wedding.

32
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,910
Qiu Hua.

33
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,490
I

34
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,020
really,

35
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,630
really,

36
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,080
really,

37
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
love you so much.

38
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,540
Thank you all.

39
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,310
Ms. Luo, hope you'll help us more in the future.

40
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,240
You're doing it again.

41
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,880
Quanquan, happy wedding.

42
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,200
Thank you, Madam Mei.

43
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm very happy that you're here.

44
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,920
Cheers.

45
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,880
Let's drink together.

46
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,190
Come on, let's drink together.

47
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,480
-Madam Mei.
-Madam Mei.

48
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,590
Excuse me.

49
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,740
Do you have a moment?

50
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,740
Yes, Madam Mei. Why?

51
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,330
I want to talk to you.

52
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,750
Okay.

53
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,810
Let's sit over there.

54
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,310
Come and have a drink.

55
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,270
Come on.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,170
So you want me and Qiu Hua

57
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
to investigate Wei Cheng's rape case

58
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,140
that was once handled by you and Mr. Yu?

59
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,300
Do you want us to help you reverse the court decision?

60
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,010
Yu is gone.

61
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,830
I don't want to be a lawyer anymore.

62
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,350
There's no point

63
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,190
in reversing the verdict.

64
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
I just want to know

65
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,240
who framed us back then.

66
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,120
I suspect

67
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,870
that person was someone in Liangcheng Law Firm.

68
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
You know my relationship

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
with Liangcheng Law Firm, right?

70
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,670
Of course.

71
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,120
You and Mr. Yu

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,480
established Liangcheng Law Firm together.

73
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,510
Besides,

74
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,920
almost all the partners of the firm

75
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,720
are your and Mr. Yu's students.

76
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,310
Humanity is complicated.

77
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,430
The law firm

78
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,680
was getting bigger and bigger.

79
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,270
Some people didn't like us.

80
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Some were not satisfied with the distribution of profit.

81
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,800
So they would do something to hurt us.

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,040
That was normal.

83
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,720
But that case was a deadly blow to us.

84
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,720
I really don't know

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,830
who would do such a thing.

86
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,680
Sometimes, people who are the closest to you

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,310
are also your greatest enemies.

88
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,600
I really learnt that lesson.

89
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,680
I know what you went through.

90
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,800
But you should have faith in humanity.

91
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,630
Jealousy is human nature.

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,630
But framing others

93
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,040
is something that is against human nature.

94
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,159
I don't know who in Liangcheng Law Firm

95
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,190
did that.

96
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,450
Madam Mei.

97
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,510
Could it be Han?

98
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,000
No way.

99
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,730
I do dislike him.

100
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
But in our life,

101
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,390
people you hate

102
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,510
are not necessarily bad guys.

103
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,120
So,

104
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
are you officially entrusting us with the job?

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,510
No.

106
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,310
I just hope you and Qiu Hua

107
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,480
can investigate it in private.

108
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,430
Leave the rest

109
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,110
to me.

110
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,440
Congratulations.

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Thank you for coming.

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,030
Happy wedding.

113
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,720
Bye. Bye.

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,270
Ms. Luo, did you have a good time?

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,909
Of course.

116
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,549
So,

117
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,630
I'll leave Qiu Hua to you.

118
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,080
You must take good care of her.

119
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,390
If you don't treat her well,

120
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,320
I won't let you off.

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,020
Did you hear her?

122
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,830
Do I dare not treat her well?

123
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,440
I just hope she won't bully me.

124
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Stop kidding.

125
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Something happened to Xia Shu's father.

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
So she couldn't come.

127
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,430
She gave her gift money to me.

128
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,540
I've given it to you.

129
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,910
Thank her for me.

130
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,790
Never mind. I'm leaving. Bye.

131
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,720
Take care.

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,200
Okay.

133
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,080
One's marriage...

134
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,760
Thank you.

135
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,540
Qiu Hua.

136
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,080
This is our director.

137
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,960
Nice to meet you.

138
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,720
Congratulations.

139
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Thank you for coming.

140
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,200
Not bad.

141
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,720
Thank you.

142
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,670
Congratulations.

143
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm leaving.

144
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,910
Let me see you off.

145
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,510
No need. Thanks.

146
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,720
Why was I so stupid?

147
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,320
Why would I trust those two lawyers?

148
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,720
They told me

149
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,790
they could help you.

150
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,160
So I sold the house

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,960
and gave all my money to them.

152
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,870
I gave them two million yuan.

153
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,930
They said as long as you don't plead guilty,

154
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,320
they would let the court acquit you.

155
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,290
Who would have thought that after they took the money,

156
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,510
they did nothing to help us.

157
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,450
You ended up in jail.

158
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,170
They took my money and disappeared.

159
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,870
Xia Shu.

160
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,840
What's wrong?

161
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,910
Luo.

162
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,080
I don't want to live anymore.

163
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,390
Come on, sit down and talk to me.

164
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,200
What's wrong?

165
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,390
Is it because of your dad's matter?

166
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,960
I never thought something would happen to my dad.

167
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,790
I was not prepared at all

168
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,080
My house in Jingbei

169
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,600
was bought by him.

170
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,080
Now it's confiscated.

171
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,840
And my bank card is a supplementary card of his card.

172
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,270
The account has been frozen.

173
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,790
Now,

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,240
I don't even have a place to live.

175
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,670
And I have no money.

176
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
Although you are no longer a partner,

177
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,320
Mr. Tao insisted on you staying in the firm.

178
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,080
That means you didn't lose your job, right?

179
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
The law firm

180
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,670
pays you 5,000 yuan per month, right?

181
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,270
Only 5,000 yuan.

182
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,390
Actually 5,000 yuan is not bad.

183
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't you have another piece of property?

184
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,510
What property?

185
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,480
That luxury car.

186
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,200
Was it confiscated?

187
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,000
No.

188
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,550
I bought it with the commissions and bonuses

189
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,410
from handling cases when I was a partner.

190
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,680
Then the problem can be solved.

191
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
If you sell that car,

192
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
you'll get at least a million.

193
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,030
You'll have much money if you sell the car.

194
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,270
My ex-boyfriend took my car.

195
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
When my dad got into trouble,

196
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,240
he ran faster than anyone else.

197
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,630
Not only did he take my car,

198
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,480
but he withdrew all the money in my card.

199
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,310
I called him,

200
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,030
only to find that he changed his phone number.

201
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,870
Go find him.

202
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,390
Get the car back from him.

203
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,320
I tried, but he refused to return it to me.

204
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,620
Do you know where he works?

205
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,280
Yes.

206
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,320
He got the job

207
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,870
thanks to my dad's help.

208
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,870
He used to be your dad's secretary.

209
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,250
He must be involved

210
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,970
in what your dad did.

211
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,790
Think about what he got involved in.

212
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,360
Then go to his office

213
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,270
and stop him.

214
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,240
When you see him,

215
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,670
you ask him to return your car.

216
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,480
If he refuses, you tell him

217
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,670
you'll go to the discipline inspection commission

218
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,000
and tell the authorities

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,740
what he did.

220
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,390
I bet when he hears these words,

221
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,050
he will return the car to you.

222
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
That'll be so embarrassing.

223
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,550
He took away your car. He should be ashamed.

224
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,330
Why should you feel embarrassed?

225
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,240
Fine.

226
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,120
Xia Shu.

227
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,080
My apartment is small. If you don't mind,

228
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,720
you can stay at my place tonight.

229
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,390
But I have to make it clear.

230
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,000
You must get your car back.

231
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,370
Or I won't help you anymore.

232
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:48,880
Okay.

233
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,080
Victim, let me ask you again.

234
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,240
On the night of June 25 at Honghai Hotel,

235
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,630
you had sexual relationship

236
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,390
with the three accused consecutively.

237
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,080
Were you voluntary

238
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,580
or forced to do it?

239
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,550
Your testimony

240
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,960
is crucial to the investigation of the truth of the case.

241
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,610
Please think carefully before you answer.

242
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,030
Your Honor.

243
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,970
[Defendant Lawyer Yu Daliang]

244
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,240
The prosecutor is putting pressure on the victim.

245
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,240
Victim.

246
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,810
The court summoned you here

247
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,790
to find out the truth of what happened that night.

248
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,820
Please answer the questions honestly.

249
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,400
[Victim Yang Cuili]

250
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,000
Do not hide any truth or tell lies.

251
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,010
Now please tell the court

252
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,220
that night,

253
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,750
whether you were forced

254
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,370
to have sexual relationship with them.

255
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,880
[Defendant Wei Cheng]

256
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,480
Yes.

257
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,350
They raped me.

258
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,960
You obtained evidence yourself instead of

259
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,440
letting the prosecution do it?

260
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,900
You know as a criminal defense lawyer,

261
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,170
one can never get evidence themselves.

262
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,180
The risk is that the witness may retract their words

263
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,150
and turn against the lawyer.

264
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,960
But Yu and I

265
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,930
were too confident.

266
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,270
Without the involvement of the court and the police,

267
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,550
we met Yang Cuili in private.

268
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,680
Yang Cuili.

269
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,800
We have your signed testimony.

270
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,910
Why did you change your statement in court?

271
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,920
The defendant's lawyers forced me to say that.

272
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,160
They said that if I were to say it was rape,

273
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,150
the families of the three people would harm me.

274
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,410
They said if I say it's a trade,

275
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
they would give me some money.

276
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,020
I was so sacred so I changed my statement.

277
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,810
Victim.

278
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
There is an original video tape

279
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,680
of the process of us getting the evidence from you.

280
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,700
Do you want us to

281
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,900
play the video in court?

282
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,530
The day before the video was filmed,

283
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,390
you came to me and asked me to say those things.

284
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:28,880
You...

285
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,010
As soon as Yang Cuili testified,

286
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,760
I knew

287
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,480
our careers would end.

288
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,630
As expected,

289
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,080
as soon as the court was closed,

290
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,910
the police

291
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,630
investigated us

292
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,500
because we were suspected

293
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,790
of forcing the witness to give false testimony

294
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,800
and committing perjury.

295
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,830
I knew very well

296
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,810
that it was a malicious

297
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,110
and premeditated trap.

298
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,580
It was impossible for us not to fall into it.

299
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,420
[Qiu Hua]

300
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,160
What's wrong, bride?

301
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,840
Yingzi, were you discussing

302
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,600
Madam Mei's case with her today?

303
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,390
Yes.

304
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,550
Let me tell you.

305
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm still in the law firm.

306
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,380
I found the case file.

307
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,570
I think there are many doubts about this case.

308
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
The victim, Yang Cuili

309
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,580
was a prostitute.

310
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,960
Wei Cheng and others

311
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
called her through the foot-bathing spa.

312
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,840
They already agreed on the price when they arrived.

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
The three men and the one woman drank a lot.

314
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,720
After that, Yang Cuili followed them

315
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,790
to a hotel.

316
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Judging from the surveillance video,

317
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,240
though they four were drunk,

318
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,560
there was no sign of violence or threat.

319
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,150
Later, Yang Cuili

320
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,830
left the room on her own.

321
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,720
And three days later,

322
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,080
she reported the rape.

323
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,940
Yingzi.

324
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,070
Did Madam Mei ask us to help reverse the court decision of that case for her?

325
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,090
No.

326
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,270
She suspected that

327
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,030
someone framed her and her husband.

328
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,790
She just wants to know who that person is.

329
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,480
Since she didn't,

330
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,609
why are you spending so much time on that case?

331
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,510
For facts and justice.

332
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,310
If the original case is solved,

333
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,000
and there was evidence showing that they were framed,

334
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
the truth of the case of Madam Mei and her husband

335
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,560
will be found.

336
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,190
It's been ten years. It's a four-year sentence in that case.

337
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,200
The people involved were already released from prison long ago

338
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,640
and their lives have returned to normal.

339
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,280
Now you want to investigate the case again.

340
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,290
Who will benefit from it?

341
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,800
Don't say that.

342
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
Though they only had a four-year sentence,

343
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,270
the truth of case still matters.

344
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,920
Sister.

345
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,650
Besides, this...

346
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,070
All right, I'll hang up now.

347
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,860
I'll get back to work.

348
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,830
Anyway, don't be impulsive.

349
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,240
When I'm back to the firm,

350
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
we'll discuss it again.

351
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,460
Sister, what are you doing?

352
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,790
Our parents asked me to get you to the banquet.

353
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,430
They are waiting for you to start the banquet.

354
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go.

355
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,120
Mr. Chen, it's time to say goodbye.

356
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,620
Okay.

357
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,180
Okay.

358
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,760
Hope you can help us in the future.

359
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,160
Okay.

360
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,450
Bye.

361
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,550
Still busy?

362
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,270
Yes. Mr. Tao, you're still here.

363
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,200
What's the matter?

364
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,830
I just want to ask

365
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,720
whether there is any progress of Dahua's case?

366
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,200
Well.

367
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,460
I'm handling it these days.

368
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,370
[Wei Cheng]

369
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
What brings you here?

370
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,350
Ms. Fang said you and Qiu Hua turned the situation around

371
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,550
regarding Wang Jiumei's case today.

372
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,310
Congratulations.

373
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,770
We didn't turn the situation around.

374
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Actually, the court decision

375
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,360
of the first instance of her case was controversial.

376
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,200
The prosecutors and judges were actually

377
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,510
very sympathetic to Wang Jiumei when they knew her situation.

378
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,600
But the law is the law.

379
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,590
It was an armed defense and she caused the death.

380
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,920
It was indeed a serious crime.

381
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,830
We just did what we could do.

382
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,430
Anything else?

383
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,260
Okay, you continue. I'll close the door for you.

384
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,100
Okay, thank you.

385
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,010
Hello, Madam Mei.

386
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,800
I've read

387
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,510
the case file.

388
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,190
There are many doubts about the case.

389
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,240
If the truth of the case can be found,

390
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,510
maybe you can

391
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,360
apply for the lawyer's practicing certificate again.

392
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,620
Yingzi, ten years have passed

393
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,680
Everyone's life

394
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,110
is back to normal.

395
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,920
I don't want to reverse the court decision of the case.

396
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,650
I just want to know the truth.

397
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,010
Madam Mei.

398
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,920
If you really suspect

399
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,350
the person who framed you and Mr. Yu

400
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,640
was someone from Liangcheng Law Firm.

401
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,680
Can you sign

402
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,590
an agent agreement with me and Qiu Hua?

403
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,590
If you officially entrust this job

404
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,200
to us,

405
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,720
we'll do it in a big way.

406
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Let me think about it.

407
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,960
[Wei Cheng Rape Case]

408
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,750
I'm in the firm.

409
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,830
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

410
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,960
Good morning, Ms. Luo.

411
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,750
Good morning, Ms. Luo.

412
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,350
Ms. Luo, Mr. Tao

413
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,310
wants to see you.

414
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,960
Okay.

415
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,640
Morning, Ms. Luo.

416
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,510
Morning, Tian.

417
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,510
By the way,

418
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,350
throw away the coffee cup for me.

419
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,510
Thank you.

420
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,010
Come in.

421
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,960
Mr. Tao.

422
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,510
Is it about Dahua's case?

423
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,420
I'll submit it to you

424
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,610
before this weekend.

425
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,750
Come in. I have something to tell you.

426
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,490
Okay.

427
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,120
Close the door.

428
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,510
Go ahead.

429
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,640
On behalf of the firm,

430
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm going to inform you of something.

431
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,880
What is it?

432
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,830
Ma Lili reported your misbehaviors to the bar association.

433
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,340
You know that, right?

434
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,410
That was several months ago.

435
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,240
We explained everything to the firm

436
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,270
and the bar association.

437
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,970
In fact, it's just that Xia Shu sent an oral message.

438
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,790
It didn't cause any bad influence, right?

439
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,100
But Liangcheng Law Firm

440
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,660
always upholds professional ethics and the law

441
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,190
and has zero no tolerance for any violations of laws or regulations.

442
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,830
Recently, the firm

443
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,160
has been examining the way our lawyers practice.

444
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,240
We discussed this at the partner meeting.

445
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,920
And we have made a final decision.

446
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,120
What decision?

447
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
The firm has decided to suspend

448
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,000
you three from practicing.

449
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
During the suspension period,

450
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,840
you are not allowed to do any legal work.

451
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,700
In other words,

452
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,930
from this moment to the time when the case is over,

453
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,510
you three

454
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,760
have nothing to do Liangcheng Law Firm.

455
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,590
Well, Mr. Tao.

456
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,670
Xia Shu's father got into such big trouble.

457
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,660
But you managed to let Xia Shu continue to work in our firm.

458
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,440
Ma Lili's complaint is such a trivial matter.

459
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,590
I don't believe you made the decision because of that.

460
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,000
Have you been made a scapegoat for something?

461
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,410
You should find a better reason.

462
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,500
The decision is made according to the rules made by all our partners.

463
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,590
If you don't believe me, you can check the rules.

464
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,200
But if you don't accept it,

465
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,480
you can just leave.

466
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,480
Got it.

467
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,410
Then I quit.

468
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,350
Since you've made up your mind,

469
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,720
there are some things

470
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
I should tell you here.

471
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,030
The firm will conduct a risk evaluation

472
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,160
of the cases that are being handled and were handled by you three.

473
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,460
You need to cooperate.

474
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,410
Pack up your belongings

475
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,200
and leave the firm immediately.

476
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,330
Also,

477
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,890
your office computers are given by the firm.

478
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,410
You can't turn them on anymore

479
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,500
or copy any documents.

480
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,910
You must stop working on any of the cases you're handling

481
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,920
and you're not allowed to contact any clients

482
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,900
in private.

483
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,840
Otherwise,

484
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,440
you will be held liable.

485
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,310
No problem.

486
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,490
Qiu Hua and Xia Shu

487
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,760
also have to follow these rules.

488
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,610
Hello, Qiu Hua.

489
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm afraid your honeymoon trip has to be canceled.

490
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,660
You have to come back right away. Something happened.

491
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,690
The law firm is forcing us to leave anyway.

492
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
I said I quit.

493
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,440
Come back quickly.

494
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,170
I can't explain it clearly on the phone. Bye.

495
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,470
Quanquan...

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,550
Something is wrong

497
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,400
with the case I'm working on.

498
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,440
I might need to go back to the office.

499
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,550
But we've booked the hotel.

500
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,390
And mom and dad are back now.

501
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,720
We have to go back

502
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,000
to entertain those guests.

503
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
Yes, I know.

504
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,280
But it's an emergency.

505
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,670
I need to go to the law firm

506
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,040
and see what's going on.

507
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,900
I'll tell you about it later.

508
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,540
Wait...

509
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,350
Quanquan.

510
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,160
How about we

511
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,550
get new tickets so we can leave this night?

512
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,790
Then when will you come back?

513
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
I don't know.

514
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,070
I understand.

515
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,960
Let's get new tickets now.

516
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,670
Sorry.

517
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,740
Don't be.

518
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,790
Be calm.

519
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,630
Hello, Mr. Wang. Long time no see.

520
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,030
How have you been?

521
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,900
Have you used up the green tea

522
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,070
that I gave you last time?

523
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,030
Winter solstice is coming soon.

524
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,730
New Year is coming soon.

525
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,790
Let's have a meal tomorrow.

526
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,590
I'll bring you new tea.

527
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,920
I've got another batch of good tea.

528
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,610
I'll wait for your reply, Mr. Wang.

529
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,200
Hello.

530
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,740
Mr. Wei.

531
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,710
Ms. Luo.

532
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,280
Tian.

533
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,480
Who are you sending messages to?

534
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,310
What's up?

535
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm here to see you off.

536
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,520
Okay.

537
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,510
I have some personal belongings to pack.

538
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,750
How about this?

539
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,200
Come back in ten minutes.

540
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,680
The boss said

541
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,900
I must be here

542
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,750
when you pack.

543
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,550
Tian.

544
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,390
You said "your boss" so many times.

545
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,130
What do you mean?

546
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,280
Isn't it enough for you to lick Han Zhitong's ass?

547
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,150
Yingzi, how many times have I told you not to be so emotional?

548
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,210
With your temper,

549
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,810
how can you take cases in the future?

550
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,270
Since we were master and disciple,

551
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,080
I asked the HR department not to come.

552
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,770
So I let Tian come.

553
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,410
So what, Director Han?

554
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,830
I should be grateful to you?

555
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,030
How about I kowtow to you?

556
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,350
No, no, no.

557
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,640
That's too much.

558
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,640
I can't accept it.

559
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,770
I'm here to thank you.

560
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,580
These are the cases originally handled by you three.

561
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,460
This case is worth 200,000.

562
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,550
This 500,000.

563
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,750
300,000.

564
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,310
This 450,000.

565
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,750
This 550,000.

566
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,640
The cases are worth 2 million.

567
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,070
After you leave, these cases will all be mine.

568
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,550
How come they'll all be yours.

569
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,590
We took all these cases.

570
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,750
Why should they be yours?

571
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,880
But they signed the agent contracts with Liangcheng Law Firm.

572
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,720
The firm has informed the clients

573
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,090
of the decision to suspend you from practicing.

574
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,430
Next, better lawyers will be sent

575
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,750
to serve them.

576
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,290
Tian is the better lawyer?

577
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,970
I am.

578
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,750
Ms. Luo.

579
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,110
So from now on,

580
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,340
you can't contact any of the clients.

581
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,280
What are you doing?

582
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,630
What are you doing?

583
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,350
That's enough.

584
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,350
Don't go too far.

585
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,680
Who is going too far?

586
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,590
Did the firm allow you to touch my phone?

587
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,510
Stay away from my phone.

588
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,920
Or I'll call the police right away.

589
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,660
Tian.

590
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,440
Those who achieve great things don't care about trifles.

591
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,790
We've got the cases.

592
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,540
There's no hurry.

593
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,400
Let her contact the clients.

594
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,720
-Let’s see who’s with her.
-Are you done?

595
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,970
Yes.

596
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,750
Take your time. Take your time.

597
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,460
Please enjoy the warmth

598
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,100
of this office for the last time.

599
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,950
Shame on you.

600
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,880
And you, why are you still standing here? Get out.

601
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,280
Help yourself.

602
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
They finally left.

603
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,360
They've been kicked out.

604
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,860
They've been kicked out.

605
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
That's so great.

606
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,680
Ms. Qiu.

607
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,550
Mr. Tao wants to see you.

608
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,640
What happened?

609
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,160
Hush.

610
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,830
Wait a minute.

611
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,590
Wait.

612
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,720
Tian, we need to go out.

613
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,160
How about you wait at the door?

614
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,400
It's okay. You can go.

615
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,160
Then compensate us if any of our stuff is lost.

616
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,070
Well.

617
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,680
What's going on?

618
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,260
I don't know.

619
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,400
Tao Zheng suddenly suspended us from practicing when I came to work.

620
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,870
Didn't he tell you the reason?

621
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,310
He said it was because Ma Lili

622
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,000
reported us to the bar association.

623
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,720
Now we are suspended and our salaries are withheld.

624
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,350
They forced us to stop handling cases

625
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,270
and won't assign new jobs to us.

626
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,000
It's like they have fired us.

627
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,260
The oral message matter has nothing to do with us.

628
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,680
Xia Shu did it alone.

629
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,350
Why should we get punished for what she did?

630
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,270
But she was indeed

631
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,400
a member of our team, right?

632
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,760
We shouldn't have let her join us.

633
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,960
I told you that.

634
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,360
I'll go talk to Fang Lihong.

635
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,830
What's the point of talking to her?

636
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,270
Does the decision

637
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,160
has nothing to do with Fang Lihong?

638
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,200
I think Fang Lihong

639
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,900
will at least get us fairly treated.

640
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,230
She should know

641
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,260
that thing has nothing to do with us.

642
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,880
Go with me.

643
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,190
Come in.

644
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,590
Ms. Fang.

645
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,270
Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu want to see you.

646
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,200
Let them in.

647
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,660
Okay.

648
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,830
Ms. Fang.

649
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,920
Luo Yingzi told me

650
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,570
that she and I were fired by our firm.

651
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,470
We didn't fire you.

652
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,900
You're suspended from practicing

653
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,930
Luo Yingzi

654
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,280
quit voluntarily.

655
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,450
If you want to quit too, that's okay.

656
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,200
The firm can write recommendation letters for you.

657
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,620
And you can work in other firms.

658
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,180
I don’t want to quit.

659
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,110
Ms. Fang, I don't understand.

660
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,110
Luo Yingzi told me

661
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,440
it's because in Xu Jianjian's case,

662
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,390
Xia Shu helped send an oral message for Ma Lili.

663
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,110
She did it alone.

664
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,320
It had nothing to do with me.

665
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,080
But you three are a team.

666
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,350
I never agreed to let her join my team.

667
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,590
The firm forced us to accept her.

668
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,070
Ms. Fang, you know that

669
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,210
because Xia Shu's father

670
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,110
had power and resources,

671
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,030
the firm let her be a partner when she just joined the firm.

672
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,000
Luo Yingzi and I are just two ordinary lawyers.

673
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,550
We couldn't stop her

674
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,640
from doing anything.

675
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,530
Besides,

676
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,780
the firm should take the main responsibility

677
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,520
for the oral message incident.

678
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,920
So you mean

679
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,180
you shouldn't be responsible for her personal behavior?

680
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Exactly.

681
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,500
How about you, Yingzi?

682
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,720
Are you willing to cut ties with Xia Shu?

683
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,000
Ms. Fang.

684
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,710
Actually, I didn't mean to come.

685
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,010
I also thought it's no use speaking to you here.

686
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,550
But since I'm here,

687
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,160
I want to tell you

688
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,490
I will find out the real reason.

689
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,180
And thank you very much.

690
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,220
I learned a lot from you. Thank you.

691
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,330
Good.

692
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,400
Yingzi, you know

693
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,340
I always admire you.

694
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,130
Though you leave Liangcheng Law Firm today,

695
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,440
I'll take it as your graduation from Liangcheng Law Firm.

696
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,930
Now you can purse your career all by yourself.

697
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,270
But remember,

698
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,270
the world is small.

699
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,400
In the future,

700
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,750
don't forget

701
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,550
that Liangcheng Law Firm also taught you a lot.

702
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,880
I won't.

703
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,110
If I become successful,

704
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,870
I will repay you and Liangcheng Law Firm.

705
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,400
My way to repay you

706
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,810
is to defeat you

707
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,380
and Liangcheng Law Firm.

708
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,060
I look forward to it.

709
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,810
Bye.

710
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,070
It seems

711
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,500
your thoughts are different from Luo Yingzi's.

712
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,190
How about this?

713
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,030
If you openly admit

714
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,310
that the whole thing

715
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,640
is only Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu's responsibility,

716
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,030
and that it has nothing to do with you,

717
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,330
I'll let the firm resume your job immediately.

718
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,020
What do you think?

719
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,440
I always think

720
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,120
you're a fastidious girl

721
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,800
who remains calm when encountering problems.

722
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,170
Of course, you are also one of

723
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,170
the indispensable rising young talents in Liangcheng Law Firm.

724
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,730
So,

725
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,650
I hope

726
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,000
you can make the right choice.

727
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,970
Let's go.

728
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,370
Didn't you say you don't want to leave?

729
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Stop packing.

730
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,270
We can't keep any client if we continue to pack.

731
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,790
Let's go.

732
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,070
I called Xia Shu twice.

733
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,790
But she didn't answer.

734
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,020
I don't know where she is.

735
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,890
Does she need you to worry about her?

736
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,480
We ended up like this all because of her.

737
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,720
Since it's so embarrassing,

738
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,340
let's go out with our heads up.

739
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,340
See you.

740
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,400
We are not allowed to use our computers.

741
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,020
We are not allowed to take the case files.

742
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,480
No one uses computers to take away the files now.

743
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,090
I contacted many of our clients

744
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
through WeChat today.

745
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,300
They were all beating around the bush.

746
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,080
Let's leave right away. Let's grasp every second to keep our clients.

747
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,300
We'll keep as many clients as we can.

748
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,470
I've been working here for so many years.

749
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,580
How can I leave like this?

750
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,720
We're only Level 2 lawyers.

751
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,080
Who will employ us if we leave here?

752
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,550
I was so useless

753
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,530
that I let them see my weaknesses.

754
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,840
In life when we encounter difficulties,

755
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,820
we can only be saved by ourselves.

756
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,240
Xue.

757
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,000
I just left. You started to miss me?

758
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,230
Wait a minute.

759
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,310
Sun.

You're so sweet.

768
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,490
Listen, brother.

769
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,920
Those incapable men

770
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,070
are controlling Dazheng Law Firm.

771
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,770
I felt bored when working here.

772
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
There is no hope there.

773
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,820
How about you quit and join Liangcheng with me?

774
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
It's a big firm after all.

775
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,230
So you've arrived.

776
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,250
How is it?

777
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,510
I've arrived.

778
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,290
It feels weird.

779
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,550
Looks like something happened.

780
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,630
Shuo.

781
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,050
I really admire your keen affection for her.

782
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,290
To pursue her,

783
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,620
you even quit your job and joined her firm.

784
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,000
So your love for Luo Yingzi

785
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,150
is real.

786
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,590
Now you believe I truly love her.

787
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,670
I'll show you how persistent I can be.

788
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,790
See how I can get her.

789
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,760

790

Hello, Ms. Fang.

792
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,760
I had to go. Talk later.

794
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,350
Coming.

Welcome.

796
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,000
Ms. Fang.

797
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,710
Mr. Chen.

798
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,710
Mr. Tao, let me give you a hug.

799
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Thank you.

805
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,690

No problem.

813
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,550
Zheng.

814
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,630
Ms. Fang.

815
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,070
Take Mr. Chen

816
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,360
to his office.

817
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,920
Okay.

818
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,030
I look forward to working with you.

819
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,880
Me, too.

820
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,780
I'll go to my office now.

821
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,550
-Thank you. Let’s go.
-Mr. Chen, this way please.

822
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,730
Mr. Chen is here. Haven't you finished cleaning?

823
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,020
Almost done.

824
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,650
Mr. Chen, are you satisfied with this office?

825
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,560
Yes.

826
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,440
Are you sure this is my office?

827
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,360
Yes.

828
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,230
It should be ready soon.

829
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,540
Okay, thank you, Ms. Zheng.

830
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,630
Mr. Chen,

831
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
We're done cleaning.

832
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,590
Someone will take away the left items later.

833
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
Here's the key.

834
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Wait. Wait.

835
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,920
I remember you.

836
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,100
You're Han Zhitong's assistant, right?

837
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,640
Weren't we opponents in court once?

838
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,920
We met in court.

839
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,350
Yes.

840
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,020
Well,

841
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,770
I'm really sorry about the earphone thing.

842
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,710
Sir.

843
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,320
What's the thing that just fell off from your bag?

844
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,530
Is it a recording device?

845
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,840
The court forbids anyone

846
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,590
from bringing recording devices into the court.

847
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,880
This is really just an earphone.

848
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,670
I hope you can let bygones be bygones.

849
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,900
We'll be colleagues from now on.

850
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
Hope you can help me in the future.

851
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,140
Don't say that.

852
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,730
We are counting on you

853
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
to help us earn money.

854
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,880
Anything else?

855
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,630
I have a question.

856
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,840
Didn't this office use to be Luo Yingzi's?

857
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,990
Why is it mine now?

858
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,990
She was fired by the firm today

859
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,770
She got fired?

860
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,340
She got fired?

861
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,320
How come?

862
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,910
Because you've joined us.

863
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,440
She is replaced by you now.

864
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,230
I have something else to do. I have to go.

865
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,840
Go ahead.

866
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,670
Go ahead, Mr. Tian.

867
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,370
What’s going on?

868
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,560
[Liangcheng Law Firm]

869
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,550
Everyone.

870
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,830
Our new colleague Chen Shuo bought us coffees.

871
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

872
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,320
You're welcome.

873
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,100
This is my first time to be here.

874
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,230
I just joined this team.

875
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,800
I'll have to ask you for help in the future.

876
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,230
Hope you'll be wiling to help me.

877
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,030
Thank you.

878
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,840
Please help me give out the coffees to everyone.

879
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,010
Hello, everyone.

880
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,280
Tian...

881
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,000
Help me give out the coffees.

882
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,370
What's wrong?

883
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,370
Are you mad at me?

884
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,320
No.

885
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,880
This is?

886
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,890
A gift for you.

887
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
We got to know each other through that legal battle.

888
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,880
Didn't I mention it this morning?

889
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm sorry about that earphone thing.

890
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,230
Aren't your wired earphones damaged?

891
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,920
I bought you a pair of wireless earphones.

892
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,030
A small gift for you.

893
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,530
No, Mr. Chen, this is too expensive.

894
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,440
I can't accept it.

895
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,110
Don't say that. You have to accept them.

896
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,800
I said I'm sorry.

897
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,620
So I need to compensate you.

898
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,680
We used to work in different firms.

899
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,950
We worked for different clients.

900
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,180
We're in the same firm now.

901
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,630
Let's be good colleagues from now on.

902
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,740
Let's be good buddies.

903
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,730
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

904
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,840
Mr. Chen.

905
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,940
I was a little rude there just now.

906
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,590
You know.

907
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,230
A colleague just left.

908
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,000
So I felt bad.

909
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,990
I understand.

910
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,120
If you need anything,

911
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,280
just let me know.

912
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,030
I may not be very capable.

913
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,760
But I can run errands for you.

914
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,070
You're so modest.

915
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,030
So one former colleague

916
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,300
of yours got fired?

917
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,600
Not one. Three.

918
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,830
Three people were fired.

919
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,710
Who are they?

920
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,480
Who else can they be?

921
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,590
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu and Ms. Xia.

922
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,880
Why did they get fired?

923
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,390
I don't know about the details.

924
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,210
The superiors suddenly made the decision.

925
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,400
Fang Lihong

926
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,630
liked Luo Yingzi a lot.

927
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,030
She asked us young lawyers to learn from her.

928
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,190
But somehow,

929
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,070
all they three suddenly got fired.

930
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,690
There must be a reason.

931
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,760
I really have no idea.

932
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
At the case meeting...

933
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,030
Why aren't you working? Stop gossiping.

934
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,440
Mr. Chen.

935
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,190
Let me give it to him.

936
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:45,830
I took a sip of it.

937
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,570
It's okay.

938
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,230
Have some coffee, Mr. Han.

939
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,150
Okay.

940
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,880
How are you?

941
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,350
Welcome.

942
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,280
I heard you were coming.

943
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,090
But we didn't organize a welcoming party.

944
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,680
And you just came and keep a low profile.

945
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,390
Our law firm is so big.

946
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,360
The relationships here are complicated.

947
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,280
If I came in an eye-catching manner,

948
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,800
people will get jealous.

949
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,400
So you keep a low profile.

950
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,150
But there are formalities I can't skip.

951
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,800
Mr. Han, look. Let me show my respect and bow to you.

952
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,360
You should bow to them.

953
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,320
I've already done that.

954
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,670
Okay, come with me.

955
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,110
Okay.

956
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,840
Let's talk in my office. Your office?

957
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,550
Okay.

958
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,190
Tian.

959
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,670
Get a copy of that.

960
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,480
Okay.

961
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,550
Tian.

962
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,560
I can tell

963
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,740
you're a big shot in this firm.

964
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,000
Bro.

965
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,920
Can you give me some clients?

966
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,710
Let me earn some money.

967
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,070
Otherwise, I'll have no money for food.

968
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,240
You really have a sharp tongue.

969
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,040
When you die,

970
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,320
let me have your sharp tongue.

971
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,440
I'll make good use of it.

972
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,030
Fine.

973
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,000
I'll let you have my tongue.

974
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,860
And you give me your brain.

975
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,520
What's good about my brain?

976
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,200
You're really smart.

977
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,880
Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua are really annoying.

978
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,590
And you managed to kick them out.

979
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,150
If I offend you and make you unhappy,

980
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,510
don't kick me out.

981
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,280
Okay?

982
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,070
I'm begging you.

983
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,000
Chen Shuo, you misunderstood.

984
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,510
It has nothing to do with me.

985
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,510
Really?

986
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,530
I heard rumors.

987
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,440
Who is spreading rumors?

988
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,030
It has nothing to do with me.

989
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,510
That's the decision made at the partner meeting.

990
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,230
Partner meeting?

991
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,200
Are you a partner?

992
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,880
You're bluffing.

993
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,360
But I didn't participate in that meeting.

994
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,230
I'm also curious

995
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,230
why that suddenly happened. They were doing well yesterday.

996
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,960
You...

997
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Isn't it normal for a lawyer

998
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,710
to quit and join another firm?

999
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,510
You have now joined Liangcheng Law Firm.

1000
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,000
You're so quick-witted.

1001
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,110
I can't get any news

1002
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,930
from you.

1003
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,840
It's normal to get a new employer.

1004
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,190
We were rivals before.

1005
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,230
Now we are

1006
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,480
colleagues.

1007
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,590
We're comrades now.

1008
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,770
In the future, we will work together

1009
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,070
in Liangcheng Law Firm.

1010
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,150
We'll have a bright future.

1011
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,050
Alright.

1012
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,070
I'll go visit the bosses.

1013
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,550
Okay.

1014
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,920
It's interesting today. Look.

1015
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,960
Our leather shoes are in the same color.

1016
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,000
Our black trousers are also in a similar style.

1017
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,030
Why is there such a coincidence?

1018
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,750
It means we're like family.

1019
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,070
We are the same.

1020
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,590
So give me some clients.

1021
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,480
I'll keep it in mind.

1022
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,310
If you help me,

1023
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,360
I'm not good enough to be your leader.

1024
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,300
You can do whatever you want to do in our firm.

1025
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,290
You just need to give the commissions you earn in due amount to the firm on time.

1026
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,150
You're being really realistic

1027
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,230
and straightforward.

1028
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,820
But I like leaders like you.

1029
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,710
With a leader like you,

1030
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,840
we can get Liangcheng Law Firm to continue to thrive.

1031
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,930
Saying these beautiful words, you must want something from me.

1032
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,480
By the way, Mr. Tao.

1033
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,840
You just said something about my office.

1034
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,760
I remember that office

1035
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,320
used to be Luo Yingzi's office, right?

1036
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,130
Where is she?

1037
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,070
Chen Shuo.

1038
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,930
You didn't come to my office to see me,

1039
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,030
but to ask about her?

1040
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,920
You care so much about her?

1041
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,880
Who cares about her?

1042
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,590
I'm here to pay my respects to you, Mr. Tao.

1043
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,270
I'm just curious.

1044
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,350
Liangcheng Law Firm is not good enough

1045
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,210
for her.

1046
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,060
So she quit and decided to join a new firm.

1047
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,810
No.

1048
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:48,940
She got fired.

1049
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,070
Why?

1050
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,970
I couldn't

1051
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,070
make the decision.

1052
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,630
I see. Ms. Fang made the decision.

1053
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,320
That's strange.

1054
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,280
I remember

1055
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,320
Ms. Fang used to like Luo Yingzi very much.

1056
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,030
She always protected her.

1057
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,130
How come she fired her?

1058
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,940
Did they have a serious conflict?

1059
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,110
Chen Shuo, don't play tricks on me.

1060
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,600
I didn't say anything.

1061
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,630
I don't know either.

1062
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,670
The firm fired us three.

1063
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,280
How come I didn't see Xia Shu in the firm today?

1064
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,070
I don't know.

1065
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,670
I saw her yesterday.

1066
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,440
She's having a hard time now.

1067
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,880
You still pity her at this time?

1068
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,530
Finally, she got us into the trouble.

1069
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,710
She's really a good-for-nothing. She's such a stupid teammate.

1070
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,150
I told you

1071
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,600
that we couldn't let her join us.

1072
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,670
But you didn't listen.

1073
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
What can she do

1074
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,400
when she's with us?

1075
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,440
She can't do anything.

1076
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,710
She only caused trouble for us.

1077
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,480
Now,

1078
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,630
you lost your job because of her.

1079
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,880
Why are you still defending her?

1080
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,610
Are you done venting your anger?

1081
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,890
I understand your feelings.

1082
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,070
But Qiu Hua,

1083
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,960
do you really think the three of us were fired

1084
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,230
because of that?
