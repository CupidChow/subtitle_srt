3
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,330
Go ahead, I'm listening.

4
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,440
What's wrong with Wei?

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,070
I'm asking you.

6
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,440
Tell me, what's wrong with Wei?

7
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,330
She

8
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,180
doesn't understand anything.

9
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,950
I have to teach her everything from scratch.

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,039
I don't get what's up with

11
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,190
college grads these days.

12
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,920
I mean, she couldn't even write a simple speech.

13
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,900
You know, today,

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,450
she wrote a speech for our division chief.

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,790
It was sent back with a scolding.

16
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,260
She was crying her eyes out.

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,190
So I had no choice but to fix it for her,

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
tweaking every little detail.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,030
I had to explain everything to her step by step—

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,740
that's why I'm still stuck here.

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh, Wei is a woman?

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,120
Since when

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,829
did you become such a mentor?

24
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,730
Well, that makes sense.

25
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,400
Back at our workplace,

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
I used to call everyone teacher.

27
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,079
Now it's different.

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,950
I've become a teacher too.

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,710

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,110
yet I'm only getting a little over three hundred million back.

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400

Mr. Wan has hidden a large amount of assets

165
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,390
Some time ago, his daughter

My classmate said

177
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,590
it's worth much more than gold.

178
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,900
It's used for high-end military-industrial products—

179
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,480
an entire shipload worth

180
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,570

181
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,790

now that Wanhe's bankruptcy reorganization has been settled,

185
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,590

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,220

the termination agreement was signed?

375
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,220
It was after.

376
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,000
Look,

377
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,460
the email has a timestamp.

378
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,320
It clearly shows it was after the termination agreement was signed.

379
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,820
Mr. Xu, what should I do now?

380
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,750
Xia Shu,

381
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,120
you're also a lawyer.

382
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,280
You understand the weight of this matter.

383
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,410
If this leaks,

384
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,560
it would be bad for us,

385
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,590
for me,

386
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,680
and for your firm as well, right?

387
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,590
I know.

388
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,320
That's why I rushed to tell you.

389
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,200
However, Mr. Xu,

390
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,900
we've already terminated the agreement with you.

391
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,580
This matter no longer concerns us.

392
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,570
But it's indeed unfavorable for you.

393
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,550
You're the representative of Dingxin, right?

394
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,420
How does this relate to me?

395
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,370
I just heard about it from you.

396
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,260
I reminded you before,

397
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,440
but you didn't take it seriously.

398
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,070
Xia Shu,

399
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,950
don't say things carelessly.

400
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,030
I'm not. I recorded it.

401
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,680
Mr. Xu,

402
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,530
I heard that Mr. Wan's daughter

403
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,180
graduated from UC Berkeley.

404
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,970
I have a classmate who also graduated from there.

405
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,690
Do you need me to ask her

406
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,110
to look into her?

407
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,480
Investigate his daughter?

408
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,790
That's not necessary.

409
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,680
If we look into it,

410
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,400
we can get a better grasp of Wanhe's assets.

411
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,380
But it will cost a bit.

412
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:38,980
How much?

413
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,050
Not too much.

414
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,700
It won't bankrupt Zhuoyue Law Firm.

415
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,740
It's not needed for now.

416
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,430
Why were you recording this?

417
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,920
I have a bad memory. I always forget things,

418
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,860
so I record every meeting.

419
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,240
Mr. Xu, I've already told you

420
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,680
about this.

421
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,850
Think it over carefully.

422
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,740
I really have to go now.

423
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,510
My boyfriend is waiting for me downstairs.

424
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,020
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

425
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,470
Mr. Xu, Xia Shu is leaving?

426
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,750
You told me she is a naive and silly girl?

427
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,270
That's right.

428
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,580
Look at her—

429
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,980
isn't she just naive and silly?

430
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,370
You're the naive and silly one!

431
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,960
Mr. Xu, I...

432
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,520
Get out.

433
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,510
Ms. Zhang

434
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,840
gave me a detailed rundown

435
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,220
of how outstanding each of his three ex-wives was.

436
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,210
Why does he

437
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,590
keep their photos on his desk?

438
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,410
To remind himself he's been divorced three times?

439
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,940
No.

440
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,440
To remind himself he's split his assets three times.

441
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,330
When I hit 40,

442
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,270
I'm going to plaster

443
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,240
a whole wall with pictures of my ex-boyfriends—

444
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,160
just to remind myself

445
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,350
how popular I used to be.

446
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,310
Come on, Xia Shu.

447
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,470
Let me record

448
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
that last part you just said.

449
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,110
I'll send it to Mr. Hao.

450
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,940
That would be his honor.

451
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,190
Luo,

452
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,240
what do we do about our report?

453
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,920
It's like an atomic bomb.

454
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,470
You know its weight too, right?

455
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,590
Of course.

456
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,400
Why else would we spend so much money on it?

457
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,110
If this gets out,

458
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,650
it won't just throw Zhuoyue Law Firm into chaos,

459
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
but it'll drag Liangcheng Law Firm down with it.

460
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,920
Luo,

461
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,640
you're not still attached to Liangcheng Law Firm, are you?

462
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,110
What about you?

463
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,790
They did treat me well back then,

464
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,860
but that was because of my dad.

465
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,160
After he got into trouble,

466
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,510
they cut ties without hesitation.

467
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,250
Comrades,

468
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,940
the court has issued a hearing notice.

469
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,830
Chen Shuo's case is going to trial.

470
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,000
Alright, I'll call Chen Shuo

471
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,270
and Mr. Xue

472
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,220
to have them come over.

473
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,710
Okay, I've already bought the food.

474
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,110
We don't need to worry too much

475
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,860
about the joint account issue, right?

476
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,680
With your abilities,

477
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,740
it should be easy to win.

478
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,480
Indeed,

479
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,460
but it might leave a bad impression on the judge.

480
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,280
It's human nature.

481
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,020
if he can't even understand that,

482
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,210
how should I put it...

483
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,190
Moral perfectionism?

484
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,060
Exactly.

485
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,590
But what worries me is Xu Zhuo.

486
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,160
He's become so unscrupulous lately

487
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,480
that he's capable of anything.

488
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,510
So I think

489
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,790
we still need to be fully prepared.

490
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
If I were Xu Zhuo,

491
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,590
there's no way I'd admit in court

492
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,360
that Mingshan just wants to evade payment.

493
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,680
That's right.

494
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,960
They'll argue that the agency fees should be paid by Party A,

495
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,090
according to the agreement,

496
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,750
so the money

497
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,640
should first go into Party A's account

498
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,670
before being allocated.

499
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,110
They'll make a big deal out of this point.

500
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,640
So if we want to win,

501
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,550
we have to prove that

502
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,660
Party A intended to cheat the lawyers from the very beginning.

503
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,040
But right now, we lack concrete evidence for that.

504
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,890
[Xu Zhuo]

505
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,830
Why is he calling me now?

506
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
Hello, Mr. Xu.

507
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,110
Yingzi.

508
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
Are you available?

509
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,390
I'd like to talk to you.

510
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,260
Is there really anything left for us to discuss?

511
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm right downstairs from your office.

512
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,960
I want to talk about Chen Shuo's case.

513
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,590
Downstairs?

514
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,680
What should I do?

515
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,090
Go ahead.

516
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,150
See what he's up to.

517
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,460
Okay, I'm coming down.

518
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,920
I'll go put on a coat.

519
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,970
He just won't go away.

520
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,700
He's so annoying.

521
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,900
Thank you.

522
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,520
I know

523
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,560
you don't want to see me.

524
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,750
Just get to the point.

525
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm busy.

526
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,300
A lot has happened

527
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,680
lately,

528
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,020
and there have been some misunderstandings between us.

529
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,110
I wanted to clear things up in person.

530
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,520
There's nothing to clear up.

531
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,420
You came to talk about the case, didn't you?

532
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,240
Mingshan is determined to sue Chen Shuo.

533
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,720
As their legal representative,

534
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,190
I have to act according to my client's wishes.

535
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,240
I hope you can understand that.

536
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,110
We're going to court tomorrow.

537
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,920
Don't you think it's a little ridiculous

538
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,250
to bring this up now?

539
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,050
I don't want to be your enemy.

540
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,750
I can talk to

541
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,550
Mingshan Group

542
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,130
and persuade them to withdraw the lawsuit tomorrow morning.

543
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,350
But in return, I hope you won't make things difficult

544
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,710
for me in other matters.

545
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,240
Can you do that?

546
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,220
Are you talking about Wanhe?

547
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,240
I never expected

548
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,840
you to go behind your current client's back

549
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,750
and secretly negotiate with the opposing counsel

550
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,290
over another case.

551
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,350
Does Mingshan Group

552
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,970
know you're doing this?

553
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,900
Yingzi,

554
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,250
you know once those things are exposed,

555
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,740
many people will be implicated.

556
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,990
How about this?

557
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,420
You name your terms.

558
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,300
Whether it's withdrawing the lawsuit

559
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,260
or asking for agency fees,

560
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,670
as long as it's within my power,

561
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,430
you can ask for anything.

562
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,960
I know

563
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,480
you're a kind person.

564
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,160
Yes, I am a kind person,

565
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,430
But I'm also someone with principles,

566
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,830
so not everything

567
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,040
can be negotiated.

568
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,840
Mr. Xu,

569
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,240
I find it pathetic on your behalf.

570
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,870
You have absolutely no bottom line.

571
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,400
As for today,

572
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,990
I'll pretend you were never here.

573
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,870
Yingzi.

574
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,510
Hello?

575
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,200
Mr. Han.

576
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,260
This way, please.

577
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,390
Mr. Han, Lawyer Xu Zhuo is here.

578
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,830
Mr. Han.

579
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,710
You can go ahead.

580
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,640
Okay.

581
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,400
Mr. Han.

582
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,830
Mr. Han.

583
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,380
Mr. Xu,

584
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,040
I can't believe you actually came to see me.

585
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,230
Here, please have a seat.

586
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,400
Mr. Han,

587
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,530
I'll get straight to the point.

588
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,910
My lawsuit against Chen Shuo

589
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,850
on behalf of Mingshan Group

590
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,300
is solely about his personal actions

591
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,380
and is by no means intended as an offense to you.

592
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
You can rest assured about that.

593
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,110
I'm not worried.

594
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,720
You don't need to

595
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,140
offend me.

596
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,480
Mr. Han,

597
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,220
the current situation

598
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,070
is not what my client, Mr. Sun,

599
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,350
wants to see.

600
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,120
He never intended to

601
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,520
withhold your agency fees.

602
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,120
This was entirely Chen Shuo stirring up trouble,

603
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,800
which ended up implicating you.

604
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,680
Here,

605
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,620
on behalf of Mr. Sun, I want to make it clear that

606
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,710
the portion of the agency fees that rightfully belongs to you

607
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,700
will be transferred to your account as soon as possible.

608
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,530
That's great!

609
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,570
Thank you so much.

610
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,480
Well...

611
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,440
But...

612
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,380
there's no such thing as a free lunch, is there?

613
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,880
Things can't be this easy.

614
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,140
What's the catch?

615
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,600
Mr. Han, you truly are a veteran.

616
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,790
I've already submitted a request to the court

617
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,090
for a witness to testify;

618
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,160
I'd like you to appear as a witness.

619
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,210
No, well...

620
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,230
Asking me to testify isn't...

621
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,430
The agency agreement

622
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,160
was signed by both of you.

623
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,680
The contract only states that

624
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,290
you're authorized to collect the enforcement funds,

625
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,540
but it does not grant you the right to distribute them.

626
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,620
Tomorrow in court,

627
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,240
all you need to do is truthfully tell

628
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,040
the judge what happened.

629
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,240
Mr. Han,

630
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,840
you're a law-abiding and ethical lawyer;

631
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,630
otherwise, you wouldn't have returned the money,

632
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,100
right?

633
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,400
Alright, I won't bother you any longer.

634
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,150
Thank you for your cooperation.

635
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,040
Goodbye.

636
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,320
Goodbye.

637
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,480
Let... Let me see you out.

638
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,170
No need.

639
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,010
Why are you looking at me?

640
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,590
Why are you so quiet today?

641
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,350
Normally, you're like a magpie,

642
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,880
chattering nonstop.

643
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,120
Maybe I'm just tired from all the meetings.

644
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,310
You're worried about Chen Shuo, aren't you?

645
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,960
We've already analyzed

646
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,700
his case thoroughly.

647
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,420
There's some risk,

648
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,400
but we have expert endorsement.

649
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,530
and the evidence is solid.

650
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,240
Xu Zhuo is unlikely to win.

651
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,030
I'm just afraid Xu Zhuo

652
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,450
might get desperate and pull some dirty tricks.

653
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,890
You know

654
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,940
he's out to ruin Chen Shuo.

655
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,800
You used to tell me to be more optimistic.

656
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,760
How come you're the pessimistic one now?

657
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,580
Don't worry, trust me.

658
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
It'll be fine, Yingzi.

659
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,770
I hope so.

660
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,920
What's going on with Quanquan?

661
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,620
I haven't seen him pick you up lately.

662
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,950
He's been busy with work recently.

663
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,160
That's not an excuse.

664
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,040
Next time I see him,

665
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,240
I'll have a word with him.

666
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,970
Why do you want to talk to him?

667
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,110
This is fine.

668
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,490
We're both busy with our own things.

669
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,960
It also lessens my guilt a bit.

670
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,430
I really admire you two.

671
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,910
This isn't a marriage;

672
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,590
it's just a partnership.

673
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,280
We're really doing fine.

674
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,460
Don't worry about us.

675
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,090
You'd better focus on tomorrow's case.

676
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,850
If we end up with a

677
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,800
strict judge,

678
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,340
there's still some risk.

679
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,520
Who is it? Can you check for me?

680
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,140
[Han Zhitong]

681
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,310
Han?

682
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,510
Why is he calling me at this hour?

683
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,750
Should I pick up?

684
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,650
Yes, hold on. Let me get my earphones.

685
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,030
Hello, Director Han.

686
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,830
It's so late. What's the matter?

687
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,120
I heard Chen Shuo's case

688
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,239
is going to court tomorrow. Is that right?

689
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,429
Yes, it is.

690
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,510
You two were both representing the same case,

691
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
yet tomorrow he's

692
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,330
going to court alone,

693
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,389
possibly facing criminal charges,

694
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,340
while you walk away clean.

695
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,800
Director Han,

696
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,690
you must be feeling pretty pleased with yourself right now?

697
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,190
Pleased?

698
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,780
Well, if that's how you see it...

699
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
I...

700
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,040
Why don't you come over to my office?

701
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,969
I'm in the office.

702
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,360
Director Han, you're quite something,

703
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,710
still working overtime at this hour,

704
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,920
so dedicated.

705
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm worried.

706
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,770
My partner is caught up in a criminal case.

707
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,010
How can I not be concerned?

708
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,590
If you're so worried, go find Chen Shuo.

709
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,620
Let him appreciate your kindness.

710
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,600
Why are you calling me?

711
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,510
I'm calling you...

712
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,230
Aren't you Chen Shuo's agent lawyer?

713
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,050
Right?

714
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
I'm calling you... Who else should I call?

715
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,130
I have something to discuss with you.

716
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,480
It's up to you whether you come or not.

717
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,280
Is he asking me to go there now?

718
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,710
What do you think he's up to?

719
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,300
We know much about him.

720
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,870
But why does he insist on me going over there?

721
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,710
To show concern for Chen Shuo, I guess.

722
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,030
Forget it.

723
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,100
I don't want to deal with him.

724
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,520
My head hurts.

725
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,030
Just ignore him.

726
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,400
This court is now in session

727
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,160
for the case of the private prosecutor,

728
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,170
Mingshan Mining Group,

729
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,810
accusing the defendant, Chen Shuo, of the crime of embezzlement.

730
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,320
First,

731
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,250
I ask the court

732
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,080
to allow me to express my respect for the defendant,

733
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,850
as he is a lawyer and a fellow professional.

734
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,110
That being said,

735
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,330
why are we filing a criminal private prosecution against him

736
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,380
and demanding that he bear criminal responsibility?

737
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,410
As lawyers,

738
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,630
our mission

739
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,150
is to use our knowledge

740
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,970
to uphold the justice of the law,

741
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,050
not to act like the defendant in this case, Chen Shuo,

742
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,450
who knowingly violated the law

743
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,420
and brazenly committed a crime

744
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,030
for enormous personal gain.

745
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,770
This is a blatant trampling of legal justice

746
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,880
and a disgrace to the legal profession.

747
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,250
Chen Shuo not only personally shouldered

748
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,190
the enormous risks stipulated in the contract

749
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,200
but also secured a victory for Mingshan with the final judgment

750
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,060
serving as valid proof of debt

751
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,960
and enabling the partial realization of certain claims.

752
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,680
The defendant, Chen Shuo, displayed extreme malice

753
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,320
and arrogance.

754
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,910
Despite knowing he had no right

755
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,930
to dispose of Mingshan Group's assets—

756
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,010
let alone withdraw funds from the joint account—

757
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,000
he brazenly transferred and misappropriated them for personal gain,

758
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,790
even after Mingshan Group

759
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,110
repeatedly proposed amicable negotiations.

760
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,150
The private prosecutor, Mingshan Group, violated the contractual agreement

761
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,440
by unilaterally signing a settlement with Minghai Group.

762
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,000
Such conduct

763
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,550
has already constituted a breach of contract,

764
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,950
and the conditions

765
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,230
for full payment of agency  fees

766
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,280
to Liangcheng Law Firm

767
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,730
and Chen Shuo have been met.

768
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,410
If even such actions

769
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,990
cannot be regulated under the crime of misappropriation,

770
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,320
then what is the purpose of this criminal offense?

771
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,860
What is the purpose of

772
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,880
criminal law in punishing offenders and protecting the people?

773
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,900
Mingshan Group's actions

774
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,780
are not only an act of betrayal and opportunism

775
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,390
but also a complete disregard for contractual integrity.

776
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,120
Despite the public security authorities having already dropped the case,

777
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,030
they insist on filing a private criminal prosecution,

778
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,910
attempting to use public power for personal gain.

779
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,400
They are exploiting criminal litigation

780
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,340
to retaliate against a cooperative partner

781
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,600
who provided significant assistance during their time of great difficulty.

782
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,880
This conduct not only violates the most fundamental principles of goodwill

783
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,310
and shared values.

784
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,860
Their claims clearly should not receive the court's support.

785
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,390
Your Honor,

786
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,400
the core of this dispute

787
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,110
revolves around the agency fees.

788
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,750
I would like to specifically draw the court's attention to the fact that

789
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,750
whether the agency fees are in dispute

790
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,800
must not be used as a justification to deny

791
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,860
the illegality of Chen Shuo's possession of the funds in question.

792
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,090
Your Honor,

793
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,930
if not for Mingshan's prior breach of contract,

794
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,520
which caused the defendant significant distress,

795
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,710
he would not have resorted to self-help under urgent circumstances

796
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,070
to safeguard his legitimate interests.

797
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,030
Why else would Chen Shuo

798
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,440
retain the disputed funds?

799
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,290
No matter how the other party tries to argue,

800
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,790
Chen Shuo's unauthorized transfer and disposal

801
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,920
of the disputed funds from the joint account

802
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,530
is already an illegal act.

803
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,990
I have also contacted the other attorney

804
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,710
named in the agency agreement, Lawyer Han Zhitong,

805
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,720
and I request Mr. Han to testify in court.

806
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,030
Your Honor, members of the court,

807
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,200
I am Han Zhitong,

808
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,070
a lawyer from Liangcheng Law Firm

809
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,030
and one of the representatives named in the agency agreement.

810
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,190
Mr. Han,

811
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,770
we all know that

812
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,710
Chen Shuo transferred 5.6 million

813
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,230
from the joint account,

814
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,750
of which 20% was paid to you.

815
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,040
Why did you later

816
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,940
return this sum

817
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,400
to Mingshan Group?

818
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,580
Because I am a law-abiding lawyer.

819
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,450
The agreement did stipulate that

820
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,800
we could receive

821
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,060
and transfer the executed debt payments,

822
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,510
but it did not authorize us to withdraw or distribute the funds at our own discretion.

823
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,420
When Mr. Chen distributed the money to me,

824
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,190
I felt there was a risk involved.

825
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,160
So I took the initiative to return the money.

826
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,440
I even advised Mr. Chen to refund the money,

827
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,790
or if not possible, to negotiate with Mingshan

828
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,910
and sign a supplementary agreement.

829
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,490
But Mr. Chen disagreed.

830
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,770
In my opinion, Mr. Chen is just too young

831
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,410
and inexperienced.

832
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,030
Your Honor,

833
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,310
Mr. Han has made it very clear.

834
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,460
Chen Shuo knowingly violated the law and the contract,

835
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,730
and despite the dissuasion from another representative,

836
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,080
he still proceeded with the intention of illegal possession

837
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,810
to withdraw and distribute

838
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,280
the large sum of money belonging to Mingshan Group.

839
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,880
His subjective malicious intent is severe,

840
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,380
clearly meeting the criteria for the crime of embezzlement.

841
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Mr. Han,

842
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,280
were you aware of

843
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,620
how the defendant, Chen Shuo,

844
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,210
withdrew and allocated the payments from the joint account?

845
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,690
Were you aware of

846
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,590
this process?

847
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,840
I was not aware at first.

848
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,430
After receiving the money, I was puzzled.

849
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,880
Wasn't it supposed to be a joint account?

850
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,700
And the other party clearly didn't want to pay.

851
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,900
So how did the funds get withdrawn?

852
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,360
I only found out after asking about it.

853
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,900
That being said,

854
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,400
I understand that Mingshan is indeed facing difficulties.

855
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,660
If they wanted to reduce the agency fees,

856
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,960
that could have been negotiable.

857
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,600
Mr. Han,

858
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,850
please be responsible for your statements in court.

859
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,930
The private prosecutor, Mingshan Group,

860
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,270
has never had any intention of maliciously breaching the contract.

861
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,800
We have also actively communicated with the defendant

862
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,190
in an effort to reach a mutual agreement.

863
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,280
Your Honor,

864
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,370
I would like to respond to the private prosecutor.

865
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,260
First,

866
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,550
we have never denied that

867
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,360
the defendant, Chen Shuo, had certain irregularities

868
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,390
in handling the joint account.

869
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,960
However, as the witness Mr. Han stated,

870
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,450
all of this occurred under the premise that

871
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
the private prosecutor, Mingshan Group, had openly breached the contract first.

872
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,910
My client, Chen Shuo,

873
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,120
had no choice

874
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,990
but to take action to protect his own interests.

875
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,070
Moreover, both parties have not

876
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,070
reached a new agreement

877
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,230
regarding the settlement of agency fees.

878
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,770
According to the contract,

879
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,250
the 5.6 million yuan

880
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,040
withdrawn by Lawyer Chen Shuo from the joint account

881
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,200
is far from the agreed payment amount.

882
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,770
Given that the conditions for payment have already been met,

883
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,150
this 5.6 million yuan

884
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,970
cannot be simply classified as

885
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,370
funds belonging to Mingshan Group.

886
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,030
Your Honor,

887
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,320
we happen to have

888
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,670
a very important audio recording here.

889
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,070
The person in this recording

890
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,880
is none other than Mr. Sun Mingshan,

891
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,260
the legal representative of the plaintiff.

892
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,550
This recording proves that

893
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,530
our client, Lawyer Chen Shuo,

894
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,040
resorted to self-help measures

895
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,250
to withhold the funds

896
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,950
only because the opposing party had breached the contract first

897
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,200
and had explicitly stated that

898
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,830
they would not pay the agency fees as agreed.

899
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,560
Objection!

900
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,480
The opposing party is engaging in trial by ambush.

901
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Representative for the opposing party,

902
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,240
you just requested Mr. Han to testify in court—

903
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,640
does that not also constitute trial by ambush?

904
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,630
Your Honor,

905
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,530
why did my client, Lawyer Chen Shuo,

906
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,850
take such a significant risk

907
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,520
to withhold the disputed funds in advance?

908
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,650
The answer lies within this recording.

909
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,220
We formally request

910
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,810
permission to play this recording in court.

911
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,210
Please grant permission, Your Honor.

912
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,150
Permission granted.
