[Unbreakable Ⅱ]

2
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,800
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,000
Besides, this all happened 10 years ago,

4
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,810
and since they were minors, it can't really be considered a crime.

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,680
Both Civil Law and the Minor Protection Law

6
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,420
focus on evidence and the statute of limitations.

7
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,770
Most importantly,

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,750
the consequences it had

9
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,400
for Xiao Nannan

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,250
haven't shown up in any real way.

11
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,320
It's hard to measure

12
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,190
emotional and mental harm in a lawsuit.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,540
I can't believe that

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,280
something like this, involving so many people,

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,310
can't be dealt with by the law.

16
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,590
The law doesn't punish the majority;

17
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,930
I still find it difficult to fire a lawsuit.

18
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,980
What about you?

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,210
I think what Qiu Hua said makes sense.

20
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,300
Let's just wait and see.

21
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,579
We need to know what Xiao Nannan's

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,560
asking for today;

23
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,120
does she want to go to court, or what?

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,010
Let's figure that out first.

25
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,990
Qiu Hua's right about this. I know about it already;

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,260
no need for you to tell me.

27
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,250
Did I say something wrong?

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,030
It seems like everything you said was wrong.

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,300
She asked me that, though.

30
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,720
Ms. Xiao, Mr. Yang,

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,900
we'd like to know

32
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,240
what your real request is today.

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,829
Are you looking for legal punishment

34
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,270
for those who hurt you back then?

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,900
No, no.

36
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,650
I didn't mean to punish them.

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,230
So, what's the purpose of you coming to us?

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,250
He suggested that

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,550
I seek legal help

40
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,750
and ask them for an apology.

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,270
Yes.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,870
It was my suggestion.

43
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,180
They treated Nannan so cruelly back then,

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,880
and changed her forever.

45
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,079
Even if they don't face legal punishment,

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
they should at least

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,010
apologize to her.

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,350
I believe if Nannan receives an apology from them,

49
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,030
she might slowly begin to heal

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,730
from the shadows of that time.

51
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,840
An apology alone seems too easy for them.

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,680
The harm caused by school bullying

53
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,740
is indeed huge

54
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,790
for teenagers,

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,360
but figuring out how to punish it

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,480
is a big challenge for society.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,079
It can't all be regulated by law.

58
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,090
From today's conversation,

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,590
it seems like

60
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,800
your career is going well

61
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,940
and you've built a new life for yourself.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,870
However, those things from the past

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,520
have clearly left a deep scar

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,070
in your heart.

65
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,020
I just

66
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,630
want to confirm with you again.

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,630
What you really want

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,960
is a sincere apology from them

69
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,120
so that you can move past the shadow

70
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,000
of what happened back then.

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,950
This is more important to you

72
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,040
than them facing legal punishment,

73
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,060
right?

74
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,570
Yes, Ms. Luo.

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,840
That's what I mean.

76
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,840
Xia Shu,

77
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,010
how's the case going

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,360
on your end?

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,870
I'm almost done.

80
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,960
I have time.

81
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,200
Ms. Luo,

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,080
are you suggesting that

83
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,950
Ms. Xia take charge of this matter?

84
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,659
Mr. Chen,

85
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,060
let's discuss the case of our firm first, shall we?

86
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,880
Hold on.

87
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,850
Ms. Xiao,

88
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,890
we are willing to

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,310
provide legal assistance,

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,500
but we'll need to sign an agreement first.

91
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,220
Your case

92
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,320
will be led by Xia Shu,

93
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,670
and both Qiu Hua and I

94
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,750
will assist with the work.

95
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,870
First, we need to

96
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,310
conduct an investigation,

97
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,750
and gather evidence regarding the bullying that happened to you.

98
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,170
Then we'll see what we should do next.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,750
Okay?

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,480
Xia Shu,

101
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,540
you can discuss the details of the agreement with them.

102
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,090
Okay.

103
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,370
Please follow me.

104
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,060
Xia Shu.

105
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,420
I'll get the agreement for you.

106
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,270
Thank you.

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Go ahead, Mr. Chen. What's up?

108
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,600
Let's step outside and talk.

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,240
What's going on?

110
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,430
What do you mean?

111
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
Aren't you handling this case?

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
Didn't I tell you, Xia Shu will handle this.

113
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,800
You know better than anyone else

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
about Xia Shu's work ability.

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,950
It's unreliable to let her handle the case.

116
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,950
That's why I asked Qiu Hua for help.

117
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,720
Why didn't you listen to me carefully?

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,510
I heard it clearly.

119
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,480
But I introduced this case,

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,920
and you want me to cooperate with others?

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,510
Let us do it.

122
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,360
We're close and we can communicate, right?

123
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,690
We...

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,450
Yes.

125
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,070
Have you forgotten?

126
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,990
What did I forget?

127
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,410
Mr. Xu's case

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,060
is also handled by our firm.

129
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,800
I have to keep an eye on it.

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,190
Don't worry.

131
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,070
If you need any help,

132
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,930
I'm always here.

133
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,670
What does Mr. Xu have to do with me?

134
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,280
Fang Rui, let's go.

135
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,560
Take my clothes.

136
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,380
We're leaving, Ms. Qiu, Ms. Xia.

137
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,940
Bye bye.

138
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,610
Bye bye.

139
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,160
Don't get discouraged.

140
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,040
If this girl were too easy to pursue, it wouldn't be interesting,

141
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,500
right?

142
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
At this stage,

143
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,580
the more anxious you get, the less anxious she'll be.

144
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,800
Let me tell you, the less anxious you are...

145
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,620
Mr. Chen.

146
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,000
Mr. Chen.

147
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,230
I've been waiting for you for so long.

148
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,270
What's up, Mr. Han?

149
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,480
Do you still remember you have a case?

150
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,160
I have more than one case.

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,990
Which one are you talking about?

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
Great minds have short memories.

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,310
Let me remind you—

154
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,490
Mingshan.

155
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,240
Yesterday was the deadline for Minghai Group's appeal, right?

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,630
Yes.

157
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,760
I forgot to ask.

158
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,650
I'll contact the judge now...

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,430
No, no, no.

160
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,690
Let me handle this little thing.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,690
I've already called.

162
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,480
Minghai Group didn't appeal.

163
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,190
Then that means the judgment is final.

164
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,630
Yes.

165
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,800
We can start the enforcement process immediately.

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
That's good news for us.

167
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,560
Don't be happy too soon.

168
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,800
Shouldn't Mingshan Group

169
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,090
be more active about this than you?

170
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,650
Yes.

171
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,510
But has Mingshan Group reached out to you?

172
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,450
No.

173
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,880
Why hasn't Mingshan Group reached out to you?

174
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,610
Have you thought about it?

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,240
You should really keep your guard up.

176
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,020
That makes sense.

177
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,290
Then let's go to Mingshan Group together.

178
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,340
No, I just got back.

179
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,680
I haven't even had a sip of water.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,750
Okay.

181
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,950
You've done a great job, Mr. Han.

182
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,800
I can go by myself.

183
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Fang Rui,

184
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,870
let's go.

185
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,430
Okay.

186
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,120
We're leaving, Mr. Han.

187
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,190
Okay, bye bye.

188
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,260
How could I forget such an important thing?

189
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,890
Well...

190
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,360
Mr. Han.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Mentor, wait for me.

192
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,400
You mean Mingshan Group hasn't asked about it?

193
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,480
Yes.

194
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,150
They didn't give a call

195
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,650
after they won the case.

196
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,220
Han,

197
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,550
in this situation,

198
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,700
when they lose the case,

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,390
Mingshan Group is more anxious than anyone.

200
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,370
But once they win,

201
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,640
they don't care, while everyone else is worried.

202
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,430
You have to be careful.

203
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,170
Don't worry.

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,580
Their little tricks

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,270
can't fool me.

206
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,510
I'm keeping an eye on everything.

207
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,080
Who are you keeping an eye on?

208
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,100
All the interested parties.

209
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,760
I have more than one set of eyes watching—

210
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,100
actually, several.

211
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,840
As soon as there's a sign of movement on their side,

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,260
I'll know immediately.

213
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,600
No.

214
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,360
You have to pay special attention to your partner, Chen Shuo.

215
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,070
You mean Chen Shuo might betray the firm

216
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,870
for personal gain?

217
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,750
No.

218
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,910
I'm afraid he'll be blinded by money,

219
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,510
not being flexible where he needs to be,

220
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,900
only focusing on his own interests,

221
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,000
and end up causing even more damage to the firm.

222
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,860
Understand?

223
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,180
Don't worry.

224
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,670
He might act slick,

225
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,210
but he's just a rookie in front of me.

226
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,570
But there's something I need to mention.

227
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,470
It's I who's keeping an eye on this case

228
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,960
but I can only get 20% of the agency fee.

229
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,790
Can you find another lawyer

230
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,080
in our firm

231
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,370
as self-sacrificing as me?

232
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,910
Come on, Han.

233
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,170
Don't pretend to be good after taking advantage.

234
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,580
You're just keeping an eye on it.

235
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,360
This case was handled by Chen Shuo himself.

236
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,870
20% is not bad.

237
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,150
The new ones are always more appealing.

238
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,360
No matter how much effort the old hands put in, they don't get the same credit.

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,460
It's me.

240
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,320
Let me ask you something.

241
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,750
Do you know why

242
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,230
Minghai Group didn't appeal?

243
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,230
[Mingshan]

244
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,130
Mr. Sun, we've been waiting for you.

245
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,200
Sorry, sorry.

246
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
I've had meetings all day,

247
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,550
and now I need to rush to another one.

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,250
Let me update you on the situation.

249
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,720
I've confirmed with the court that

250
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,710
Minghai Group didn't appeal,

251
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,750
and the judgment has already taken effect.

252
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,410
Can we now proceed with enforcement?

253
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,950
I'll follow your lead.

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,150
Considering the other party's background

255
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
and the nature of their business,

256
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,240
apart from freezing

257
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,600
their bank accounts,

258
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
I think we should also investigate

259
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,820
their non-core business assets

260
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
and report any financial information to the court.

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,200
What do you think?

262
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,280
I'll leave everything to you two.

263
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,220
Please.

264
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,960
Sorry, I have to rush to another meeting.

265
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,630
Hurry up. Sorry.

266
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,910
Keep in touch, Mr. Sun.

267
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,910
Okay.

268
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,200
Let's go.

269
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,130
Wait, Mentor.

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is his business.

271
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,450
Why doesn't he pay any attention to it?

272
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,120
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

273
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,310
He must be playing tricks behind my back.

274
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,040
Xue, help me investigate something.

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,030
Mentor,

276
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
I have a classmate

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,680
who's currently working as a lawyer at Deren Law Firm.

278
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,050
They just took on the Minghai Group's case.

279
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,510
So if needed,

280
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,630
I can ask them

281
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,240
and see if Minghai Group has had any contact

282
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,630
with Mingshan Group recently.

283
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,000
It's impossible,

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,430
since they're representing Minghai Group.

285
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,410
It's not him representing Minghai Group,

286
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,150
it's another lawyer from his firm.

287
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,250
His talents

288
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,440
have always been overlooked.

289
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,320
In that case, you can ask him.

290
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,050
Okay.

291
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,240
Behavior between classmates, such as mutual hostility,

292
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,540
provocation,

293
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,570
fighting, and insults,

294
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,150
could potentially constitute the following criminal offenses:

295
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,170
Article 233 of the Criminal Law:

296
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,750
"Involuntary manslaughter" (if someone dies due to negligence).

297
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,750
Article 234: "Intentional injury."

298
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,340
Article 238: "Illegal detention."

299
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,310
Enough with the reciting.

300
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,630
This case doesn't really

301
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,000
fall under the scope of the Criminal Law regulation.

302
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,480
There are other articles.

303
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,450
Article 246: "Defamation"

304
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,080
and Article 293: "Provocation and troublemaking."

305
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,440
Do you think it can be considered the criminal offenses you mentioned above?

306
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,060
I think it might,

307
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
but the judge might not agree.

308
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,260
By the way,

309
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,470
Article 7 of the Judicial Interpretation on Personal Injury Compensation

310
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,050
holds schools, kindergartens, and relevant educational institutions

311
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,320
responsible for compensation

312
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,320
if they fail to fulfill their legal obligations

313
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,980
of education, management, and protection,

314
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,200
resulting in personal harm

315
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,980
to minors.

316
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,870
We can use this as a basis

317
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,870
to pursue legal action against Xiao Nannan's high school at the time.

318
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,170
But how are you going to prove that

319
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,210
Xiao Nannan actually suffered personal harm?

320
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,170
I don't believe it.

321
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll keep looking.

322
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,720
Stop looking.

323
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,600
We're better off

324
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,520
talking to Xiao Nannan about it.

325
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,470
Talk about what?

326
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,550
Giving up.

327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,870
Why?

328
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,410
Many people get bullied from a young age.

329
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,150
They grow up in harsh environments,

330
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,790
but they still live just fine.

331
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,510
So you mean

332
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,770
Xiao Nannan should just put up with it?

333
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,070
I didn't say that.

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
I just experienced more than her.

335
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,070
I know that many things

336
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,230
can't be fixed

337
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,430
by the law,

338
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,580
sometimes it's better to just rely on yourself.

339
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,830
If you want to live in this world,

340
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,220
you can't be so fragile.

341
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
You think Xiao Nannan is fragile?

342
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,120
I think so.

343
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,480
I've experienced more than her since I was a kid.

344
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,550
I'm still living just fine.

345
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,200
Qiu,

346
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,240
I can't agree with you.

347
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,120
It's because so many people

348
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,840
think like you do

349
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,030
so that society turns a blind eye

350
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,880
to all the evil,

351
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,820
letting bad people and kids get away with whatever they want.

352
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,360
But what can you do about it?

353
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,990
You've checked the Criminal Law, the Civil Code, the Minor Protection Law,

354
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,030
and the Public Security Administration Punishment Law.

355
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,290
Didn't you just check it?

356
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,630
Even if we can't

357
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,840
hold him legally accountable,

358
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,200
we should at least ensure he faces moral condemnation.

359
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,600
He should apologize to the victim in person,

360
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,480
and the victim deserves some psychological comfort;

361
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,510
isn't that right?

362
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,320
Yes.

363
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm afraid it's hard to do.

364
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Then I'll try.

365
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,670
You eat first.

366
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,870
I've put everything I have here,

367
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,840
and now you're telling me to leave?

368
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,200
What?

369
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,330
What did you say?

370
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,080
Hello, sir.

371
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,480
Is Wei Guiying inside?

372
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,960
She's the one arguing in there.

373
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,380
What's wrong with her?

374
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,750
Our place is too small,

375
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,150
so she took out a loan

376
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,120
to rent the place next door.

377
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,250
But it turns out she got scammed.

378
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,360
She gave the money to a scammer.

379
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,240
That place already belonged to someone else.

380
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,000
How could something like this even happen?

381
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,320
It's not easy to earn some money.

382
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Okay, thank you.

383
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,570
You're welcome.

384
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,630
Hello, is Wei Guiying here?

385
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,750

Are you Wei Guiying?

388
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,720
Yes.

389
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,240
Hello, Ms. Wei.

390
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,370
My name is Xia Shu,

391
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
and I'm a lawyer from Yinghua Law Firm.

392
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,230
I'm here today

393
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,070
because our firm

394
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,910
has been entrusted by Ms. Xiao Nannan

395
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,240
to provide legal assistance

396
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,480
regarding the bullying she experienced in school.

397
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,590
You and Xiao Nannan were high school classmates, right?

398
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,500
Xiao Nannan? That rich girl?

[School Bullying Perpetrator: Zhang Xiaolian]

400
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,030
I must remind you that

401
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,750
you're still using insulting terms toward her.

402
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,490
Your actions back then

403
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,720
caused significant harm to Ms. Xiao Nannan,

404
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,760
and she is still troubled by what happened.

405
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,440
That's why she hopes

406
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,550
you will issue a formal apology

407
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,960
for what you did.

408
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,910
Are you kidding me? Apologize?

409
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,630
Who will apologize to us?

410
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,710
Comfort her feelings?

411
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,960
Who will comfort me?

412
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,290
We just gave her a nickname

413
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,820
and joked around a little;

414
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,320
how is that considered harm?

415
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,970
You're just a young girl;

416
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
do you even know what real harm is?

417
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,220
Let me tell you what harm is.

418
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,860
I've changed three jobs this year.

419
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,200
No matter how hard I work,

420
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,890
my boss still looks down on me.

421
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,470
Since graduating from college,

422
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,819
I haven't even been able to find a stable job.

423
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,720
Everything I own is right here,

424
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,869
and I got scammed.

425
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,650
Who's going to apologize to me?

426
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,130
I got fired today.

427
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,619
I don't even know where to look for a job tomorrow.

428
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,310
I have no money to pay my rent.

429
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,460
I can't afford to eat and sleep.

430
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,140
Who's apologized to me?

431
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
You're a lawyer, right?

432
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,890
Why don't you

433
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,920
stand up for people like me?

434
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,680
And you call that harm?

435
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,720
Just a few words made her hurt?

436
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,680
Then what about people like us—should we just drop dead?

437
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,620
Get lost!

438
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,680
You're being unreasonable.

439
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,360
Apologize? No way.

440
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,580
Hello, Xiao Nannan.

441
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,200
Please have a seat.

442
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,730
I ordered some fruit tea; is that okay?

443
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,720
Sure.

444
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,900
Thank you, Ms. Qiu.

445
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,670
You're welcome.

446
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,640
I invited you here today

447
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,310
just to have a casual chat.

448
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,350
Xia Shu met a few people

449
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,670
from the list you provided.

450
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,850
But I'm sure you can already guess the outcome,

451
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,550
so I'll be frank with you.

452
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,960
They think

453
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,480
they were just kids back then,

454
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,750
and all they did was make a few casual jokes.

455
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,430
Besides,

456
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,860
your family is better off than theirs,

457
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,820
so it was inevitable that

458
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,000
they held some resentment toward you.

459
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,070
At that age,

460
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,160
having those kinds of feelings

461
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,200
is understandable.

462
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,980
Ms. Qiu,

463
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,960
are you saying that

464
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,640
all of this is just me

465
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,630
being overly sensitive

466
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,310
and making a fuss over nothing?

467
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,120
No, I didn't mean that.

468
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,920
What they did to you back then

469
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,150
was certainly wrong.

470
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,160
What I want to say is that

471
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,400
sometimes,

472
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,930
life is just cruel.

473
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,510
If you want to survive,

474
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,820
you need to turn your heart

475
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,070
into a coarse sieve,

476
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,430
filtering out all the small things.

477
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,240
What you can do is

478
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,440
make your heart stronger.

479
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,260
Only when you become stronger

480
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,870
will others not be able to hurt you.

481
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,320
What are lawyers for?

482
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,200
What are the laws for?

483
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,480
They got my contact information

484
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,350
from you.

485
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,130
Now they're calling me and insulting me as the rich girl.

486
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,480
I was wrong. I shouldn't have come to you.

487
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,870
I should have just endured it.

488
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,000
I've paid all the money I need to.

489
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,310
Let's terminate the agreement.

490
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,590
Xia Shu,

491
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,610
did you know that Xiao Nannan wants to terminate the agreement?

492
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,520
What?

493
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,030
Why?

494
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,440
You don't know why?

495
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,920
When you went to look for Xiao Nannan's high school classmates,

496
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
did you give them

497
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,890
her contact info?

498
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,150
I did give it to one of them,

499
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,960
but he said he wanted to apologize to Xiao Nannan,

500
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,900
so I gave it to him.

501
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,590
I knew it was you.

502
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,640
Your intelligence seems to be decreasing.

503
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,200
They weren't trying to apologize to Xiao Nannan!

504
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,790
They clearly just wanted to get

505
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,960
Xiao Nannan's contact information

506
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,550
and spread it to other classmates.

507
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Now several people

508
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,240
have already called and insulted Xiao Nannan.

509
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,230
Why is he so bad?

510
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,200
What should we do?

511
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,240
What can we do?

512
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,190
Let it be.

513
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,110
Honestly, there's not much

514
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,470
we can do about this case anyway.

515
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,880
Maybe terminating the agreement

516
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,030
is actually a good thing for Xiao Nannan.

517
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
No, we can't just give up.

518
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,120
I'll give her another call and try to talk to her.

519
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,360
Let's wait for Yingzi to come back and discuss it.

520
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,230
If it doesn't work out, let's just refund her money.

521
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,160
Hello.

522
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,700

Please try again later.

524
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,870
Hello, Mr. Hao. What's wrong?

525
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,960
Xia Shu,

526
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,970
I want to go over the situation

527
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,070
with Mr. Ma and Mr. Yang with you.

528
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,200
Are you free?

529
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,070
I have a case which is troublesome.

530
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,160
I can't step away for now.

531
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,840
How about you come find me tonight?

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,850
I see.

533
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Alright, I got it.

534
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,540
Thank you, bro.

535
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,700
I know what I owe you.

536
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,790
We'll have many opportunities to deal with each other in the future.

537
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,080
That's all for now.

538
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,450
Okay, bye.

539
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,360
Really?

540
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,400
Those two have been working together for a while now.

541
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,550
Did Minghai Group pay back Mingshan Group's money?

542
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,050
No, but they've been getting really close.

543
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,660
Just yesterday, Sun Mingshan went to Minghai Group,

544
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,280
and the boss of Minghai Group

545
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,950
personally came downstairs to greet him.

546
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,690
They were chatting and laughing like old friends.

547
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,320
What were they talking about?

548
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
Who knows?

549
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,710
My buddy

550
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,980
is just a department manager at Minghai Group.

551
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,950
He only knows that someone from Mingshan Group went over.

552
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,100
Until the agreement is finalized,

553
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,110
there's no way he'd know

554
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,340
what they talked about or what they did.

555
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,000
The lawyer's out there busting their butt for the client,

556
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,080
while the client has betrayed the lawyer.

557
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,370
What's even the point of that?

558
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,900
Are they trying to avoid paying a small amount of lawyer fees?

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,920
They're going to pay you over 8 million in lawyer fees,

560
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,200
and you call that a small amount?

561
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,030
It's not a small sum.

562
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,840
When did those two companies start getting in touch?

563
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,920
It was after you won the case in the first trial.

564
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,980
Logically speaking,

565
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,200
the boss of Minghai Group

566
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,300
is a senior official at the department level.

567
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,680
How could he possibly care about a private enterprise owner?

568
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,160
It's because you

569
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,590
did such a solid job in the first trial

570
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,030
and gathered evidence so thoroughly.

571
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,670
They knew that

572
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,270
even if the case went to the second trial,

573
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,160
they'd still lose.

574
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,910
That's why he put on a show.

575
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,270
Sun Mingshan isn't stupid.

576
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,550
He knows what Minghai Group is afraid of.

577
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,720
So,

578
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,560
no matter how Minghai Group's attitude changes,

579
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,270
the core demand of Mingshan Group won't change.

580
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,660
They just want Minghai Group to pay back the money.

581
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,680
That's the point.

582
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,620
[Mr. Sun]

583
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,220
Meeting with Minghai Group behind my back, you really know how to play the game.

584
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,510
Hello, Mr. Sun. I'm Chen Shuo.

585
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,200
Regarding Minghai Group's situation,

586
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,340
the company I hired has almost finished the investigation.

587
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,610
They've bought a piece of land

588
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,590
in Pingling.

589
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,020
The internal sources say

590
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,130
it's for building dormitories,

591
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,550
but the specific purpose isn't important.

592
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,790
What matters is that

593
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,720
this land

594
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,720
hasn't been seized yet,

595
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,790
and its property value

596
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,830
is enough to cover most of the debt.

597
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,050
Given the situation,

598
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,360
do you think we should provide this information to the court as soon as possible?

599
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,210
You really found it.

600
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,790
Go ahead and provide it.

601
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,160
They

602
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,990
won't give up until they're in deep trouble.

603
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,380
If they don't actively enforce the judgment,

604
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,030
we'll apply for enforcement ourselves.

605
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,550
I'll provide it to the court then.

606
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,320
Also, Mr. Sun,

607
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,600
there's one important point,

608
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,670
as mentioned

609
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,710
in our previous agency agreement,

610
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,830
we both

611
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,590
need to set up a joint account

612
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,680
to collect payments

613
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,790
and enforcement funds.

614
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,310
Now that enforcement is about to start,

615
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,750
would it be possible for you to send someone

616
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,140
to coordinate with me on this matter?

617
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,940
Sure. When do you think is okay?

618
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,650
The sooner, the better.

619
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,310
Wait, how about tomorrow?

620
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,120
Okay, I'll send someone there tomorrow.

621
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,670
You go ahead with your work.

622
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,590
I'll wait for you.

623
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,070
If you're ungrateful to me,

624
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,540
don't blame me for being harsh with you.

625
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,640
Mr. Sun,

626
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,010
we're in negotiations with Minghai Group right now.

627
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,510
Is it a good time to bring up enforcement?

628
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,720
What's wrong with that?

629
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,310
We're negotiating with them,

630
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,550
but they keep dragging things out;

631
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,400
they just don't want to pay.

632
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,400
As long as the deal isn't done,

633
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
we should push for enforcement.

634
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,970
We should seize

635
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,030
as many assets as possible.

636
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,590
The more we enforce,

637
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,260
the stronger our position in negotiations.

638
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,550
Does Mr. Chen know about the negotiations?

639
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,140
We can't let him know.

640
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,120
By the way,

641
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,540
make sure everyone who knows about this

642
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,690
keeps it strictly confidential.

643
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,220
We absolutely cannot let Mr. Chen

644
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,540
hear a word of it.

645
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,090
Come in.

646
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
Mr. Han, are you looking for me?

647
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,990
I've been waiting for you.

648
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,160
Sit down.

649
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,000
The door is also closed.

650
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
Sit down.

651
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,240
Why so serious?

652
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,440
What's going on?

653
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,660
I've received confirmed news—

654
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,810
Mingshan Group and Minghai Group are in talks.

655
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,270
That's a bit underhanded.

656
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,230
I had a feeling before.

657
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,010
Whenever something like this happens,

658
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,080
it's always a given that

659
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,920
the client will betray their lawyer.

660
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,070
But it's a bit strange.

661
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,470
You said they are negotiating,

662
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
but I just called Sun Mingshan

663
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,560
on the way here,

664
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,830
and he was urging me

665
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,480
to hurry up with the enforcement.

666
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,350
Enforcement?

667
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,380
Yes, Sun Mingshan said that.

668
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,160
That means their negotiations didn't succeed.

669
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,930
So what if they didn't succeed?

670
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,990
If they didn't succeed,

671
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
they'll use the lawyer

672
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,590
to push for enforcement,

673
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,030
and then when they go back to the negotiating table,

674
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,060
Mingshan Group will have a stronger position,

675
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,830
right?

676
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,620
I didn't think of that.

677
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
How about this, Mr. Han?

678
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,790
I have to call you Mentor.

679
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,120
I'll pay my respects as your disciple.

680
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,110
Okay? Look.

681
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,750
Fine.

682
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,760
You're amazing.

683
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,080
Flatter me after we get the money.

684
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,880
Fine.

685
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,000
Let's get on with the enforcement right away.

686
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,180
Don't be greedy.

687
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
As their assets are seized, we make a withdrawal.

688
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,340
Then we'll go straight to Mingshan Group for negotiations

689
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,350
and cut our losses as soon as possible, understand?

690
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,800
Okay, I got it.

691
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,350
I told Sun Mingshan

692
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,590
to build the joint account as soon as possible.

693
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,870
He's sending someone over tomorrow,

694
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,030
and we'll go to the bank together.

695
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,510
Wait, building a joint account?

696
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,030
If they disagree,

697
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,000
we can't come up with the money,

698
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,660
then we'll have done all this for nothing.

699
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,940
You need to make sure who's going to set up the account

700
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,060
and how they're going to do it.

701
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,250
Chen Shuo,

702
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,680
you can't do this.

703
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,110
What did I do?

704
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,590
It's too risky to get caught.

705
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,720
Mr. Han, you're worrying too much.

706
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,270
I am a lawyer.

707
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,240
I won't do anything illegal.

708
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,180
Also,

709
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,550
as long as they fulfill the agreement,

710
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,580
the joint account

711
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,080
is just an account.

712
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,080
Brother,

713
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,530
listen to me.

714
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,800
Have you ever heard of any lawyer making eight to ten million

715
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,570
just from the first trial?

716
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,140
From the very beginning, I knew that

717
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,650
the bid from Mingshan Group was just a gimmick,

718
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,340
designed to lure lawyers in.

719
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,950
Brother, let's lower the price.

720
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,270
Let's just ask for one million,

721
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,050
and this matter can still be negotiated,

722
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,990
don't you think?

723
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,490
I can earn 8 million,

724
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,030
but I should settle for 1 million?

725
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,980
No wonder you're young.

726
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,000
As the saying goes,

727
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,570
"A bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush."

728
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,840
What you can get is real money;

729
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,910
what you can't get

730
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,130
is just numbers on paper.

731
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,830
Mr. Han,

732
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,110
I'm just following the agreement on this.

733
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,400
I just want what I deserve.

734
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
If you're worried,

735
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,440
you can report it to the firm

736
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,470
and see what's the firm's decision.

737
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,580
Wait, why should I report it?

738
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,030
The more you earn,

739
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,040
the more I get too, right?

740
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,610
There you go, brother.

741
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,480
Don't worry. I'll let you know

742
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,960
if there's any progress on my end, okay?

743
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,510
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

744
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,270
Alright.

745
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,880
Ms. Xiao,

746
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,450
your phone is off,

747
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,610
so I had no choice but to apologize this way.

748
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,270
I didn't mean to leak your phone number.

749
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,330
It was my own careless handling.

750
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,160
This has nothing to do with Ms. Qiu.

751
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,680
I'm truly sorry.

752
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,020
What is it?

753
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,460
Your coffee is good.

754
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,660
Let's get down to business.

755
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,330
My uncle and younger uncle

756
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,680
have basically won over

757
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,390
Mr. Ma and Mr. Yang.

758
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,220
It's too quick.

759
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,790
What about Lan? You still can't contact her?

760
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,160
She's in the country,

761
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,790
but when I went to her place,

762
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,290
she wouldn't see me.

763
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,970
Do you have any idea?

764
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,720
How would I know?

765
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,440
Let me think about it.

766
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,080
Hao Lei, let me ask you a question.

767
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,660
Even if you don't become the president,

768
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,930
you're still a major shareholder.

769
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,500
You're not short on money,

770
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,790
so why fight with your uncle and younger uncle?

771
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,440
You lawyers

772
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,590
can make money

773
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,550
taking on regular cases too.

774
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,550
Why go after debts,

775
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,090
throwing yourself under someone's car wheels

776
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,700
or apologizing to clients in the middle of the night?

777
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,260
What's in it for you?

778
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,820
This is called a sense of accomplishment.

779
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,850
Do you understand?

780
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,340
A sense of accomplishment?

781
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,490
Did your sense of accomplishment come from

782
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,000
crawling under car wheels

783
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,730
or playing mind games with loan sharks?

784
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,750
Why didn't I have a sense of accomplishment?

785
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,680
I think I'm pretty impressive.

786
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,390
I used to feel like I had everything,

787
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,730
but in reality, I have nothing.

788
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,770
I have nothing now.

789
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,400
But I still have to hold on to something.

790
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,200
Aren't you the same?

791
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,890
So I think

792
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,870
we are quite alike.

793
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,410
Enough. Stop pretending to be close.

794
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,750
You tricked me into working for you.

795
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,830
Let's get down to business.

796
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,650
You can only rely on Lan now.

797
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,640
What should you do?

798
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,770
You like sense of accomplishment,

799
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,680
so you go ask her out.

800
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,730
I...

801
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,750
I'll leave it to you.

802
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,200
Okay, I owe you.

803
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,510
Mentor, this is Miss Dong from the Mingshan Group.

804
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,310
This is my mentor.

805
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,440
Mr. Chen.

806
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,640
I'm Dong Yao, just call me Dong.

807
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,720
No, I'll call you Miss Dong.

808
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,400
Hello.

809
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,880
Hello.

810
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,470
I'm sorry

811
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,960
to trouble you with the trip today.

812
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,630
It's okay.

813
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,610
Do you have your ID and authorization letter with you?

814
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,390
Yes.

815
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,970
Okay.

816
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,120
Mentor, I'll take care of the errand.

817
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,830
Errand?

818
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,150
There are no small matters when it comes to Mingshan Group.

819
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,830
Every task is crucial,

820
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,000
and I must handle it personally.

821
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,030
I've already contacted the bank,

822
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,680
and it won't take much of your time,

823
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
and we'll get it done quickly.

824
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,370
Okay.

825
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,210
You go first.

826
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,350
I'll get you a car.

827
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,010
No need.

828
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,950
Work hard. Don't slack off.

829
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,070
Miss Dong,

830
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,070
these are the agreements

831
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,310
required for us

832
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,320
to establish the joint account.

833
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,050
Our firm has already stamped them.

834
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,110
See if there's any problem.

835
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,030
If not,

836
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,790
you can just have the Mingshan seal placed,

837
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,310
and we'll submit them to the bank.

838
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,900
Okay. Mr. Chen, let me take a look.

839
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,240
Miss Dong,

840
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,820
I feel like I've seen you before.

841
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,150
I had dinner once

842
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,280
with Mr. Sun and Mrs. Sun.

843
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,420
Mrs. Sun

844
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,040
left quite a deep impression on me then.

845
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,430
Today when I saw you,

846
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,200
I just felt there was something familiar

847
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,270
about your demeanor,

848
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,830
your aura, and even the way you speak.

849
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,590
You mean my sister?

850
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,930
Mr. Sun's wife is your sister?

851
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,750
Yes.

852
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,030
Is she your cousin or biological sister?

853
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,930
Biological sister.

854
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,900
No wonder.

855
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,240
I was thinking

856
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,550
how did Mr. Sun

857
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,310
get so lucky

858
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,720
to marry such a great wife?

859
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,550
But now that I see you, I realize

860
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,370
I've been a bit out of the loop.

861
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,650
Don't joke like that.

862
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,070
How can I compare with my sister?

863
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,480
Her marrying my brother-in-law

864
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,860
ensures that she never has to worry for the rest of her life.

865
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,950
Unlike my sister, I'm in my thirties,

866
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,630
but I'm still working for my brother-in-law.

867
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,550
Don't say that.

868
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,679
You are excellent.

869
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,330
Is there anything wrong with the agreement?

870
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,350
No. I'll stamp it.

871
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:16,960
Okay.

872
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,280
By the way, Mr. Chen,

873
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,130
when did you meet my sister?

874
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,960
I should have already joined the company by then.

875
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,360
When exactly? Let me think.

876
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,580
Not long ago.

877
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,400
Yes, she mentioned

878
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,290
she had a younger sister.

879
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,020
Really?

880
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,920
I thought that

881
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,550
if the older sister is elegant, intelligent, graceful,

882
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,880
tall,

883
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,110
and pretty,

884
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,000
then the younger sister must be something special, right?

885
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,520
You're so funny,

886
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,550
like Jia Baoyu.

887
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,239
There are two more copies.

888
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,210
Okay.

889
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,840
Now I know

890
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,590
why my brother-in-law is willing to work with you.

891
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,500
I'm just average in terms of business skills, but I'm good at sweet-talking.

892
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,320
Mr. Chen.

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,000
Hello.

894
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,800
You're here.

895
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,030
Hello.

896
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,480
Hello.

897
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm here today

898
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,480
as I mentioned on the phone earlier,

899
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
to handle some joint account business.

900
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,670
This is Miss Dong, the financial officer from the Mingshan Group.

901
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,110
Miss Dong.

902
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,700
Hello.

903
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,470
Come with me.

904
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,270
Okay.

905
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,920
This way, please.

906
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,680
Okay.

907
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,400
Miss Dong, you first.

908
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,440
Zhang.

909
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,280
Mr. Ma.

910
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,450
Mr. Chen's law firm

911
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,440
is opening an account at our bank.

912
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,930
Okay.

913
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,690
Have a seat.

914
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,520
Did you bring the authorization letter and ID?

915
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,370
-Yes.
-Yes.

916
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,800
Here are the authorization letter, ID, and agreement.

917
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,000
It'll be quick.

918
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Okay, let me check.

919
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,480
Thank you.

920
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,190
Come on.

921
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,770
Two U keys, one for you and one for me.

922
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,650
Yes, just change the password later.

923
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,790
Okay, I'll call a taxi.

924
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,440
Let me give you a ride.

925
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,930
I drove here; it's parked over there.

926
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,720
Let's go.

927
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,320
Then I won't be polite with you anymore.

928
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,550
What's there to be polite about with me?

929
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,440
This is the material for the enforcement request,

930
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,190
Judge Liu.

931
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,150
You've thoroughly investigated, right?

932
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,510
Do these properties and lands fully belong to Minghai Group,

933
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
without any cooperative development

934
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,350
or other ownership issues?

935
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,550
No. We've investigated thoroughly.

936
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,170
Don't worry.

937
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,470
We'll study it

938
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,920
and enter the process as soon as possible.

939
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,510
Okay.

940
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,240
Thank you, Judge Liu.

941
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,950
Bye.

942
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,840
What a busy day.

943
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,670
Is eight million yuan

944
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,420
enough to win Luo Yingzi's heart?

945
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,920
Should I tell Fang Lihong?

946
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,770
Come in.

947
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,760
Ms. Fang.

948
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,950
Mr. Chen, is there something?

949
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,280
I hope I'm not interrupting.

950
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,150
No.

951
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,510
I just wanted to give you an update

952
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,980
on the progress of the Mingshan Group's case.

953
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,630
Have a seat.

954
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,180
Okay.

955
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,360
Now,

956
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,690
we've won the first trial.

957
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,280
The other party didn't appeal,

958
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,320
so the judgment is final.

959
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,550
Congratulations.

960
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,150
This achievement

961
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,440
is thanks to the strong support from

962
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,100
you and our firm.

963
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,250
I'm really grateful to the firm.

964
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,480
Chen Shuo, the fact that the other party didn't appeal

965
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,900
might not be a good thing.

966
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,040
It could be a change of battlefield.

967
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,190
What do you mean?

968
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,000
Well, many clients nowadays

969
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,400
aren't used to solving problems through law.

970
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,000
They're more accustomed to using power to get things done.

971
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,170
They didn't appeal

972
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,960
doesn't mean they accepted the judgment.

973
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,810
Maybe they just changed their approach.

974
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,880
For example, they might secretly use other methods

975
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,110
to negotiate with our client.

976
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,910
Ms. Fang, it really seems like

977
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,710
you were right.

978
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,850
After we won the case,

979
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,800
I had someone investigate,

980
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,710
and these two companies, which have never had any dealings with each other,

981
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,350
suddenly became close.

982
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,050
They've been in contact privately for no apparent reason.

983
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,660
Just like you said, they're colluding.

984
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,830
But the key point is that

985
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,660
Sun Mingshan never mentioned a word of this to me.

986
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,190
It seems that you've thought ahead.

987
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,570
With age comes wisdom.

988
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,590
Nowadays, too many people

989
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,590
lack this sense of contract.

990
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,260
When they need to go to court,

991
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,260
they use the lawyer as a tool.

992
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,670
But once the situation changes,

993
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,860
they'll step on the lawyer to climb higher,

994
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,760
and in the end, they'll just kick the lawyer aside.

995
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,480
So, are you suggesting that

996
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,000
the situation we are worried about

997
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,610
has already happened in this case?

998
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,130
What should we do, Ms. Fang?

999
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,400
I have no experience in this.

1000
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,150
You must know more than I do.

1001
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,920
What should we do?

1002
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,690
Mingshan Group hasn't mentioned

1003
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,100
anything to you?

1004
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,710
Yes, I talked to them on the phone yesterday

1005
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,510
and they didn't mention a word.

1006
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,440
What about the enforcement?

1007
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,420
Are they still going ahead with it?

1008
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,760
They've been pushing me, asking me to hurry up.

1009
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,620
I went to the court today and submitted the application.

1010
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,790
That means

1011
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,520
they haven't made a deal yet.

1012
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,460
For now, they still need a lawyer.

1013
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,020
Since they haven't brought it up,

1014
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,160
I think you shouldn't either.

1015
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,480
Follow up with the court

1016
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,240
and urge them to move quickly on the enforcement.

1017
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,760
But there's one very important thing:

1018
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,000
the money from the enforcement

1019
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,230
must be in our own hands.

1020
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,910
I remember when you signed the contract,

1021
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,480
didn't you need to set up

1022
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,440
a joint account?

1023
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,540
Yes, it's done.

1024
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,670
I went to the bank today

1025
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,390
with their accountant from Mingshan Group

1026
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,400
and got it done.

1027
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,110
It won't be easy if it's done.

1028
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:24,960
What's wrong?

1029
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,110
Without the other party's approval,

1030
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,850
we can't move the money

1031
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,620
from the joint account.

1032
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,250
But we can move it.

1033
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,840
We can?

1034
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,570
Yes.

1035
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,330
Today, I submitted the agreement

1036
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,960
for the joint account setup

1037
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,880
to the bank.

1038
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,860
The agreement is official,

1039
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
meaning that

1040
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,590
the accountant from Mingshan Group

1041
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,340
took the stamp

1042
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,080
and just stamped it right there.

1043
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,550
But when I submitted it, I handed in two copies.

1044
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,820
These copies give us at Liangcheng Law Firm greater authority.

1045
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,230
As long as we want,

1046
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,720
we can revoke their permissions at any time.

1047
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,400
Did I mess up?

1048
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,090
Did I? Ms. Fang

1049
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,550
No.

1050
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,070
Chen Shuo,

1051
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,260
you did the right thing

1052
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,070
leaving that option open.

1053
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,230
You scared me.

1054
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,360
The way you were looking at me

1055
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,600
made me think I'd made a mistake.

1056
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,370
I'm relieved to hear that.

1057
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,310
That's all.

1058
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,840
I'll get back to work.

1059
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,000
Alright, you go ahead.

1060
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,430
Sorry to bother you, Ms. Fang.

1061
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,010
Come in.

1062
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,480
Mr. Tao.

1063
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,890
Chen Shuo.

1064
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,730
Take a look.

1065
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,180
Look at my complexion. How does it look?

1066
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,810
Looks good. What's up?

1067
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,120
Last time you said you needed someone for the Wanhe Case.

1068
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,380
You said I look pale and asked me to rest.

1069
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,080
Now I've rested,

1070
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,420
and you see,

1071
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,500
we've won the first trial

1072
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,640
for the Mingshan Case.

1073
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,710
I have nothing to do now.

1074
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,710
I can join the Wanhe Case.

1075
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,440
Although you've won the case,

1076
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,290
it hasn't been enforced yet.

1077
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,400
The enforcement part is fine.

1078
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,260
I just discussed it with Ms. Fang,

1079
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
and there's nothing to worry about.

1080
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,030
Right now, the Wanhe Case is the key.

1081
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,590
And I think the Wanhe Case

1082
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,360
is really similar to a case

1083
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,220
I saw before—

1084
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,790
the Zhucheng Case.

1085
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,590
So, let me join you.

1086
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,980
I'll definitely be of great help.

1087
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,100
Chen Shuo,

1088
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,120
if you told me earlier,

1089
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,720
I would have let you join.

1090
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,710
But now,

1091
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,030
the team is full.

1092
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,990
The case is big, and so are the benefits.

1093
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,000
If I add you in,

1094
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,380
that's one less share of the money.

1095
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,940
Think from my point of view.

1096
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,190
I really can't explain it

1097
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,690
to other partners.

1098
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,790
Don't worry, Mr. Tao.

1099
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,540
I won't make things difficult for you.

1100
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,490
I just want to contribute my small part

1101
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,530
to our firm.

1102
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,980
I know you too well, Chen Shuo.

1103
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,640
You want to make more money.

1104
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,250
The Mingshan Case is enough.

1105
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,880
That's enough.

1106
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
You see right through me.

1107
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,750
You know me well, Mr. Tao.

1108
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,250
Fine.

1109
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,070
If you need anything,

1110
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,300
just call me, okay?

1111
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:16,990
No problem.

1112
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:17,890
I'm leaving.

1113
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,870
He won't let me join?

1114
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,900
Mentor.

1115
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,570
What's wrong with you?

1116
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,000
Why aren't you focusing on your studies? Where are you going?

1117
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,290
Minghai Group is actually negotiating with Mingshan Group,

1118
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,700
and I've heard

1119
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,210
the government is involved in the coordination.

1120
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,900
They're setting us up, aren't they?

1121
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,370
You've been running around these days?

1122
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,480
Yes, Mentor.

1123
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,670
What should we do?

1124
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,610
I'll handle it myself.

1125
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,470
I'm going out.

1126
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,240
Where are you going?

1127
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,430
Thank you.

1128
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,320
Prepare for the exam.
