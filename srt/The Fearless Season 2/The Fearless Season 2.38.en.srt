00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,890
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,430
I'm available.

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,640
Do you need me to pick you up?

5
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,430
No need.

6
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,610
I've already called a car.

7
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,479
Mr. Chen is waiting for you inside.

8
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,150
Thank you.

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,950
You've already ordered coffee for me?

10
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,940
Give me a hug.

11
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,400
I've missed you so much.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,510
Mind the place.

13
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,710
That's enough hugging.

14
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,770
I don't care about them.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,520
Alright.

16
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,410
Where's the ring?

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Don't tell me you lost it.

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
If you lost it, you're in big trouble.

19
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,160
I took it off when I showered and forgot to put it back on.

20
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,500
You took it off and forgot to put it back on?

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
That means this ring isn't important to you.

22
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,829
Maybe it's too light.

23
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,400
What happened?

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,590
You didn't even tell me when you got back.

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,150
How could I dare to tell you?

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,910
After the court session,

27
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,720
certain someone never contacted me again.

28
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,960
I didn't dare to ask about it either.

29
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,530
Your logic is impeccable.

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,710
You've been waiting for me here, huh?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,470
Let's talk about Li Yuan's case.

32
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,590
Let's not talk about it.

33
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,800
I made my position very clear in court.

34
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,670
Then let me express myself first.

35
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,870
I admit,

36
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,110
I...

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,840
I was not professional in court.

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,920
It was indeed mixed with many personal emotions.

39
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,910
Many of my words were directed at you.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,500
But don't you think you're also at fault?

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,920
Your reaction wasn't right.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,800
I think you're not only doing this for Li Yuan's case.

43
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,000
Because what you said to me,

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,960
it was downright hostile.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
So I really want to ask,

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,750
what's your reason?

47
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,630
Why don't you set an example? Okay?

48
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,300
You go first.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,910
My story is too long.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,800
We're about the same age.

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
Whose story will be short?

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,870
Alright, I'll go first then.

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,680
I

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,240
actually had two reasons for taking this case.

55
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,800
The first one is,

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,300
it was introduced by an acquaintance.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,190
I couldn't refuse.

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
The second one,

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,310
okay, the second one is the key point.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
Because of my mother.

61
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,950
When my mother was about to pass away,

62
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,390
the kind of decision I faced

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,560
was the same as Li Yuan's.

64
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,960
Signing to give up treatment?

65
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,390
But I was too timid.

66
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,490
I didn't dare to sign.

67
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,990
My father signed it in the end.

68
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,870
Because my father was also getting old,

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,950
I always felt

70
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,830
that I should be the one to bear these responsibilities.

71
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,880
I was truly in a lot of pain at that time.

72
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,830
No matter how rational I tried to be,

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,270
as soon as I entered that hospital room,

74
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,240
I was just my mother's daughter.

75
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,320
But later, when I gave up on her,

76
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,240
my mother became

77
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,920
just a flat line on the monitor.

78
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,360
Then she completely

79
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,520
said goodbye to this world.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
So, can you understand?

81
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,850
The decision to give up treatment,

82
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,270
whoever makes it

83
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,870
carries thorns forever.

84
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,190
This is also why

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,130
I chose to be Li Yuan's agent.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,240
When I met Li Yuan,

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,040
I felt like it was as if the universe, in some mysterious way,

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
was destined to give me an answer.

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,680
It was also from that moment

90
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,820
I treated Li Yuan

91
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,620
as if she were my younger self.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,430
We're all women here.

93
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,260
Do you agree with

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,050
how I handled the situation with Yuan Gang?

95
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,750
Ms. Li,

96
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,190
we are lawyers.

97
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,360
If we were to act as your lawyers,

98
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,190
we

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,000
would fully understand your decision

100
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,080
and respect your wishes.

101
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,230
I subconsciously hoped

102
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,270
to prove with a verdict

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,980
that my decision was right.

104
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,390
So now,

105
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,350
do you still think this approach

106
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,540
is still correct?

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,750
When we lost the case,

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,330
I was quite dazed.

109
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,190
I went to ask my father

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,010
if he regretted

111
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,720
giving up on my mom.

112
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,920
But he told me

113
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,250
that he and my mother had long decided

114
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,150
to leave this world with dignity.

115
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,480
His words

116
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,750
made me feel quite relieved.

117
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,080
So I became even more certain

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,310
that my decision wasn't wrong.

119
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,800
Same in Li Yuan's case.

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,310
We lost the lawsuit,

121
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,720
but

122
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,800
I still very much agree with Li Yuan.

123
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,720
It's like recognizing my former self.

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,720
Luo Yingzi,

125
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,320
I'm quite envious of you, you know.

126
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,630
I'm not as self-contained as you are.

127
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,950
I don't have

128
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,630
such a sensible father,

129
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,800
nor do I have a fortunate mother

130
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,630
who met a man who loves her so deeply.

131
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,800
The only similarity between us is that

132
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,160
our mothers were critically ill,

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,870
and our fathers were the ones who ultimately

134
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,470
made the decision to let them go.

135
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,390
But the difference is,

136
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,110
my father doesn't love my mother.

137
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,070
He had an affair.

138
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,310
As to my mother's illness,

139
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,480
everyone knows there's no hope.

140
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,670
My mother knows it too.

141
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,310
But my mother is human after all.

142
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,590
and humans have fear.

143
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,590
She's afraid of loneliness

144
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,270
and being abandoned.

145
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
Yet my father still abandoned her.

146
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,130
That's the basic situation.

147
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
You brought her in too late.

148
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,750
The cancer has already spread.

149
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,200
Surgery is no longer effective.

150
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,630
I called you here to discuss

151
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,870
the next steps for treatment.

152
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,870
If we pursue aggressive treatment,

153
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,550
that means chemotherapy.

154
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,070
Does the patient have medical insurance?

155
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,020
No.

156
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,530
Her health has always been poor.

157
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,190
She retired early and went home a few years ago.

158
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
Then you need to consider

159
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,060
whether it's worth such a high cost

160
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,270
for treatment that won't make much difference.

161
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,230
Is there any other option?

162
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,140
Then we give up on treatment.

163
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,570
We won't do any unnecessary treatments or life-saving measures.

164
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,830
Once you've discussed it with your spouse,

165
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,970
she can be discharged.

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,270
Let's give up then.

167
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,080
Anyway, later on...

168
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,790
He...

169
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,150
He got what he wanted.

170
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
He signed the papers.

171
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,960
My mom was discharged from the hospital immediately.

172
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,330
Of course.

173
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,220
I didn't

174
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,590
tell my mom about my dad's affair.

175
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,510
After she was discharged,

176
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,440
my dad started making all kinds of excuses every day,

177
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,010
saying he was busy with work

178
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,320
and not coming home at all.

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,200
And my mom was pretty naive,

180
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,190
she didn't ask or suspect anything.

181
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,550
She just obediently went to stay at my grandmother's house.

182
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
But in reality,

183
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,600
from the moment my dad signed those papers,

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,270
my mom was essentially in a

185
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,440
state of waiting to die.

186
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,630
Before she passed away,

187
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,360
she kept calling out my dad's name.

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
But my dad never showed up.

189
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,690
I don't know where he was.

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Soon after,

191
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,910
my mom passed away.

192
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,360
Then my dad had a flash marriage,

193
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,670
and I was left at my grandmother's house.

194
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,630
Maybe you were right.

195
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,270
You didn't tell your mother about your father.

196
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
At least your mother

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
didn't leave this world

198
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,630
with double despair.

199
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,390
But I often ask myself,

200
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,510
what if back then

201
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,670
I had told my mom about his affair?

202
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,910
Maybe then my mom wouldn't have trusted my dad so easily.

203
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,180
She wouldn't have given

204
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
the right to choose and accept treatment

205
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,350
to my dad

206
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,450
and let him make a decision.

207
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,870
Would she have lived longer then?

208
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,440
Of course, this is all hindsight now.

209
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,360
No, let's not talk about it anymore.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,150
So, let's get back to

211
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,340
Yuan Gang's case.

212
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,870
I still believe

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,000
that Li Yuan has no right

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,790
to decide Yuan Gang's life or death.

215
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,590
I insist on this point strongly.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,990
Chen Shuo, I think

217
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,570
you're overthinking this a bit.

218
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,730
Yuan Gang is different from your mother,

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,440
and my client, Li Yuan,

220
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,210
is also different from your father.

221
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,790
Her decision

222
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,510
isn't influenced by any other factors.

223
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,870
On the contrary, your client,

224
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,930
Yuan Gang's mother, Ms. Cui,

225
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,180
I think the way she loves her son

226
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,660
is

227
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,080
extremely irrational,

228
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,510
subjective,

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
and self-indulgent.

230
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,390
I disagree.

231
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,870
I think there's nothing wrong with Ms. Cui.

232
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,870
She's a mother,

233
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,700
Which mother doesn't love her son?

234
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,790
Right?

235
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
I believe what Ms. Cui did is what

236
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,080
most mothers in the world

237
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,720
would do and decide on

238
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,480
when faced with this situation.

239
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,720
I understand her.

240
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,960
Most?

241
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,720
All.

242
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,600
All of them.

243
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,790
Okay.

244
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,550
Alright, alright, let's not talk about it anymore.

245
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,170
It's a heavy topic.

246
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,020
Let's order, okay? Let's eat.

247
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,960
Luo Yingzi,

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm just curious to ask,

249
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,190
if one day I end up like Yuan Gang,

250
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,120
what would you choose?

251
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,710
Are you signing it

252
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,750
or not?

253
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,700
Are you giving up the treatment

254
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,030
or continue the treatment?

255
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,720
Wait a minute.

256
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,950
You knelt down, gave me a ring,

257
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,210
and proposed.

258
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,510
You don't have some kind of illness, do you?

259
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,670
Don't jinx me.

260
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm perfectly healthy.

261
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,720
We're here to discuss the case,

262
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,670
let's stick to the facts.

263
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,240
Why are you dragging us into this?

264
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,750
Why can't I relate it to us?

265
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,030
I'm asking you, didn't I propose?

266
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,480
You accepted, did you?

267
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,910
So we're united as one now.

268
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,000
We're one entity.

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,860
How is my question baseless?

270
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,510
You're being ridiculous.

271
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,750
Chen Shuo, this kind of question is

272
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,720
a purely hypothetical one.

273
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,600
It's like you're imagining in your head

274
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,840
that you've

275
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
won a hundred million in the lottery.

276
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,510
And...

277
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,150
"How should I spend this? It's so much money.

278
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,870
Where should I hide it? Where should I keep it?"

279
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
Does that make any sense?

280
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,270
It's absurd.

281
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,240
If you're going to be like that, I could ask too.

282
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,790
What if I was the one lying there?

283
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,840
What would you choose?

284
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,630
Would you sign or not?

285
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,440
I wouldn't sign.

286
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,150
I could never sign.

287
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,030
No matter what, I wouldn't sign.

288
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,230
I'd stay with you until the very end.

289
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd be by your side.

290
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
No, no, no.

291
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,600
I hope you would sign.

292
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,230
Because I also hope

293
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,690
to die with dignity,

294
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,910
to leave this world with dignity.

295
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,030
I'm back.

296
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,270
I won't give up.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Ms. Luo.

298
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,970
I'm here again.

299
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,220
I have a new case for you.

300
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,450
Mr. Chen.

301
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,050
Bad news.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,790
Don't panic,

303
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,990
take it slow. What's wrong?

304
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,200
Li Yuan

305
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,150
wants to divorce Yuan Gang.

306
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,240
Did she mention it before?

307
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,320
A while ago,

308
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,970
she briefly mentioned it to me.

309
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,120
I didn't take it too seriously.

310
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,600
Didn't we just win our lawsuit recently?

311
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,910
She was still acting like before,

312
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,030
taking turns with me to go to the hospital

313
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,150
to take care of Yuan Gang.

314
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,090
But two days ago,

315
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
she told me

316
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,790
that she's planning to divorce Yuan Gang.

317
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,480
I thought she had lost the lawsuit

318
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,440
and was just venting her emotions.

319
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,390
But unexpectedly,

320
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,480
I received the summons

321
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,840
from the court today.

322
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,900
Mr. Chen, what should we do?

323
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,480
It's okay, don't worry.

324
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,440
Receiving a summons is normal.

325
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,670
The question now is,

326
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,330
we don't know who the opposing counsel is.

327
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,060
It doesn't matter who it is,

328
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,310
as long as it's not Luo Yingzi.

329
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,260
What if it's still them?

330
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,550
Think about it.

331
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,320
They didn't continue to appeal.

332
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,790
Maybe

333
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,790
they might want to play this card.

334
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,600
This idea might

335
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,500
have come from Ms. Luo.

336
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,530
Mr. Chen, you must help me.

337
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,150
We can't let them get divorced.

338
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,300
If they do,

339
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,100
it would be the death of Yuan Gang.

340
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,360
Mr. Chen.

341
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,840
Mr. Xue.

342
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,240
I have a question to ask.

343
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,320
Given Yuan Gang's current condition,

344
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,440
can he get a divorce?

345
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,320
Is it legally supported?

346
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,250
Yes, it is.

347
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,720
Ms. Cui,

348
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,180
the primary factor in divorce

349
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,120
is whether the couple's relationship

350
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,790
has broken down irretrievably.

351
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,630
Given the current situation,

352
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,030
your son is in a state of brain death.

353
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,980
The court may not grant a divorce on the first petition,

354
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,030
but if Li Yuan insists,

355
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,930
the court will eventually grant it.

356
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,030
But don't worry,

357
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,180
both spouses

358
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,960
have a mutual obligation to support each other.

359
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,400
Even after divorce,

360
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
the court will require Li Yuan

361
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,160
to provide some financial assistance

362
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,829
to Yuan Gang.

363
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not about the money.

364
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:13,790
Besides,

365
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,109
Li Yuan has said she's giving up her property rights.

366
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,030
I'm not trying to

367
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,680
fight with her over property issues now.

368
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Then, if I may ask,

369
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,560
why are you doing this now?

370
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,349
Actually, at this point,

371
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,880
you've already obtained guardianship of Yuan Gang.

372
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,030
In other words, you've secured Yuan Gang's care.

373
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,660
I think

374
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,400
there's no need to use this marriage

375
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,380
to hold Li Yuan hostage anymore.

376
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,850
I'm not holding Li Yuan hostage.

377
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,160
Mr. Chen,

378
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,070
although we have different views on the matter of life and death,

379
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,510
Li Yuan and I have different opinions,

380
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,510
but I know in my heart

381
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,920
that she truly cares for Yuan Gang.

382
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,960
Her care for Yuan Gang

383
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,880
is irreplaceable.

384
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,880
You haven't taken care of brain-dead patients,

385
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,510
you really don't understand.

386
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,990
Please don't worry,

387
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,750
there are actually many other ways.

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,750
If worst comes to worst,

389
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,350
we can hire someone to help you

390
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,350
take care of Yuan Gang together.

391
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,200
Letting strangers take care of my son?

392
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
I can't accept that.

393
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,800
You have no idea

394
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,030
how hard it is to take care of Yuan Gang.

395
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,310
How can I explain this to you?

396
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,550
Oh, right.

397
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,720
I've seen some patients

398
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,160
being cared for by strangers.

399
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,030
To put it bluntly,

400
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,830
those patients are like

401
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,680
a piece of meat being turned over in their hands.

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
With Yuan Gang's current condition,

403
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,690
he can't even defecate on his own anymore.

404
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,130
We have to help him with everything.

405
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,000
Also,

406
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,880
he often needs manual suctioning of phlegm.

407
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,600
His lung infection

408
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,920
has gotten out of control.

409
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,630
His trachea has been opened,

410
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,350
and now without the tubes,

411
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,850
he simply can't survive.

412
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,850
I... I don't know how much longer I can live.

413
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,350
I don't know how long

414
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,710
my limited assets can sustain us.

415
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,790
I just hope there's someone who loves him

416
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,990
who can stay by his side, care for him, and accompany him.

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,480
If Li Yuan is gone,

418
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,920
I really don't know what will happen to my son.

419
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,830
Alright.

420
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,270
I'll leave it to you then.

421
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
Don't worry.

422
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,510
However,

423
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,640
Yuan Gang has only been in a brain-dead state for half a year.

424
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
So I estimate

425
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,350
the first lawsuit won't result in a divorce.

426
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,270
But as long as we persist with the appeal,

427
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,400
after waiting another half year,

428
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,310
the second lawsuit should result in a divorce judgment.

429
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,440
I understand.

430
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,590
You can send me the agreement anytime once it's ready.

431
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,480
Alright.

432
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,350
Xia Shu, please see her out.

433
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,830
Okay.

434
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,350
Goodbye.

435
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,440
Are you still going to take it?

436
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,970
Of course I will. Why not?

437
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,980
How about I take it this time?

438
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,440
Why?

439
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,400
Most people certainly won't understand Li Yuan's actions.

440
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,350
After the custody case is over,

441
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
you've seen the online reactions.

442
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,110
Besides, the opposing representative this time

443
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,370
will definitely be Chen Shuo again.

444
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,130
After the last case was over,

445
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
it already affected your relationship.

446
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,160
I'm afraid if you take this case again,

447
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,000
you two might end up...

448
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,750
You're just afraid we'll break up,

449
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,440
so you don't want me to take it,

450
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
and you want to take it yourself, right?

451
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,180
Well, that's not entirely true.

452
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,180
Last time I sympathized with Yuan Gang,

453
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,740
this time I sympathize with Li Yuan.

454
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,810
So let me handle the case.

455
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
I'm fine with it.

456
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm fine with it too.

457
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,170
I'm taking the case.

458
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,960
Don't you want to think about Chen Shuo?

459
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,960
I've already talked to Chen Shuo before.

460
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,270
As for him,

461
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,070
he has his own obsessions.

462
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,510
And I have my own principles.

463
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,880
Emotionally,

464
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm on his side.

465
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,940
But professionally, I'm just like you.

466
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,830
I don't want to mix emotions with work.

467
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,750
We're all adults.

468
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,510
We can only defend our own values.

469
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm not just arguing for Li Yuan,

470
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,510
but also for these values.

471
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,630
Yuan Gang is already brain dead.

472
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,770
But what about his mother?

473
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,200
She still chooses

474
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,680
to keep him by her side

475
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
in this way.

476
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,110
That's her choice.

477
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,180
Given that,

478
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,750
Li Yuan is also an individual.

479
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,480
Why can't she choose to divorce?

480
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,980
Right?

481
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,510
Yuan Gang's mother

482
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,110
can't make her own choice

483
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,510
at the cost of someone else sacrificing their entire life.

484
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,500
So I must take this case.

485
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
Alright then.

486
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,830
Next time in court,

487
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,310
don't be at loggerheads with each other.

488
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,640
Try to be a bit more moderate, okay?

489
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,590
Okay.

490
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,270
Brother-in-law is here.

491
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,280
Who?

492
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,680
Speak of the devil.

493
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,550
I'll leave you two to talk.

494
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
-Are you talking about me?
-Let’s go.

495
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,070
Let's go.

496
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,480
Mr. Chen, the great lawyer,

497
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,750
what brings you here?

498
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
That's enough, no need to smooth it out.

499
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,530
I saw it.

500
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,800
You're wearing the ring.

501
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,700
What's the matter?

502
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,780
I saw Li Yuan on the way up here.

503
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm her agent for a lawsuit.

504
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,350
You suggested

505
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,170
to propose a divorce, right?

506
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,560
Divorce is not my suggestion,

507
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,550
but I agree.

508
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,930
So for this new case, I'm still

509
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,750
her attorney.

510
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,040
Do you have to take this case?

511
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,870
Yes.

512
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,680
No matter who takes it,

513
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,270
it's better than you standing across me.

514
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,260
Then you don't take it.

515
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm just kidding.

516
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,800
I support you taking it.

517
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,970
As I said before,

518
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,560
this case isn't the answer to our relationship.

519
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,170
It's just a case,

520
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
it's our respective jobs.

521
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,760
In this case,

522
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,000
we're just lawyers defending our respective clients

523
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,310
and our own values.

524
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,630
So don't worry too much.

525
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,200
Relax, okay?

526
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,370
Have you made up your mind?

527
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,830
I have.

528
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,710
See you in court.

529
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm leaving.

530
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,690
Is there anything else?

531
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,640
No, nothing.

532
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,830
Chen Shuo.

533
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,110
The divorce dispute case between Li Yuan and Yuan Gang

534
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,510
is now in session.

535
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,240
The criterion for divorce in Chinese law

536
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,030
is the irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship.

537
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,500
In this case,

538
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,270
the defendant is in a state of brain death.

539
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,080
Whether physically, psychologically,

540
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,200
or emotionally,

541
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,440
he is unable to fulfill marital obligations.

542
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,240
The defendant is already "dead",

543
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,870
while our client is still alive.

544
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,990
Her life continues,

545
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,070
and she is unwilling

546
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,350
sacrifice herself

547
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,400
for a formal marriage.

548
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,410
If the defendant guardian

549
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,720
is willing to allow Mr. Yuan Gang

550
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,830
to continue living in such a manner,

551
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,240
that is her choice.

552
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,120
She should be responsible

553
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,250
for her own decision,

554
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,640
rather than forcing our client

555
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,150
to make sacrifices for it.

556
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,060
Therefore,

557
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,110
we firmly request a divorce from the defendant, Yuan Gang.

558
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,090
As someone who once deeply loved Yuan Gang,

559
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,840
our client is willing

560
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,620
to leave all their jointly owned property,

561
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,240
including stocks, bank deposits, cars,

562
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,400
and all other assets,

563
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,070
to the defendant's guardian

564
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,090
to facilitate hiring someone to care for the defendant.

565
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,630
Let me handle this?

566
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,600
I'm fine with it.

567
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,440
The last time both parties were in this courtroom

568
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,110
confronting each other

569
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,200
was a month ago.

570
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,880
The focus of the debate was whether Mr. Yuan Gang

571
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,590
was actually dead or not.

572
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,200
A month later,

573
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,350
the plaintiff in this case, Ms. Li Yuan,

574
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,710
reported her husband Yuan Gang

575
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,720
to court,

576
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,320
seeking a divorce from him.

577
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,470
This proves

578
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,540
that you actually acknowledge

579
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,000
that Mr. Yuan Gang

580
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
is a person,

581
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,660
a living person.

582
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,610
It's just that due to severe injury,

583
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,440
he has lost his ability to move.

584
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,240
Our country's law stipulates

585
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
that spouses have the obligation to support each other.

586
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,680
Now,

587
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,620
Mr. Yuan Gang has only been in a coma for half a year,

588
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,730
yet Ms. Li Yuan, who claims to love him dearly,

589
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,520
is eager to leave him.

590
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,980
I can't help but ask,

591
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,570
the love you keep talking about,

592
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,580
did it ever really exist?

593
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,100
What are spouses?

594
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,330
Among all familial relationships,

595
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,070
the marital relationship

596
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,150
is the only one that needs to be established by law.

597
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
When a man and a woman

598
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,540
voluntarily

599
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,330
decide to become husband and wife,

600
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,110
it means

601
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,160
they have already fallen deeply in love with each other.

602
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,790
They are willing to entrust their lives

603
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,760
to each other,

604
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,790
allowing two lives to become one,

605
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,830
forming a more complete life.

606
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,880
Your Honor,

607
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,030
among all the evidence we've submitted,

608
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,200
there is a video

609
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,290
of Ms. Li Yuan and Mr. Yuan Gang

610
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,720
taken at their wedding.

611
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,040
I now humbly request the court's permission to play it.

612
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,190
Permission granted.

613
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,470
Ms. Li Yuan,

614
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,830
do you take Mr. Yuan Gang

615
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,150
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

616
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,630
to marry him,

617
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,070
for better, for worse,

618
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,920
♫You bring me silent♫

619

in sickness and in health,

621
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,360

623
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,160

624
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,710
Do you

625
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,290
take this vow?

626
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,570

630

for richer, for poorer,

637
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,470
in sickness and in health,

638
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,960
before I met you,

639
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,200
I never thought about getting married.

640
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,330
After meeting you,

641
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,880
I don't want to be alone anymore.

642
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,350
This is love.

643
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,250
This is marriage.

644
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,090

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,020
The wedding vows seem to still echo in our ears.

♫Through your eyes♫

648
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,340
♫To deep inside♫

649

Her husband has just been in a coma for half a year,

650
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,680
and she's already eager to leave him.

651
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,120
Isn't this disheartening?

652
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,840
♫Hold me tighter♫

653
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,760

♫I'll never wander♫

655
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,880
if our marriage

656
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,830
cannot provide us with a sense of inner peace

657
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,200
in this turbulent world,

658
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,840
♫It pulls me♫

♫Slower it drags me deeper♫

662
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,110
the meaning of love?

663
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,880
What is the purpose

664
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,650
of having this family?

665
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,680
All rise.

666
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,830
The court believes

667
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,880
that spouses have a legal obligation to support each other.

668
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,060
♫You bring me silent♫

669
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,790
The plaintiff and defendant in this case

670
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,470
have a deep emotional foundation.

671
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,020
The marital relationship between the two parties has not broken down.

672
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,180
♫Though the time has faded♫

673
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,540
Therefore, this court rules

674
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,370
to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit.

675
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,880
♫You take me through the night♫

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,250

♫And see me through the light♫

681
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,030
It's okay.

682
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,460
I will file another lawsuit.

683
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:24,940
Alright.

684
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,910
We can arrange to meet together in a few days.

685
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,560
♫Tell me slow♫

686
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,680

♫Don't let me go♫

688
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,750
Have a quick chat.

689
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,680
You can go ahead first.

690
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,970
♫Through your eyes♫

691
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,030
OK.

692
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,960
Well, you've won against me twice now.

693
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,200
What's so special about that?

694
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
I can win against you even more times.

695
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,590
Let's go.

696
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,740
I said we'd have a quick chat.

697
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,990
Is Li Yuan still going to file another lawsuit?

698
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,450
Yes.

699
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,680
Yingzi,

700
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,190
my request is simple.

701
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,700
Can we both drop this case?

702
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,210
This case,

703
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,030
I still need to continue with it.

704
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,790
Because I have to be accountable

705
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,920
for the agreement I signed with my client.

706
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,870
I have to be responsible.

707
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,920
As I've said before,

708
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,790
can you please relax a bit?

709
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,480
It's just a job.

710
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,480
Don't let it affect

711
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,350
our relationship and feelings for each other.

712
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,200
Have some faith in me,

713
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,110
okay?

714
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,870
I'll try my best.

715
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,870
Stop being pretentious.

716
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,620
Let's go, treat me to a meal.

717
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,690
What are you treating me to for winning?

718
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,000
You choose.

719
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,190
What should I order?

720
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,350
Didn't you file for divorce?

721
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,250
Why are you still coming here?

722
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,950
Let me do it.

723
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,440
It's not necessary.

724
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,240
Let me do it.

725
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,210
No.

726
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,990
You can't handle him alone.

727
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,810
Why don't you hire a caregiver?

728
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,500
You already know the answer.

729
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,810
As if a caregiver could take good care of him.

730
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,960
Can they guarantee to turn him

731
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,110
every two hours?

732
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,400
Can they guarantee to suction his phlegm

733
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,960
thoroughly and completely?

734
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,770
Can they guarantee to treat Yuan Gang

735
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,190
like a human being?

736
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,960
I can't stand by and watch them

737
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,270
torment my son like this.

738
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,350
No way.

739
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,550
Why don't you take a break? I'll take over.

740
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,810
If you continue to be this stubborn,

741
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,350
it will only

742
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,310
add more burden to Yuan Gang and yourself.

743
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,760
Why don't you just say I will adde more burden to you?

744
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,090
He's my son.

745
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,110
I can take good care of him.

746
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,850
You don't need to worry about it, okay?

747
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,680
If you have something to say, just say it.

748
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,570
If not, please leave.

749
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,100
I came here to tell you

750
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,100
that I will continue to appeal for divorce.

751
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,590
You want to divorce him,

752
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,690
isn't this just a tactic

753
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,590
to force me to give up my son?

754
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,000
You know very well

755
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,150
that I can't take care of him alone

756
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,500
and I need your help.

757
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,650
You've decided to abandon him.

758
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,350
Li Yuan,

759
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
how can you be so heartless?

760
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,710
Mom,

761
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,340
why won't you believe

762
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,800
that you can't bear to part with him,

763
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,280
and neither can I?

764
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
It's not that I don't want to take care of him,

765
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,400
but I really can't bear

766
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,510
to see the person I love

767
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,310
lying here

768
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,540
in this condition.

769
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,830
I've been dreaming about him lately.

770
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,340
In my dreams, he has no facial features,

771
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,970
no expression, no voice,

772
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,360
but I know what he wants to say.

773
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,790
He wants to leave.

774
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,679
When did you give him phlegm today?

775
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,150
What's wrong?

776
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,199
Blood oxygen is dropping.

777
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,170
Doctor!

778
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,610
Doctor!

779
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,600
Doctor!

780
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,210
Doctor!

781
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,940
Doctor!

782
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Family members, please leave.

783
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,190
1 mg of epinephrine, intravenous push.

784
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,530
Suction the patient's phlegm immediately.

785
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,699
The patient still has no heartbeat.

786
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,190
Give another 1 mg of epinephrine,

787
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,000
intravenous push.

788
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,370
1 mg of epinephrine, intravenous push.

789
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,800
Three minutes later, if the patient's heartbeat still hasn't returned,

790
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,190
give another 1 mg of epinephrine,

791
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,070
intravenous push.

792
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,240
Our patient

793
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,970
suffered cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation.

794
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,660
We've done everything we can to save him,

795
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,880
but the patient's heartbeat hasn't returned.

796
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,310
If this continues,

797
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,880
it will lead to ischemia and hypoxia,

798
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,260
causing severe damage to various organ functions.

799
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,320
Moreover, prolonged chest compressions

800
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,230
can result in rib fractures.

801
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,560
You should be mentally prepared.

802
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,100
Should we continue the rescue?

803
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,630
Save him.

804
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,760
The patient's heartbeat still hasn't resumed.

805
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,510
Zhao, suction the patient's airway once more.

806
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,540
Okay, suctioning once.

807
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,520
Wang, administer 1 mg of epinephrine intravenously.

808
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,230
1 mg of epinephrine, intravenous push.

809
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,240
The patient's heartbeat has resumed.

810
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,710
Yuan Gang's family,

811
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,190
Yuan Gang's heart has now resumed beating.

812
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,520
Thank you.

813
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,760
Thank you.

814
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,510
Thank you.

815
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,930
Let me reiterate one more time.

816
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:08,640
The defendant will bear all medical expenses of the plaintiff,

817
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,070
and cover the medical expenses owed by the plaintiff.

818
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,550
The plaintiff withdraws all other claims.

819
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,500
Both parties have reached an agreement.

820
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,650
Is that correct?

821
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,210
Yes.

822
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,560
Yes.

823
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,330
This is the mediation agreement.

824
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,280
Both parties, please review and confirm.

825
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,540
If you have no objections,

826
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,580
you can sign it.

827
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,920
The court specifically emphasizes

828
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,410
that this mediation is based on the principle of voluntary participation.

829
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,180
Once signed, it takes effect immediately

830
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,540
and becomes legally binding.

831
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,740
It cannot be revoked,

832
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,710
and cannot be appealed.

833
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,560
Do both parties understand?

834
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,820
Understood.

835
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,680
Understood.

836
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,260
Then please sign.

837
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,560
Ms. Cui,

838
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,810
it's not too late to change your mind.

839
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,400
Once you sign,

840
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
there's no going back.

841
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,030
Your Honor,

842
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,430
during the process of trying to save my son that day,

843
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,670
I saw Li Yuan's sincerity.

844
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,620
I suddenly realized something.

845
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,120
Yuan Gang will never wake up again.

846
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,720
Leaving behind only a suffering body

847
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,380
and making the two women he loved most in this world

848
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,990
torment each other,

849
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,610
I don't think this is what he would have wanted.

850
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,510
I should stand in my son's shoes

851
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,920
and consider things for Li Yuan.

852
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,520
She's still young.

853
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,340
She can start over in many ways.

854
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,600
I don't regret my decision.

855
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,490
Mom,

856
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,500
we both lost Yuan Gang.

857
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,130
I have no parents,

858
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,320
and you've lost your son.

859
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,400
From now on,

860
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,470

00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,830
♫In our sky♫

936
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,940
♫She will always wait for me♫

937
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,800
Whether it's going well or bad,

938
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,570
wealth or poverty,

939
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,220
in sickness and in health,

940
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,670
before I met you,

941
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,730
I never thought about getting married.

942
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,190
After meeting you,

943
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,760
I don't want to be alone anymore.

944
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,520
This is what love is.

945
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,350
This is marriage.

946
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,610
If love is so fragile,

947
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,510
if our marriage can't help us find

948
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,930
in this turbulent world,

949
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,910
a home where our hearts are at peace,

950
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,150
what's

951
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,180
the meaning of love?

952
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,320
What is the purpose

953
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,410
of having this family?
