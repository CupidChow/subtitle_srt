00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,150
I've made up my mind.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm going to pursue this lawsuit.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Okay.

6
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,640
I'm going to sue.

7
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,850
But suing...

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
I might lose, right?

9
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,430
But I don't care anymore.

10
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,850
I've been hesitating,

11
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,780
especially since that day when the lawyer mentioned that

12
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,000
Liu Jianming is living in hardship.

13
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,680
I was thinking,

14
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,680
since I'm living better than him,

15
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,070
is it too much for me

16
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,840
to sue him instead?

17
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,470
But I never expected

18
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,520
them to resort to such despicable means

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
to evade responsibility.

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,910
So, I'm going to sue them.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,560
Ms. Luo,

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,240
don't overthink it.

23
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,090
You haven't done anything wrong.

24
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,680
No, Ms. Xiao.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,680
This is indeed my responsibility.

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,030
I am truly happy

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
to see you so brave,

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,910
but when you mustered your courage,

29
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,520
I missed

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,710
such a good opportunity.

31
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,940
I really feel like

32
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,600
I cannot forgive myself.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,030
Ms. Xiao,

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,710
going to court

35
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,680
is both mentally and physically exhausting.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,520
Given the current situation of this case,

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,870
the possibility of losing is very high.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
We might end up

39
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,470
spending time and money

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,430
only to suffer another round of hurt.

41
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,710
What's the point of that?

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,030
For myself.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,870
Until this morning,

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,280
all the decisions I made

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,220
were influenced by Yang Shu.

46
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,650
I was always afraid, always blaming myself,

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,120
thinking that it was my fault that led to all of this.

48
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,000
But now I understand

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,710
it wasn't me—it was them.

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,470
They are the ones who committed wrongdoing,

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,420
and even after all these years,

52
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,680
they show no awareness or remorse,

53
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,620
acting as if what happened

54
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,840
was justified.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,050
Cowardice and fear in the face of evil

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,540
are tantamount to enabling it.

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
That's why I want to sue them.

58
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,160
Winning isn't the most important thing;

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,570
what matters is standing

60
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,660
in court

61
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,970
and telling everyone what they did to me

62
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,800
and the harm I suffered from

63
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,430
what others might dismiss

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,360
as minor wrongs.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,270
For me, that is enough.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm back.

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,590
You're back.

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,310
Why are you so late?

69
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,660
-I just got off work.
-Let's go.

70
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,520
Where are we going?

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,190
To the Division Chief's house.

72
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,960
Didn't we agree that

73
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,140
Chief Hou has been so supportive of my work,

74
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,829
so we should go and visit.

75
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,779
I was too busy and forgot.

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,899
Alright, let's go.

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,030
Maybe you should change your clothes.

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,580
What's wrong with these clothes?

79
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,310
It's just... I feel like

80
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,680
our outfits don't really match.

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
They do.

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,510
You're in professional attire,

83
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,800
and so am I.

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
That's exactly the problem—it's too formal.

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,000
It's too late.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,740
Honey, change into something else.

87
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,190
Wait,

88
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,550
we're just going to Chief Hou's house, not a banquet.

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,190
No need to change. That's it.

90
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,620
Let's go.

91
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,950
Aren't you in a hurry?

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,670
I'm not changing.

93
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,830
-Let's go quickly.
-Okay.

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,690
Here.

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello.

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
You are...

97
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,750
Are you Ms. Wang?

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm Hou Chief Hou's subordinate, Zhang Quanquan.

99
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,510
This is my wife, Qiu Hua.

100
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,270
Hello. Hello.

101
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,360
We came specifically to visit Chief Hou.

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,960
Sorry,

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,530
but you came at a bad time.

104
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,520
Hou hasn't returned yet—

105
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,610
he's at a meeting at the bureau.

106
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,770
Quanquan, maybe

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,630
we should visit another day.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
This is my fault for not confirming the time.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,990
How about we wait downstairs for a while?

110
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,390
He told me he won't be back until very late.

111
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,830
How about you reschedule for another day.

112
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,500
It's okay.

113
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,310
We'll wait downstairs.

114
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,510
Go inside.

115
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,270
It's okay.

116
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,830
We can wait downstairs.

117
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,000
It's okay. Come in.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,220
I'll contact Hou

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,190
to see what's going on.

120
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,650
Come in.

121
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Well, then, sorry to trouble you.

122
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,900
It's okay. Come in.

123
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,390
Sorry.

124
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,270
It's okay.

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Have a seat.

126
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
Do we need to change shoes?

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,560
No, no.

128
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,870
Fei, hurry up. I need to entertain guests.

129
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,860
Go inside and play with your sister.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't want to; the cartoon just started.

131
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,800
Be good; the guests are waiting.

132
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,990
Be good.

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,750
Hurry up.

134
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,680
Go.

135
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,260
Go.

136
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Are you disobedient?

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,590
I'll tell your dad when he comes back. Go.

138
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm not afraid even if you tell him.

139
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,560
I just want to watch.

140
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Ms. Wang.

141
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,270
Just let him watch.

142
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,660
We're going to wait anyway.

143
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
This is the time

145
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,630
he watches cartoons every day;

146
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,440
so it's become a habit, you see.

147
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,070
We came too suddenly

148
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,240
and disrupted your normal routine.

149
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,120
We're really sorry.

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,800
It's nothing; have a seat.

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,070
I'll make you some tea.

152
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,340
Don't bother.

153
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,030
What's your name?

154
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,150
Mom.

155
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm busy now.

156
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
I'll call you later.

157
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,750
How busy can you be?

158
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,900
What if your mom has something important?

159
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,430
A couple of days ago,

160
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
my dad was sentenced

161
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,960
to 10 years.

162
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,560
My mom has been feeling really down lately

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,830
and keeps calling me.

164
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,270
I don't know what to do.

165
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,920
Wait,

166
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,380
how come you didn't tell us about something

167
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,080
as big as your dad's sentencing?

168
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,610
The more I talk about it, the sadder I get.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,110
I'll just get through it.

170
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,310
Luo, aren't you the same?

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
How can we be the same?

172
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,390
You're still so young.

173
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,159
I just grew up overnight.

174
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,170
I wanted to go back in the last trial,

175
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,480
but my mom wouldn't let me.

176
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,230
She said we could visit him together

177
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,790
after he's eligible for visits.

178
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,160
Besides,

179
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,110
with the mess that Han

180
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,830
left us in Xiao Nannan's case,

181
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,680
I couldn't just run away

182
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
and leave you two to clean up the mess.

183
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,400
Anyway, Xia Shu, just remember this:

184
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,160
whether it's money or manpower you need,

185
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,620
as long as I can be of use,

186
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,560
you just tell me.

187
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you, Luo.

188
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,290
By the way, Qiu Hua has been going through the accounts these days

189
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,190
and mentioned that the second debt repayment

190
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,950
hasn't been settled by Hao Lei yet.

191
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,789
What's going on?

192
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,320
He's currently canvassing for votes

193
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,659
to become the president,

194
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,970
planning to buy equity,

195
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,500
and has a pile of unpaid workers' wages.

196
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,460
What do you mean?

197
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
Are you going to give up the profit

198
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,770
and let go of the money?

199
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
How could that be?

200
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,720
Right now, I'm

201
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,320
helping him win over shareholders

202
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,080
so that once he becomes the president,

203
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,330
he'll give me all the legal business for the year.

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,550
That way, our law firm will have its income secured.

205
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,790
Anyway, Xia Shu, as I've told you before,

206
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,030
the money is only real when it's in your own hands.

207
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,200
Hao Lei is indeed having a tough time,

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,790
but you're also in a difficult position now,

209
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,400
so take care of yourself first.

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,760
I understand.

211
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,410
Luo, I've gone through the legal codes over and over,

212
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,790
and this time Han

213
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,790
has really blocked our path.

214
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,360
It's all my fault for being careless.

215
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
What should we do?

216
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,000
Just keep

217
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,960
exploring new ideas,

218
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,550
see if there's any good strategy left.

219
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,480
You think about it, and I'll think about it too.

220
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,030
Super Wings, transform, fight monsters.

221
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,310
Quanquan, shall we go now?

222
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,830
Wait a bit; the episode just finished.

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,410
Thank you.

224
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,830
Here, have some fruit.

225
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,310
Thank you.

226
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:52,960
Sit down.

227
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,790
Sit properly!

228
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,360
Why are you being so inconsiderate?

229
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,950
I just called Chief Hou,

230
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,440
but he didn't answer.

231
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,240
I guess the meeting hasn't ended yet.

232
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,680
Chief Hou is usually very busy, right?

233
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,320
Yes.

234
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,800
It's just a matter of timing.

235
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,510
As you know,

236
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,790
there are always a lot of personnel changes at work,

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
so Hou is especially busy.

238
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes.

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Of course.

240
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,230
How about

241
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,090
I try calling again?

242
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,750
I'll try calling again.

243
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,720
Thank you so much.

244
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,270
It's okay.

245
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,910
Thank you so much.

246
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,720
It's okay.

247
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Quanquan, I really think

248
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,030
we shouldn't bother them anymore.

249
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,790
I feel like we're overstepping.

250
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,900
Let's wait a little longer,

251
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,870
or else this trip would've been for nothing.

252
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,360
You're already disrupting their personal life;

253
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,080
it's so awkward.

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,790
Don't you feel embarrassed?

255
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,380
Keep your voice down.

256
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,360
Xia Shu,

257
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,390
come look at this.

258
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,390
Check out the last post—

259
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,000
look at this comment.

260
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,820
Well...

261
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,140
Do you notice anything?

262
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,870
Compare the date on this one with the previous one.

263
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,030
I'll call Qiu Hua.

264
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,410
Okay.

265
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,970
This is funny, right?

266
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,680
[Luo Yingzi]

267
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,910
Sorry.

268
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,750
Yingzi, I'm out handling something.

269
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,750
What's wrong?

270
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,100
Where are you?

271
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,630
Can you come to the office right away?

272
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,430
What's going on?

273
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,050
Come quickly.

274
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
We can't wait for tomorrow.

275
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,550
Come here now.

276
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,920
Okay, I'll be there later.

277
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,500
Quanquan, it's getting late.

278
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,310
Let's go.

279
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,410
Go?

280
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,550
I'm so sorry.

281
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,720
Hou isn't answering his phone.

282
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,790
What if something important gets delayed?

283
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,570
No, no.

284
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,490
I'm sure the Chief Hou is just busy with more urgent matters.

285
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,650
He probably won't be available for a while.

286
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,750
We really shouldn't

287
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,670
have disturbed you today;

288
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,770
sorry for the trouble.

289
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,600
Oh, don't say that, it's nothing.

290
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,480
It's nothing.

291
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,600
We're leaving now.

292
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,200
Okay.

293
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,940
Sorry.

294
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,270
Well, my wife and I

295
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,550
will come to visit Chief Hou another time.

296
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,430
Alright, you two can come by again later.

297
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,270
Okay.

298
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,750
No need to see us out.

299
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,480
It's nothing.

300
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,670
We'll visit you next time. Goodbye, Ms. Wang.

301
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,520
Okay.

302
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay, come again.

303
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,750
Sorry to bother you.

304
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,270
He's so cute.

305
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,750
Bye.

306
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,870
It's okay. Bye.

307
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,670
Sorry to bother you.

308
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,750
My law firm has an emergency.

309
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,720
You can just drop me off

310
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,030
at the entrance of the firm later.

311
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,680
Okay.

312
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,680
No wonder

313
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,500
you were going to leave after just half an hour.

314
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,460
Turns out you've got something to deal with.

315
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,140
It's a pity that

316
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,700
today's trip was for nothing.

317
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,720
Even if our firm didn't have an emergency,

318
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,840
I would have asked you to leave.

319
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't you feel awkward

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
sitting in someone else's house?

321
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,920
It's so awkward,

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,770
even Ms. Wang felt awkward.

323
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,880
Why should it be awkward?

324
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,750
It's normal for subordinates to wait for their superiors.

325
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,650
Last time I went to the airport to pick up a leader,

326
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,890
the flight was delayed,

327
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,730
and I waited from morning till night.

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,320
It's quite normal.

329
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,720
I just think it's meaningless.

330
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,910
You once said that

331
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,080
a division chief

332
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,250
is the most basic level of an official in a state organ.

333
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,780
He can't determine your fate.

334
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,240
Besides,

335
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,360
how we live our lives

336
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,600
depends on us.

337
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,360
Why are you trying to curry favor with some division chief?

338
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,180
He supported my work,

339
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,280
and I just wanted to thank him.

340
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,590
How does that turn into currying favor?

341
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,890
Qiu Hua, I realize you really

342
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,420
don't want me to advance.

343
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,550
But advancing also requires the right methods, doesn't it?

344
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,090
If you look down on me,

345
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,710
why did you marry me in the first place?

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,270
When did I ever say I look down on you?

347
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,310
We don't have a foundation

348
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,420
in Jingbei.

349
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,480
If we're not going to build a good relationship with the leaders and colleagues,

350
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,690
how are we supposed to get by?

351
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,720
I just want to rely on my own ability.

352
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,440
Maybe we're not doing as well as others right now,

353
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,550
but I'll feel at peace

354
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,600
knowing that I'm making a living with my own skills.

355
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,890
Okay.

356
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:46,620
[Yinghua Law Firm]

357
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,280
You're finally back.

358
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,630
Well,

359
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
do you remember that

360
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,270
website from Xiao Nannan's university days,

361
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,930
the one where Liu Jianming posted

362
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,840
Rich Girl's Sayings?

363
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,080
I remember.

364
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,150
But that was 5 years ago,

365
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,440
hasn't that post been buried by now?

366
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,080
Yes, I think so too.

367
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,000
But it's suddenly active again.

368
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,190
The post has resurfaced.

369
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,320
Take a look.

370
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,270
Qiu, come and take a look.

371
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,750
Fox posted a reply below,

372
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,180
and Liu Jianming even

373
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,650
responded to him.

374
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,870
He's still attacking Xiao Nannan.

375
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,050
Look at the timing.

376
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,320
Since the post is active again,

377
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,630
it's still relevant.

378
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,270
Yes.

379
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,000
The defamation is still ongoing.

380
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,740
Yes.

381
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,340
Who is this Fox?

382
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,200
Where did he come from?

383
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,600
I was thinking about who this person could

384
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,030
be on my way here.

385
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,480
Then I figured

386
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,000
it's probably that guy.

387
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,030
Chen Shuo?

388
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,320
How did you figure out that it's Chen Shuo?

389
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,630
He's so sneaky,

390
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,390
always pulling these shady tricks.

391
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,940
Actually, I haven't heard from him recently,

392
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,570
so I'll give him a call and check in on him.

393
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,920
Is there any other post?

394
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,590
No.

395
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,600
It's page 10.

396
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,150
His phone is off.

397
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,580
Even Unscrupulous Chen has his offline moments.

398
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,930
Well,

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,120
didn't I tell you before that

400
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
there might be a turning point?

401
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,640
Have you changed your mind?

402
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,490
Yes.

403
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,670
You called me over this late

404
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,369
just to make me realize my mistake?

405
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,109
No, it's because of this.

406
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,510
Okay, I'll go home and reflect

407
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,829
on my mistakes.

408
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,720
You're so petty.

409
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,780
Quanquan is still waiting for me.

410
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,760
I'm leaving.

411
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,349
I'm leaving too.

412
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,819
Okay.

413
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,569
It's so late. Who's there?

414
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,069
Hello, who are you looking for?

415
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,609
Hello.

416
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,589
Is this Yinghua Law Firm?

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,530
I'm Hao Lei. I'm here to find Xia Shu.

418
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,540
Xia Shu.

419
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
Xia Shu, someone is looking for you.

420
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,960
Hao Lei?

421
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,310
Why are you here?

422
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,100
Mr. Hao,

423
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,460
you brought all this food

424
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,980
for Xia Shu, didn't you?

425
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,220
I saw Xia Shu posting on her Moments that

426
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,750
she's still working overtime.

427
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,720
I wasn't sure what she likes to eat,

428
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,590
so I bought a bit of everything for her to choose from.

429
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,830
What are you doing, making such a big fuss?

430
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,350
You must be up to no good if you're looking for me.

431
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,830
Xia Shu, Mr. Hao's intentions are good.

432
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,590
He's so considerate,

433
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,180
right, Qiu Hua?

434
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,040
Mr. Hao, since you're here,

435
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,110
I have something to say.

436
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,350
You still haven't paid

437
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,400
the second debt payment

438
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,830
for Xia Shu's reclaiming debt for you.

439
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,310
How do you plan to handle that?

440
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,620
Actually, I'm here today

441
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,280
to discuss this matter.

442
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,200
Okay.

443
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,440
I'll leave it to Xia Shu then.

444
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,030
You can discuss it then.

445
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,680
Xia Shu, Xia Shu, I'll leave this to you.

446
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,960
You must make it clear.

447
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,350
Okay.

448
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,440
We're leaving now.

449
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,030
Okay.

450
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,950
You can enjoy your late-night snack,

451
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,380
but the accounts still need to be settled.

452
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,430
Your two lawyers are quite funny.

453
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,440
Come in.

454
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,240
Come and have some.

455
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,210
I have no appetite.

456
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,790
Let me ask you,

457
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,270
can't you really gather the money

458
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,990
Zhang Lan is asking for

459
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,880
in this agreement?

460
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,030
I'm already figuring out how to gather the money,

461
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,030
but ever since you two talked last time,

462
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,210
she's disappeared again.

463
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,640
I can't talk to her about the price.

464
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,400
Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.

465
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,590
At least for now, no one can get her shares.

466
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,960
Not such a bad thing?

467
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,590
If you can't give the money to Zhang Lan,

468
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,030
you won't be able to become the president.

469
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,300
That would mean your promise to me

470
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,740
is just an empty one.

471
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,720
Do you expect me to do this for free?

472
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,590
I'm already thinking of a way.

473
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,280
To raise the money,

474
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,730
I've even sold my house.

475
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm in a tough spot too.

476
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,120
Can we maybe tweak the agreement a bit?

477
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,640
That way, we can lower the price,

478
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,490
but Zhang Lan will still feel like she's made a profit.

479
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,550
No, take it away.

480
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,510
Put that look away.

481
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,550
Just now, Ms. Qiu already said that

482
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,120
the money you owe us is a temporary extension.

483
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,460
Don't try to back out.

484
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
If you can't pay the big amount,

485
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,510
can't you at least pay the smaller ones?

486
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,270
So,

487
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,920
we should find a way through the contract.

488
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,770
If we can squeeze out some money through the contract,

489
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,110
I'll have enough to pay you.

490
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,270
But how can we squeeze it?

491
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,400
Xia Shu,

492
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,970
your sofa here is pretty comfortable.

493
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,480
Tell me, do you think

494
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,400
I might have post-traumatic stress disorder?

495
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,070
Every day when I enter the company,

496
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,300
all I can think about is my uncle coming to force a showdown

497
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,560
and the shareholders going crazy.

498
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,870
What's wrong with me?

499
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,640
You clearly haven't worked before.

500
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,960
Don't you know that

501
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,000
sleeping at work

502
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,230
is always better than sleeping at home?

503
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,720
Sleeping on the office sofa

504
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,110
is way deeper than sleeping in your own bed.

505
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,880
So, when you're working for me,

506
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,310
is this how you slack off too?

507
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,240
Of course.

508
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,200
If Mr. Hao is not satisfied,

509
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
find another lawyer.

510
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,050
I'll change right away.

511
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,110
You'd better find someone rich

512
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,480
who can pay Zhang Lan

513
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,790
all at once.

514
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,570
Then I guess I can only look for one in my dreams.

515
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,250
I've almost finished reviewing Zhang Lan's contract;

516
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
let's go over it together.

517
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,710
Hao Lei.

518
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,510
Weren't you saying you had post-traumatic stress disorder?

519
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,030
It looks like you're sleeping pretty soundly now.

520
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,550
What is it?

521
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,560
Tell them to wait.

522
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,240
I'll ask someone to pick them up.

523
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,230
Okay.

524
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,210
The boss of Mingshan Group is here.

525
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,860
They still have the nerve to come?

526
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,350
Any news about Chen Shuo?

527
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,920
Don't mention it.

528
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,160
He said he would turn off his phone on vacation.

529
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,560
I thought he was joking,

530
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,090
but it turns out he really did.

531
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,830
It's been so many days,

532
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,320
and he hasn't even made a call.

533
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,880
He made money for himself,

534
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,120
but he leaves us to clean up his mess.

535
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,070
Hello, Han.

536
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,990
She's up there.

537
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,930
Mr. Fang, they are here.

538
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,970
Let me introduce you.

539
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,350
This is Mr. Sun Mingshan,

540
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,590
the CEO of Mingshan Group.

541
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,310
Mr. Sun, this is Ms. Fang,

542
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,760
the founding partner of Liangcheng Law Firm.

543
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,640
Hello, Mr. Sun,  I'm Fang Lihong.

544
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,490
Hello, Ms. Fang. It's an honor to meet you.

545
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,830
These are our company's two legal counsels,

546
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,830
Mr. Gao and Mr Jia.

547
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,310
Welcome.

548
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,830
Hello.

549
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,570
Please come in.

550
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,150
Mr. Fang, your firm

551
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,350
has transferred 5.6 million

552
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,200
from the joint account

553
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,640
without our permission.

554
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,750
This action is not only malicious in nature

555
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,480
but also involves a significant amount of money.

556
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,100
We are formally demanding that

557
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,470
your firm return the full amount of the illegally transferred funds

558
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
to the joint account within five days.

559
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,540
Otherwise, we will file charges

560
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,610
against your firm and the individuals involved.

561
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,160
You're Mr. Gao, right?

562
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,820
I believe you're mistaken.

563
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,000
Our firm withdrew the funds

564
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,200
based on the terms of the contract we both agreed to.

565
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,310
Is there an issue with that?

566
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,970
Mr. Han,

567
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,160
we're all in the legal profession,

568
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,240
so let's not avoid the core issue.

569
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,750
The issue at hand is that

570
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,270
your side bypassed the other party of the joint account

571
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,920
and withdrew funds from it without authorization.

572
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,780
This violates both the agreement and the law.

573
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,310
I don't know

574
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,900
about the details.

575
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,310
Because this case

576
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,400
has been handled by Mr. Chen.

577
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,530
He's currently on vacation,

578
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
and his phone is off.

579
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
We don't know when he'll be back.

580
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,270
How about this?

581
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,150
Once he returns to the firm,

582
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,720
we'll gather all the details

583
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,030
and get back to you.

584
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,000
There's one more thing, Mr. Sun.

585
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,350
Before Mr. Chen

586
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,030
left,

587
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,030
he expressed some concerns about your company.

588
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,640
According to him,

589
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,840
your company has been negotiating with Minghai Group

590
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,070
behind the lawyer's back.

591
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,000
This behavior

592
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,510
blatantly violates our mutual agreement.

593
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,350
You have nothing to do here.

594
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,360
Wait for me outside.

595
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,960
Mr. Fang. Mr. Han.

596
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,970
I don't want to escalate things.

597
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,050
Yes, I have been negotiating with Minghai Group,

598
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,750
but we have no choice.

599
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,300
How the money was taken out,

600
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,930
you need to figure out how to get it back for me.

601
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,020
We can negotiate the agency fee.

602
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,830
Once we resolve our issues,

603
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,850
we'll entrust all of our company's legal matters

604
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,620
to your firm.

605
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,750
Wouldn't that be perfect?

606
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,380
But if the money isn't returned,

607
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,440
that's a different story.

608
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,300
Mr. Sun, are you threatening us?

609
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,640
If that's the case,

610
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,360
then I don't think there's any point in

611
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,470
continuing this discussion.

612
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,930
We are in the legal field,

613
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,800
and we only recognize the law.

614
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,440
Mr. Sun, whenever you have time,

615
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,750
I'd like to visit you

616
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,640
and sit down to discuss this matter.

617
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,960
I understand that

618
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,270
you might be in a difficult position,

619
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,160
but if you don't honor the agreement

620
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,550
and end up using the lawyer only to turn against them,

621
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,270
it could damage your reputation

622
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,400
once it's spread.

623
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,480
I believe we should prioritize harmony.

624
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,400
Let me know when you're available,

625
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,510
and I'll arrange a visit.

626
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,640
Mr. Han, if only Mr. Chen

627
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,830
could be as reasonable as you,

628
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,990
this would be much easier to resolve.

629
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,920
Fine.

630
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,020
I'll ask my secretary to contact you when I get back.

631
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,660
Okay.

632
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,490
I'm leaving.

633
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,470
Be careful.

634
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,680
Watch the steps.

635
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,240
Bye.

636
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,270
Bye.

637
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,260
[Righteous Luo]

638
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,510
Hello.

639
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,170
Unscrupulous Chen, what do you mean?

640
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,610
Did you already scam them enough

641
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,680
with the last case,

642
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,640
or have you suddenly grown a conscience,

643
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,360
decided to stop doing bad things,

644
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,100
and turned over a new leaf?

645
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,090
What do you mean?

646
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,830
Don't you know what I mean?

647
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,680
You've got a chance to make money,

648
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,270
why run off to play?

649
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,960
You even turned off your phone.

650
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,160
Come on, tell me, where did you go?

651
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,750
Who did you take with you?

652
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,510
You're not talking, are you?

653
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,040
Is it because I guessed right?

654
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,160
There's no need to stay quiet if I'm right,

655
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,590
no need to act shy.

656
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,360
Hello.

657
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,400
What are you doing?

658
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,240
I'm fine. What's up?

659
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,400
Let's talk in person.

660
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,260
Let's meet at the usual place.

661
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,800
Mr. Sun, Chen Shuo and I

662
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,480
have invested nearly 1.4 million

663
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,270
in costs for the case.

664
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,590
You'll have to cover that;

665
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
you can't expect us to work for you

666
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
out of our own pockets, can you?

667
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,070
Alright,

668
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,430
as long as there are invoices, we'll acknowledge them.

669
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,200
Okay.

670
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,160
The 5.6 million previously withdrawn

671
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,030
doesn't even cover 50% of the agency fee,

672
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,620
so we won't be returning that.

673
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,480
Additionally, if you pay us another million,

674
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,640
we'll consider this matter settled.

675
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,020
Mr. Han,

676
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,960
your demands are way too much.

677
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,590
That's absolutely out of the question.

678
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,920
According to the agreement,

679
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,860
you owe us over 13 million.

680
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,920
I've already said that

681
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,880
we can't carry out that contract.

682
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,250
Then what do you propose?

683
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,310
Return the 5.6 million you took first.

684
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,520
We'll reimburse any documented costs

685
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,270
with invoices

686
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,010
and pay you another million.

687
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,680
If that's the case,

688
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,650
then there's nothing to negotiate.

689
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,480
Mr. Han,

690
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,710
aren't you afraid of going to court?

691
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,720
I'm a lawyer;

692
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,030
why would I be afraid of going to court?

693
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,960
Besides, if we do end up in court,

694
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,560
we're the ones upholding the contract

695
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,160
while you're the ones breaking it.

696
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,580
Who do you think the court will side with?

697
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,240
How about this?

698
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,680
I'll go back to the board

699
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,950
and get the approval for the 5.6 million.

700
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,720
As for costs, like I said,

701
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,470
we'll reimburse anything with valid invoices.

702
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,510
The agreement ends here. Is that acceptable?

703
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,920
No.

704
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,010
You need to add another million, just like I said.

705
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Mr. Han,

706
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,270
the deal we reached with Minghai Group—

707
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,640
aside from the 20 million we already paid—

708
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,860
they've only agreed to pay another 10 million.

709
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,480
Think about it.

710
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,480
I have to cover your costs

711
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,510
and give you an extra million.

712
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,400
That means nearly 30% of what I manage to recover

713
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,720
goes straight to you.

714
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,590
How am I supposed to go through with this agreement?

715
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,200
Fine.

716
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,100
Then 5.6 million is approved

717
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,230
and the costs will be reimbursed; is that what you mean?

718
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,690
I still need to get board approval for this.

719
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,330
Unscrupulous Chen.

720
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,480
Where have you been these days?

721
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,150
Your phone's been off.

722
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,200
Nice haircut.

723
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,980
Did you break up?

724
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,120
Yeah.

725
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,510
Really? With whom?

726
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,510
It's none of your business.

727
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,680
Didn't you say you had something to discuss?

728
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,800
Just get to the point.

729
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,680
Okay.

730
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,750
You're Fox, right?

731
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,510
You saw it?

732
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,920
Knew it was you.

733
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,110
Unscrupulous Chen, aren't you on vacation?

734
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,590
Where'd you find the time to mess around like this?

735
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,790
I wasn't messing around.

736
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,920
I just set a reminder

737
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,510
on my phone.

738
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,000
That day was the statute of limitations deadline,

739
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,960
so I just replied to the post.

740
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,870
I just realized now

741
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,160
when we went to see Liu Jianming that time,

742
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,790
he was scheming to

743
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,110
get information about Xiao Nannan from us,

744
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,890
and you even chimed in with him.

745
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,820
Did you already foresee today's outcome?

746
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,110
That day,

747
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,930
I was thinking that Liu Jianming's

748
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,230
life must be quite mundane.

749
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,270
If he found out that

750
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,640
someone he used to bully

751
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,880
is now doing better than him,

752
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,720
he would definitely feel unbalanced.

753
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,770
In that case,

754
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,250
he might do something drastic.

755
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,510
Later, I found out that Han is his representative.

756
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,920
I thought the trap I set earlier

757
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,200
was about to spring,

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,770
so I replied to the post

759
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,070
and mentioned him.

760
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,960
Well, you're quite the schemer, Fox Chen.

761
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,140
Thank you, Fox Chen.

762
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,930
Thanks to your help this time.

763
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,720
I sent you three videos.

764
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,680
Take a look.

765
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,640
Good, Unscrupulous Chen.

766
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,130
That day, I was arguing

767
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,720
fiercely, red-faced and heated,

768
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,820
while you were quietly recording videos behind my back.

769
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,790
How are you going to use these three videos?

770
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,790
I sent them to you;

771
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,130
shouldn't you be the one deciding how to use them?

772
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,790
You've got two options.

773
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,880
One, you can post them online

774
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,200
and let public opinion put pressure on him.

775
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,790
When the case goes to court,

776
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,920
the judge will definitely take that into account.

777
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,860
That's vigilante justice.

778
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,480
Using public opinion to influence a court ruling.

779
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,890
I can't agree with that.

780
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,110
What's the second option?

781
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,590
What a righteous lawyer.

782
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,830
The second option is simple—

783
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,240
just hand the videos over to the judge.

784
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,270
Whatever decision they make

785
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,270
is out of our hands.

786
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
But if I were you,

787
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,330
I'd go with the first one.

788
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,960
I need to think this through,

789
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,550
but I really can't accept the first option.

790
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,400
Suit yourself.

791
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,430
The videos are with you now—it's up to you.

792
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,510
Anything else?

793
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Why are you acting so weird, Unscrupulous Chen?

794
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,130
Are you sick?

795
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,790
No.

796
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,520
I've got work to do at the office. I'll head back first.

797
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,940
So weird…

798
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,270
Luo Yingzi,

799
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,440
if I ask you something,

800
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,770
can you give me an honest answer?

801
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,590
Go ahead. I'll tell you the truth.

802
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,750
Are you in love with Xu Zhuo?

803
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,160
Why are you so stunned?

804
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,110
You heard me clearly.

805
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,960
Are you in love with Xu Zhuo?

806
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,720
Are you all right,

807
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,350
Qiu Hua and you?

808
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm a career-driven woman.

809
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,110
Why do you assume I'm all about romance?

810
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,520
Right?

811
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,550
You look obsessed with romance.

812
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,550
Besides,

813
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,880
who I like or don't like

814
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,200
is nobody else's business.

815
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,960
Does it have anything to do with you?

816
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,730
Yes.

817
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,370
We've known each other for years, haven't we?

818
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,350
If we're friends,

819
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,469
I should at least give you a heads-up.

820
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,070
A heads-up about what?

821
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,480
If my guess is right,

822
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,670
you should be extra careful

823
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,449
when dealing with him.

824
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,500
Careful about what?

825
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,270
He has something to do with Mei Daliang's case.

826
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,000
What are you talking about?

827
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,960
What do you mean, "What am I talking about?"

828
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,440
Didn't you hear me clearly?

829
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
Unscrupulous Chen, are you jealous of him?

830
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,219
Why would I be jealous of him?

831
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,670
We are peers.

832
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,000
You're hopeless.

833
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,110
You're hopeless.

834
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,469
Silly girl.

835
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,230
Just admit it—

836
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,590
you like Chen Shuo.

837
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,030
Wait, what's going on with you and Chen Shuo?

838
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,360
You guys keep trying to match me up.

839
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,550
Maybe you should just switch careers

840
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,630
and become matchmakers instead.

841
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,800
You don't like him?

842
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,960
Then why did you say he was jealous?

843
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,550
How many times do I have to tell you?

844
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,210
It's just professional rivalry.

845
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,240
That's not just professional rivalry—

846
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,120
he's jealous like a love rival.

847
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,670
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.

848
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,760
Why is it so hard for me

849
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,130
to just focus on my career?

850
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,070
Can we please stop dragging everything back to romance?

851
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,690
I'm begging you.

852
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,210
A career woman is like a brick—

853
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,510
she gets placed wherever she's needed.

854
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,430
Fine, I'll stop talking.

855
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,670
As long as you know

856
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,920
what's going on in your own heart.

857
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,840
I know exactly what's going on.

858
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,910
As long as you do.

859
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,740
By the way,

860
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,030
you just said Chen Shuo suspects

861
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,220
Xu Zhuo might be connected to

862
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,070
what happened back then.

863
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,400
But I feel like he's always had a bias against Xu Zhuo,

864
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,960
so his judgment might not be entirely objective.

865
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,840
Not necessarily.

866
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,110
Xu Zhuo was part of Madam Mei's team back then—

867
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,030
he was directly involved.

868
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,130
It's entirely possible.

869
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,190
Qiu Hua, don't start thinking like Chen Shuo,

870
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,000
always assuming the worst in people.

871
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,220
Yes, we assume the worst,

872
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,150
but you just have terrible taste.

873
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
What do you mean?

874
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,880
I can't be bothered to explain.

875
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,000
What do you think Han would do

876
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,190
if he found out that

877
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,440
Liu Jianming had made a new post?

878
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,330
With Han's temper,

879
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,440
he'd probably smash his calculator so hard it sparks

880
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,150
and then throw it in Liu Jianming's face.

881
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,110
They deserve it.

882
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Let's wait and see.

883
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,110
Director Han, we're here today

884
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,110
to inform you that

885
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,920
the infringement has been ongoing.

886
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,000
We've already filed a criminal private prosecution,

887
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
and the court has accepted the case.

888
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,070
Your client

889
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,960
will soon receive a court summons.

890
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,190
The notarized document I have here

891
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,510
is the latest piece of evidence.

892
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,800
Who knows if your evidence is even legitimate?

893
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,920
Director Han,

894
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,020
we've given you chances.

895
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,450
If you think it's fake,

896
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,880
we'll verify it in court.

897
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,390
[That rich girl is doing great now, and she's back to stirring up trouble.]

898
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,780
Uncle,

899
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,670
I'm busy here.

900
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,840
I'll call you later.

901
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,800
Busy…

902
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,150
You won't be busy for long.

903
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,960
You'll be too busy in prison, you know that?

904
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,230
What?

905
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,030
Are you out of your mind?

906
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,360
You run a tiny business, yet you still have time

907
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,920
to stir up trouble online?

908
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,760
What possessed you

909
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,670
to post insults about her?

910
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,840
She's found the evidence

911
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,670
and has already sued you.

912
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,400
Just wait to serve jail time.

913
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,990
You're absolutely hopeless.

914
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,440
I should've never helped you.

915
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,410
How did you put up this screen protector? This is messed up.

916
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,590
I'm not paying for this.

917
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,760
I'll redo it in a bit.

918
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,630
Uncle, listen to me.

919
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,710
I was just bored.

920
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,920
Do we have any other way?

921
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,130
What else can we do?

922
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,370
Go to court!

923
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,590
This is really good.

924
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,630
Mr. Chen, Ms. Fang asked you to see her

925
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,840
as soon as you get back.

926
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,110
Which Ms. Fang? He?

927
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,440
Fang Lihong.

928
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,880
Mentor, you are finally back.

929
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,070
I called you so many times, and you didn't answer.

930
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,510
I even left you messages.

931
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,110
Maybe you're the only one who cares.

932
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,440
I just gave you 10%,

933
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
but you bought so much stuff?

934
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,960
Consumerism is a trap.

935
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,630
Ms. Luo didn't reach out to you?

936
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,670
Can you not mention her?

937
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,050
Fine.

938
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,280
Let me get down to business.

939
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,230
I went to Jingxiang Nursing Home;

940
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,070
I figured I should give them the money in person.

941
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,190
I didn't know you're pretty famous there

942
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,440
until I got there.

943
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,600
You're amazing, Mentor.

944
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,880
What's so great about it?

945
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,920
I just donated some money;

946
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,230
I didn't actually do anything.

947
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,510
Is there anything else?

948
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,440
By the way, Mentor, there's one more thing.

949
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,980
Mingshan Group

950
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,880
asked us to return the 5.6 million,

951
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,110
but my aunt stepped in.

952
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,400
She's adamant—we won't give it back.

953
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,960
Is that so?

954
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,070
Then I should thank your aunt.

955
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,400
What should we do next?

956
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,550
We'll take it one step at a time.

957
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,150
Your aunt asked me to come to her, anyway. I'll head up first.

958
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,910
I'll go up first.

959
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,860
Okay.

960
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,960
Chen Shuo, you've been away for more than 10 days.

961
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,280
Your phone was off,

962
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,840
and you didn't contact the firm.

963
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,320
How could you do that?

964
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,330
Have some water.

965
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,110
No need, Ms. Fang, just get to the point.

966
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,870
Here is the thing.

967
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,590
While you were away,

968
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,120
Mingshan Group came to the firm several times.

969
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,190
They want to terminate the agreement

970
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,070
and have the transferred funds returned.

971
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,320
From what I've gathered,

972
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,840
Mingshan Group and Minghai Group

973
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,070
must have negotiated privately.

974
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,110
Are they close to reaching a settlement?

975
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,760
That's why they don't need us anymore.

976
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,540
So now that they don't need us, they want to terminate the agreement?

977
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,070
Then why did they sign it

978
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,190
in the first place, Ms. Fang?

979
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,550
Besides, they betrayed us first.

980
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,770
They betrayed us—

981
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,610
why should we be the ones to back out?

982
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,200
So, sorry,

983
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,480
but I don't agree.

984
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,440
I'm sure you remember

985
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
when they first put out the public bidding,

986
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,890
why did no one dare to take it?

987
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,400
Because everyone saw

988
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,680
this coming.

989
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,960
Mingshan Group treated their lawyers

990
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,460
as disposable from the start.

991
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,940
The moment a situation like this arose,

992
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,010
they already had a plan for how to deal with us.

993
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,360
So,

994
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,550
there's no need for us to fight this head-on.

995
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,850
Why shouldn't we?

996
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,410
They're the ones who breached the contract first.

997
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,340
Chen Shuo, now is not the time to be angry

998
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,040
or impulsive.

999
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,280
You don't fully understand what's at stake here.

1000
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,640
Some things

1001
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,870
just aren't worth insisting on.

1002
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,780
If we refuse to compromise,

1003
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,950
there's no telling

1004
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,440
what might happen next.

1005
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,310
So, take my advice—

1006
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,360
let's take a step back

1007
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,720
and talk to them.

1008
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,080
We'll negotiate for

1009
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,090
the best possible outcome.

1010
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,820
Okay, Ms. Fang.

1011
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,400
I'll give you some face.

1012
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,610
We can talk, but I won't back down,

1013
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,890
unless they give me enough reasons.

1014
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,590
Fine.

1015
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,130
I'll arrange the negotiation time, okay?

1016
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,930
No problem. Just let me know when it's done.

1017
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,810
Mr. Chen,

1018
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,030
I've always thought you were someone

1019
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,900
who knew how to be flexible.

1020
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,630
I just hope you won't be too stubborn

1021
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,190
about this.

1022
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,510
You don't know me very well.

1023
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,850
There are things I can be flexible about,

1024
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,690
but I'll stand my ground

1025
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,230
on some things.

1026
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,760
You're finally done talking.

1027
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,150
Come here.

1028
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,840
What are you doing?

1029
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,150
Good news.

1030
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,190
We need to talk.

1031
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,920
Good news.

1032
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,620
Hurry up.

1033
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,280
I put in an enormous amount of effort—

1034
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,970
talking until my mouth was dry—

1035
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,880
to get this result.

1036
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,960
So, what do you think? Can you accept it?

1037
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,110
Mr. Han,

1038
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,700
this case was originally mine, wasn't it?

1039
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,930
You were just assigned by the firm to assist me.

1040
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,690
So why did you negotiate with the other party behind my back?

1041
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,210
Why?

1042
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,960
You weren't home,

1043
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,170
your phone was off,

1044
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,510
and the people from Mingshan Group came several times.

1045
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,630
Plus, Fang Lihong kept coming to me.

1046
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,630
What was I supposed to do?

1047
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:49,990
Fine.

1048
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,050
All right.

1049
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,930
Well...

1050
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,030
I admit it was wrong of me

1051
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,440
to negotiate

1052
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,360
without your approval.

1053
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,920
I apologize.

1054
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,920
Do you accept the outcome I negotiated?

1055
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,620
No.
