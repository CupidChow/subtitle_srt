00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,940
[Unbreakable Ⅱ]

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,090
The Defendant.

4
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,430
Since you admit that the creditor-debtor relationship

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,870
is true and valid,

6
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,590
there is no reason not to repay.

7
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,979
The facts of this case are clear,

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,479
and the legal relationship is straightforward.

9
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,150
This court...

10
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,870
Judge,

11
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,070
my side admits to borrowing this money from the plaintiff,

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,800
but my client is facing operational difficulties

13
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,040
and truly cannot produce such a large amount right now.

14
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,600
We need some time.

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,390
My client

16
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,210
is willing to devise a repayment plan

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,340
and submit it to the court for review...

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
He's using stall tactics again.

19
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,680
If the court agrees,

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,210
please schedule the verdict for a later date.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,470
Objection.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
As the judge said,

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,860
the facts of this case are clear,

24
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,560
and the legal relationship is straightforward.

25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,990
There is no reason to continue dragging it out.

26
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,030
We request an immediate verdict in court.

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,810
Judge, even if an immediate verdict is passed,

28
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,100
my client still cannot produce such a large amount.

29
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,030
The law would just be issuing another IOU.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,900
Three million is not a small number.

31
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,470
So we really need time...

32
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,410
IOU.

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,430
The defendant,

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,350
go back and actively devise a repayment plan.

35
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,910
This case

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
will be adjourned for verdict.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,180
Court adjourned.

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,920
IOU.

39
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,990
Han!

40
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,470
Hurry up!

41
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,150
Mr. Han!

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,190
Hold on!

43
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,430
Stop!

44
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,780
You're pretty fast, huh?

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,940
What are you doing?

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,590
Ms. He, do you have something to say?

47
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
I spent over a hundred thousand on you,

48
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,350
and all I get is you saying I'll repay in court?

49
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,550
Why did I hire you then?

50
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,820
Is this my fault?

51
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,360
When I proposed in court that the evidence might be false

52
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,080
and requested a forensic testimony,

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,090
didn't you say everything was true?

54
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,190
Real debt, real evidence.

55
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,360
How could the judge rule otherwise?

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,790
What kind of advice was that?

57
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,180
Playing around? Fooling whom?

58
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,660
Do you take the judge for a child?

59
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,360
Stop talking nonsense.

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,000
What should we do next?

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Didn't we have to submit a repayment plan?

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,630
So shouldn't we take three months to devise the plan?

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,579
Let's stall for three months first.

64
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,790
Well, it's either hide or stall.

65
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,010
What other tricks do you have?

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,750
You, go away.

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
No matter how much we talk,

68
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,670
I'll still end up losing, right?

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,270
From the first time you met me,

70
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,940
I already made it clear that

71
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,000
as long as this case goes to court, we'll definitely lose.

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,630
So why did I spend

73
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,560
over a hundred thousand on you?

74
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,520
Don't worry.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,800
If we lose in the first instance judgment,

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,600
will you appeal?

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Of course, I'll appeal.

78
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,680
How can I just easily...

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,040
I don't have the money to repay anyway.

80
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,200
Then come with me to the law office first.

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,130
Let's sign the second-instance agency agreement first.

82
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,940
After you sign and make the payment,

83
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,490
I'll tell you what to do next.

84
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,600
Mr. Han,

85
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,250
you want more money, don't you?

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,630
Let me tell you,

87
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,250
even if I appeal,

88
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,560
I won't hire you again.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,820
Suit yourself.

90
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,120
If that's really the case,

91
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,750
then you've spent over a hundred thousand

92
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,330
just to have me say

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
repayment in court.

94
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,170
Please reconsider.

95
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,050
Auntie Song, I understand your concerns,

96
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,390
but you don't have to worry too much.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,590
This is how the law works.

98
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,820
It won't issue a verdict immediately.

99
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,290
So if anything comes up,

100
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,690
we'll definitely inform you at the first opportunity.

101
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,890
Okay,

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,670
don't worry, Aunt Song.

103
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,120
Auntie Song.

104
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,000
Xia Shu.

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,890
How about you take Aunt Song back first?

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,190
Alright.

107
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,090
Here, let me take that.

108
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,240
Judge Liu,

109
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,970
you've also said that the facts of this case are clear

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,520
and the legal relationship is straightforward.

111
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,870
So why not issue a verdict immediately?

112
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,010
Immediate verdicts are the exception, after all.

113
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,430
And the defendant has expressed

114
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,580
a willingness to mediate

115
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,200
and devise a repayment plan.

116
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,540
If installment repayment is feasible,

117
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,150
then it should be quicker for the plaintiff to realize their creditor's rights

118
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,840
than going through the process

119
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,740
and finally executing it.

120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Judge Liu,

121
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,860
He Qiaohui runs a small loan company.

122
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,210
The borrowers are all in urgent need of money

123
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,120
and use their houses as collateral.

124
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,750
So with He Qiaohui's income,

125
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,720
she can definitely repay the debt in full.

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,670
It's just that she doesn't want to.

127
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,800
And there's another situation

128
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,030
that you may not be aware of.

129
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,310
This He Qiaohui,

130
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,430
after receiving the summons,

131
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,960
divorced Zhou Damin

132
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,750
and transferred most of their property.

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,320
I didn't know about this.

134
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,670
Is it true? Do you have evidence?

135
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,630
It's absolutely true.

136
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,310
We can apply for an investigation to obtain evidence.

137
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,150
Actually, He Qiaohui and her team

138
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,720
are deliberately delaying things,

139
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
hoping that during the delay,

140
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,830
our client will be unable to handle the pressure and collapse,

141
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,920
so that she can ultimately avoid the debt.

142
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,870
But my client

143
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,430
really can't afford to delay any longer.

144
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,950
She's over sixty years old

145
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,320
and suffers from multiple illnesses.

146
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,710
Her husband died a few days ago

147
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,100
due to lack of money for treatment.

148
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,760
And she doesn't have any children.

149
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Judge Liu,

150
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,360
we request

151
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,420
that the court issue a verdict as soon as possible.

152
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,310
Alright, we'll issue a verdict as soon as possible.

153
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,560
Come in.

154
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,960
Mentor,

155
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,350
She has paid the fee.

156
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,390
Paid?

157
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,000
Please sit.

158
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,390
Mr. Han,

159
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,920
you've earned almost two hundred thousand

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
from me so far.

161
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,400
Let me tell you,

162
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,120
if you can't help me protect my property,

163
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,030
don't blame me for being rude this time.

164
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,230
Ms. He,

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,200
you're insulting me by saying that.

166
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,300
Do you know that?

167
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,580
Alright, I'll tell you the method now.

168
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,890
First,

169
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
communicate more with the judge,

170
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,950
tell him that you're willing to repay the money

171
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,630
and that the repayment plan will be ready soon.

172
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,310
Then,

173
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,630
express your strong willingness to mediate.

174
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,950
The court has indicators for mediation and withdrawal rates,

175
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,790
so they definitely hope for mediation.

176
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,130
With mediation,

177
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,280
we can delay things for several more months.

178
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,240
Second,

179
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,640
if we can't delay any longer,

180
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,510
after the first-instance judgment,

181
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,940
on the last day of the appeal period,

182
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,630
preferably at the very last moment before the appeal period expires,

183
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,480
we submit the appeal.

184
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,840
Once we appeal,

185
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,750
the court will have to investigate again.

186
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,590
With this investigation,

187
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,370
we can delay things for several more months.

188
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,270
Third,

189
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,630
and most importantly,

190
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,400
hurry up and find Zhou Damin.

191
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,220
Get those assets under your control.

192
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,740
Don't let him

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,020
make a fake divorce real.

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,670
Otherwise, the money you scammed from the old lady

195
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,360
will all be lost to him.

196
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,320
Don't worry about that.

197
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,600
I've already talked to Damin.

198
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,720
We've agreed that after the lawsuit is over,

199
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,830
he'll remarry me.

200
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,540
Do you really believe that?

201
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,670
If I have hundreds of millions

202
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,480
of yuan obtained from you,

203
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,870
when you call me,

204
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,840
I'll definitely say that the divorce is fake too.

205
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Don't forget,

206
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,650
after the second-instance trial,

207
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,790
we'll still lose.

208
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,750
By then, you'll be heavily in debt.

209
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,970
Why would Zhou Damin remarry you?

210
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,790
If you don't believe me, let's test it.

211
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,870
Find someone you trust the most

212
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,120
and open a company.

213
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,670
Ask Zhou Damin to transfer all the money

214
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,370
he scammed into that company.

215
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,700
Let's see if he'll do it.

216
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Well, Ms. He, I haven't finished speaking yet...

217
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,200
Ms. He.

218
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,480
Mr. Zhou,

219
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,390
take a look at our real estate project.

220
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,520
Phase one is already sold out.

221
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,570
This is phase two,

222
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
which is currently on sale.

223
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,550
Our community

224
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,800
is very convenient.

225
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,790
There's a ski resort

226
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,390
and a golf course just outside the door.

227
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,850
There's also a large supermarket within the community.

228
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,750
How do you like it, Yali?

229
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,470
Which of the two units we just saw do you prefer?

230
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,390
Let me tell you,

231
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,310
these are limited edition layouts, right?

232
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,070
I don't want either.

233
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,770
You're not happy with these limited edition layouts because they're too small?

234
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,960
Tang.

235
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,230
Let's discuss it further.

236
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,050
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

237
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,960
If you need anything, just let me know.

238
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,390
Okay.

239
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,260
What's wrong?

240
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,790
For such a large sum of money,

241
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,240
will your wife give it to you?

242
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,810
Besides,

243
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,210
if she finds out,

244
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,720
she'll tear us apart.

245
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,720
The money

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
is all in my hands.

247
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,700
I decide whether to buy this house or not.

248
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,970
So, Damin,

249
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,840
shall we decide today?

250
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,600
Of course.

251
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,020
Why else would I come here, right?

252
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,730
Let me take this call about the company.

253
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,720
Tang, come over and talk to her some more.

254
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,550
Qiaohui, is something wrong?

255
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,750
Where are you?

256
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,150
I'm outside.

257
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,630
What are you doing outside?

258
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
The judge is still asking us to repay the money.

259
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,480
Where's Mr. Han?

260
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,360
Just because the judge says to repay, we have to?

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,520
Well.

262
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,440
Why didn't we repay earlier then?

263
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,550
Why wait until today?

264
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,570
Stop wasting words.

265
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,750
I'll tell you,

266
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,370
Han gave us some advice.

267
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm not sure what to do.

268
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,910
You need to come home quickly and discuss it with me.

269
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,330
Come back now.

270
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,770
Alright then.

271
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,520
Damin,

272
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,540
I think the seventh floor is better.

273
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,410
"Seven up, eight down," right?

274
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,330
Yali,

275
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,150
I have some business at the company.

276
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,330
I have to go back first.

277
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,270
Let's talk about

278
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,860
the house later, okay?

279
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,530
There are two units, right?

280
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,480
You can compare them later

281
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,000
and

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,270
let Tang introduce them to you again.

283
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,400
Well.

284
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,160
What do you mean "talk about it later"?

285
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,790
Didn't you say we would decide today?

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,790
Hui.

287
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,870
Hui.

288
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,720
Why are you calling me back like this?

289
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,590
Couldn't you have just told me over the phone?

290
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,630
I have a lot of things to handle.

291
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,700
Damin,

292
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,910
we don't know

293
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,320
how long this lawsuit will drag on.

294
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,360
Those funds are just sitting idle with you.

295
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,200
We can't lend them out either.

296
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,390
Han gave us

297
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,600
an idea.

298
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,270
He suggested that I open a new company

299
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,450
under my cousin's name.

300
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,160
Hurry up

301
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,030
and transfer that money

302
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,480
to our new company right away.

303
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,150
Oh, that?

304
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,250
Alright.

305
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,620
Hui,

306
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,390
you're right.

307
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,020
I can't just

308
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,960
let all that money sit there idly.

309
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,790
Right?

310
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,550
It's not that I'm afraid of being stolen, but I'm afraid of being targeted.

311
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,790
I'm also concerned about its safety.

312
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,740
So, I invested it.

313
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,550
And they're all long-term investments.

314
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,840
The money can't be withdrawn for a while.

315
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,670
Just this?

316
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,950
You could have just told me this over the phone.

317
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,000
I have a lot on my plate.

318
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Alright, I'm leaving now.

319
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,600
Hold it!

320
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,540
What's wrong?

321
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,910
Han was right about you.

322
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,570
Han...

323
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,750
Han...

324
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,790
What did he say?

325
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,320
Zhou Damin,

326
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,630
you have someone else.

327
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,690
Don't worry about whether I have someone else or not.

328
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Right now...

329
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,110
Let me tell you,

330
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,630
don't try to pull any tricks on me.

331
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,090
That money is mine.

332
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,450
You have to transfer it back to me.

333
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,800
Remember this,

334
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,940
the divorce was fake.

335
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,510
The property division was also fake.

336
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,790
You need to transfer the money back to me.

337
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,910
It's my money.

338
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,000
Otherwise, I'll sue you.

339
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,920
I'll sue you.

340
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,730
You've made me...

341
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,160
He Qiaohui, that's enough!

342
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,560
Look at you now, you're like a shrew.

343
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,630
I'm curious,

344
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,600
how did I endure you for so many years?

345
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,340
We're already divorced.

346
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,480
You mentioned the property division agreement just now.

347
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,320
You read it and agreed to it before,

348
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,030
right?

349
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,160
From now on,

350
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,000
each will follow their own path.

351
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,880
Don't come looking for me again, okay?

352
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,590
Please, goodbye.

353
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
That's not true!

354
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,010
Come back here!

355
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
You're a shrew!

356
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,510
Get back here!

357
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Is it because

358
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm getting older or what?

359
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,490
My shoulders hurt just from stretching.

360
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,780
You're so delicate.

361
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,510
Let me drink some water.

362
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,250
Shuo,

363
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,960
let me tell you something.

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,150
I have a new case.

365
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,840
A couple is getting a divorce.

366
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,200
The man came to me,

367
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,330
but I can't even bear to talk to him.

368
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,750
I think you should come and help me guide him.

369
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,000
Why can't you bear to talk to him?

370
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,550
He's short of money and morality.

371
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,050
You only think of me now?

372
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,790
Did you take this case yourself

373
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,000
and are afraid of being condemned by your conscience?

374
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
So you called me

375
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,600
to shift your moral burden onto me, right?

376
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,960
Then you can feel at ease

377
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,320
collecting your agency fee, huh?

378
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,150
No.

379
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,010
To be honest,

380
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,620
I've wanted to learn from you for so many years.

381
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,410
When you were a lawyer,

382
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,190
you didn't have a conscience,

383
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,910
but I really can't learn that from you.

384
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm too upright.

385
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
I can't help but feel uneasy at crucial moments.

386
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,780
Come here and take a look at this.

387
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,050
It's interesting.

388
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,630
Why are you laughing?

389
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,630
Isn't it a coincidence?

390
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,000
I have a case too.

391
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,600
The client who came to me

392
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
is a woman.

393
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,710
She's very wealthy and kind.

394
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,410
This is interesting.

395
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,150
The two clients who came to us are a couple.

396
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,240
What a coincidence!

397
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,930
The man wants to sue the woman.

398
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,080
It's the woman's money.

399
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,960
I guess they won't be together for much longer.

400
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
But

401
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,320
judging from these materials,

402
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,200
the woman is definitely in the right.

403
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,850
There's not much point in dragging this lawsuit out.

404
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,500
Xue,

405
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,750
how about this?

406
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,390
Let's choose a more challenging case

407
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,220
and represent the man?

408
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,620
Are you crazy?

409
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,150
The woman is rich.

410
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,390
Why bother with the man?

411
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,600
That's why they call me Unscrupulous Cheng.

412
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,630
I want to represent this unscrupulous husband.

413
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,440
I've made up my mind.

414
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,020
It's up to you.

415
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,590
You negotiate a higher legal fee for me.

416
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,480
Here.

417
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,480
What about the woman's case?

418
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,190
Pass it on to Luo Yingzi.

419
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
So you're using this case

420
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,570
to curry favor with her?

421
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,920
Yinghua Law Firm is short of cases anyway.

422
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,780
I took a case from her before,

423
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,420
so I can return the favor this time.

424
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,349
Then let's stick to our old rule.

425
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,980
Seventy-thirty split, you take seventy and I take thirty.

426
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,640
Seventy-thirty won't work this time.

427
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,700
How about eighty-twenty? Eighty-twenty.

428
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,030
I'm not doing as well as before.

429
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,099
I have an assistant now,

430
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,280
and I have to pay him.

431
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,849
An assistant? Where did he come from?

432
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,400
Liangcheng Law Firm assigned him to me.

433
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,760
Fang Lihong's nephew.

434
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,349
He's not an assistant.

435
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,750
He's just there to keep an eye on you.

436
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,330
Why would he keep an eye on me?

437
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm not afraid of him.

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,920
I don't care about that.

439
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,400
Our rule is our rule.

440
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,070
It's still seventy-thirty.

441
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,230
That's Fang Lihong's nephew.

442
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,240
Tell Fang Lihong to pay for her nephew.

443
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
It's not my problem.

444
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,760
Come on, Xue.

445
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,920
Why should I feel embarrassed?

446
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,680
Let's play another round.

447
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,290
Eighty-twenty.

448
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,980
If you win, it's seventy-thirty.

449
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,120
If I win, it's eighty-twenty.

450
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,650
[Jingbei Yinghua Law Firm]

451
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,480
The opposing party just wants to delay time

452
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,900
and transfer assets to avoid debt.

453
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,070
Even if the court eventually finds out

454
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,640
that their divorce was fake,

455
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,400
if Zhou Damin has already

456
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,700
transferred all the assets,

457
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,680
it will be difficult to trace the flow of those assets.

458
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,750
Enforcing the judgment will also be challenging.

459
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,550
So our top priority now

460
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,670
is to find a way to stop them as soon as possible.

461
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:36,950
Yingzi,

462
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,640
who is Zhou Damin's divorce lawyer?

463
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,830
It's Chen Shuo's old partner,

464
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,400
Xue from Dazheng Law Firm.

465
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,790
Right, Xia Shu,

466
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,620
we've already talked to the judge.

467
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,920
The judge agreed to make a ruling as soon as possible.

468
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,270
So your task now

469
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,930
is to closely monitor the court

470
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,090
and ensure the ruling is issued promptly.

471
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,440
Then urge the court

472
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,750
to serve the ruling

473
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,550
on the opposing party as soon as possible.

474
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:57,840
Okay.

475
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,690
They will definitely appeal.

476
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,640
But it's fine.

477
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,110
We'll urge the second-instance court to hold the hearing as soon as possible.

478
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,130
What can we do?

479
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,960
We're dealing with a bunch of rogues.

480
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,340
We have to play along with them.

481
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,870
I'm leaving.

482
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,590
Maybe we don't have to do anything this time.

483
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,410
They might start fighting among themselves.

484
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,030
What do you mean?

485
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,240
Think about it. How could it be such a coincidence?

486
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,850
How could He Qiaohui's husband's divorce case

487
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,500
end up in Xue's hands?

488
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,440
That's no coincidence.

489
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,640
It's a bad idea suggested by Chen Shuo.

490
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,270
Is it really a bad idea?

491
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,310
We've met He Qiaohui and her husband.

492
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,350
He Qiaohui's husband knows she can't escape repaying the debt.

493
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,880
Was the divorce

494
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,530
really fake?

495
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,590
So you're saying

496
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,060
He Qiaohui originally planned a fake divorce,

497
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,220
but her husband

498
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,840
wanted to make it real while he had the chance?

499
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,590
There's no turning a fake divorce into a real one.

500
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,030
Once the paperwork is done,

501
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,180
the divorce is real.

502
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,350
When the court rules that He Qiaohui has to repay the debt,

503
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,090
do you think her husband will remarry her?

504
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,400
If He Qiaohui understands this,

505
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,120
will she let her husband off easily?

506
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,000
Did Chen Shuo come up with this bad idea

507
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,750
after thinking through

508
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,160
what would happen in the future?

509
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,310
But why would he do it this way?

510
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,030
Don't you know?

511
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,750
I don't know.

He wants a 20% referral fee.

522
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,200
No way.

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,470
[Defendant Client, Jiao Yanling]

560
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,830
Sorry for troubling you.

561
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,930
No trouble at all. Let's go inside and talk.

562
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,440
Please come in.

563
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,920
Okay.

564
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,720
Hello. I'm Chen Shuo.

565
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,830
Zhao Wei.

566
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,500
[Plaintiff Client, Zhao Wei]

567
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,590
Hello, hello. Have a seat.

568
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,430
Nice shades. You look cool.

569
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,120
Mr. Chen.

570
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,690
My friend recommended Mr. Xue to me,

571
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,960
but he referred me to you instead.

572
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,590
He also told me

573
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,680
there's no case you can't win.

574
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,610
Thank you.

575
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,120
So you're the founder

576
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,560
and owner of Jiao's Private Kitchen?

577
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,330
Yes.

578
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,790
Qiu Hua.

579
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,800
Ms. Jiao, please continue.

580
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,650
Actually,

581
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,030
I can't really be called the founder.

582
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,960
I've had mobility issues since I was young

583
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,790
and don't like being in the public eye.

584
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,330
I just like

585
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,000
to cook at home.

586
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,630
Later,

587
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,880
my husband left us,

588
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,590
leaving me with our child.

589
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,680
I had no choice

590
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,750
but to open

591
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,330
a small restaurant.

592
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,190
I never expected it to become famous

593
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,230
or to expand to five locations.

594
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,310
Jiao's Kitchen?

595
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,740
You mean the founder of Jiao's Kitchen

596
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,670
is your wife?

597
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,880
I only found out when I came back this time.

598
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,440
When I left,

599
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,910
she was just a little girl

600
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,720
holding our child, begging me not to go.

601
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,050
I never expected

602
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,830
after I left for eighteen years,

603
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,790
she would become a boss

604
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
and open five restaurants.

605
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,830
Yes, Jiao's Kitchen is famous.

606
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,660
We all know that.

607
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,950
But there's one thing I don't understand, Mr. Zhao.

608
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,440
With such a money-spinner

609
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,070
in your family,

610
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,900
why did you leave in the first place?

611
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,720
At that time,

612
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,240
who could have predicted what would happen later?

613
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,840
I had no choice but to find her.

614
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,130
I came to Jingbei alone as a migrant worker.

615
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,400
I had no job,

616
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,780
no house.

617
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,570
I went hungry some days and ate too much others.

618
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,920
She's a local of Jingbei,

619
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,770
with a Hukou.

620
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,300
As you can see,

621
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,000
I've had a disability in my leg

622
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,280
since I was young.

623
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,480
So

624
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,750
I don't like interacting with people.

625
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,680
When I grew up,

626
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,430
I didn't have a decent job,

627
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,920
so my marriage was delayed.

628
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,110
Later, someone introduced me to her through my mother.

629
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,610
Did you explain

630
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,800
everything clearly to him about Yanling?

631
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,750
Don't worry.

632
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,110
I told him everything.

633
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,330
It's just the young man has a rural Hukou now.

634
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,280
If it were an urban Hukou,

635
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,920
he wouldn't even look at Yanling.

636
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,410
Why isn't he here yet?

637
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,640
Zhao,

638
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,480
why are you still sitting?

639
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,350
They're already here.

640
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,000
Stand up.

641
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,830
What are you doing?

642
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,680
Making such a fuss.

643
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,950
I was just listening to some tapes I brought back from the south.

644
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,040
They're really good.

645
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,390
Come on, get down.

646
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,780
Hurry up and get down.

647
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,590
Here you go.

648
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,590
This is Aunt Liu.

649
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,870
Hi, Aunt Liu.

650
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,180
Hello.

651
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,110
Yanling,

652
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,410
Hello, Yanling.

653
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,720
Yanling,

654
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,390
take Zhao inside.

655
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,170
It's too cold. Let's go inside.

656
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's go.

657
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,160
You go ahead.

658
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,790
Alright.

659
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,750
The first time I saw him,

660
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,920
I fell in love with him.

661
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,310
What I didn't expect was

662
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,400
that he also liked me.

663
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,910
When we were going up the stairs,

664
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,580
he reached out

665
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,190
to help me.

666
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,830
At that moment,

667
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,890
I felt so warm.

668
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,480
I've never liked

669
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,640
interacting with people since I was young.

670
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,540
I'm really boring.

671
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,140
He's completely different.

672
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,610
He's very playful

673
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,020
and always happy.

674
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,110
Then he took me to the places

675
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,160
he used to hang out.

676
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,580
There were so many people.

677
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,770
It was my first time going to a place like that.

678
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,990
There was music.

679
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,750
It was completely different

680
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,590
from my previous life.

681
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,370
Then, he asked me to dance with him.

682
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,000
How could I?

683
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,110
I didn't dare to at that time.

684
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,340
I really didn't know how to be there.

685
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,970
So he danced with me,

686
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,070
with me standing on his feet,

687
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,200
We danced like that

688
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,790
for an entire song.

689
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,970
He would also ride his motorcycle

690
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and take me all over the city.

691
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,460
I had never lived like this before.

692
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,720
This was a different kind of life.

693
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,520
He told me

694
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,460
that life could be lived differently.

695
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,770
Is it too fast?

696
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,700
Don't worry about that now.

697
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,790
I just want to know if you're happy.

698
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,130
Let me tell you,

699
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,860
nothing is more important than being happy.

700
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,430
So happy.

701
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,140
So warm.

702
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,780
Actually,

703
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,300
this kind of beauty

704
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,230
has been supporting me all along.

705
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,060
Listening to this,

706
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,000
isn't your story with Ms. Jiao

707
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,640
a love story?

708
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,530
Mr. Chen,

709
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,150
you're really funny.

710
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
Love?

711
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,680
She's crippled,

712
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,860
not attractive at all,

713
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,990
and can't even speak fluently.

714
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,530
How could I fall in love with her?

715
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,160
We got married soon after that.

716
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,470
Eleven months later,

717
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,180
I gave birth to our son.

718
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,480
I thought that with a child,

719
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,060
our marriage would become more stable.

720
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,510
But who would have thought

721
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,360
that when the child was only four months old,

722
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,120
he left without even saying goodbye.

723
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,530
Where did he go?

724
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,920
Later, I heard from him

725
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
that he went to Guangdong with friends.

726
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,620
I got his phone number,

727
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,040
so I called him.

728
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,160
I kept calling him, but he didn't answer.

729
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,320
And eventually, he changed his number.

730
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,370
When the child was ten months old,

731
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,380
I got his exact address

732
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,350
in Guangdong.

733
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,090
I rushed there with the child.

734
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,590
I remember waiting downstairs that day,

735
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,610
while he was upstairs

736
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,200
and wouldn't come down.

737
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,590
I waited all day,

738
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,860
and then he climbed onto the roof and ran away.

739
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,730
He's really something.

740
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,820
Ms. Jiao,

741
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,920
during the years he was away,

742
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,990
did he pay child support?

743
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,980
No, he didn't.

744
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,440
He's very playful

745
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,980
and can't save any money.

746
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,750
Besides,

747
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,000
when he was working in Jingbei,

748
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,820
he didn't have a decent job.

749
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,960
So when we were together,

750
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,200
he spent all the money I earned.

751
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
You don't want your wife,

752
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,900
but the child is your own, isn't it?

753
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,010
Aren't you the biological father?

754
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,480
Yes, I am.

755
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,880
Right, you are the father.

756
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,170
How could you just leave for eighteen years and not care about him at all?

757
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,510
It's not that I don't want to care,

758
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,030
but I can't.

759
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,330
I can't even support myself,

760
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,770
how can I support the child?

761
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,590
So what did you do

762
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,770
in the south during those eighteen years?

763
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,740
I played around.

764
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,440
I'm born to enjoy playing.

765
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,620
Over the years,

766
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,670
I never stuck with a job for long.

767
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,630
I tried doing business with friends, but it failed.

768
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,350
I tried transportation, but it failed too.

769
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,920
I even worked as a courier, and it also failed.

770
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,490
I even smuggled things by sea.

771
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,410
You failed it too?

772
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,670
It's profitable.

773
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,570
But I was caught.

774
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,970
I did make some money once,

775
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,240
but I got caught and stayed in jail for a couple of days.

776
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,830
You know,

777
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,760
life is just like that.

778
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,660
Money is not everything.

779
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,480
It's about having experiences.

780
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,710
Isn't that right?

781
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,590
Yes, yes, yes.

782
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,170
You're amazing.

783
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,880
Our savings

784
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,990
were soon gone too.

785
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,580
And I had such a little child with me.

786
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,750
I didn't know what to do.

787
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,010
Life was really hard.

788
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,210
So I cried at home.

789
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,510
I cried at home for months.

790
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,590
Nobody cared about me.

791
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,600
Nobody really cared.

792
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,430
Later, with no other choice,

793
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,910
I tried opening a small restaurant.

794
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,220
Unexpectedly, everyone loved my cooking.

795
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,480
I expanded from one restaurant to five,

796
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,400
and then from a small alley

797
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
to this upscale restaurant now.

798
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,930
I couldn't manage it alone,

799
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,270
so I hired people to help me.

800
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,510
This is unexpected.

801
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,110
Look at me,

802
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,440
someone who couldn't even speak in front of others before,

803
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,040
now

804
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,440
I have my own business.

805
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,920
And my son,

806
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,670
he is so amazing.

807
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,170
He got into university last year

808
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,050
and is now living on campus.

809
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,750
And then,

810
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,740
he came back.

811
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,670
[Jiao's Kitchen]

812
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,700
Thank you

813
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,130
for coming here personally.

814
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,470
Ms. Jiao, please stay.

815
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,240
No, no.

816
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,610
-Let me walk you to your car.
-Take it slow.

817
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,750
Don't worry.

818
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,680
I hope our cooperation

819
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,720
will go smoothly this time.

820
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,300
Absolutely.

821
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,310
Absolutely.

822
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,860
I've prepared some specialties from the restaurant, pickled vegetables.

823
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,050
You're too kind.

824
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:39,790
Goodbye.

825
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,310
Goodbye.

826
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,200
Alright, goodbye.

827
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,940
I thought that,

828
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,130
like Wang Baochuan

829
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
waiting in the cold cave for eighteen years,

830
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,600
I was waiting for him to come back.

831
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,000
But unexpectedly...

832
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,570
Ms. Jiao, your noodles with gravy are ready.

833
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,430
Have some noodles.

834
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,990
Who would eat noodles with this?

835
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,540
Pour the wine.

836
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,900
Stop.

837
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,430
Let her pour.

838
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,360
Aren't you the boss?

839
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,290
You've finished your meal?

840
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,880
Yanling,

841
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,240
I came back to get a divorce.

842
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,940
Nice wine.

843
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,680
Ms. Jiao has tens of millions of assets.

844
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,040
You can just enjoy them.

845
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,240
You can just play around.

846
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,710
Why do you want a divorce?

847
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,510
To tell you the truth,

848
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,780
I figured it out while eating.

849
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,630
I don't like this woman at all.

850
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
I don't even want to look at her.

851
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,830
I thought,

852
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,960
if we divorce,

853
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,450
since her assets are mine,

854
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,780
at least I can get half of them, right?

855
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,860
Since that's the case, why not divorce? Isn't that right?

856
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,770
Does he want to divide your assets?

857
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,310
He proposed a divorce,

858
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,980
but I didn't agree.

859
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,050
But I saw how determined he was.

860
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
I was thinking,

861
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,660
after eighteen years,

862
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,530
he wasn't with me.

863
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,940
I still managed to get through life, didn't I?

864
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,480
So, let's divorce.

865
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,250
I didn't expect him to propose that,

866
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,929
if we divorce,

867
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,469
my assets will be considered joint property,

868
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,590
and he wants to split them equally.

869
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,030
Excuse me, Mr. Zhao.

870
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm a bit unclear.

871
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
Are you saying that,

872
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,810
when the child was four months old,

873
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,020
you left without saying goodbye

874
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,280
and disappeared for eighteen years?

875
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,360
Yes.

876
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,600
And after eighteen years,

877
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,520
your wife earned tens of millions of assets on her own.

878
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,020
And then you came back and wanted to divorce her,

879
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,100
asking for half of her assets?

880
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,739
Is there anything wrong with that?

881
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
Well, Mr. Chen.

882
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,429
Is your assistant okay?

883
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
What does he mean by that?

884
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,560
He doesn't mean anything.

885
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,440
He's young

886
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,190
and lacks a sense of propriety in speaking.

887
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,280
Don't be too sensitive.

888
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,960
It's okay, Mr. Zhao.

889
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,110
Let's continue, shall we?

890
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,030
Mr. Chen,

891
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,450
your assistant didn't understand,

892
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,310
but you did, right?

893
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,370
Don't you know the legal provisions

894
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,140
better than me?

895
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,480
We're married.

896
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,420
What's hers is mine,

897
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,370
and of course, what's mine is hers.

898
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,710
All her assets

899
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,060
are joint property.

900
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,620
If we divorce, we have to split them equally.

901
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,510
Yes, that's what the law stipulates.

902
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,470
Ms. Jiao, are you here

903
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,460
to sue him?

904
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,080
It's not that I want to sue him.

905
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,720
It's because he wants to split my assets equally.

906
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,480
I... I don't want to give him that much.

907
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,640
I want to give him less.

908
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,070
But he sued me.

909
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,190
Isn't he a beast?

910
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,390
Ms. Jiao,

911
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,380
your situation is indeed complicated.

912
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,420
Please sit here for a moment.

913
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,860
Ms. Luo and I

914
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,770
will discuss and deliberate on it.

915
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,960
Yingzi, this case is a bit tricky.

916
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:04,970
Yes.

917
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,440
You see, even though

918
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,080
this man's behavior is despicable,

919
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,920
Jiao Yanling and he were already married

920
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,480
when she started her business.

921
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,000
So, he has the right

922
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,110
to divide the assets she earned.

923
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,340
Therefore, I suggest

924
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,820
it's best not to take this case to court.

925
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,280
It's better to advise both parties to negotiate.

926
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,890
This man disappeared for eighteen years

927
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,080
without a trace.

928
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,590
He didn't fulfill any obligations

929
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,900
to the family and the child.

930
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,210
Yet, he dares to ask for half of the assets.

931
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,510
That doesn't make sense.

932
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,960
Right.

933
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,630
But it's unlikely

934
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,900
that he won't get anything at all.

935
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
In my opinion,

936
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,370
for this kind of scumbag,

937
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,500
giving him a single cent is too much.

938
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,630
There's nothing we can do.

939
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,070
Sentiment is sentiment, and the law is the law.

940
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,760
The Mr. Zhao she just described

941
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,920
is heartless

942
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,280
and has no conscience whatsoever.

943
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,800
If this kind of person goes to court,

944
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,190
they definitely won't be polite either.

945
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Moreover,

946
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,710
his lawyer is Unscrupulous Chen.

947
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,940
You've told me so much.

948
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,730
Mr. Zhao,

949
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,920
I'm quite worried.

950
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,710
I'm afraid that if it goes to court,

951
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,850
the judge won't sympathize with you.

952
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,230
Why do I need the judge's sympathy?

953
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Isn't that what the law stipulates?

954
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,760
The judge can't ignore the law and make arbitrary rulings, can they?

955
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,800
According to the law, it's half.

956
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,500
Yes, it should be half.

957
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,030
But, Mr. Zhao,

958
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,190
in life,

959
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,120
money is indeed important.

960
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,300
But isn't reputation important too?

961
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,960
We're both men.

962
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,700
We needs this, don't we?

963
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,670
If the lawsuit is filed,

964
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,740
and the other party publicizes your past

965
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,630
and actions,

966
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,300
it will be very detrimental to your reputation.

967
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,020
Jiao Yanling? She won't.

968
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,630
Not Jiao Yanling.

969
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,940
I'm talking about the opposing lawyer.

970
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,160
You may not be clear about this now.

971
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,590
Lawyers have various tactics

972
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,540
and methods to win a lawsuit.

973
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,960
For example,

974
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,480
creating public opinion is one of them.

975
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,800
Like I just said,

976
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,880
if they publicize

977
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,320
all your actions,

978
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,000
whose side will public opinion take?

979
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,870
Ms. Jiao's, right?

980
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,030
So, when we go to court in the future,

981
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,880
don't you think the judge will consider public opinion?

982
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,920
Don't they consider public sentiment?

983
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,730
They have to consider it.

984
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,370
So, fighting this lawsuit will be very difficult for us.

985
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,780
It's okay.

986
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,650
I'll just leave after getting my money.

987
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,930
I don't care what others say.

988
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,510
You're simplifying things.

989
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,010
This is the internet era.

990
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,480
Even a passing bird leaves traces.

991
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,530
If you have any negative news,

992
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,160
sit down and type on the keyboard,

993
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,870
and it will all come out on the computer screen.

994
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,000
It stays with you forever,

995
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,400
no matter where you go.

996
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,560
So, Mr. Chen,

997
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
what should we do,

998
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,230
in your opinion?

999
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,110
In my opinion, we shouldn't go to court.

1000
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,030
Ms. Jiao,

1001
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
although you built up

1002
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,340
this family business all by yourself,

1003
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,110
your marital relationship

1004
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,990
has been ongoing.

1005
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,150
According to the law,

1006
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,230
unless there are legal grounds

1007
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,590
for a smaller share or no share,

1008
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,980
your assets are considered joint property.

1009
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,960
Your husband's request .

1010
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,670
for division does have a legal basis.

1011
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,230
We want to resolve this issue with the other party

1012
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,210
through negotiations as much as possible.

1013
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,320
Do you think that's okay?

1014
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,300
It's okay.

1015
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
I don't want to go to court either.

1016
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,670
After all, we were married,

1017
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,970
and he's still the father of our child.

1018
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,950
I don't want to make it too ugly.

1019
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,880
What I mean is,

1020
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,630
let's resolve this issue

1021
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,870
through negotiations.

1022
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,440
All of Ms. Jiao's assets

1023
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,660
were created

1024
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,130
during your

1025
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,400
marital relationship, right?

1026
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,690
You're married.

1027
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,230
Once you divorce,

1028
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,940
you have the right to divide the property.

1029
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,860
As long as this premise exists,

1030
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,160
we have room to continue negotiating.

1031
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,000
What's the problem here?

1032
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,310
Why do we need to negotiate further?

1033
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,700
Isn't it half?

1034
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,230
Well, you keep emphasizing this half.

1035
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,970
I've heard it so many times,

1036
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,840
half, half, half.

1037
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,010
I just want to ask, what have you done in these eighteen years?

1038
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,620
Have you fulfilled your duties as a husband?

1039
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,980
Have you fulfilled your duties as a father?

1040
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,690
No, nothing at all.

1041
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,710
Suddenly, you come back

1042
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,760
and want half of someone's property.

1043
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,330
Is that appropriate?

1044
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,180
It doesn't sound appropriate to anyone.

1045
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,080
But don't worry.

1046
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,880
We are very professional lawyers.

1047
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,950
So,

1048
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,960
we will fight for your maximum rights and interests.

1049
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,630
Think about it,

1050
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,270
shall we talk to them?

1051
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,890
The other party wants to divide the joint property.

1052
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,580
What's your bottom line?

1053
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,370
How much do you want to give him?

1054
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,150
He wants half.

1055
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,590
I think that's too much.

1056
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,400
And he wants cash.

1057
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Where am I going to get that much cash?

1058
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,230
I was thinking,

1059
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,190
don't be too ruthless.

1060
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,480
Giving him a part of it is fine.

1061
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,610
Can we do it

1062
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,060
this way?

1063
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,510
Give him a portion of it each month.

1064
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,710
This guy

1065
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,840
can't save money.

1066
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,030
I think this might be better.

1067
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,880
No good.

1068
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,670
Well...

1069
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,920
Ms. Jiao,

1070
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,100
do you still have any illusions about him?

1071
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,030
It's come to this point already.

1072
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,320
What illusions could I still have about him?

1073
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,840
Well, what I meant was,

1074
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,160
why give him a portion every month?

1075
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,990
Are you paying him a salary?

1076
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,320
In my opinion,

1077
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,440
the best solution is six words:

1078
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,400
divorce, divide the money, and move on.

1079
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,760
From now on, he's out

1080
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,480
of your world.

1081
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,630
Don't even think about him.

1082
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,920
Don't get entangled

1083
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,620
with such a scumbag.

1084
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,220
Alright,

1085
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,920
let's contact them first

1086
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,410
and start negotiations, okay?

1087
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,020
Okay.

1088
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,370
Alright, Ms. Jiao, you can go back first.

1089
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,480
Once we've arranged

1090
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,630
the time and place for negotiations,

1091
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,630
we'll notify you.

1092
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,960
Okay.

1093
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,620
By the way, I want to remind you one more thing.

1094
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,130
If he contacts you during this time,

1095
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,410
we suggest that you don't meet him.

1096
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,330
Okay.

1097
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,510
Let us escort you out.

1098
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,440
Okay.

1099
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,710
By the way, Ms. Jiao,

1100
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,450
I'll send you the electronic versions of the power of attorney

1101
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,600
and agreement first.

1102
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,080
You can take a look when you get back.

1103
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,720
Okay.

1104
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,400
Ms. Jiao.

1105
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,290
Ms. Jiao, we won't escort you out then.

1106
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,710
We'll keep in touch by phone anytime.

1107
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,390
Okay.

1108
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,010
Goodbye.

1109
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,590
Goodbye.

1110
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,550
Goodbye, Ms. Jiao.

1111
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,390
Wait, why are you sometimes escorting her out

1112
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,520
and sometimes not? Are you crazy?

1113
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,030
When I walked her up here just now,

1114
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,340
she kept lagging behind.

1115
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,640
She's insecure about her leg.

1116
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,360
When we're seated and she stands up,

1117
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,300
she thinks we're watching her from behind.

1118
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,230
You know, along this corridor,

1119
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,290
if we escort her,

1120
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,630
she'll think we're watching her like this from behind.

1121
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,990
I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable.

1122
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,110
You're really observant.

1123
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,030
I didn't notice

1124
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,280
you were so considerate before.

1125
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,350
It depends on who I'm dealing with.

1126
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,960
Someone like you, who has a strong heart,

1127
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,320
doesn't need me to be considerate usually.

1128
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,070
Stop dragging me into this.

1129
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,360
I'm talking about you and Xia Shu.

1130
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,070
You should call them

1131
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,210
and arrange the negotiation.

1132
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,720
Wait, why do we have to call them?

1133
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,010
Why don't they call us?

1134
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:52,900
Sis,

1135
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,800
can you stop acting high and mighty

1136
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,020
just because the other party is Chen Shuo?

1137
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,280
We're the defendants.

1138
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,030
If we don't call them,

1139
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,920
we'll just have to wait to go to court.

1140
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,030
Well, I'm not calling him.

1141
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,030
You call him if you want to.

1142
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,430
Whatever.
