[Unbreakable Ⅱ]

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,430
Lady, your card has a balance of forty thousand yuan.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,450
Can you check how much is

5
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,229
in this card for me?

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,039
It shows a balance of eighty-two thousand yuan.

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Sorry, just a moment, please.

8
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,430
Mr. Zhang, where should I sit?

9
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,310
You can sit with the division chief.

10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,330
Perfect timing to discuss the materials.

11
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,340
Okay.

12
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,080
Don't be nervous.

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
Hey, Qiu Hua, what's up?

14
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,400
Quanquan,

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
I have an urgent matter.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,960
I need to use the money

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,580
from our future fund.

18
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,610
I wanted to discuss it with you, is that okay?

19
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,430
Quanquan, let's go.

20
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,210
Okay, okay, division chief.

21
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,040
Sure, no problem, use it as you need.

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,030
The password is your birthday.

23
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,180
I have something to do, talk later.

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,290
What's going on?

25
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,750
Why are both Qiu Hua and Zhang Quanquan

26
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,100
transferring money to me?

27
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,430
Luo Yingzi.

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
Did you receive my transfer?

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
One for forty thousand, one for eighty thousand,

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,590
totaling one hundred twenty thousand.

31
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,710
So it was you who sent it.

32
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,400
I was wondering why Zhang Quanquan

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
also sent me money.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,750
What do you mean?

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,910
I want to buy in.

36
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,120
I guessed it right.

37
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,510
Have you thought it through?

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,740
You've been interviewing outside, haven't you?

39
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,630
I don't believe you haven't received any offers.

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,590
Not only received,

41
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,050
but three of them.

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,430
Yuanfang, Dahua, and Yuanhang.

43
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,550
These are all big firms.

44
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,550
And each offers a very good package.

45
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,530
Have you decided

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,360
to give up such good offers?

47
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,920
Sounds like you don't plan to keep me.

48
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,070
No, that's not what I meant.

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,360
Well, why are you teasing me too?

50
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,510
Tell me what you're thinking.

51
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,530
These three offers are all very good.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,270
But I still can't bear to leave.

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,800
Look at us now,

54
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,780
we have the law firm,

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
we have cases,

56
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,030
although not many,

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,320
but each is in our own hands.

58
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
Watching you fight alone

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,430
for this small firm,

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,560
I just can't bear it.

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,710
Then all I can say is,

62
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,300
welcome to join.

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,190
Ms. Qiu, happy cooperation.

64
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,840
Happy cooperation, Ms. Luo.

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,010
But we need to be clear,

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
the initial capital to register the firm was all from you.

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,030
The firm's shares,

68
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,800
apart from the three senior lawyers,

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,870
you hold fifty percent, I hold forty percent.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
My forty percent share ratio

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,630
is exactly one hundred twenty thousand.

72
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,459
I've transferred it to you.

73
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,570
The dividends from Auntie Song's case,

74
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,680
you should also distribute according to the shares.

75
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,390
No problem.

76
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,340
I have the one hundred thirty-two thousand ready for you.

77
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,880
Actually, you didn't need to transfer the one hundred twenty thousand,

78
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,590
you could have just deducted it from there.

79
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,130
That's a different matter.

80
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,480
I need to buy in first,

81
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,840
then you can give me the dividends.

82
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,630
Okay, Ms. Qiu, you're clear and straightforward in business.

83
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,430
Now that the dividends are settled,

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,630
you're no longer worried

85
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,800
about taking advantage of Zhang Quanquan's family, right?

86
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,480
To be honest with you,

87
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,909
most of the money I transferred to you today

88
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,180
was from Quanquan's card.

89
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,960
It's our future fund

90
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,150
for the child.

91
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,810
It's all Quanquan's savings.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,270
I didn't earn any money

93
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,550
from the Xu Jianshe case,

94
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,070
so I haven't deposited

95
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,640
any money into the card yet.

96
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,080
Today, I advanced it

97
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,700
for the sake of buying in.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,190
But I have to say,

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,190
you two are already married,

100
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,910
why still distinguish between yours and mine?

101
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,680
Since he entrusted this card to you,

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,400
it’s only right for you to use it.

103
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,540
I’m used to being independent.

104
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,460
I don’t want to owe anyone.

105
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,060
Then I’ll take it for now.

106
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:26,650
Go ahead.

107
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,960
I’ll have to return it to him later anyway.

108
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,960
I haven’t had the chance to explain it to him yet.

109
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,190
Count it.

110
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,900
Make sure it’s clear.

111
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,360
Between us, do we really need to count?

112
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
No, no, even brothers keep clear accounts.

113
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,490
Count it properly. Listen to the sound of the money.

114
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
Today’s a good day.

115
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,140
I’ll book a restaurant.

116
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,280
We’ll call Xia Shu and have a nice meal together,

117
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,870
okay?

118
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,820
Where’s Xia Shu?

119
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,630
She went to accompany Auntie Song.

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,020
She felt that Auntie Song was alone and had no one to take care of her,

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,830
so she said she’d accompany her to look at nursing homes.

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,890
Yingzi,

123
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,280
for Auntie Song’s case this time,

124
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,370
Xia Shu contributed the most.

125
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,670
We should give her a larger share.

126
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,600
I underestimated her before.

127
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,680
I said some harsh things to her,

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,520
but she didn’t hold a grudge against me.

129
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,350
So today’s meal is on me.

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,750
Your awareness has improved.

131
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,300
But I need to make this clear.

132
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,420
Since it’s your treat,

133
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,200
you’re paying for it.

134
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,060
Don’t say it’s your treat but end up with me paying, okay?

135
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,050
Fine, I’ve got money.

136
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,540
This stack should be enough.

137
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,850
We don’t need that much.

138
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Don’t worry.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,070
As for Xia Shu’s share,

140
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,020
I’ve already calculated it.

141
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,520
This time, we’ll give her an extra fifty thousand.

142
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,040
Okay, I think you’re right.

143
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,960
Alright then,

144
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,090
I’ll go put this money away first.

145
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
I’ll come back and discuss Ms. Jiao’s matter

146
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,700
with you later.

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,240
Sure.

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,159
Count it.

149
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,240
I’ve already counted.

150
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,159
It’s fine, count it again behind my back.

151
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,750
Ms. Jiao is quite something.

152
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,720
Why can’t she just

153
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,070
make up her mind

154
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,400
to sue him in court?

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,650
It’s infuriating.

156
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,370
But Ms. Jiao told us

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,920
her story with Zhao Wei, didn’t she?

158
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,190
To us, it’s just a story,

159
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
but to Ms. Jiao,

160
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,360
it’s her past.

161
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,190
It’s hard for us to understand

162
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,630
the weight of those feelings in her heart.

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Ms. Jiao said

164
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,910
that the care and warmth she received

165
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,410
from Zhao Wei

166
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,380
were more important than anything else in the world.

167
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,360
We should try to understand.

168
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,650
Understand what?

169
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,430
Let me ask you this.

170
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,750
Why does Ms. Jiao only remember

171
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,200
that pitiful bit of care and warmth?

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,800
The root cause is that

173
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
she’s only focusing her attention

174
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,050
on that scumbag.

175
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,409
But everyone’s emotional experiences are different.

176
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,630
We can’t make judgments for them.

177
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,000
I understand the reasoning,

178
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,310
but if she keeps giving in like this,

179
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,950
how can we stand our ground

180
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,120
and negotiate with the other party?

181
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
We’re lawyers.

182
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,090
We have to act according to our client’s wishes.

183
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,560
Just wait and see,

184
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,310
there’s bound to be a lot of trouble ahead.

185
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,930
You heard it the other day.

186
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,830
Zhao Wei came back

187
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,630
with a mountain of debt.

188
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,170
Anyway, her vast fortune isn’t mine,

189
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,810
so I don’t have to feel bad for her.

190
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
I’m just afraid that

191
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,040
in the end, she’ll give the money to Zhao Wei

192
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,720
and still lose her dignity.

193
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,340
It's Ms. Jiao.

194
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,560
Ms. Jiao.

195
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,750
Ms. Qiu, I just got a call

196
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,160
from a court in Guangdong.

197
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,290
They said Zhao Wei owes 3.67 million yuan outside.

198
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,800
He’s been sued,

199
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,390
and now

200
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,360
the court has ruled that he repay the debt, but he hasn’t.

201
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,890
He’s been added to the list of dishonest persons.

202
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,600
He provided my information

203
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,520
to the court over there.

204
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,440
The court called me and said

205
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,120
that my assets are marital property

206
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,960
and need to be used to repay his debts

207
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,390
that he owed outside.

208
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,960
I just checked,

209
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,039
and my bank account has been frozen.

210
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,090
Ms. Jiao, don't panic.

211
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Zhao Wei borrowed money in his personal capacity,

212
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,840
and the amount is obviously beyond

213
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,680
the needs of your daily family life.

214
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,440
Moreover, this money was not used for

215
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,770
your joint family life or business.

216
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
So I don't think

217
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,910
this money can be considered

218
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,440
as your joint marital debt.

219
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,080
We'll contact the court immediately

220
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,710
and file an execution objection.

221
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,690
Ms. Jiao, this is Luo.

222
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,240
Like what Ms. Qiu and I

223
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,630
have reminded you

224
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,040
before,

225
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,750
you must not soften your heart towards him.

226
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,870
See?

227
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,790
Now, have you given up

228
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,240
all your illusions about him?

229
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
We totally understand

230
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,360
your unforgettable old feelings for him,

231
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,790
but he now

232
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,130
sees you as an ATM.

233
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,030
If you don't think about yourself,

234
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,240
think about your career,

235
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,820
okay?

236
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,680
Think about your child.

237
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,840
You've worked hard to build this fortune,

238
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,040
not to support such a jerk.

239
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,150
Ms. Jiao,

240
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,960
I was just discussing this

241
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
with Ms. Luo.

242
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,320
I also think

243
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,750
that only by emotionally

244
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,390
cutting ties with him completely

245
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,720
can you and your child start a new life.

246
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,020
This man is not worth your pity.

247
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,030
Ladies,

248
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
I know you're both doing this for my good,

249
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,950
but I still want to talk to him again.

250
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,030
Please also help me

251
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,210
explain to the court over there

252
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,150
and unblock my account as soon as possible.

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,160
Thank you.

254
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,790
Then I'll contact the court over there right away

255
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,930
to sort out this account issue.

256
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,080
You call Chen Shuo

257
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,500
to schedule a negotiation time.

258
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,950
How can she, as a big boss,

259
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,270
not understand the situation?

260
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,170
Ms. Luo, be professional.

261
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,580
Call Chen Shuo quickly.

262
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,820
[Righteous Luo]

263
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,440
Righteous Luo.

264
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,670
You've been contacting me a bit too frequently lately.

265
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,320
Do you have any thoughts about me?

266
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,110
Unscrupulous Chen,

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,600
delusion is an illness that needs treatment.

268
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
And Chen Shuo,

269
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,710
it's okay to defend your client's interests,

270
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,330
but aiding and abetting is not right.

271
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,360
What's wrong with me?

272
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,670
What's wrong with you?

273
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,500
Your client is a dishonest person.

274
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,550
He submitted my client's information

275
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,110
to their court.

276
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,480
-My client's bank account has been frozen.
-Ah?

277
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,440
What are you "ah"-ing about?

278
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,910
Don't tell me you didn't know about it.

279
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,680
Well, you always come up with these bad ideas

280
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,750
for your client.

281
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,440
Don't you fear shortening your lifespan?

282
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,740
Righteous Luo, let me emphasize two points.

283
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,960
First, I didn't do this,

284
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,430
nor did I ask him to do it.

285
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,840
Second, can we be professional?

286
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,280
Don't push the blame

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,150
onto me every time

288
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,510
your client is in a bad situation.

289
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,010
Is that okay?

290
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,720
Pfft,

291
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,400
I won't believe you.

292
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,190
Alright, alright, let's stop here.

293
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,130
[Righteous Luo]

294
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,170
You've finished scolding and insulting me.

295
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
Do you have any business to discuss?

296
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,470
Let's schedule another negotiation.

297
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,830
See, in the end,

298
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,050
we still have to talk, right?

299
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,240
You should tell your client

300
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,750
to be prepared to make concessions.

301
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,790
Also,

302
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,000
without conditions that satisfy us,

303
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,190
we won't make any concessions. I'm hanging up.

304
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,060
Finally, I got to hang up first.

305
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,510
What did you draw?

306
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,920
A duck.

307
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,130
Lei, you're amazing!

308
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,350
Where have you seen a duck before?

309
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,640
In the river by the gate?

310
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,350
Great, great!

311
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,990
-Did you tell the teacher?
-Who is he talking to?

312
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,000
Did the teacher praise you?

313
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,900
He has another kid too.

314
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,540
I'm so happy.

315
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,970
I... In a few days, right?

316
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,240
Don't worry.

317
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll buy you a toy when I get back.

318
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,400
I'll get you a toy car.

319
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,790
What are you chatting about so happily?

320
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,190
Business matters.

321
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,980
We've recently received a new batch of cars.

322
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,360
Why did you rush me over here?

323
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,910
Sorry to trouble you,

324
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,290
having to come over specially like this.

325
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,420
I came to see you because it's definitely important.

326
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,360
Let me ask,

327
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,270
did you provide some information

328
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,150
about Ms. Jiao

329
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,920
to your court?

330
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,790
Her account has been frozen now.

331
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,750
Your court over there

332
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,320
wants to execute her assets.

333
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,150
Right.

334
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,970
Her assets

335
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,560
aren't my assets too?

336
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
If I can't repay the money over there,

337
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,630
the court won't remove me

338
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,120
from the list of dishonest people.

339
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,430
It's very inconvenient.

340
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,090
Why are you doing this to yourself?

341
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,630
On that day,

342
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,950
from the way your negotiation with her went,

343
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,360
I could see that Ms. Jiao still has feelings for you.

344
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,560
If we negotiate well,

345
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,870
it's completely possible to get more money.

346
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,200
Are you pushing her

347
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,920
to the brink by doing this now?

348
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,080
I haven't done anything wrong.

349
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,780
Didn't you also tell them last time

350
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,370
that my assets

351
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,300
are also marital property,

352
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,160
and my debts are also marital debts

353
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,950
that they need to share?

354
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,500
At that time,

355
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,840
after I get my share of the assets,

356
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,350
I can just use that part of the money to repay, right?

357
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,270
Are you really not afraid that she'll cut ties with her old feelings

358
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,240
and be tough on you?

359
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,120
I'm not afraid.

360
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,240
She's the type of person who,

361
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,630
as long as a man treats her well,

362
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,100
she'll remember it forever.

363
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
She can't be tough.

364
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Besides,

365
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,020
even if she is tough,

366
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,830
we still have to give her half, right?

367
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll take my share and leave.

368
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,670
What old feelings?

369
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,720
Alright,

370
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,620
I just wanted to ask for your opinion.

371
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,360
Do you want to negotiate with them again?

372
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,260
Is there anything to negotiate?

373
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,630
Her account is frozen.

374
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,670
You can't get the money.

375
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,280
If you negotiate with her and finish it

376
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,000
as soon as possible,

377
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,160
you can get the money faster.

378
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,940
Do you want this money or not?

379
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,160
Alright, alright, let's negotiate.

380
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,380
This is really troublesome.

381
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
I'll wait for your message.

382
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,590
Thank you.

383
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
Let me see him out.

384
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,710
Okay, Judge Li.

385
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,440
We'll prepare the materials as soon as possible

386
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,600
and send them to you.

387
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,520
Okay, thank you.

388
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,540
Goodbye.

389
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,440
It's set?

390
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,240
We'll negotiate at Liangcheng Law Firm in three days.

391
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,630
Then I'll call Ms. Jiao

392
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,030
and have her come over tomorrow to discuss

393
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,830
the negotiation strategy.

394
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't call her yet. Hang up.

395
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,750
What's wrong?

396
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,600
I think we overlooked a key point.

397
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
What did we overlook?

398
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,630
How has he been living in the south

399
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,910
for eighteen years?

400
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,320
With his despicable character,

401
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
I don't believe he's been living alone

402
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,030
for eighteen years.

403
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,320
Are you saying...

404
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,910
We know too little

405
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,830
about his behavior outside.

406
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,300
If he just left home,

407
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
then the impact on property division

408
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,440
is hard to estimate.

409
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,270
But if he left home

410
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,120
and had some other behavior at the same time,

411
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,790
then it's a different story.

412
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
Right, that makes sense.

413
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,830
The indictment should have his address.

414
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,430
Alright,

415
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,640
you go negotiate with Ms. Jiao,

416
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,910
and I'll make a trip to the south.

417
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,160
Can you handle it alone?

418
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,260
Yeah, I can.

419
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,180
Should we tell Ms. Jiao about this?

420
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,220
No. We're investigating Zhao Wei,

421
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,250
not Ms. Jiao.

422
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,660
We should keep this low-key.

423
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,740
Honey, you're back.

424
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,340
I bought some roast meat from downstairs at work.

425
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,110
Quanquan,

426
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,820
I was just about to call you.

427
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,840
Something urgent came up with my client.

428
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,600
I have to go on a business trip.

429
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,900
I'll be back in a day or two.

430
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,020
You're packing to leave already?

431
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,200
Why didn't you

432
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,790
tell me about this trip earlier?

433
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,960
I just decided on it.

434
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,690
It was sudden.

435
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I have to leave quickly.

436
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,380
I barely managed to get a flight ticket.

437
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,630
If I don't leave now, I'll miss check-in.

438
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:02,960
My bag...

439
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,930
I have to go now.

440
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm sorry.

441
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,050
Since we got married,

442
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,140
I've been busy every day.

443
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,670
I haven't taken care of the family enough.

444
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,440
When I finish this busy period,

445
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,790
I'll take a leave from the firm.

446
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,870
Then we can go on our honeymoon, okay?

447
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,000
I have to go now.

448
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,720
Qiu Hua.

449
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,390
Sit here,

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,270
I have something to say to you.

451
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,210
You withdrew the money.

452
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,190
What's going on?

453
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,550
I officially became a shareholder of Yinghua Law Firm today,

454
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,750
a partner.

455
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,790
That's why I transferred all the money away.

456
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,120
Eighty thousand yuan?

457
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,150
I saw that there was only two thousand left in the card.

458
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,400
Today, Luo Yingzi hoped I could become a shareholder.

459
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,090
I agreed.

460
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,600
But I didn't have that much money in my card at the time,

461
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,840
so I transferred the money from your card

462
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
and borrowed it first.

463
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,550
I got my dividend today.

464
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,360
I put the money in the bedside cabinet.

465
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,650
It's all locked up.

466
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,480
I was planning to tell you when I got back.

467
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,109
Look, the money is all here.

468
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,859
This money is more than enough to cover the deficit in your card.

469
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,349
For the extra part,

470
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,440
you should deposit it too.

471
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,220
I'm not talking about the money.

472
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,829
I just want to know

473
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,859
why you don't tell me anything.

474
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,990
You didn't tell me when you got fired from the law firm.

475
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,260
And now I just found out you're a partner,

476
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
and you didn't tell me about that either.

477
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,200
Is it that I'm not

478
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
in your life plan at all?

479
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,200
Quanquan, you might have misunderstood.

480
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,670
I was going to tell you today.

481
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,410
I called you, didn't I?

482
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,040
But you were busy at the time,

483
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,830
and you hung up really quickly.

484
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,880
I didn't have time to explain clearly.

485
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,110
Initially,

486
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,310
the registered capital of our law firm

487
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,960
was borne solely by Luo Yingzi.

488
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,200
She agreed to let me work at the firm

489
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,530
and also allowed me to look for other jobs outside.

490
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,000
Now she's letting me enjoy shareholding and dividends.

491
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,880
So I don't want to delay any longer.

492
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,290
I feel uneasy every second

493
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,530
I delay paying her back.

494
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:56,970
Also,

495
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,520
the card you gave me before,

496
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,200
the money on that card

497
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,920
was all saved by you through hard work.

498
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn’t explain it clearly to you today,

499
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,710
and I just transferred the money without saying anything. That was my fault.

500
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,720
I think maybe the card

501
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,590
should stay with you from now on.

502
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
Qiu Hua,

503
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,750
you know that’s not what I meant.

504
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,550
I just wanted to say that this money is for our child.

505
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,140
It's for the kid.

506
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,980
See, I made some money today,

507
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,000
and the extra amount

508
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
is also for our child’s future.

509
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,550
You can just deposit it all into your card.

510
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,970
This card... you should keep it.

511
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,330
It’s better if it stays with you.

512
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,160
Then both of us know clearly about it.

513
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,450
Quanquan, I really have to go now.

514
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,060
If I don’t leave, I’ll miss my flight.

515
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,950
Make sure you deposit the money, Quanquan.

516
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,970
I’m heading out now.

517
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,780
Take care of yourself, okay?

518
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,270
Mr. Chen,

519
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,440
are these the two cases?

520
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,070
Yes.

521
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,800
Why are you borrowing so many case files? Are you looking for something?

522
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,240
Looking for inspiration and experience.

523
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,000
You have no idea.

524
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,430
Reading cases handled by senior lawyers is incredibly enlightening.

525
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,290
Alright, just sign here.

526
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,680
Okay.

527
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:37,940
Done.

528
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,750
Thank you, Minghui.

529
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,720
Take care, Mr. Chen.

530
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,310
See you.

531
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,220
Besides handling cases,

532
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,810
he’s always reading through case files handled by others.

533
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,950
When he wasn’t looking, I flipped through them,

534
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,220
almost all of them were cases handled by partners.

535
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,500
Hey, he just borrowed another stack.

536
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,190
All of them are cases handled by partners.

537
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,060
So when does your flight

538
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,460
arrive in Jingbei?

539
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,740
This afternoon.

540
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,640
I’ve already sent the exact time to Xia Shu.

541
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,680
Yingzi,

542
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,920
just negotiate with them confidently.

543
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,140
They can’t win.

544
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,370
Ms. Qiu went to Guangdong, right?

545
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,640
Yes, she’s handling

546
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,830
the issue with your bank account.

547
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,790
She’s communicating

548
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,200
with the court over there.

549
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,490
You’ve all worked so hard.

550
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,870
It’s no trouble. It’s our job.

551
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,270
Ms. Luo,

552
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,860
you’re not married, are you?

553
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,100
I was. I’m divorced.

554
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,890
You were also a victim?

555
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,110
How do I put it?

556
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,500
In the end,

557
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,330
I sent my ex-husband to prison.

558
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,240
Actually, Ms. Jiao,

559
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,440
there was a time

560
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,480
when I was a bit like you.

561
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
I thought,

562
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,680
since we had a foundation of feelings,

563
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,750
I didn’t

564
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,550
want to be too harsh.

565
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,070
But later, I realized that

566
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,530
your kindness

567
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,900
means nothing to a cold

568
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,440
and selfish person.

569
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,020
So eventually,

570
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,650
I woke up.

571
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,070
It’s been over a year

572
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,910
since the divorce,

573
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,750
and I’m doing just fine, aren’t I?

574
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,320
You're still spinning the chair?

575
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,430
You’re really something.

576
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,310
Ms. Jiao, Ms. Luo.

577
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,970
It’s just the two of you?

578
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,500
Where’s Ms. Qiu?

579
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,630
She had something to attend to today.

580
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,850
Come in.

581
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,700
Mr. Zhao is already here.

582
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,160
Can we stop spinning this around, Mr. Zhao?

583
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,270
They’re here now.

584
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,070
Wei, why did you do this?

585
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,440
If you wanted a share of my money, that’s one thing.

586
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,710
But dragging your messy debts

587
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,190
into this,

588
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,580
that’s not right, is it?

589
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,440
What do you mean, “not right”?

590
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,600
We’re still married, aren’t we?

591
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,440
I provided your information to them.

592
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,670
What’s wrong with that?

593
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,850
My business is falling apart.

594
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,640
What about the hundreds of people who depend on it for their livelihood?

595
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,940
You’re pushing me to the brink.

596
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,890
Don’t you care about the consequences?

597
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,010
Ms. Jiao,

598
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,170
getting so emotional

599
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,040
won’t help solve the problem.

600
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,750
Why don’t we all sit down?

601
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,270
Mr. Chen, Mr. Zhao, here's the situation.

602
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,310
Today will be

603
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,310
our final negotiation.

604
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,080
If we can't reach an agreement this time,

605
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,270
we’ll have to wait for the court’s ruling.

606
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,010
From what we understand,

607
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,070
the 3.67 million yuan you owe over there

608
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,510
has already landed you on the court’s list of dishonest persons.

609
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,680
Our client, Ms. Jiao,

610
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,990
is willing to help you repay this portion of the debt,

611
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,970
but

612
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,390
the rest of the assets

613
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
will not be divided further.

614
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,200
Do you agree?

615
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,570
I paid you to represent me.

616
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,680
You can’t screw me over.

617
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,750
Forget I said anything.

618
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
So, you’re saying you don’t agree?

619
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Of course I don’t agree.

620
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
Is this your final position?

621
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,680
Final position, no agreement.

622
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,240
My debts

623
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,550
are also joint marital debts.

624
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,830
It’s only right for her to repay them.

625
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,550
When dividing the assets in the future,

626
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,270
you can deduct half of this amount.

627
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,500
Joint marital property

628
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,010
must include half for me.

629
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,640
Ms. Jiao, as you can see,

630
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,380
Mr. Zhao’s stance is very firm.

631
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,810
Our child is studying out of town.

632
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,230
I’ve called him back,

633
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,530
and he’ll be here tomorrow.

634
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,240
How am I supposed

635
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,140
to explain to him

636
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,610
that he has a father like you?

637
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,190
That’s up to you.

638
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,200
Fine then.

639
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,210
We’ll see each other in court.

640
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,270
I’m sorry, Ms. Jiao,

641
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,550
for making you come all this way for nothing.

642
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,750
You’ve worked hard.

643
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,790
It really has been exhausting.

644
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,080
Fang Rui, close the door.

645
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,010
As you just heard,

646
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,610
the opposing attorney, Luo, said

647
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,820
today is the final negotiation.

648
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,550
And when Ms. Jiao left,

649
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,630
her attitude was also very firm,

650
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,640
as you saw.

651
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,310
As your lawyer,

652
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,940
the best advice I can give you now is

653
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,950
to accept the terms they proposed

654
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,460
during the last negotiation,

655
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,060
that is, to accept one-third of the assets.

656
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,190
Of course, don’t worry.

657
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,690
I’ll fight hard to negotiate

658
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,530
that they cover

659
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,020
the 3.67 million debt, okay?

660
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,540
I’ll say it again.

661
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,620
If I can get half,

662
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,210
why should I settle for one-third?

663
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,070
Whose side are you on, anyway?

664
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,000
Are you out of your mind...

665
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,480
You’re the one who’s out of your mind!

666
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,860
You have another wife and child, don’t you?

667
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:19,830
What?

668
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,550
Don’t play dumb with me.

669
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,550
Three days ago, in that room,

670
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,510
weren’t you on the phone?

671
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,960
Talking to your another child, right?

672
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,070
A boy, isn’t it?

673
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,830
Why are you doing this?

674
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,680
Do you really want me to expose you?

675
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,360
Mr. Chen,

676
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,140
I’m not a monk.

677
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,110
You expect me to live alone for eighteen years?

678
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,070
Besides, legally speaking,

679
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,060
I’m still married to her,

680
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,920
right?

681
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,580
That woman is just someone I’m living with for convenience.

682
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,670
That has nothing to do with this.

683
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,300
It does matter. You’ve committed bigamy.

684
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,520
You committed a serious marriage crime.

685
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,680
That’s a serious accusation.

686
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,110
You’ll be held responsible, you know?

687
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,240
You’re really something, Mr. Zhao.

688
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,610
Can we act like adults here?

689
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,750
Let me ask you one last time.

690
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,350
Do you accept

691
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,160
my final proposal?

692
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,880
Don’t bother asking. I don’t accept.

693
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,210
Then there’s nothing more I can do, Mr. Zhao.

694
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,320
Let’s terminate our agreement.

695
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,830
I won’t represent you in this case anymore.

696
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,070
I’m sorry, but you’ve chosen the wrong person.

697
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,190
I’m not up to the task.

698
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,000
Here’s what we’ll do.

699
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,630
You initially paid me 200,000 yuan.

700
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,490
I’ve kept 140,000 of that.

701
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,850
Thirty percent, 60,000 yuan,

702
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,810
I’ll hand over to the firm.

703
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,710
And the 140,000 includes my taxes.

704
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,000
How about this?

705
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,240
If you accept,

706
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,720
we’ll split the 140,000 in half.

707
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,640
I’ll return 70,000 to you.

708
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,980
I’ll cover the taxes on my portion.

709
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,940
Is that okay?

710
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,030
If you want to terminate the agreement,

711
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,510
then you'll refund the full amount.

712
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,010
Not a single cent less.

713
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,070
Fine.

714
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,200
I’ll take the loss, okay?

715
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,330
But I have one condition.

716
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,150
What condition?

717
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,070
Let me tell you.

718
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,620
If you come back to me to represent you in this case again,

719
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,890
my starting fee

720
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,160
will be 500,000 yuan.

721
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,620
China doesn’t have

722
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,070
just one lawyer.

723
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,230
Even if I don’t take this to court,

724
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,550
or even if I do,

725
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,160
I don’t necessarily have to come to you.

726
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,830
Thank you very much.

727
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,360
Fang Rui,

728
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,750
take Mr. Zhao to handle the termination procedures.

729
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,070
Next room, please.

730
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,140
Take care. I won’t see you out.

731
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,140
Let’s see how long you can keep acting so high and mighty.

732
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,680
How did it go?

733
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,700
Can we win this time?

734
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh my god, Qiu Hua, you’re amazing!

735
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,350
With this evidence,

736
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,510
he’ll never escape our grasp.

737
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,360
[Jiao's Kitchen]

738
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,110
I still want to thank all of you.

739
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,150
Some of you have been with me for many years,

740
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,960
and some have just joined recently.

741
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,430
Because of my family matters,

742
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,530
we’ll be taking a break for a few months.

743
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,820
Your salaries for these months

744
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,450
will be paid as usual.

745
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,740
I hope when it’s time to come back,

746
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,390
you’ll all return.

747
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,930
Thank you, Ms. Jiao.

748
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,220
We appreciate all the care

749
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,660
you’ve shown us over the years.

750
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,990
Let’s toast to Ms. Jiao.

751
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,740
Thank you, Ms. Jiao.

752
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,930
Thank you, thank you, Ms. Jiao.

753
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
Sit down and eat.

754
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
You take care of things here.

755
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,160
Sure, no problem.

756
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,920
He has been living with a woman surnamed Qi

757
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,690
for twelve years now.

758
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,070
Before that,

759
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,270
he also lived

760
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,270
with another woman.

761
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,480
He and this Ms. Qi

762
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,000
have been living as husband and wife.

763
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,800
They even jointly purchased a property,

764
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,030
and both their names

765
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,410
are on the deed.

766
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,240
They also raised a child together,

767
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,850
who is now eight years old.

768
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,070
On the child’s household registration,

769
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,420
Zhao Wei’s name is listed as the father.

770
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,950
He and Ms. Qi

771
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,430
also held a wedding ceremony locally.

772
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,440
Ms. Jiao,

773
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,290
now you have two options.

774
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,220
The first is

775
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,390
to continue the divorce lawsuit against him.

776
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,110
He’s been away from home for eighteen years.

777
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,610
During those eighteen years,

778
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,270
whether it’s toward the family, the child,

779
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,480
or you as his wife,

780
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,540
he hasn’t fulfilled any of his obligations.

781
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,930
We’ll explain all of this

782
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,240
to the judge in detail.

783
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,030
The judge

784
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,070
will likely side with you.

785
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,070
However,

786
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,030
the fortune you’ve built with your own hands

787
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,680
might end up

788
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,650
with him taking a significant portion.

789
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,810
The second option is

790
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,110
to sue him for bigamy,

791
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,930
so that his betrayal

792
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,070
receives the legal punishment it deserves.

793
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,790
Give me some time

794
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,030
to think about it.

795
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,580
This should completely shatter her illusions, right?

796
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,390
Sometimes I feel like we women

797
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,390
are truly emotional creatures.

798
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,670
These are the ties that bind.

799
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,830
Even when two people are separated, they still exist.

800
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,950
Speaking of which, these ties can feel a bit burdensome,

801
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,640
but if life didn’t have these kinds of bonds,

802
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,610
what meaning would there be in living?

803
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,590
Yanling,

804
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,970
I’m back to get a divorce.

805
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,810
A couple of days ago, Liu Ming’s dad came to see me.

806
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,880
What did he want?

807
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,260
You know his parents are getting old.

808
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,740
His mom recently fell ill.

809
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,830
She’s partially paralyzed.

810
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,240
But the prison where he’s serving his sentence is so far away,

811
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,930
and the old couple can’t make the trip.

812
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,650
Yet they miss their son in prison.

813
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,680
Guess what?

814
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,760
His dad actually wanted me to go visit Liu Ming

815
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,910
on their behalf.

816
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
What were they thinking?

817
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,140
You didn’t agree, did you?

818
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,250
How could I possibly agree?

819
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,000
But those couple of days,

820
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,400
because of this,

821
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,680
I couldn’t sleep well.

822
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,750
You know, it’s been almost half a year

823
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,700
since Liu Ming’s case ended.

824
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,210
Even though we’ve become like strangers,

825
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,350
because of this,

826
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,750
I suddenly

827
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,350
feel a bit sorry for him.

828
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,930
The pitiful always have their own faults.

829
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,510
If you’re going to be soft-hearted, I’ll look down on you.

830
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,010
At least for me,

831
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,110
having gone through a divorce,

832
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,510
my heart is harder than stone.

833
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,510
Being soft-hearted is impossible.

834
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,180
It’s just that...

835
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,590
Well, I feel a bit unsettled, that’s all.

836
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I’m back.

837
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,850
Hey, Quanquan,

838
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,190
I’m back from my business trip.

839
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,800
Why aren’t you home yet?

840
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
It’s so late.

841
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,179
Qiu Hua,

842
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,900
I’m not feeling well.

843
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,730
I’m at the hospital.

844
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,870
[Jingbei City People’s Hospital]

845
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,429
Oh my god.

846
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,739
Quanquan,

847
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,830
Quanquan,

848
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,460
what’s wrong?

849
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,929
Are you okay?

850
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,659
Luckily, no fever.

851
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,080
I told you not to come.

852
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,030
You’re sick.

853
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,310
How could I not come?

854
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,980
What did the doctor say?

855
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,429
The doctor said it’s nothing serious.

856
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,670
I just feel weak all over

857
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,110
and a bit nauseous.

858
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,720
It’s fine.

859
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,890
If it were fine, why would you be on an IV?

860
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,960
I just ate some random stuff and drank a bit

861
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,190
because you weren’t home.

862
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,120
Then my stomach got upset, and I started vomiting and having diarrhea.

863
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,130
Look at you.

864
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,290
Why can’t you take care of yourself?

865
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,930
What’s wrong?

866
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,100
Do you need to vomit?

867
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,060
Here, drink some water.

868
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Don’t talk.

869
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,360
It comes in waves.

870
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,670
Use this.

871
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,740
Here?

872
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,280
You were home alone.

873
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,710
Why were you drinking?

874
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,820
I was just so bored.

875
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,440
I thought drinking would help me relax.

876
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,840
It’s fine.

877
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,000
Isn’t this nice?

878
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,960
Now that I’m sick, you’re not busy anymore.

879
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,820
It’s good.

880
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,480
Quanquan,

881
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,760
I’m sorry.

882
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,550
I’ve been so busy with work

883
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,920
and haven’t been able to take care of you.

884
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,070
Since we got married,

885
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,240
we’ve talked about going back to our hometown to have a wedding banquet,

886
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,320
but we still haven’t done it.

887
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,680
We planned a honeymoon,

888
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,270
but it never happened.

889
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,300
We haven’t even gone to the movies

890
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,840
or on a proper date.

891
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,050
It’s all my fault.

892
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,040
I’ve messed up what should have been a good life.

893
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,960
I promise you,

894
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,390
once I’m done with this busy period,

895
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,760
we’ll go, okay?

896
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,960
Qiu Hua,

897
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,690
I feel a bit dizzy.

898
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,880
Dizzy?

899
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,290
It’s like I’m overwhelmed by happiness.

900
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,650
I didn’t sleep well at all last night.

901
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,860
My head is buzzing.

902
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,830
Good morning, Ms. Fang.

903
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,650
Morning.

904
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,440
Ms. Fang.

905
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,080
Good morning.

906
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,290
Ms. Fang.

907
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,560
Let me tell you something.

908
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,840
Since Chen Shuo arrived,

909
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,040
he’s been frequently borrowing case files

910
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,970
from the archives—cases handled by partners in the past.

911
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,800
He’s already gone through most of them.

912
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,960
Call Fang Rui to come see me.

913
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,870
Sure, Ms. Fang.

914
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,670
Come in.

915
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,180
Fang Rui, come here.

916
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,900
Sit down.

917
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,430
How’s it been working with Chen Shuo?

918
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,270
It’s been great.

919
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,020
Auntie,

920
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,630
I think I’m starting to like practicing law.

921
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,710
You didn’t like it before?

922
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,350
Before, I just thought it was a bit boring.

923
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,450
But after working with my mentor,

924
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,280
I find law really interesting.

925
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,280
It’s not as boring as you and my parents make it seem.

926
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,500
Chen Shuo is your mentor now?

927
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,150
Seems like you two get along well.

928
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,280
Of course!

929
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,710
What

930
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,030
did I tell you?

931
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,630
Haven’t forgotten, have you?

932
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,250
I heard he’s been

933
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,150
reading a lot of cases

934
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,240
handled by other partners in the firm.

935
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,360
Do you know why?

936
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,490
He’s studying.

937
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
I thought he was more into having fun.

938
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,970
Reading case files—is there a problem?

939
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,960
No problem.

940
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,630
Has he specifically talked to you about

941
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,360
which cases he’s particularly interested in?

942
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,580
No.

943
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,470
Mr. Zhao, you can’t be here.

944
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,360
Meeting with a lawyer requires an appointment.

945
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,880
Aren’t I also your client?

946
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,380
I’ll just stand here and wait. What’s the problem?

947
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Mr. Zhao, this isn’t appropriate.

948
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,440
It’s really not suitable.

949
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
It’s fine, Sun. It’s fine.

950
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,040
You can go back.

951
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,920
Mr. Chen.

952
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,590
Mr. Chen.

953
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,620
Wait, wait.

954
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,620
Mr. Zhao,

955
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,550
didn’t we already terminate our agreement?

956
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,750
Why are you still coming to me?

957
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,320
Mr. Chen, you really have to save me this time.

958
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,180
What’s wrong now?

959
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,480
My wife down south said

960
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,950
someone went there to investigate me.

961
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,550
It just hit me

962
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,070
the lawyer named Qiu,

963
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,610
who’s been negotiating with us,

964
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
wasn’t there that day.

965
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,690
Did you already figure it out

966
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,950
that she went to investigate?

967
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,890
So you’re only realizing this now?

968
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
They’re partners.

969
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,630
If only one showed up that day,

970
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,840
I knew something was wrong.

971
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,840
Based on my understanding of them,

972
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,440
there’s no way they wouldn’t go south

973
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,710
to look into your life.

974
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,550
What? Did they get evidence

975
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,460
of your bigamy?

976
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,290
That’s why I said you’re brilliant.

977
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,050
You have to save me!

978
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,410
Given the current situation,

979
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,750
if they sue you,

980
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,150
you’re going to jail.

981
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,250
What should I do?

982
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,570
Alright, here’s what you do.

983
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,800
Go find your wife up north.

984
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,010
Beg her, see her.

985
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,680
Just kneel in front of her

986
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,130
and ask for another chance.

987
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,370
Ask her to let you off the hook.

988
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,280
That’s what I should do.

989
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,380
But Mr. Zhao,

990
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,960
what you did to her before was pretty ruthless.

991
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,490
Are you sure she’ll forgive you?

992
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,480
Well.

993
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,400
Are you planning to hire me again?

994
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,000
If you want to hire me,

995
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,820
we can sign the agreement right now.

996
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,030
Mr. Chen,

997
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
let me try begging her first.

998
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,800
If she agrees,

999
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,700
then I won’t need to go to court.

1000
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,430
That’s fine too.

1001
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,710
But if you sign now,

1002
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,480
it’s 500,000 yuan.

1003
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,180
If you come back later, it’ll be 600,000.

1004
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,760
Not a single cent less.

1005
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,230
We’ll talk about it later.

1006
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,840
Explain it to them.

1007
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,190
Have them pay in cash.

1008
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,880
And if any of them are in financial difficulty...

1009
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,590
Don’t pull me!

1010
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,400
Sir, sir, sir!

1011
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,740
I’m here to see my wife.

1012
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,640
Ms. Jiao, I'm leaving.

1013
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,370
What do you want?

1014
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,590
Yanling,

1015
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,440
it’s all my fault.

1016
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,840
Please don’t hold it against me.

1017
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,510
Don’t take it to heart.

1018
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,030
The divorce, the property,

1019
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,040
we can discuss everything.

1020
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,800
Just don’t drag other things into this.

1021
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,330
What are you talking about?

1022
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,370
It's...

1023
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,880
You said we’d

1024
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,300
leave it to the law at this point.

1025
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,040
Go back. Come with your lawyer.

1026
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
If my lawyer isn’t present,

1027
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,500
I won’t discuss anything with you.

1028
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,980
Why are you dragging outsiders into this?

1029
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,630
Are you saying the ones dragged in aren’t outsiders?

1030
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,920
Yanling,

1031
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,910
after all, we’re still husband and wife.

1032
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,640
We stopped being husband and wife a long time ago.

1033
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,070
Go back.

1034
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,370
I’m busy.

1035
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,500
Yanling,

1036
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,110
I’m begging you.

1037
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,310
For the sake of our child...

1038
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,750
What are you doing?

1039
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,940
I was wrong, I was wrong.

1040
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,460
I’m begging you, Yanling.

1041
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,280
Wang!

1042
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,880
Yanling,

1043
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,030
I’m begging you, Yanling.

1044
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,920
Sir, I’m sorry.

1045
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,630
Don’t pull me!

1046
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,150
I’m working, sir.

1047
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,670
Don’t pull me!

1048
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,000
Sir, I’m sorry.

1049
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,920
This is my wife.

1050
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,150
Sir, please leave. Sir!

1051
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,670
Yanling!

1052
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,110
Sir!

1053
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:57,480
Yanling!

1054
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,440
Yanling!

1055
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,440
What are you doing?
