00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,710
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,840
Mr. Sun.

4
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,310
Thank you.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
That must have cost you a lot.

6
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,509
Look at Mingshan Group—

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,430
big companies sure have money.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
Every dish on the table is top-notch.

9
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,220
Right?

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,540
Yes.

11
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,560
Mr. Sun being willing to talk

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,870
is a great sign

13
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,039
for both parties.

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,509
Mr. Xue,

15
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,570
regarding your request for pre-litigation asset preservation,

16
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,430
we've filed for a reconsideration

17
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,280
and asked the court to hold you accountable

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,570
for wrongful preservation.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Now that you've frozen the accounts,

20
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,090
Mingshan is in serious financial trouble,

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,130
and the compensation funds have basically become meaningless.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Was your goal to drag this

23
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,829
into a lose-lose situation?

24
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
This has nothing to do with Xue.

25
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,730
I was the one who requested the accounts to be frozen.

26
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,720
I had no choice.

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,030
Since you were not paying the agency fee,

28
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,079
we had no choice but to do this.

29
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,060
Lawyers,

30
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,670
it's not that I don't want to pay.

31
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,320
I simply can't.

32
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,320
There's barely over 10 million left in the account.

33
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,500
Now that you've frozen the accounts,

34
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,000
the workers are protesting, and the production lines have shut down.

35
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,760
You're cutting off their livelihood here.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,110
Mr. Sun, you're trying to guilt-trip me?

37
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,110
Well, I'm not falling for it.

38
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,500
When you had security block me

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,830
from Mingshan's gates

40
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,950
and secretly negotiated with Minghai,

41
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,400
you should've seen this coming.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,520
Right? There's no point in saying this now.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,740
Mr. Sun,

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,140
we're not trying to confront Mingshan Group.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,890
If you give Mr. Chen the agency fee he deserves,

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,180
we'll immediately apply to unfreeze the account.

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,610
That way, you'll get all the money to save the company.

48
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,630
Whenever you give us the full agency fee

49
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,420
according to the contract,

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,390
I will apply for the unfreezing right away.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,400
Otherwise,

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,540
I will definitely file a lawsuit within 30 days,

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,770
and no one will be allowed to touch

54
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,320
this 14 million or so.

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,190
Chen Shuo,

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,090
you're just trying to drag this out until I'm pushed to the edge.

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,070
Do the math yourself.

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,510
The agency fee you're getting from this case

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,440
is enough to pay the wages of hundreds of workers.

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,150
While the workers are starving,

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,890
you still complain about the money being too little.

62
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,240
It really is

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,040
"The rich are dining on wine and meat, while the poor are freezing to death,"

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,190
and "Let them eat cake."

65
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,950
If everyone was like this,

66
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,410
who would still want to run an industry?

67
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,910
Everyone would just become a lawyer.

68
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,900
Mr. Sun, are you blaming me for making it so you can't pay the wages?

69
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,190
You caused all this trouble by being unreasonable.

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,810
Which one of us cut off the workers' livelihoods?

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,940
The pre-litigation preservation is simply

72
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,560
a self-protection measure we took in this urgent situation.

73
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,060
Mr. Sun,

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,320
once we reach an agreement,

75
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,570
we can immediately apply for the unfreezing.

76
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,030
That's not what we're here to discuss today.

77
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,920
Shouldn't we be discussing the agency fee?

78
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,840
Let's talk business.

79
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,830
Alright,

80
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,040
let's talk business.

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,950
Mr. Xu,

82
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,720
according to the agency agreement between Liangcheng Law Firm

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
and Mingshan Group,

84
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,870
we have fulfilled

85
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,480
all the obligations specified in the agreement.

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,080
And the conditions for the payment of the full agency fee

87
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,230
have also been met.

88
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,909
It was stipulated in the agreement.

89
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,680
Do you have any objections?

90
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm afraid I can't agree.

91
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,250
First,

92
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,420
Liangcheng Law Firm has already issued a letter announcing

93
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,300
that it had severed ties with Mr. Chen Shuo.

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,300
From now on, we will only be discussing Mr. Chen Shuo.

95
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,540
Second,

96
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,550
Mr. Chen Shuo didn't complete

97
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,430
all the entrusted matters.

98
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,220
Therefore,

99
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
he has no legal grounds

100
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,250
to take the full agency fee.

101
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,320
Mr. Chen Shuo only participated during the first trial.

102
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,560
In the first trial, Minghai basically did not put up any resistance.

103
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,020
The most important part

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
of realizing the creditor's rights was largely

105
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,960
resolved through negotiations between both parties.

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,990
This was not the result of Mr. Chen Shuo's work.

107
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,580
Thus, it is clearly unfair for Mr. Chen Shuo

108
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,100
to claim the full agency fee.

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,790
Third, and most importantly,

110
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,590
Mr. Chen Shuo secretly transferred 5.6 million

111
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,440
from the joint account.

112
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,050
This constitutes serious misappropriation.

113
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,960
We demand an immediate return of the funds

114
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,040
and reserve the right

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,090
to take further legal action.

116
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,240
On the condition that Mr. Chen Shuo returns the full amount,

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
excluding any reasonable expenses

118
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,390
that can be supported by invoices,

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,600
we are willing to pay a total of 500 thousand

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,920
in agency fees

121
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,770
to Mr. Chen Shuo and Mr. Han Zhitong.

122
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,750
Thank you.

123
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,980
This is our final decision.

124
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,800
It cannot be changed

125
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,780
and is non-negotiable.

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,390
Mr. Sun,

127
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,550
is this your attitude as well?

128
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,310
I've fully entrusted it to Mr. Xu Zhuo.

129
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,470
I'll follow Mr. Xu's advice.

130
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,790
Well, I'm sorry.

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,670
Let's not talk about it anymore. See you in court.

132
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,280
Mr. Xue, Mr. Sun,

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,190
could you please excuse us for a moment?

134
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,420
I'd like to have a private conversation with Mr. Chen.

135
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,350
Alright.

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,450
That's fine.

137
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
Being young is great.

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,950
You're only a few years older than me.

139
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,990
What do you mean by that?

140
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,160
When I was young,

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,900
my temper was even worse than yours.

142
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,270
Otherwise,

143
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,270
I wouldn't have ended up in prison twice.

144
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Mr. Xu, please don't say that.

145
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,430
We're both lawyers, working in the same field.

146
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,430
The circle is not that big.

147
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,830
Everyone knows why you went to jail

148
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,800
those two times.

149
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,010
So, my situation

150
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,790
really can't be compared to yours back then.

151
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,000
Mr. Chen,

152
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,950
we work in the same field.

153
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,060
Of course, I understand the saying "Seeing someone of my own kind suffer makes me reflect on my own fate."

154
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,750
Although I'm the representative for Mingshan Group,

155
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm willing to help you.

156
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,230
Wait, Mr. Xu,

157
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm really curious.

158
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,310
Are you always like this?

159
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,120
Representing the plaintiff but helping the defendant?

160
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,600
Do you want to play both sides?

161
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,440
We're all in the legal profession.

162
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,080
Winning cases and making money

163
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,659
is the most important thing.

164
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,750
Don't meddle in other matters.

165
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,650
As long as you don't meddle in,

166
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,510
I'll take care

167
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,160
of Mingshan.

168
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,820
What did I meddle in?

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,270
And what does any of this

170
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,500
have to do with you?

171
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,350
Aren't we here to discuss Mingshan's matter today?

172
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,850
Do we need to discuss anything else?

173
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,040
Mr. Chen,

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,510
I hope you can accept my goodwill

175
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,460
and don't let emotions cloud your judgment.

176
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,310
You should know better than I do

177
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
how the law defines the crime of misappropriation.

178
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,669
That's not necessarily true.

179
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,409
I didn't get detained twice.

180
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,360
So there are some things

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,850
I probably know less about than you.

182
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,200
It's true that I got detained twice,

183
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,240
but both times I was acquitted.

184
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,280
If you get detained this time,

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,930
there's no way

186
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,680
you'll come out innocent.

187
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,180
Whether I can come out innocent

188
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,480
depends on whether you have the ability

189
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,590
to put me in there first.

190
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Also, as you just mentioned,

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,200
it's true that you came out innocent

192
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,860
both times.

193
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,240
But what I want to say is that

194
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,320
you know exactly what shady things

195
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,870
you've done.

196
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,640
If that's the case,

197
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,300
there's no need to continue this conversation.

198
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,040
I hope you won't regret it.

199
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,600
Mr. Xu,

200
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,180
I have a rebellious nature.

201
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,710
I'm not afraid of threats,

202
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,810
nor am I afraid of petty people.

203
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,330
Remember what you said.

204
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,490
Trying to threaten me?

205
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,380
Lei,

206
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,270
I really didn't expect you

207
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,690
to offer such a price.

208
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,310
You must have put everything you have into this, right?

209
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
As long as it's worth it.

210
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,030
Lei,

211
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,790
I'll sign it.

212
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,410
That's great!

213
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,800
Ms. Zhang Lan, I can make the payment anytime.

214
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,310
By the way, why didn't Xia Shu come with you?

215
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,650
She's busy with something else, I guess.

216
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
Her work

217
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,800
revolves around you, doesn't it?

218
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,310
Did you two have a fight?

219
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,080
It must have been your fault.

220
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,670
You haven't paid back the money you owe her yet, have you?

221
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,150
I haven't.

222
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,190
You're a grown man.

223
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,560
You don't need me

224
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,500
to remind you what Xia Shu is thinking.

225
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,830
I was actually supposed to go back to the U.S. these days,

226
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,900
but because she came to speak well of you,

227
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,750
I agreed to meet you.

228
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,020
She spoke up for me?

229
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,850
The first time she made an appointment with me,

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,260
she told me how good you are.

231
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,320
Of course,

232
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,270
I'm not someone easily swayed by others.

233
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,030
I agreed to sign the contract with you

234
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
because of your offer.

235
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,790
My dad's in trouble,

236
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,180
and I can't count on my mom.

237
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,420
But luckily, I'm doing alright.

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,110
I managed to get under the truck the first time,

239
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,590
and I can do it the second time.

240
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,950
Earning money by my own ability

241
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,610
makes me happy.

242
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
840,000 yuan, plus the travel expenses.

243
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,260
Are you paying or not?

244
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,050
No.

245
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,670
I want you to continue helping me collect the debt.

246
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,600
Damn you!

247
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,440
I'm not serving you anymore.

248
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,390
I already spent the money I got from selling the car

249
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,300
on hiring a lawyer for my dad and taking care of my mom,

250
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,760
so there's not much left.

251
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,750
As long as you transfer the money according to the contract,

252
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,650
it can solve most of my difficulties.

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,720
Just tell me,

254
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
when can you give me the money?

255
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,930
So you're just robbing Peter to pay Paul, right?

256
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,310
Fine, Hao Lei.

257
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,940
You want to give my money to Ms. Zhang Lan.

258
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,410
Then how are you going to pay me back?

259
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,520
Do you really have to be the chairman?

260
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,960
Can't you just be a shareholder?

261
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,790
I'm not buying it anymore.

262
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,800
What?

263
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,290
I'm not buying your shares anymore.

264
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,430
What do you mean, Lei?

265
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,670
Lei?

266
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,870
[Wanhe Group Co., Ltd. Bankruptcy Reorganization Case—First Creditors' Meeting]

267
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,150
Any other objections?

268
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't have any.

269
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,480
Do you?

270
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,880
No. We can start.

271
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,150
Announce it.

272
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,360
Wanhe Group Co., Ltd.

273
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,320
First Creditors' Meeting

274
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Voting Result:

275
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,630
Not approved.

276
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,790
Great.

277
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,400
What do we do now?

278
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,790
Of course it couldn't be approved.

279
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,630
We're only being compensated at 30%.

280
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,050
Who are we going to ask for the rest of the money?

281
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,480
If it doesn't get approved again,

282
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,840
will it just go for liquidation?

283
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,240
No. They wouldn't dare.

284
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,670
You're just saying that.

285
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,470
What's next?

286
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,480
What should we do?

287
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,650
Let's talk at home.

288
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,750
Ms. Fang, Mr. Tao.

289
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,960
Please stay.

290
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,240
Judge Wei wants to see you.

291
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,340
This way, please.

292
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,090
Alright.

293
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,560
Wait for us at the entrance.

294
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,090
Okay.

295
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,200
Judge Wei, Director Xu,

296
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,550
Ms. Fang and Mr. Tao are here.

297
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,840
Ms. Fang.

298
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,080
-Ms. Fang.
-Director Xu.

299
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,510
Please have a seat.

300
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,910
Ms. Fang.

301
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,120
According to the rules, we need two-thirds approval.

302
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,060
But we barely got more than half.

303
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,160
What should we do now?

304
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,910
We didn't expect this situation either.

305
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,720
Actually, before the meeting,

306
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,440
we had already communicated

307
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,600
with most of the creditors.

308
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Their feedback was quite positive.

309
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,040
We really didn't expect that when we got to the venue...

310
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,360
This won't do.

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Although the law does not limit

312
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,530
the number of creditors' meetings,

313
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,320
having such widespread opposition

314
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,910
in the first meeting

315
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,590
could make things even harder moving forward.

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,320
The government has been emphasizing the need

317
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
for proper communication and explanation before the meeting.

318
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,720
We've also been working hard on communication.

319
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,560
Logically,

320
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,910
if they were going to oppose it,

321
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
they should have communicated with us

322
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,530
before the meeting, not waited

323
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,320
until they were at the venue to cast their votes.

324
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,870
I think there might be

325
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,070
other factors at play.

326
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,200
Ms. Fang,

327
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,080
given the current situation,

328
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,140
the second creditors' meeting

329
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,280
may very well be our last chance.

330
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,490
If it doesn't get approved again,

331
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,630
we may need

332
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,160
to consider liquidation.

333
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,580
I understand.

334
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,030
Ms. Fang.

335
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
Mr. Liu from Dingxin

336
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,000
voted against the proposal at the creditors' meeting.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,080
Do you know about this?

338
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
I don't.

339
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,120
That's impossible.

340
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,850
How is that impossible?

341
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
Not only did he vote against it,

342
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,150
but he also incited a bunch of creditors

343
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,550
to join him,

344
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,360
which led to the reorganization plan failing to pass.

345
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,060
Mr. Xu, you assured me before

346
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,660
that he wouldn't be a problem.

347
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,200
I talked to Mr. Liu

348
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,630
and went over the pros and cons with him,

349
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,000
and he promised me.

350
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,840
But despite my repeated assurances

351
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
that he would receive favorable terms,

352
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
in the end, he didn't vote in favor.

353
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,750
His opposition

354
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,730
is understandable.

355
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,960
Mr. Xu,

356
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,550
at this point,

357
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,840
I can only rely on you.

358
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,710
Please, talk to Mr. Liu again

359
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,870
and make sure he votes to approve it

360
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,630
at the next meeting.

361
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,160
Otherwise,

362
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,380
if the reorganization plan doesn't get approved,

363
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,270
we'll have to go for liquidation.

364
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,550
By then,

365
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,720
I don't think he'll even recover 20%

366
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
of what he's entitled to.

367
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,840
Ms. Fang,

368
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,270
in order to cooperate with your work,

369
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
we've taken on a lot of risk.

370
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,720
If you're going to say this,

371
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,550
I won't be able to work.

372
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,710
What a jerk.

373
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,030
What did he say?

374
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,430
If the reorganization plan doesn't get approved,

375
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,430
I believe none of us

376
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,670
will have a good outcome.

377
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,590
What do you think?

378
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,390
Ms. Fang, don't say that.

379
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,820
I'll go persuade him again.

380
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,050
What a bastard.

381
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,490
Xia Shu!

382
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,190
[Zhang Lan]

383
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,000
Hello, Ms. Zhang Lan.

384
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,530
Xia Shu, I'm going abroad in a few days.

385
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,250
There's something I need to tell you before I leave.

386
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,180
You're leaving so soon?

387
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,120
What about the shareholders' meeting?

388
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,360
Are you going to abstain?

389
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,480
Xia Shu,

390
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,800
Hao Lei hasn't paid back the money he owes you.

391
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,100
Why are you still thinking for him?

392
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,570
Sis, what did you want to tell me just now?

393
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,960
It's still about the shares.

394
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,070
Hao Lei came to me saying he had raised enough money.

395
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,590
He quoted a high price,

396
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,310
and I was ready to sign the deal on the spot.

397
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,480
But when I asked him, "Why didn't Xia Shu come?

398
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,900
Did you two have a fight?"

399
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,000
he ran off.

400
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,270
What's going on between you two?

401
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,680
He didn't buy it? Why not?

402
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,970
Who knows?

403
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,110
I was wondering where he got the money from.

404
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,270
Didn't you say before

405
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,730
that he was still short by over a million?

406
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,240
Where did he get all that money?

407
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,810
Uncle Liang is definitely not the kind of person who would lend money to Lei.

408
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,050
It was my agency fee.

409
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
He used your money?

410
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
This brat is really unreliable.

411
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm so glad I didn't sign that agreement.

412
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,570
Looks like

413
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,270
I'd be better off selling the shares to his uncle.

414
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,290
Sis, are you really going to sell your shares to them?

415
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,840
Don't worry about this.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,070
I'll handle it myself.

417
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,390
Hao Lei bullied you.

418
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,920
I'll help you teach him a lesson.

419
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,630
Ms. Zhang...

420
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,380
Mr. Chen Shuo?

421
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,920
Mr. Chen Shuo,

422
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,490
you're suspected of misappropriation.

423
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,200
The other party concerned has filed a lawsuit

424
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,390
and reported the case to the police.

425
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,270
Now we need your cooperation in the investigation.

426
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,550
Please come with us.

427
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,980
Chen Shuo was arrested.

428
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,280
Is that true?

429
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,490
It's true.

430
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,160
How come I haven't heard about it?

431
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,070
This has caused quite a stir— Hello, Mr. Tian.

432
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,460
Good morning.

433
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,590
Are you sure he was arrested?

434
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,680
Mr. Chen?

435
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
-It shouldn't be.
-I've only heard about it.

436
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,440
He's a nice person.

437
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,240
This is so sudden.

438
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
What did I say?

439
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,510
A case worth over 10 million isn't so easy to handle.

440
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
He's just too stubborn.

441
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,920
What happened?

442
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,200
Mr. Tian, Chen Shuo was arrested.

443
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,450
Chen Shuo was arrested?

444
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,300
Yes. It's been spreading through the whole firm now.

445
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,030
Come in.

446
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,770
Mentor, Mr. Chen was arrested.

447
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,560
What? Mr. Chen was arrested?

448
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,890
This Xu Zhuo is ruthless.

449
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,830
They're all in the same line of work.

450
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,450
How could he do this to him?

451
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,750
Since he did this to Chen Shuo,

452
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,920
he wouldn't let us off easily either.

453
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,590
We need to be extremely cautious

454
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,290
with Wanhe's case now.

455
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,270
Ms. Fang,

456
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,110
Chen Shuo is suspected of misappropriation.

457
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,620
Legally, there's still something we can work with.

458
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,420
Chen Shuo has nothing to do with us anymore.

459
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,350
Our priority now

460
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,070
is to be on guard against Xu Zhuo.

461
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,790
We need to prevent him from causing trouble for us

462
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,870
in the Wanhe Case.

463
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,850
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

464
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
Keep an eye on things at home.

465
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,090
Okay, Mentor.

466
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
[Fang Rui]

467
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,930
[Mr. Tian]

468
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,260
Mr. Tian.

469
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,600
Fang Rui, Shuo was arrested.

470
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,650
What?

471
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,570
Chen Shuo was arrested. It's absolutely true.

472
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,090
Mingshan Group reported the case,

473
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,930
claiming that he illegally took Mingshan's funds for his own use,

474
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,070
constituting misappropriation.

475
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,230
The atmosphere in the firm is tense right now.

476
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,020
Everyone's afraid Zhuoyue Law Firm might cause trouble for us in the Wanhe Case.

477
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,000
Hello?

478
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,400
Hello, Mr. Xu.

479
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,020
This is Han Zhitong from Liangcheng Law Firm.

480
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Mr. Han, what's the matter?

481
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Could I come to Zhuoyue Law Firm to talk to you?

482
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,130
I have an appointment with a client soon.

483
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,470
I can't leave, and it's not convenient.

484
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,090
In that case, may I suggest we talk outside?

485
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,020
There's a tea house called Loushiming Tea House near your firm.

486
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll wait for you there.

487
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,180
Sorry, I really can't leave.

488
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,310
No problem.

489
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
I'll wait for you there.

490
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll wait until you have time.

491
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,420
Let's meet at Loushiming.

492
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,830
Ms. Luo still hasn't answered the phone?

493
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,270
When is she coming back?

494
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,460
Please keep calling her.

495
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,740
[Luo Yingzi]

496
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,510
I am calling her.

497
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,160
Mr. Xu is being too ruthless.

498
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,310
He won't make much money from this case.

499
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,200
Why bother?

500
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,510
Xu Zhuo wants to completely ruin him.

501
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,520
Can't you see?

502
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,030
Pick up.

503
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,470
Where did Ms. Luo go?

504
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,480
Qiu Hua.

505
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,920
Why didn't you answer my calls?

506
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,350
I put it on silent and didn't hear it.

507
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,750
Why are you here too?

508
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,400
Ms. Luo.

509
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,010
Chen Shuo was detained.

510
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,400
When did this happen?

511
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,270
We were just on the phone yesterday.

512
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,290
It happened yesterday afternoon.

513
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,310
Why?

514
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,330
He's suspected of misappropriation.

515
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,270
Mr. Tian from Liangcheng Law Firm

516
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,350
just called and told me about it.

517
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,750
It's still the same case.

518
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,790
Mingshan Group reported the case.

519
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,610
Xu Zhuo is behind it.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,750
Doesn't Mr. Xu fear

521
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,750
ruining his reputation in the industry by doing this?

522
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,310
This is clearly just a contract dispute.

523
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,070
Why does he have to turn it into a criminal case?

524
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm going to find him.

525
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
Wait. Calm down.

526
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,030
What's the point of finding him?

527
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,240
I am calm.

528
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,270
Even if I can't persuade him,

529
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,000
I need to ask him why he's doing this.

530
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,910
Do you think he'll give you an honest answer?

531
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,350
I can't just let him ruin Chen Shuo like this.

532
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm leaving.

533
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,230
I'll drive you.

534
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,890
You can't drive in this state. Let's go.

535
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Okay, let's go.

536
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,830
Mr. Liu,

537
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,880
please listen to my advice.

538
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,640
The government has put so much effort

539
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,370
into helping Wanhe, such a large company,

540
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,680
go through bankruptcy reorganization.

541
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,200
They won't easily let it go bankrupt again.

542
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,670
There might even be various policies in the future to support it.

543
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,560
If you don't want to invest, you can observe

544
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,840
and see the attitudes of other strategic investors.

545
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,700
This will definitely be profitable in the future.

546
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,260
I really find it strange.

547
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,860
At first, you said Wanhe had more than 3 billion,

548
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,850
and I didn't believe it.

549
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,070
But from what I know about Wanhe,

550
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,920
such a large enterprise

551
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,380
must have at least 2 billion, right?

552
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,030
Let me go with you.

553
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,870
It's fine. I should be able to handle it alone.

554
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,130
I'll call you if anything happens.

555
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
But now, look,

556
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,690
it only has a little over 1 billion.

557
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,400
Ms. Luo.

558
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm here to see Mr. Xu.

559
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,630
Mr. Xu is meeting a client.

560
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,460
I see.

561
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,470
Where's the money?

562
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,610
Where did the rest of the money go?

563
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,440
Ms. Luo?

564
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,200
Luckily, we've been supervising the entire process.

565
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,180
Think about the other small shareholders.

566
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,610
At this point, they can only swallow their grievances.

567
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,550
Who can they go to for justice?

568
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,550
Ms. Luo, please wait!

569
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,350
Ms. Luo!

570
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,510
Ms. Luo!

571
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,830
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

572
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,570
You may leave now.

573
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,480
Yingzi,

574
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,140
I'm with a client right now.

575
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,240
I can see that.

576
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,550
Mr. Liu, you're here too?

577
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,400
Are you here to discuss Wanhe's reorganization?

578
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,200
Mr. Xu,

579
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,350
we're part of the legal team as well.

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
Why are you talking to the client

581
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
behind our backs?

582
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,610
Mr. Liu voted against the proposal at the creditors' meeting,

583
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,720
which led to the reorganization plan not being approved.

584
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,960
Liangcheng Law Firm asked me to persuade Mr. Liu.

585
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,160
Mr. Liu, you can tell Ms. Luo

586
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,450
what I told you.

587
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,270
Ms. Luo,

588
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,040
you came at the right time.

589
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,720
Can you give me some advice?

590
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,920
Right now, the valuation of Wanhe

591
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,530
is only 1.8 billion,

592
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,640
but I have to accept compensation

593
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,440
based on a percentage in the 30s.

594
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,900
What does this mean?

595
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,640
It means that

596
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,830
I've invested over 1 billion in total,

597
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,030
but now I can only get back a little more than 300 million.

598
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,830
So tell me,

599
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,790
what should I vote for?

600
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,200
Mr. Liu, if you ask me,

601
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,000
I would say that, based on what I know,

602
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,350
Wanhe still has an asset whose whereabouts haven't been clarified.

603
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Talking about reorganization at this point

604
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,070
is too early.

605
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,880
Luo Yingzi,

606
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,750
will you take responsibility for your words?

607
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,240
Wanhe does have an asset under investigation.

608
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,750
It was clearly stated

609
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,980
in the reorganization plan.

610
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,240
The asset in question is worth less than 200 million,

611
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,000
and it won't affect the overall situation.

612
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,530
And it can't be clarified in a short time.

613
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,000
Should we halt the reorganization because of this?

614
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,480
If this drags on,

615
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,790
we're all doomed.

616
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,200
All parties concerned are present.

617
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,430
How can it not be clarified?

618
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,470
If it can't be clarified, how can the interests

619
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,750
of the parties be protected in the reorganization?

620
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,930
What are you here for?

621
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,150
Are you here to cause trouble?

622
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm in charge of the legal team.

623
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,750
Moreover, once the reorganization plan is approved,

624
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,140
the legal team will be disbanded.

625
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,100
Our cooperative relationship will also come to an end.

626
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,110
Don't express your opinions.

627
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,960
And Mr. Liu,

628
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,560
if you trust Ms. Luo,

629
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,420
then terminate the contract with me

630
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,400
and let Ms. Luo represent you.

631
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,030
Mr. Xu,

632
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,440
why are you saying this?

633
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,290
Of course I trust you.

634
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,750
But let me ask you,

635
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,200
if you were me—

636
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,550
having invested over a billion

637
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,410
and now only able to get back a little more than 300 million—

638
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,820
would you be satisfied?

639
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,470
If you're not satisfied with the 300 million,

640
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,830
then you'll have to wait for the reorganization to fail and for it to go into liquidation.

641
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Let me tell you,

642
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,980
there's a good chance you won't get a penny back.

643
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,190
Alright.

644
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,600
I'll vote in favor.

645
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,460
Then it's a deal.

646
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,750
If you go back on your word at the creditors' meeting

647
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,910
and cause the reorganization plan not to be approved,

648
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,060
you'll have to

649
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
bear the consequences yourself.

650
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,640
Alright.

651
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,420
I've invested over a billion.

652
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,000
Now I'm losing more than 700 million.

653
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,180
It's such a great deal.

654
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Luo Yingzi.

655
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,350
What do you want?

656
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,510
Mr. Xu,

657
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,880
Chen Shuo has been detained on a criminal charge.

658
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
You know about this, right?

659
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
What does this have to do with you?

660
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,830
Of course it has to do with me.

661
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,610
Chen Shuo is my friend and also a peer in the same field.

662
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,790
This is clearly just a contract dispute,

663
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,720
and Mingshan was in breach first.

664
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,240
Why are you turning a contract dispute into a criminal case?

665
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Sorry.

666
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,650
Our understanding of the law is different.

667
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,140
To me,

668
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,820
this is a criminal case.

669
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,210
Chen Shuo violated the terms of the contract

670
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,110
by transferring money from the joint account

671
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,830
to his personal account

672
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
without Party A's approval.

673
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,110
This already constitutes a criminal act.

674
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,310
As a lawyer,

675
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,880
regardless of who I'm dealing with,

676
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,750
I must base my actions on the law

677
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,200
and the facts.

678
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,200
I believe he committed a crime,

679
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,100
so Mingshan reported it.

680
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,880
However,

681
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,200
everyone is considered a legal citizen

682
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,160
until the court rules otherwise.

683
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,060
If he believes he didn't commit a crime,

684
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,170
he can clarify it in court.

685
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,980
If the judge believes he didn't commit a crime,

686
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,750
then what's the problem?

687
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,440
So, when you suspect someone of committing a crime,

688
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,440
you just report it, have them detained and investigated,

689
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
and if they're found not guilty, release them,

690
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,170
right?

691
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,110
What else would you suggest?

692
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,680
So, it's the same as the two times you were detained,

693
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,200
right?

694
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,510
Someone once told me

695
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,920
that you've been hurt by this world

696
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,620
and also learned a lot from it.

697
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,800
Today, I finally understand the meaning behind it.

698
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,590
But I feel sorry that,

699
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
from your life experiences,

700
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,640
you haven't learned anything else

701
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,410
but to see the world

702
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,980
as a jungle full of deceit!

703
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,560
Luo Yingzi.

704
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,400
What exactly is your relationship with Chen Shuo?

705
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,210
Are you two involved?

706
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,440
Whether I'm involved with him

707
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,830
has nothing to do with you.

708
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,020
You're truly disgusting.

709
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,760
I always thought you liked me.

710
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,350
Mr. Xu,

711
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,000
this is the last time

712
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,400
I call you "Mr."

713
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,430
In the dispute between Chen Shuo and Mingshan,

714
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,710
you know better than anyone

715
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,950
why he did this.

716
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,310
I'm here today

717
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,160
hoping you'll persuade Mingshan

718
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,910
to withdraw the criminal charges against Chen Shuo.

719
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,640
And if I say no?

720
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,550
Then we'll have to meet in court.

721
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,880
I swear I'll make sure everyone

722
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,920
sees your true colors in court.

723
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,440
I'll ruin your reputation!

724
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,870
I'd like to see

725
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,070
if you have the ability.

726
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,350
You're too confident.

727
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,720
Remember.

728
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,240
You're still part of my team.

729
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,840
You absolutely cannot do anything that harms the team's interests.

730
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,180
Yingzi, how did it go?

731
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,550
Any results?

732
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,370
Just drive.

733
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,070
We can't hold any illusions about that kind of person.

734
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,920
Using public power to attack a peer

735
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,970
is simply disgraceful!

736
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,550
Hello?

737
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,440
Hello, Qiu Hua.

738
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,760
Xu Zhuo is determined to put Chen Shuo behind bars.

739
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,350
I'm going to see Mr. Xue,

740
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,080
hoping to arrange a meeting with Chen Shuo.

741
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,440
I just told Xu Zhuo

742
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,640
that I'll ruin his reputation.

743
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,400
A scoundrel like him

744
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,110
should be struck at his weak point.

745
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,350
You know what to do, right?

746
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,060
Xia Shu.

747
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,320
Xu Zhuo is now determined to frame Chen Shuo.

748
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,910
We need to speed up our plan.

749
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,000
Any updates from your classmate?

750
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,960
We're talking right now.

751
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,310
It's already past midnight over there.

752
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,880
She said there's some progress,

753
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,230
but we'll have to wait a few days.

754
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,440
Companies like theirs

755
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,270
will release an official report.

756
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,960
That's great.

757
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
One more thing—

758
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,300
Keep it confidential.

759
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,360
What's your name?

760
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,720
My name is Sun Xiaoxiao.

761
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,350
That's a lovely name.

762
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,050
Thank you.

763
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,160
Mr. Xu.

764
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,770
Is there anything? I'm quite busy.

765
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,680
Mr. Xu,

766
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,210
I heard

767
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
you had Chen Shuo sent to prison?

768
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,110
Don't put it like that.

769
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,830
I don't have the power

770
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,640
to send anyone I want to prison.

771
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,480
I'd like to send you to jail.

772
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,920
Do you think I could?

773
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,920
Bro, if you want to send me to jail,

774
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,240
you're not quite capable enough.

775
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,730
But didn't you get Chen Shuo sent there?

776
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,120
If he hadn't done anything illegal,

777
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,960
do you think I could have found a way to send him there?

778
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,870
Alright, bro.

779
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,440
We all know each other too well.

780
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,960
Just talk about those two times you went to jail.

781
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,500
Can you really say you didn't do anything illegal?

782
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,820
You want to send me back in there again?

783
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,310
I wouldn't do that.

784
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,850
After all, we're in the same field.

785
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,220
No matter how shameless I, Han Zhitong, am,

786
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,190
I would never resort to revenge out of spite.

787
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,800
Framing a peer is just despicable.

788
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,870
What do you mean?

789
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,350
Mr. Xu,

790
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,690
I've been involved in the whole process

791
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,270
between Chen Shuo and Mingshan Group.

792
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,750
It's at most

793
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,360
just a contract dispute,

794
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,440
right?

795
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,480
And it's Mingshan Group that breached the contract first.

796
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,770
No matter how you look at it, it's not a criminal case.

797
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,240
How about this?

798
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,640
Do me a favor

799
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,500
and withdraw the case at the police station, okay?

800
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,480
I really didn't expect

801
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,790
Chen Shuo to be so popular.

802
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,790
Now that he's in trouble,

803
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,469
so many people are protecting him.

804
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,760
If you really wanted to protect him,

805
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,739
you should've advised him to return the money in the first place.

806
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,389
Let's just go to the police and withdraw the case.

807
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,650
So that we can still be good friends.

808
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,639
Mr. Han,

809
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,350
I've never considered

810
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,400
someone like you to be a friend.

811
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,880
What's wrong with me?

812
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,070
Nothing.

813
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,550
Reputation is often something with no concrete evidence.

814
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,699
But everyone knows in their hearts.

815
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,230
Isn't there no concrete evidence here?

816
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,400
But after Chen Shuo,

817
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,639
your reputation for framing peers

818
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,030
will have concrete evidence.

819
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,030
I'm not afraid of that.

820
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,150
You can tell that

821
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,520
to anyone you want.

822
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,310
Really?

823
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,590
If I were afraid,

824
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,620
there wouldn't be today's Xu Zhuo.

825
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,480
I have something to do. I'll be going.

826
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,740
Don't regret it, Mr. Xu.

827
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,430
In my world,

828
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,460
there's no such thing as regret.

829
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,170
Goodbye.

830
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,190
He's usually quite a sensible person.

831
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,020
How come he can't understand it this time?

832
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,070
The economic crime investigation unit has already filed the case.

833
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,290
This could be big or small.

834
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,380
To put it mildly,

835
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,850
it's just a regular contract dispute;

836
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,800
to put it more seriously,

837
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,800
he could be charged with misappropriation,

838
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,810
which isn't impossible.

839
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,200
He's already in the detention center now.

840
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,270
What do you want me

841
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,410
to help with?

842
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,800
This matter of his will have to be settled in court.

843
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,340
It depends on you lawyers now.

844
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:42,930
Got it.

845
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,840
Well, thank you, Wang Rui.

846
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,780
Sorry for the trouble.

847
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,890
It's no trouble at all.

848
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,310
I'm also worried about Chen Shuo,

849
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,440
but I

850
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,590
have limited capacity.

851
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,720
Let's keep in touch.

852
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,210
Alright.

853
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,730
Mr. Xue.

854
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,110
What's the situation?

855
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,280
I've contacted Wang Rui.

856
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,930
He said we should figure it out on our own.

857
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,880
I've already applied for a meeting with the detention center.

858
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,630
Then I'll go with you.

859
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,550
You can't go.

860
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,710
He only asked me to be his lawyer.

861
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,780
When are you going to see him?

862
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm going there now.

863
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,220
Then take me with you.

864
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,980
It's not that I don't want to take you,

865
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,110
but you haven't been authorized.

866
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,540
The detention center won't let you in.

867
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,250
Then please tell him

868
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,670
to entrust his case to me as well.

869
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,580
I'll be his lawyer alongside you.

870
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,320
You two...

871
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,970
If only you had known then what you know now.

872
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,470
Do you know that

873
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,620
Chen Shuo has always loved you?

874
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,550
Mr. Xue, this is not the time to say this.

875
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,260
My brother is in the detention center.

876
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,720
Can't I just speak my mind?

877
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,930
Chen Shuo

878
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,860
may seem like a playboy,

879
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,440
but he's never truly loved anyone,

880
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,310
except you.

881
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,630
He has given all his love to you,

882
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,970
but you never took it seriously.

883
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,330
You don't even look at him properly.

884
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,240
Why?

885
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,710
Tell me,

886
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,110
why is someone who is usually so understanding

887
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,480
being so stubborn this time?

888
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,100
It's not about the 8 million.

889
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,790
He just wants to prove to you

890
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,640
that he can be that Petőfi

891
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
you always admire.

892
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,090
Mr. Xue, let's go.

893
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,000
Take me to see him.

894
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,840
If I can't get in, I'll wait outside for him.

895
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,420
I'll wait for him to entrust the case to me, okay?

896
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,490
Honestly confess what you have done,

897
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,660
report your criminal associates,

898
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,960
and expose others' criminal activities.

899
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,750
-Third, study seriously…
-Chen Shuo!

900
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,440
I'm here.

901
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,550
Someone's here to see you.

902
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm the one in jail.

903
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,760
Why are you looking so down?

904
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,920
Your little brother is disappointing.

905
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,070
I've caused trouble for you again.

906
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:44,780
Have you been mistreated?

907
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,410
No, no.

908
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,520
I'm fine. I'm alright.

909
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,260
Alright.

910
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,710
So how are we going to handle this case?

911
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,770
What do you mean how? We'll plead not guilty.

912
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,860
Shuo,

913
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,890
here's what I'm thinking.

914
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,840
First,

915
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,860
I'm not confident about handling

916
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,100
a criminal case.

917
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,920
Second,

918

There's no need for us to do that.

922
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,930
How about

I don't need you to represent me.

928
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,250
