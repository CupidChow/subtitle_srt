00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,920
This chain store

4
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,950
has around forty to fifty branches

5
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,400
in Jingbei and several major cities.

6
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,590
Their assets are quite impressive.

7
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,580
But because they expanded too quickly,

8
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,930
their capital chain broke.

9
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,310
To repay debts,

10
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,720
they had to sell at a low price.

11
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,560
Mr. Zhou, have you ever considered switching industries?

12
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,340
If you want to switch,

13
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,480
I think this is a really good opportunity.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
But there's one condition.

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,610
If you really want to do this,

16
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,110
you must make a complete break

17
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,500
with your previous businesses.

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,470
My situation is like this.

19
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,970
Actually, I've

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,300
always wanted to do honest business.

21
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,480
First, those old friends

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,900
and connections...

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,720
It's not easy to just cut them off.

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,810
Second,

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,450
now that those money-making paths are gone,

26
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,720
I haven't figured out

27
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,950
what to do in the future.

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,920
If you have a good opportunity...

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,910
But you have to listen clearly

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,460
to my last condition.

31
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,230
I said that if you really want to do this,

32
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,510
you must make a complete break

33
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,900
with your previous businesses

34
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,100
and the people you know in society.

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll do it.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,680
I'll cut them off.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,630
You don't know,

38
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,070
recently my wife

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,420
gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

40
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,220
I need to accumulate virtue.

41
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,030
I'll cut them off.

42
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,410
Congratulations!

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,980
Alright,

44
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,140
I'll introduce you to the seller.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,040
You can go inspect it yourself first.

46
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,470
If you think it's suitable,

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,420
you can negotiate directly with him.

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,950
What's there to inspect?

49
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,280
I'll listen to you. You say it's okay, it's okay.

50
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,620
No, Mr. Zhou.

51
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,940
This is a huge investment.

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,210
It's your entire future fortune.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,630
You must carefully inspect it yourself.

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,260
Right now, there are a few other buyers,

55
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,360
but

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,750
I can talk to the seller first

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,980
and ask him to wait a few more days for you.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,670
Alright.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,079
Making money

60
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,010
won't be as fast as before,

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,560
but if you manage it properly,

62
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,380
everything will be fine in the future.

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,700
If you're willing,

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,680
I'll go talk to him now.

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,310
I'm willing.

66
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,060
Yingzi.

67
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,400
Well...

68
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,190
Listen to me for a moment.

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,730
I've done

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,770
too many wrong things in my life.

71
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,030
If there's one good thing I've done,

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,850
it's helping you.

73
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,940
How should I put it?

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,970
Thank you.

75
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,140
Don't be so formal.

76
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,550
We'll have plenty of chances to meet

77
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,330
and interact in the future.

78
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,040
Maybe I'll even need to ask you for a favor sometime.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,670
Don't talk about asking for favors.

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I'll be going now.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Why are you leaving already? Have a meal.

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,600
I need to go talk to him.

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,480
Take care of your hand.

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,159
Eat the stuff I brought for you.

85
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,950
The one inside...

86
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,680
Alright, alright. Next time, don't bring anything.

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,270
Don't bother.

88
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,430
I'll wait for your message.

89
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,870
Okay.

90
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,430
Alright.

91
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,010
This smells good.

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,970
What's got into you, Xia Shu?

93
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,900
Here, scrambled eggs, cereal,

94
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,050
yogurt, and bread.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,810
Alright.

96
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,560
Although it's not my favorite -

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
soy milk, fried bread sticks, and tea eggs -

98
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,870
yogurt, bread, and scrambled eggs

99
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,700
are fine too.

100
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,090
You put some thought into this, Xia Shu.

101
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,780
My treatment has even been upgraded.

102
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,240
Luo,

103
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm moving out today.

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,920
What?

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,870
The money I earned from these cases

106
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,420
is enough for me to live independently.

107
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,450
Thank you for letting me stay here for free for a few months.

108
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,720
I won't be able to accompany you anymore.

109
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,190
Wait, where are you moving to?

110
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,680
This is so sudden.

111
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

112
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,240
I don't have to.

113
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm just moving to this building,

114
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,940
two floors below you.

115
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,570
We'll still be neighbors.

116
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,650
If I get scared, I'll knock on your door.

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,290
Alright, Xia Shu.

118
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,800
You've really grown up and matured.

119
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,040
You know how to plan things quietly

120
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,080
and discreetly now.

121
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,880
Luo, you were right before.

122
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,280
Money that hasn't been received can't be considered money.

123
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,550
I'm going to ask Hao Lei for the money today.

124
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,880
This will be my first real earning on my own.

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,909
No,

126
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,040
that money from Auntie Song was also your earning.

127
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,500
No, this is truly the first one.

128
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,100
[Xincheng Mining]

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,070
What did you say?

130
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,510
I said,

131
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,750
this money can't be considered

132
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,950
as if you recovered it alone.

133
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,930
After all, I was also there.

134
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,180
You can consider it as me giving you a heads-up.

135
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,120
So I'll give you 200,000 yuan,

136
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
plus travel expenses.

137
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,480
Hao Lei, do you have any shame?

138
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,870
Be reasonable.

139
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,270
Why are you speaking so rudely?

140
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,160
Where did you get such a big temper?

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,890
Why don't you also hydrate yourself to calm down?

142
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,750
I haven't even said anything worse yet.

143
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,730
No wonder others scheme against you.

144
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,980
You deserve it.

145
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,790
What kind of talk is that?

146
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,980
You're a lawyer.

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,570
Why don't you have the courage to sue me if you can?

148
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,840
Hao Lei,

149
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,400
840,000 yuan, plus travel expenses.

150
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,270
Will you give it to me or not?

151
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,980
No.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,490
But we can cooperate in a different way.

153
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,760
I'm asking if you will give it to me or not.

154
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,580
No.

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,080
I'll let you continue helping me collect debts.

156
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,870
For each subsequent debt, the commission will be 30%.

157
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,570
Get lost!

158
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,870
I'm not serving you anymore.

159
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,600
Hao Lei,

160
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,140
you'll be receiving a lawsuit soon.

161
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,120
He knew perfectly well that Xia Shu had already caught up with the creditor,

162
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,820
but he still ran over to collect the debt himself.

163
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,030
In the end, he insisted that he was the one who recovered the money.

164
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,630
Isn't he clearly trying to encroach on

165
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,030
Xia Shu's labor fruits?

166
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,340
This Mr. Hao

167
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,980
had already planned everything.

168
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,290
Xia Shu plants the tree, and he picks the fruit.

169
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,160
He just wants to establish the fact

170
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,450
that he was the one who recovered the debt.

171
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,950
Look, this supplementary agreement

172
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,560
also has Hao Lei's signature.

173
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,159
If it really comes to court,

174
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,230
the judge will also recognize

175
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,720
that it was Hao Lei who recovered the debt.

176
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,460
Now this matter has become a bit complicated.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,230
To sue him,

178
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,310
it's not like

179
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,820
we can only get 200,000 yuan.

180
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,870
But to get it all back

181
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
is also unrealistic.

182
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
It's not just about the money.

183
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,180
We can't just let ourselves be bullied like this.

184
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,720
Right?

185
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,580
Xia Shu.

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,390
Let's sue him!

187
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,810
Forget it. No need to sue.

188
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,270
Why not?

189
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,070
As a lawyer, I have to calculate the costs.

190
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Suing him would be time-consuming and effort-intensive. It's not worth it.

191
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
I'll go back and talk to him.

192
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll accept his 200,000 yuan

193
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
and the other cases he gives me.

194
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,190
Don't worry.

195
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,860
I'll make him pay me back double

196
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,970
for what I lost here, elsewhere.

197
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,720
It's like Zhen Huan returning to the palace with a vengeance.

198
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,780
Alright, Xia Shu,

199
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,560
go ahead and do it confidently.

200
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,410
Qiu Hua and I will be your strongest support.

201
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,000
I believe you can handle it. Come on!

202
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,120
Wait for my good news.

203
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,549
Ms. Xia.

204
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,690
Are you here to see Mr. Hao?

205
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,390
Is Mr. Hao in?

206
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,240
Mr. Hao is occupied at the moment.

207
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,580
Would you like to wait for a while?

208
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,600
Xu,

209
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,270
you go ahead and take care of your business.

210
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,950
Are you Ms. Xia?

211
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,230
Yes, I am. And you are?

212
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,970
Hi,

213
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,860
I'm the deputy general manager of the company. My last name is Liang.

214
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,260
Lei usually calls me Uncle Liang.

215
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,510
Mr. Liang, I've heard so much about you.

216
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,930
Oh, please.

217
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,030
If it's convenient for you,

218
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,570
I'd like to discuss something with you.

219
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,440
Sure.

220
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,620
Please.

221
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,720
Lei often praises you

222
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,550
in front of me,

223
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,840
saying you're very capable.

224
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,500
I didn't expect you to be so young.

225
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,550
Mr. Liang, you flatter me.

226
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,960
I know you're here about the compensation.

227
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,690
I've talked to Lei about it.

228
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,890
We can negotiate the compensation further.

229
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,710
Mr. Liang, I'm not here for the compensation.

230
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,260
Mr. Hao said he has a few more cases

231
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,290
he wants to entrust to me.

232
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,340
I came here after agreeing to his proposal.

233
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,470
So you accepted his commission?

234
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,820
Yes.

235
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,500
Lei is in a meeting right now.

236
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,530
We can meet him after he's done.

237
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,000
He's in a meeting with the two senior Haos.

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,490
Right?

239
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,390
Yes.

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,380
Regarding Lei's family matters,

241
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm sure you're aware of them.

242
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,280
Family businesses

243
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,140
always end up like this.

244
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,090
As for small shareholders like us,

245
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,790
we're caught in the middle and suffer the most.

246
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,450
It's hard to side with anyone.

247
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,340
Mr. Liang,

248
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,150
don't mind me butting in.

249
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,170
Actually, in this situation,

250
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,040
you should side with Mr. Hao Jr.

251
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,120
Emotionally speaking,

252
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,580
I should side with him.

253
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,770
But the well-being of over 10,000 employees is more important.

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,250
This company

255
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,080
was founded by me

256
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,730
and Lei's father.

257
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,060
I can't just watch it fall apart

258
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,510
in his hands.

259
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,210
Mr. Liang,

260
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,870
Mr. Hao Jr. set me up.

261
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,930
Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing him fall and everyone pile on.

262
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,390
I'd even kick him while he's down.

263
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,600
But you know what?

264
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,360
After observing him,

265
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,370
I think Mr. Hao Jr. is capable.

266
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,980
He's cunning

267
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
and has a knack for performance.

268
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,490
He knows when to play the part

269
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,790
and when to be shameless.

270
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,750
Just think, in Guanbei,

271
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,330
I recovered such a difficult debt.

272
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,300
In the end, I got tricked by him.

273
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,590
Then why did you accept his commission?

274
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,330
We're all adults.

275
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,480
If he bullies me,

276
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,370
I'll just find a way to get it back somewhere else.

277
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,350
I have room to maneuver with him.

278
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,340
Why wouldn't I take it?

279
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,140
It's rare for you to speak up for him.

280
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,190
This time,

281
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,860
let's see if he can stand up to his uncles.

282
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,920
The business your uncle, me,

283
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,430
and your father built

284
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,440
shouldn't be ruined by you alone.

285
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,840
You can keep your shares.

286
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,270
Just go back abroad to study.

287
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,000
Your annual dividends

288
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,270
will never be lacking.

289
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,080
It'll be more than enough for you to live comfortably abroad.

290
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,840
Mr. Liang, I heard that

291
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,610
there are other small shareholders in the company.

292
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,450
Would you rather support a new young master

293
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,470
or let the two old uncles take charge?

294
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,720
Mr. Liang,

295
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,170
I'll go up and see Mr. Hao Jr.

296
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,040
Your eldest uncle and I

297
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,000
can assure you today

298
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
that we won't touch your shares.

299
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,150
We'll work for you

300
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,490
so you can enjoy yourself abroad.

301
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,710
Mr. Hao, Ms. Xia is looking for you.

302
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,010
Ms. Xia.

303
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,930
You're just in time.

304
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,210
Let me introduce.

305
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,450
This is my eldest uncle.

306
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,240
This is my youngest uncle.

307
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,870
You've seen both of them.

308
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,600
They are also two vice presidents of our company.

309
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,670
Each person occupies 20% of the shares.

310
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,830
Now they want me to hand in the power.

311
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,100
Can you talk to them for me?

312
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,630
Lei, we didn't force you.

313
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,490
Besides, there is a legal department in the company.

314
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,230
Why did you hire a lawyer?

315
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Sirs,

316
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,500
it's not impossible to hand over the rights.

317
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,290
But we have company rules.

318
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,280
At least we have the company law.

319
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,200
Major matters such as the appointment and removal of the chairman

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,020
and the transfer of management rights

321
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,430
require a resolution by the shareholders' meeting.

322
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,660
Mr. Hao.

323
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,790
Just hold a shareholder meeting

324
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,260
according to the legal procedures.

325
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,720
Yes.

326
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,520
Uncles.

327
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,300
I can give you the right.

328
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,180
But the shareholders' meeting should be held.

329
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
The minority obeys the majority.

330
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,620
As long as it is approved

331
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,360
by the number of shareholders that meets the proportion stipulated in the company's articles of association,

332
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,240
I will immediately hand over the position of chairman,

333
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,210
as well as the company's management and operational rights,

334
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,090
to you.

335
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,550
Brother.

336
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,370
Lei, you're really something.

337
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,790
You actually listen to a woman.

338
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,170
Thank you, Ms. Xia.

339
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,330
Thank you.

340
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
Don't think I'm here to help you.

341
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
You tricked me.

342
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,490
I'm here to get even with you.

343
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,760
Now, you have two choices.

344
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,210
Either you return 840,000

345
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,630
and the travel expenses,

346
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,650
or I'll sue you.

347
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,060
See you in court.

348
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,990
Are you trying to

349
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,110
scare me like my uncles?

350
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,480
I went to Inner Mongolia too.

351
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,510
I signed the supplementary agreement.

352
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,200
And I watched him make the payment to me.

353
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,750
Even if it goes to court,

354
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,600
the judge may not always be on your side.

355
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,510
Fine.

356
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,270
It all depends on whether you're willing

357
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,780
to go to court at this time.

358
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,530
By the way,

359
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,830
after this lawsuit,

360
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,270
I'm no longer your lawyer.

361
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,590
I don't know if the other two Mr. Hao

362
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,350
need a lawyer.

363
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,620
No way.

364
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,210
Give me back the money if you're not okay with it.

365
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,500
Ms. Xia.

366
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,110
You've seen

367
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,310
my current situation.

368
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,870
I have so many debts out there.

369
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,160
I was only able to collect this one payment.

370
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,540
If I transfer 20% extra to you,

371
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,730
my two uncles won't agree.

372
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,870
How about this?

373
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,390
Let's discuss a proportion.

374
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,740
Give me a little discount.

375
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,310
I'll pay you all at once.

376
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,030
And I also entrust you

377
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,060
with handling all my subsequent debt collection.

378
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,250
If we get the money back,

379
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,560
the ratio can be improved.

380
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,630
What do you think?

381
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,120
How much discount do you want?

382
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,060
I think...

383
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,090
How about

384
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,170
half?

385
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,150
I'll transfer 420,000 to you at once.

386
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,910
No.

387
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,500
At least 600,000.

388
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,220
500,000.

389
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,170
550,000.

390
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,340
If it's less than 550,000,

391
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,280
I'm leaving now.

392
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,410
550,000 then.

393
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,920
What is this?

394
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,690
Don't you have a few more cases to entrust to me?

395
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,240
Here's the contract. Take a look.

396
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,610
You're so cruel.

397
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,190
I've been scared by your traps.

398
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,940
As long as you can help me become the chairman,

399
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,830
I'll agree to any condition of yours.

400
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,900
Whether I'll help you or not

401
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,870
depends on the sincerity

402
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,990
the contract you give me shows.

403
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,260
[Jingbei Zhuoyue Law Firm]

404
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,750
This way, please.

405
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,590
Mr. Xu.

406
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Mr. Xu.

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,660
Welcome.

408
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,650
Welcome.

409
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,440
Welcome to the Zhuoyue family.

410
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,750
It's our honor.

411
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,320
Please.

412
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,670
Have a seat.

413
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,200
Alright.

414
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,240
Ladies,

415
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,070
the court has carefully considered our opinions.

416
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,460
Wanhe won't be able to liquidate.

417
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,560
Liangcheng Law Firm has won the bid to become the bankruptcy administrator.

418
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,460
You heard about it, right?

419
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Yeah, we did.

420
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,790
Now they can make a fortune again.

421
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,420
Thanks.

422
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
In my opinion, as lawyers,

423
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,350
while selling legal knowledge and legal practice services,

424
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,780
we can't ignore money,

425
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,960
but if our primary motivation

426
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,910
is money,

427
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,130
or putting profits first,

428
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,800
then the case definitely won't be handled well.

429
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,220
Right, you make a good point.

430
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,200
They have formed

431
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,760
a dedicated legal team,

432
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,270
led by Tao Zheng,

433
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,300
and Fang Lihong will also go all in.

434
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,120
Since we're representing Dingxin,

435
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,820
we need to start following up on the whole project.

436
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,680
Our work will commence immediately,

437
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,800
but before we start,

438
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,630
we need to resolve our cooperation issues.

439
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,550
Here's the agreement between us.

440
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,670
Take a look first.

441
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,200
I'll be upstairs.

442
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,750
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

443
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,710
There shouldn't be any issues.

444
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,530
Right, we should really take a good look at it.

445
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,440
You said there shouldn't be any issues without even looking at the contract?

446
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,349
I was just saying.

447
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,310
I'm just pretending to be polite.

448
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,920
Isn't this a demonstration of sincere cooperation?

449
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,089
We still need to take a good look.

450
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,000
Not putting profits first,

451
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,420
but he's really tough on us.

452
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,599
Tough?

453
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,600
After deducting Zhuoyue's commission,

454
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,250
we'll get thirty percent of the remuneration.

455
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,310
It's alright.

456
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,910
I disagree.

457
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,460
If we get our share after their commission,

458
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,040
that's only 21%

459
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,310
in our hands.

460
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
This case was originally brought by us.

461
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,400
If we didn't give it to them,

462
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,720
we could handle it ourselves.

463
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,070
Now we're giving it to them for free.

464
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,790
We should at least get half,

465
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,040
and all allocations

466
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
should be made before the commission.

467
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,360
We're cooperating with them

468
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,550
as a law firm.

469
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,490
Why should they take their commission first?

470
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,240
Qiu Hua,

471
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,590
we're a small law firm.

472
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,200
Even if we have important clues,

473
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,030
Dingxin could

474
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,030
still kick us out

475
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,570
after obtaining them

476
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,350
and then find a bigger law firm.

477
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,290
But Zhuoyue is different.

478
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,890
With Mr. Xu's endorsement,

479
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,200
we can get this cooperation opportunity.

480
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,240
Compared to high salaries,

481
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
I cherish this cooperation opportunity more.

482
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,760
As for remuneration, it's reasonable enough.

483
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,660
Isn't that our core demand?

484
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,370
My core demand is different from yours.

485
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,040
Xu Zhuo's

486
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,970
metaphysical theory of valuing righteousness over profit,

487
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,640
you may accept it, but I won't.

488
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,880
And I don't think

489
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,100
cooperating is more beneficial for growth

490
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,350
than taking cases independently.

491
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,510
So, shall we talk to him again

492
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,830
and strive for an allocation before the commission?

493
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,070
Do you agree?

494
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
Yingzi, I understand your point,

495
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,110
but this is business.

496
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
It's about

497
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,980
the interests of the three of us at Yinghua Law Firm.

498
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,830
Let me talk to him, okay?

499
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,880
Sure, no problem.

500
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,640
But you have to negotiate to make it happen.

501
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,750
If you say it like that,

502
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,820
I have to say something.

503
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,000
We originally had the initiative in this case,

504
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,200
but because we gave it to him

505
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
and he signed an agreement with Mr. Liu,

506
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,750
we're now at a disadvantage.

507
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,730
Just remember,

508
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,370
if he comes to you again,

509
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,780
no matter what he says

510
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,420
or how much he reminisces about the past,

511
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,660
you can't give in.

512
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,030
Just leave it to me.

513
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,350
That's not just one sentence.

514
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,640
You said a whole paragraph.

515
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,030
Alright then,

516
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,650
well...

517
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,350
I guess I don't need to stay here anymore.

518
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,490
I'll just leave.

519
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,740
Okay, you can go first.

520
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,820
I'll also go up and say good-bye to him.

521
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,500
No need, just go.

522
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,160
Alright, alright, I'm leaving.

523
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,100
Take care of this contract for me.

524
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,500
Come in.

525
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,150
Mr. Xu, Ms. Qiu is here.

526
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,030
Ms. Qiu.

527
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,500
Isn't Ms. Luo coming?

528
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,610
She had some other matters at the firm,

529
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,970
so she went back first.

530
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,720
Zhang,

531
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,450
get us some water.

532
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,170
No need to trouble, thank you.

533
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,430
Please sit.

534
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,140
Okay.

535
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,880
Is there any issue with the contract?

536
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,120
I had my colleagues draft it.

537
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,180
I told them

538
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,350
that Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu

539
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,890
are like my junior sisters,

540
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,770
so everything should be on the best terms.

541
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,750
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

542
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,300
But sorry,

543
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,520
we can't sign this contract.

544
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,110
Why?

545
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,700
Mr. Xu,

546
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,260
you know very well how this case came to us.

547
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,710
We found the key information

548
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,940
for this case.

549
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,750
If we hadn't told you

550
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,450
and gone to Dingxin ourselves,

551
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,950
we could have represented Dingxin independently.

552
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,600
Now that you're proposing

553
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,590
that your firm give us

554
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,410
thirty percent after taking their commission,

555
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,770
we can't accept that.

556
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,560
Does Ms. Luo also think so?

557
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,130
Of course, we're a team.

558
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,030
Ms. Qiu,

559
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,670
as I said earlier,

560
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,470
as lawyers,

561
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,750
we can't ignore money,

562
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,500
but we also can't

563
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,930
put profits first.

564
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,840
Doing so won't result in a well-handled case.

565
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,200
So, Mr. Xu,

566
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,030
why are you so harsh on us?

567
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,270
When we cooperate with other firms,

568
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,630
it's never more than twenty percent.

569
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,170
That's because they're working for you.

570
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,340
But this case was brought to us,

571
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,660
which is our value.

572
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,270
So,

573
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,640
what percentage do you want?

574
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,030
Fifty percent,

575
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,610
and it should be allocated before the commission.

576
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,440
Impossible.

577
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,400
In fact, this case is now with our firm,

578
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,820
and we signed the contract with Dingxin.

579
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,790
Most of the future work

580
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,590
will also be done by us.

581
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,960
As for the workload,

582
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
we can divide it proportionally.

583
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,510
Actually, since we're not the administrators,

584
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,880
our task

585
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,470
is to safeguard Dingxin's creditor interests

586
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,280
and supervise the administrators' disposal of the bankruptcy assets,

587
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,240
so we don't need that many people.

588
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,380
If your firm is confident,

589
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,580
you can leave it to Ms. Luo and me.

590
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,710
Is this your final decision?

591
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,350
And Luo Yingzi also thinks the same?

592
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,150
Yes.

593
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Fifty percent,

594
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,620
allocated before the commission.

595
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,830
Alright.

596
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,660
Go back and think about it some more.

597
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,310
We can talk again next time.

598
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,860
Okay, Mr. Xu.

599
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,740
I'll leave the contract here for you.

600
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,160
You didn't scare him, did you?

601
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
Whatever.

602
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,200
Your Mr. Xu

603
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,670
can't be that easily frightened, can he?

604
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,910
We're discussing work here.

605
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,900
Stop being sarcastic.

606
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,640
I just think this collaboration is hard-earned

607
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,280
and I don't want to lose the opportunity.

608
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,330
I guess Xu Zhuo will come to you.

609
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
Listen, the more you concede,

610
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,100
the less valuable you'll be in his eyes.

611
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,600
Your guess was actually right.

612
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,140
[Lawyer Xu Zhuo]

613
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,370
Mr. Xu.

614
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Ms. Luo.

615
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Can you come over when you have a moment?

616
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,700
I'd like to chat with you.

617
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,880
I was out today,

618
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,970
busy with another case.

619
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,210
How about this?

620
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,850
I'll come to you after I finish up.

621
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,100
Okay, I'll wait for you.

622
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,010
Goodbye.

623
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,540
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

624
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,660
Can you stop making wild guesses? It's scary.

625
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,440
Madam, your goods are all moved.

626
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,300
Let me pay you.

627
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,880
Could you please give me a five-star review?

628
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,350
Sure, absolutely.

629
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,200
Thank you.

630
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,720
I'll say it again,

631
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,350
if you're too soft on Xu Zhuo,

632
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,810
I won't be nice to you.

633
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,450
Look, it's scratched.

634
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
How can I give a five-star review now?

635
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,440
I'll move this chair over.

636
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,830
I'm back.

637
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,940
Back already?

638
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,800
Just in time.

639
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,560
Help me move this chair over there.

640
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,710
How did the talk go?

641
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,010
Here it is.

642
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,130
We signed four contracts,

643
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,780
each worth at least 800,000.

644
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,470
This Mr. Hao is quite interesting.

645
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,640
One moment he's trapping you,

646
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,680
the next he's like

647
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,310
a lamb at your mercy.

648
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,940
How dare he trick me again?

649
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,070
He should have known me better.

650
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,280
He dug a hole for me,

651
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,410
so I dug one for him.

652
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,030
We'll see.

653
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,410
These four contracts weren't easy to negotiate,

654
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,390
but at least we didn't get shafted.

655
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,110
The terms are good.

656
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,170
Are there any any loopholes he can find?

657
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,120
He tried,

658
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,320
but I saw through it all.

659
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,110
Well done, Xia Shu.

660
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,880
You're now the most profitable lawyer

661
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,320
in our firm.

662
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,850
Are you talking about me again?

663
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,070
You're much better than Luo, who always sides with outsiders.

664
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:20,810
Sis,

665
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,700
can I make a request?

666
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,160
Of course you can.

667
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,200
Not only can you make a request,

668
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,880
but you should sit down while doing so. Come on.

669
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,890
Isn't this inappropriate?

670
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,790
It's perfectly appropriate. You're the top earner.

671
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,510
Go ahead.

672
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,140
I want to become a partner.

673
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,590
These four contracts together

674
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,840
are worth at least 3.2 million.

675
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,260
This is my gift to you.

676
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,980
Xia Shu, is this a sudden idea or something

677
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,330
you've been planning for a while?

678
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,230
It's something that has come naturally.

679
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,430
Sis,

680
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,640
when I came back from Inner Mongolia a few days ago,

681
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,950
I was fully expecting you guys to celebrate my success.

682
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,680
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep at night.

683
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,120
But when I got back to the firm,

684
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,200
you weren't there.

685
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,600
And you said the commission doesn't count until it's received.

686
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,860
I was a bit upset.

687
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,980
I was wondering

688
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,720
why you guys never

689
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,920
seem to see my efforts.

690
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,370
So, did you move out

691
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,590
because of that?

692
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,620
No,

693
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,590
I moved out because I'm independent now.

694
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,100
After what happened to me,

695
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,150
you guys took me in.

696
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,200
So I took your recognition as a standard.

697
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,440
When you praise me, I'm happy.

698
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,440
When you don't celebrate my successes, I'm upset.

699
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,250
I've become too dependent on you guys.

700
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,030
With you guys as my backup,

701
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,360
I can live with empty hands.

702
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,750
I previously worked hard

703
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,310
just to gain your recognition.

704
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,400
It was like a child seeking praise for their efforts.

705
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,950
But now,

706
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,500
I also want to grasp something on my own.

707
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,560
Money or work.

708
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
I also want to do it for myself.

709
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,620
So that's why you went all out to collect the debt?

710
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,120
For you guys,

711
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,070
but also for myself.

712
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,210
Qiu, Luo.

713
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,590
Please consider it.

714
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,330
Pass that over to me, please.

715
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,180
Sure.

[Yinghua Law Firm, Xia Shu, Partner]

717
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:27,740
This...

718
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,600
Pass it over.

719
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,910
We promised to hold a celebration for you.

720
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
We won't break our word.

721
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,770
Look,

722
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,540
we've even had your business cards printed.

723
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,260
Are you satisfied?

724
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,200
Actually, before you returned to Jingbei,

725
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,910
Qiu Hua and I had already discussed it.

726
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,830
We wanted you to join us as a partner.

727
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,220
We'll each give up 10% of our shares.

728
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,450
You'll have 20% of the law firm's shares.

729
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,820
How does that sound?

730
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,410
Are you willing to join us?

731
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,360
Do you think it's too little?

732
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,550
When did you become so money-grubbing?

733
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,810
Or should Luo and I

734
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,510
give you another 10%?

735
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,570
Let me tell you, she's only this nice to you.

736
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,760
If it were someone else,

737
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,120

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,460
Qiu.

743
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,840
Luo.

744
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,270
Thank you both.

745
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,030
You're too kind to me.

746
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,470
Why thank us?

747
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,430
This is all thanks to your own hard work, Xia Shu.

748
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,390
Come in.

749
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,600
Mr. Xu, Ms. Luo is here.

750
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,110
Ms. Luo.

751
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,030
Mr. Xu.

752
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,870
You're here.

753
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,790
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

754
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,100
I was a bit busy before

755
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,510
and kept you waiting.

756
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,680
Why didn't you even say goodbye

757
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,370
last time?

758
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,680
Our firm had some urgent matters.

759
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,030
I saw that you were busy too

760
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,030
and didn't want to disturb you,

761
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,070
so I left

762
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,480
without saying goodbye.

763
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

764
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,440
I called you here

765
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,880
to discuss

766
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,450
the contract between our two companies.

767
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,700
After signing the contract,

768
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,440
we need to start working on it right away.

769
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,610
I heard that Liangcheng Law Firm has already started.

770
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,820
Yes.

771
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,960
That's why I wanted to discuss

772
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,200
the contract with you again.

773
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,070
It's better for us to talk alone.

774
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,770
It won't be like with Qiu Hua,

775
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,730
who's always confrontational.

776
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,880
Mr. Xu, speaking of that,

777
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,660
I must clarify something for you.

778
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,880
About that...

779
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,190
Qiu Hua also talked to me about it that day.

780
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,550
Qiu Hua

781
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,130
is very straightforward,

782
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,740
but she has a good heart.

783
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,430
Of course, I criticized her.

784
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
She immediately realized

785
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,200
her own problem.

786
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,090
If you always give in like this,

787
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
our firm will go bankrupt sooner rather than later.

788
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,270
The more you give in,

789
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,360
the less valuable you become in their eyes.

790
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,270
So before I came today,

791
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,790
she repeatedly told me

792
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,460
to apologize

793
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,010
to Mr. Xu on her behalf.

794
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,710
She's so embarrassed.

795
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,790
Think more about our firm

796
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,460
and put aside those useless ideals.

797
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,550
Just tell him,

798
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,510
we have more evidence of Wanhe's

799
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,430
hidden assets.

800
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,130
Guess how I responded to her.

801
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,150
How did you respond to her?

802
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,080
I told her,

803
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,880
Qiu Hua,

804
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,800
you can't talk like that.

805
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,920
What kind of person is Mr. Xu?

806
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,510
What's his level and perspective?

807
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,110
Can he be the same as us?

808
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,440
Would Mr. Xu stoop to our level,

809
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,220
as second-year lawyers?

810
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,410
Right?

811
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,840
Isn't that so, Mr. Xu?

812
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,040
Don't flatter me.

813
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,700
Are you setting me up?

814
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
No, these are all sincere words.

815
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,800
Actually, I just don't like Qiu Hua's

816
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,000
tone in negotiations.

817
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,460
Forget it.

818
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,230
If I keep going,

819
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,800
it'll make me look petty.

820
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,510
Let's get back to the contract.

821
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,980
What have you thought about it these two days?

822
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,350
We've really given it

823
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,250
some serious thought these two days.

824
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,640
Our final decision

825
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
is that

826
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,680
we still insist

827
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,430
on a 50% split of the agency fee,

828
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,740
allocated before any bonuses.

829
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,480
No way.

830
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,040
Our firm

831
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,460
has many more people than yours.

832
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,350
And it'll be the same in future work.

833
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,130
That's a fact.

834
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,030
I won't accept 50%.

835
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,080
What you said, Mr. Xu,

836
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,690
is a fact.

837
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,240
However,

838
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,110
it was indeed we

839
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,230
who first discovered this information.

840
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,440
If we hadn't shared it with you in time,

841
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,380
you wouldn't have had the opportunity

842
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,130
to cooperate with Dingxin Group

843
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,590
and become their agent, right?

844
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,310
What I said is also a fact.

845
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,570
That's not the whole truth.

846
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,620
Then the whole truth is...

847
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,270
The whole truth is,

848
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,330
regardless of who first

849
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,880
discovered the information,

850
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,640
the case is now with Zhuoyue Law Firm,

851
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,840
and it's us who signed the agency agreement with Dingxin.

852
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,510
Let me put it this way.

853
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,960
If we didn't sign the agreement with you

854
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,160
and decided to do it ourselves,

855
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,810
that would be fine.

856
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,510
Mr. Xu, I don't think

857
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,140
that's completely true either.

858
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,720
You only know

859
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,450
about the profit transfer

860
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,000
between Mr. Wan and Dr. Peng,

861
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,550
using Dr. Peng

862
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,020
to conceal Wanhe's valuable assets.

863
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,350
But you don't have any evidence.

864
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,200
We don't need evidence.

865
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,050
We just need to pass the information

866
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,730
on to the administrators.

867
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,200
They'll investigate it themselves.

868
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,870
But even if they finish their investigation,

869
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,190
the conclusion will only be that the funds are unaccounted for.

870
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,590
Because the land

871
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,060
has already been sold to an overseas company.

872
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,010
And the connection between that company and Wanhe...

873
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,740
Let's just say

874
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,510
only we know about it.

875
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,160
What you know,

876
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,350
I can easily find out by hiring an overseas

877
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,480
background investigation company.

878
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,400
It'll just take some time.

879
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,760
Do you really think

880
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,810
there's anything we can't find out?

881
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,750
Mr. Xu.

882
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,440
Actually, at that time,

883
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,840
we could have shared this evidence with someone else.

884
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,210
But why didn't we?

885
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,310
It's because we have great trust and respect for you.

886
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,400
And we really hope

887
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,780
to facilitate this cooperation.

888
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,590
Alright,

889
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,810
Mr. Xu,

890
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,990
how much do you think

891
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,960
is appropriate for us to receive?

892
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,010
Thirty percent of the entire administrator's fee.

893
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,679
That's my final offer.

894
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,460
I hope you can understand.

895
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,270
If you don't accept it,

896
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm sorry.

897
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,760
Mr. Xu.

898
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,670
I actually know

899
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,110
that when you were at your lowest point,

900
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,230
you met Madam Mei.

901
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,150
And it was Madam Mei

902
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,520
who gave you the opportunity to make a comeback.

903
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,460
Surely, back then, you

904
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,250
should be the same as I am now.

905
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
I really hope to

906
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
facilitate this collaboration,

907
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,110
to learn from you

908
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,390
and work together on this case.

909
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,050
However, as you know,

910
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,400
I can't make any decisions

911
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,710
for my partners.

912
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,310
Alright, then, I'll

913
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
go back and discuss it with them

914
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,130
before giving you a final reply.

915
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,720
Thank you very much today.

916
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,000
I won't disturb you any further.

917
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,640
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

918
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,360
Ms. Luo.

919
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,400
Of course, I understand

920
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,710
how difficult it is

921
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,580
to start a law firm.

922
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,750
I also see your potential,

923
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,670
and I cherish this opportunity for collaboration.

924
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,300
Alright,

925
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,620
how about forty percent?

926
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,760
If you're willing,

927
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,930
I'll fight for it with my partners.

928
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,880
This is my

929
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,960
final concession.

930
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,660
I also hope you'll go back

931
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,070
and consider it carefully with your team.

932
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,680
I'm looking forward to your reply.

933
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
I previously discussed fifty percent with him.

934
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,230
My bottom line is forty percent.

935
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,760
Not a penny less.

936
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,910
Qiu Hua, you're right.

937
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,110
Mr. Xu,

938
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,590
we will

939
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,930
definitely give it our all.

940
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,190
Here are the materials

941
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,870
for that contract dispute case I mentioned.

942
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,750
We shouldn't have much to do for a while,

943
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,440
but if the client comes,

944
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,220
Qiu, can you help me respond on my behalf?

945
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,190
No problem.

946
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,000
Are you going alone again?

947
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,980
That's too dangerous.

948
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,710
Their group is sending two people

949
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,760
as my bodyguards.

950
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,210
Are those bodyguards mentioned

951
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,150
in another contract?

952
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,120
Don't worry.

953
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,690
Hao Lei is trying to set me up.

954
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,510
It's agreed that the working expenses

955
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,710
incurred in handling the entrusted matters by Party A

956
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,810
shall be included in the agency fee.

957
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,280
Party A shall not bear any additional costs.

958
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,250
I added a line, "But..."

959
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,030
But the expenses incurred by the auxiliary personnel

960
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,640
dispatched by Party A are excluded.

961
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,680
Well done, Xia Shu, you've improved.

962
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,150
So when are you leaving?

963
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,410
I'm leaving soon.

964
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,890
Why hasn't Luo come back yet?

965
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:23,960
Qiu.

966
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,570
Do you think she can close the deal?

967
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,290
Her?

968
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,530
As long as she doesn't surrender,

969
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,970
she'll definitely close the deal.

970
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,190
Why do you say that?

971
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,980
Qiu,

972
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,560
don't you think Ms. Luo

973
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,120
has a lot of feminine charm?

974
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,450
Just look at Mr. Chen.

975
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
He's had so many girlfriends,

976
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,170
but in the end,

977
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,980
he was completely under Ms. Luo's thumb.

978
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,490
I'm exhausted.

979
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,110
Mentally exhausted.

980
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,590
You're back. How did it go?

981
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,120
How did it go?

982
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,890
It's signed. Look.

983
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,830
Signed?

984
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,260
Did you negotiate properly before signing?

985
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,150
Didn't you say

986
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,900
forty percent is good to sign?

987
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,010
See what I mean?

988
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,300
Charm.

989
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,020
Luo.

990
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,640
I'm going on a business trip.

991
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,590
You probably won't see me for a while.

992
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,270
Are you still going alone?

993
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Xia Shu, you've got some nerve!

994
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,590
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

995
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,820
Is it okay for Xia Shu to go alone?

996
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,520
It's fine.

997
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,280
The place this time isn't remote,

998
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,580
and she'll have two bodyguards from Party A.

999
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,220
Did you notice?

1000
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,410
Xia Shu has really grown up,

1001
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,840
becoming more and more charming.

1002
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,520
I think that Mr. Hao has a crush on her.

1003
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,280
Charm.

1004
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,100
I'm back.

1005
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,110
Qiu Hua, you're back.

1006
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:55,920
Dad,

1007
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,350
why are you here?

1008
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,510
Quanquan didn't tell me you were coming.

1009
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,500
I came to Jingbei for a meeting

1010
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,830
and thought I'd drop by to see you.

1011
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,280
So where's Quanquan?

1012
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,320
He went out to buy some things.

1013
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
I told him,

1014
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,330
let's go out as a family of three for dinner,

1015
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,780
but Quanquan said

1016
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,230
he prefers to buy something

1017
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,590
and eat at home.

1018
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,860
Yes, yes.

1019
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,500
We rarely eat out.

1020
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,510
Please sit for a while.

1021
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,550
I'll go to the kitchen and get things done.

1022
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,190
No need.

1023
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,330
I told Quanquan

1024
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,280
to bring takeout back.

1025
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,250
You sit.

1026
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,750
Okay, you sit too.

1027
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,630
After you got married,

1028
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,820
you haven't been home.

1029
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,540
Is everything alright with you two?

1030
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,730
We're doing great.

1031
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,900
I arranged a job for your younger brother.

1032
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,410
He doesn't have a degree,

1033
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,190
so I couldn't arrange anything too good for him,

1034
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,510
just a security guard job.

1035
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,760
You understand, right?

1036
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,740
Yes, I understand.

1037
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,240
This is best.

1038
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,850
It won't cause you too much trouble.

1039
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,250
Dad,

1040
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,530
you don't have to overly take care of our family's affairs.

1041
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,240
Our current life

1042
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,890
is already much better than before.

1043
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,960
Also,

1044
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,070
a few days ago, Wu from Muyuan Investments

1045
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,890
called me,

1046
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,370
saying you went to see him

1047
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,590
but rejected him.

1048
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,330
Why is that?

1049
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,710
The conditions

1050
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,470
Mr. Wu offered me,

1051
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,910
you should know about them, Dad, right?

1052
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,600
He just wanted to use me

1053
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,150
to get you to approve that land for him.

1054
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,960
But I can't cause trouble for you

1055
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,150
because of my own matters.

1056
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,680
Qiu Hua,

1057
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,150
you're really considerate.

1058
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,840
Quanquan has good taste.

1059
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,390
Actually,

1060
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,600
I've been wanting to find a chance

1061
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,920
to talk to you alone.

1062
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,040
Dad, what do you want to say?

1063
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,380
Do you

1064
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,260
like Quanquan?

1065
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,270
Why are you suddenly asking this?

1066
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,930
We're married now,

1067
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,770
and we're doing well.

1068
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,510
When Quanquan liked you

1069
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,760
and chased you to Jingbei,

1070
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,740
I wanted to ask you then,

1071
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,920
do you like our Quanquan?

1072
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,780
Yes, I do.

1073
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,250
What do you like about him?

1074
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,860
Quanquan is

1075
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,280
honest

1076
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,570
and reliable.

1077
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Being with him makes me feel at ease.

1078
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,430
Did you marry Quanquan

1079
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,080
because of your family situation?

1080
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,160
Yes and no.

1081
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,440
How so?

1082
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,150
Dad, you should know

1083
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,230
about our family's situation.

1084
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,040
I've come a long way to get where I am now,

1085
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,760
so I actually lack a sense of security a lot.

1086
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,550
It's hard for me to trust people.

1087
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,590
But Quanquan is the only one

1088
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,510
who can give me a sense of security.

1089
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,300
He earns my trust.

1090
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,440
I think there are many things

1091
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,410
in this world worth pursuing,

1092
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
but for me,

1093
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,140
security and trust

1094
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,070
are more precious than anything else.

1095
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,630
Quanquan gave me that.

1096
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
I see.

1097
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,580
Qiu Hua,

1098
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
thank you.

1099
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,960
Dad, don't say that.

1100
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,890
Alright.

1101
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,170
Next,

1102
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,160
is what I want to discuss with you.

1103
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,110
You know,

1104
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,800
Quanquan doesn't like Jingbei

1105
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,130
and wants to go back to the county.

1106
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,090
I think with his abilities,

1107
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,180
he won't make a name for himself in Jingbei.

1108
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,180
So are you willing to go back with him?

1109
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,200
No.

1110
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,910
Why not?

1111
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,370
Of course, it's for my own development,

1112
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,430
as well as for you and Quanquan.

1113
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,080
Dad, let me be honest,

1114
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,270
