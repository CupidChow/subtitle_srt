[Unbreakable Ⅱ]

2
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
I'm relieved that Yingzi

4
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,039
has a partner like you.

5
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,400
She's passionate, smart,

6
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,000
and capable.

7
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,120
But sometimes,

8
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,479
she can be impulsive.

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,310
You are meticulous and prudent.

10
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,020
Together, you complement each other perfectly.

11
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,740
Thank you for the compliment.

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,480
What's up?

13
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,130
Madam Mei, I'm here for the Zhucheng Case.

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,680
What's the problem?

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,040
I just find it strange.

16
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,630
For such a big case,

17
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,430
the administrator‘s fee ended up being as high as 30 million.

18
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,980
Even if everyone at Liangcheng Law Firm were involved,

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,680
the profits each person would get are huge.

20
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,310
Why didn't you and your husband

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,560
use your own people from the firm back then,

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,750
including your own assistant,

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,760
and instead chose Xu Zhuo, who had just been released from prison?

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,520
Work requirements.

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,250
Really?

26
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,280
Both my husband and I admired Xu Zhuo.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,430
At that time,

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,060
he had just established his own law firm.

29
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,950
You could also understand it as

30
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,430
nurturing the younger generation.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,130
Is that the only reason?

32
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,570
What do you think?

33
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,470
If you say that's the reason,

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,830
then I'll accept it.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,630
No wonder Yingzi appreciates you.

36
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,780
I'm the best supporting role.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Alright.

38
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,150
I admit

39
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,800
that in this matter,

40
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,400
we did something inappropriate.

41
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,090
People

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,500
always see things clearly only in hindsight.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,750
Back then, my husband and I

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,560
resigned from our original law firm,

45
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,000
took a few underappreciated students with us, worked hard together,

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,470
and later established Liangcheng Law Firm.

47
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,240
We saw ourselves as the masters of the firm

48
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,960
and the students.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,870
Looking back now,

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,960
that kind of authority was foolish.

51
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,150
It restricted the students' free development

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
and shattered the respect between us.

53
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,370
Any independent thoughts from the students

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,870
were seen by us as

55
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,910
ingratitude.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,790
At that time,

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
I was very arrogant.

58
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,650
Decisions of life and death

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,910
seemed to be at my lips.

60
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,510
It was at this time that

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,209
the Zhucheng Case came.

62
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,180
[Xu Zhuo]

63
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,130
Hello, Mr. Xu.

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Why didn't you come today?

65
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,920
I have some urgent matters at home.

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,780
I might not be able to come over for the next couple of days.

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,800
I see.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,560
So,

70
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,430
have you thought about

71
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,430
joining Zhuoyue?

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,040
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,870
I may need more time.

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,190
I'm a bit busy here.

75
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,040
Talk to you later. Bye.

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,710
You're here.

77
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,070
Why didn't you go to Zhuoyue Law Firm?

78
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,800
Come here.

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,630
I have something to tell you.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,830
Good.

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,070
I went to see Madam Mei just now.

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
After you finish,

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
I also want to talk to you.

84
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,120
You go first.

85
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,530
Xu Zhuo wants the three of us to join Zhuoyue Law Firm,

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
and

87
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,060
make me a partner,

88
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
and you and Xia Shu

89
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,190
as lawyers at Zhuoyue.

90
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,800
But he said, you'll get preferential payment,

91
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,450
and the three of us will still be a team.

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,630
Did you agree?

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,640
Take a guess.

94
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,350
What do you think?

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,080
Actually, I talked to Chen Shuo

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,680
about this yesterday.

97
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,000
He thinks

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,310
Xu Zhuo is worried about the secret of Wanhe's

99
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,480
asset transfer leaking,

100
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,480
so he's using the offer of partnership

101
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,480
to shut me up.

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,190
Anyway, I'm finding Xu Zhuo harder and harder to understand.

103
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,500
Previously, because of the Wanhe case,

104
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,870
I subconsciously thought

105
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,950
he was involved with Madam Mei's case,

106
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
but Madam Mei

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,120
always backs him up,

108
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,290
so I didn't think much of it.

109
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,800
I still suspect Liangcheng Law Firm the most.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,540
Why?

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,750
I think when Madam Mei

112
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,720
found out about Yu Cheng's criminal clues,

113
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,600
to ensure the bankruptcy reorganization went smoothly,

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,270
she chose to keep it confidential temporarily.

115
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,800
But the partners

116
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,909
at Liangcheng Law Firm found out,

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,870
and they realized

118
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,140
there was a huge risk facing them.

119
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,520
If Zhucheng's shareholders found out that the administrators

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,020
knew about Yu Cheng's crimes but chose to conceal it,

121
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,120
their future primary claims

122
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,510
would be hard to satisfy.

123
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,310
They could then sue the administrators for negligence

124
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,250
and demand compensation,

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
and Liangcheng Law Firm

126
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,920
would face billions in compensation,

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,070
and their partners

128
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,680
would risk losing everything.

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,630
In the Zhucheng Case,

130
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,860
Madam Mei and her husband

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,750
didn't let anyone else from Liangcheng FLaw irm participate,

132
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,020
meaning

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,240
the huge profits weren't ours.

134
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,310
But when problems arose,

135
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,390
we'd face the risk of losing everything.

136
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,260
But

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,650
if Madam Mei and her husband fell,

138
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,120
then things would be different.

139
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,490
The profits could be shared,

140
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,800
and the risks could be controlled at any time.

141
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,300
You're right,

142
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,750
but you forgot one thing.

143
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,650
At that time, no one at Liangcheng Law Firm knew

144
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,909
the inside story of the Zhucheng Case.

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
The only one who knew,

146
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,040
besides Madam Mei and her husband's assistant,

147
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,260
was Xu Zhuo.

148
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,800
But I've also

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,750
verified this with Madam Mei,

150
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,510
and she said it couldn't be Xu Zhuo.

151
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,040
Moreover, I have no evidence to prove

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
Xu Zhuo is related to this matter.

153
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,570
Madam Mei and her husband have always supported him.

154
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,200
Why would he stab his benefactors in the back?

155
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,910
Benefactor?

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,990
Does Xu Zhuo wish to have a benefactor?

157
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,560
As far as I know,

158
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,000
the defenders for Xu Zhuo's second case

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,140
were Mei Daliang and her husband.

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,190
As the old saying goes, "Great kindness needs no thanks; deep kindness is almost like enmity."

161
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,750
If great kindness can't be repaid,

162
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,270
then one might try to eliminate the benefactor.

163
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,270
Mei Daliang and her husband have always been strong-willed.

164
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,110
How do you think they would treat

165
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,250
a young man

166
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,160
who is both indebted to them and destitute?

167
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,000
And for Xu Zhuo,

168
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,980
is Xu Zhuo the type to be a mere follower?

169
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,280
There's another point,

170
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,120
if there really is a creditor

171
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,549
making a huge claim against the administrator,

172
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,400
Xu Zhuo's small law firm would definitely not be able to escape.

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,000
That's true,

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,030
but it seems Madam Mei

175
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,390
is also willing to back up for Xu Zhuo.

176
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,120
Madam Mei is your mentor.

177
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,990
She must be nice in your eyes.

178
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,720
But I'm being objective.

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,000
Today I asked Madam Mei why,

180
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,270
you didn't give the Zhucheng Case to your own people

181
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,960
but to an outsider, Xu Zhuo.

182
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,040
Do you know what Madam Mei said?

183
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,000
We handed this lucrative case

184
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,490
to an outsider, Xu Zhuo.

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,230
We did appreciate him,

186
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,550
but...

187
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,780
it was also a kind of warning.

188
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,050
We decide who lives and who doesn't.

189
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,730
Whoever doesn't respect us

190
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,790
can only step aside.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,790
Unfortunately,

192
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,070
I only reflected on and

193
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,420
realized all this after Yu's death.

194
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,120
But at that time, we thought

195
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,260
we were just supporting the young.

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,150
Before I told you this,

197
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,180
did you know Madam Mei was such a person?

198
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,360
Anyway, I think

199
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,270
now everything is just our speculation.

200
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,910
But I think

201
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,000
before this matter is investigated clearly,

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
let's not go to Zhuoyue Law Firm for now.

203
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
Let Xia Shu go for me.

204
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,620
Mr. Xu.

205
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,630
Yingzi.

206
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,200
I told you before

207
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
something happened at home.

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,870
Can another lawyer go for me?

209
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,140
Xia Shu from our law firm, okay?

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
Why?

211
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,080
Because I...

212
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,440
I might have to go back to my hometown, Lingnan.

213
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,320
Has something happened?

214
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,990
As you know,

215
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,030
my father is the only one

216
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,700
left in my family.

217
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,000
He always worries about

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,150
me being alone in Jingbei,

219
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,320
and he has this, this,

220
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,030
proud disciple,

221
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,150
so he wants me to go back and meet him.

222
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,800
So I'll go back and see.

223
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,160
You mean

224
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,940
you're going on a blind date?

225
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,530
You can think that way.

226
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
Blind date?

227
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,480
Are you serious?

228
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,270
Well, my father

229
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,840
is almost 70 years old.

230
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,290
I have to make him rest assured.

231
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,330
Oh right, Mr. Xu,

232
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,340
I've thought it through about

233
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,450
joining Zhuoyue Law Firm.

234
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,650
So, what's the result?

235
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,960
I've also talked about it with Qiu Hua

236
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
and Xia Shu.

237
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,950
They were very excited

238
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,670
after listening, the same as me.

239
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,670
We are all very grateful for your recognition of us.

240
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,030
But as you know,

241
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,480
sometimes the three of us

242
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
girls think a lot.

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
We just can't

244
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,430
let go of our small law firm.

245
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,460
So,

246
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,320
we made a difficult decision.

247
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,270
Well,

248
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,530
we won't join Zhuoyue Law Firm for now.

249
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,010
But we are very thankful for

250
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,160
your recognition and understanding.

251
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,670
I'm very sad

252
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,550
that you won't join.

253
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,900
Yes. Me too.

254
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,630
But I can't force you.

255
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,150
You should go home first.

256
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,880
Come back early.

257
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,700
Thank you for your understanding.

258
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,910
Bye.

259
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,510
Why are you laughing?

260
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,050
Awesome.

261
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,820
Now you lie without even making an outline.

262
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,080
It's not easy for me.

263
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,850
By the way, let's not tell Xia Shu about my

264
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,050
secret investigation for now.

265
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
She brought up the Zhucheng Case again,

266
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,070
She suspects Mei Daliang's trouble is related to the Zhucheng Case.

267
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,360
She's worried I'll be in danger like Mei Daliang

268
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
back then.

269
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,390
Did you manage to deflect her suspicion?

270
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,670
Temporarily dispel her doubts.

271
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,790
But she's still undecided about whether to disclose

272
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,370
the asset transfer by Wanhe.

273
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,050
I'm not sure about her.

274
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,390
You'd better deal with Chen Shuo as soon as possible.

275
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,310
Let me remind you,

276
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,920
her relationship with Chen Shuo is not ordinary.

277
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm leaving.

278
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,370
Xia Shu, we'll lend you the money.

279
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,880
Don't be stubborn, okay?

280
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,720
No.

281
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,390
Luo has invested her money in the firm.

282
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,000
Your money has its own use.

283
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,150
I can't take the money.

284
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
I've done the math for you.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,360
Hao Lei currently owes us 1.21 million,

286
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,720
and that's just the first installment.

287
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,000
The total debt is

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
at least two million.

289
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,750
According to your commission,

290
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,850
your dad's money should cover most of it.

291
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,960
You missed one.

292
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,620
There's also the late fee of 210,000.

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,670
You must get the money. Got it?

294
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,500
I know.

295
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,200
But this time, all the money Hao Lei has

296
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,850
will probably go to Zhang Lan.

297
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,570
You're poor yourself.

298
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,690
And you're worried about the young master?

299
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,750
Does he need your concern?

300
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,790
Sell two houses and he'll get the money.

301
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,550
Even selling houses isn't that quick, you know.

302
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,800
The shareholders' meeting is in a few days.

303
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll ask him for the money after that.

304
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,750
By the way, Xia Shu,

305
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I forgot something important.

306
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,550
I'm not going to Zhuoyue Law Firm

307
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,750
for that case for now.

308
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,870
You'll have to go to Zhuoyue Law Firm for a few days.

309
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,510
Okay?

310
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,900
Is it going to Mr. Xu's place?

311
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,510
Yes.

312
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,720
Is Zhang Lan the only thing left for Hao Lei?

313
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,700
Are you free?

314
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,140
He doesn't pay me back. Why should I bother with him?

315
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,230
Just ignore him.

316
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,510
I haven't worked with Mr. Xu yet.

317
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,460
I'll go and experience it.

318
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,620
What do you have to experience with a man who

319
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,810
got into jail twice?

320
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,550
He just pretends to be elegant in the office every day.

321
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,680
We, on the other hand, work from dawn to night.

322
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,090
Don't expect anything.

323
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,590
The creditors' meeting is coming up soon.

324
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,840
It's really urgent.

325
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
Why don't you go tomorrow?

326
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,010
Okay.

327
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,910
I'll go home now.

328
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,960
Go back and get ready.

329
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,960
Well, it's tomorrow. You're off work now?

330
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,890
It's only 1 p.m.

331
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,590
I want to get a facial.

332
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,030
I still have a few sessions left on the card I bought before.

333
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,790
Go.

334
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,710
I'm the one who need your help.

335
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm leaving. Bye.

336
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,320
Bye.

337
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,150
She was just worrying about money,

338
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,510
and now off to get a facial.

339
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,830
Xu Zhuo is really popular.

340
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,910
She has a lot on her mind right now.

341
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,930
I'd rather she spent more time with Mr. Xu

342
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,130
to distract herself.

343
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,110
[Jingbei Zhuoyue Law Firm]

344
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,340
You're too late.

345
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,690
What time is it? Why aren't you here yet?

346
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,840
Miss, do you have an appointment?

347
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,920
We're together.

348
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,510
What took you so long?

349
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,400
Traffic jam.

350
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
Is Mr. Xu here?

351
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,460
He's been here for a while. Let's go.

352
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,630
Here.

353
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,240
Miss, what are you doing?

354
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,080
Don't you know you're late?

355
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,650
It's my first day here.

356
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,870
I must make a good impression on Mr. Xu.

357
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,780
People are laughing at you.

358
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,030
You're so dressed up.

359
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you here for work?

360
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,190
Who are you showing this to?

361
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,570
Alright.

362
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,510
I'm not dressed up.

363
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,120
This is just paying attention to appearance.

364
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,370
I can't stand it.

365
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,280
Mr. Xu.

366
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,640
Alright, let's go.

367
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,970
Mr. Xu, we meet again.

368
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,910
Who are you?

369
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,670
Don't you remember me?

370
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,600
I went to your charity event

371
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,870
with Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu before.

372
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,390
We even took a photo together.

373
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,360
Ms. Xia is here to take over Ms. Luo's work.

374
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,020
Welcome.

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,240
But

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,790
all the work before

377
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,510
was done by you and Luo Yingzi.

378
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,790
Now suddenly there's a change.

379
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,960
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

380
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,150
Ms. Xia's mind

381
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,240
is like a computer.

382
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,960
She can remember all the legal articles by heart

383
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,730
and recite them.

384
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,970
You can definitely trust her work ability.

385
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,490
Alright, since you insist on the change,

386
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
then change it.

387
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,910
But before the confirmation of the debt declaration,

388
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,400
all the accounts need to be cleared up.

389
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,760
No problem.

390
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,260
Let's go.

391
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,300
Well, Mr. Xu.

392
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,480
I wanted your autograph last time,

393
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
but I didn't get the chance.

394
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,550
I've printed out your photo

395
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,390
this time.

396
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,640
Could you sign it for me?

397
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,060
There's no need.

398
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,770
It's okay.

399
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,200
Here.

400
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,450
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

401
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,170
Are you done?

402
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,990
Yes.

403
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,510
Let's go.

404
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,589
Bye, Mr. Xu.

405
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,350
Ms. Fang,

406
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,260
Luo Yingzi suddenly quit,

407
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,110
and now Xia Shu came.

408
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,480
I want to ask you about her.

409
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,550
Isn't Ms. Xia from your firm before?

410
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,070
Xia Shu?

411
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,830
Don't worry about her.

412
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,110
She came to our firm

413
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,900
because of her father's connection.

414
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,350
Later, when her dad got into trouble,

415
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,410
we didn't dare to keep her.

416
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,280
This girl is quite simple.

417
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,240
She's just a machine for memorizing things.

418
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,440
She likes to memorize legal articles.

419
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,110
But she really

420
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,340
hasn't handled many cases.

421
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,400
Just make sure her office has

422
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,480
fast internet,

423
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,090
and let her play games as much as she wants.

424
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,790
Okay, I got it.

425
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,440
Idle people are the easiest to handle.

426
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,920
Bye.

427
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,070
Where did you get this photo?

428
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,480
I downloaded it online.

429
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,200
I looked for many photos

430
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,170
and finally chose the most handsome one.

431
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,160
Do your calculations.

432
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,440
You're here for work.

433
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,860
It's fine.

434
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,070
Ms. Xia.

435
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,260
Mr. Xu.

436
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,480
How is the new environment?

437
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,400
Pretty good.

438
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,220
Mr. Xu, have a seat.

439
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,080
Let me get you some water.

440
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,310
Mr. Xu, you came just in time.

441
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,270
There's a claim from Dingxin.

442
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,970
The accounts don't match.

443
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,800
I just want to ask you.

444
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
This one.

445
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Look.

446
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,890
And the total number.

447
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,880
Okay.

448
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,470
Is your network speed fast enough?

449
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,100
What do you mean?

450
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,810
It's pretty good. I just checked.

451
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,510
It's definitely enough for work.

452
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,420
A bit slow for gaming.

453
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,660
Do you want to add a router here?

454
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,350
No need.

455
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,160
We're here to work,

456
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,230
not to play games.

457
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,620
Work well

458
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,890
and play games well too.

459
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,750
And which one?

460
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,160
Mr. Xu.

461
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,170
Mr. Gao and Mr. Jia from Mingshan are here.

462
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Okay, got it.

463
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
We'll talk about it tonight.

464
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,220
I'll leave you then.

465
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,240
Mr. Xu.

466
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,990
Hello.

467
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,030
Mr. Xu.

468
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,550
Please.

469
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,110
Please.

470
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,270
We only get half of the agency fee,

471
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,000
yet we do all the work.

472
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,690
He's really taking advantage.

473
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,790
I finally encounter an issue

474
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,720
and want to discuss it with him,

475
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,640
but I have to wait until night.

476
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,400
What does that mean?

477
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,310
We have to work overtime tonight.

478
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,110
Qiu, Mr. Xu has a guest.

479
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll go serve some water.

480
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
No, Xia Shu. Seriously?

481
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,240
Mr. Xu, we're here

482
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,790
on behalf of Mr. Sun from Mingshan Group.

483
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,280
We have a case for you.

484
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,830
Have some water.

485
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,590
Thank you.

486
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,880
Mr. Xu.

487
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,310
Thank you.

488
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,600
We'd like to entrust you with a lawsuit against Liangcheng Law Firm.

489
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,590
Who are you?

490
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,720
Ms. Zhang.

491
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,670
Hello, I'm Xia Shu.

492
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm also from Dingxin case team.

493
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,610
Hello, Ms. Xia.

494
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,710
What brings you here?

495
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,310
Well,

496
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,870
I... I'm here for you, Ms. Zhang.

497
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,990
I looked around just now.

498
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,310
It seems only you and me are at the same age.

499
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,440
There are many things I don't understand that I want to ask you.

500
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,630
May I add you on WeChat?

501
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,440
Of course.

502
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,190
Great.

503
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Let me scan your QR code.

504
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,660
Okay.

505
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,260
Let's go downstairs.

506
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,930
Okay.

507
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,200
Mr. Xu is busy, right?

508
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,720
Yes.

509
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,830
He's with guests.

510
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,400
Okay.

511
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Let me scan your QR code.

512
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,830
Okay.

513
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,720
I'll send you my phone number.

514
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,540
Okay, I'll save it later.

515
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,270
I'll get back to work.

516
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,700
Okay, I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

517
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,700
Keep in touch.

518
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,920
Xia Shu.

519
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,510
Are you serious?

520
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,930
We're here for work,

521
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,440
not to serve them.

522
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,710
Qiu, didn't you notice

523
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,520
that Mr. Xu's guests

524
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,700
are from Mingshan?

525
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,550
Mingshan?

526
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,310
What are they doing here?

527
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,080
I was eavesdropping outside the door.

528
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,200
It seems like Mingshan Group

529
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,310
wants to entrust Mr. Xu to sue Liangcheng Law Firm.

530
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,750
Sue Liangcheng Law Firm?

531
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,240
I remember the Mingshan Case

532
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,790
was handled by Chen Shuo.

533
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,500
Mingshan suing Liangcheng Law Firm.

534
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,750
Could it be targeting Chen Shuo?

535
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,070
But I'm sure

536
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,440
what I heard is that

537
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,730
they want to entrust Mr. Xu to sue Liangcheng Law Firm.

538
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,650
I didn't hear if Mr. Xu took it or not.

539
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,500
Okay, Xia Shu.

540
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,510
You didn't come here in vain.

541
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,640
You have to pay attention to this matter

542
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,980
and keep observing.

543
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,540
If Xu Zhuo takes on the case,

544
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,610
we need to inform Luo Yingzi immediately.

545
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,140
By the way,

546
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,560
you already knew about the relationship

547
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,620
between Luo Yingzi and Chen Shuo?

548
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,890
Of course.

549
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,540
That's why I dared to please Mr. Xu.

550
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,240
Xia Shu,

551
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,510
anyone who dares to underestimate you

552
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,070
must be blind.

553
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,240
Like me,

554
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,960
I've been blind several times.

555
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Come on, keep up the good act.

556
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,400
Act right in front of him, just like you did just now.

557
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
No problem. Leave it to me.

558
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,230
This one is still handsome.

559
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,160
You're way more handsome than him.

560
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,680
Demanding the return of the legal fee?

561
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
That's not quite appropriate, is it?

562
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,790
He represented you in the lawsuit.

563
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,110
The case was won.

564
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,680
And now you want your legal fee back.

565
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,320
Mr. Xu, it's not that we don't want to pay the legal fee.

566
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,880
But Mr. Chen took advantage of the situation

567
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
and demanded too much.

568
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,510
Besides, we've already reached a settlement.

569
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,910
We don't need a lawyer anymore.

570
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,670
Yet he still wants to charge the original amount.

571
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,670
Wasn't that something you agreed to before?

572
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,990
Now the market economy is not good.

573
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,160
Can't you show some contractual spirit?

574
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,070
Mr. Xu,

575
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,790
it's not that we don't have the contractual spirit.

576
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,650
It's just that Mr. Chen

577
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,770
is too greedy.

578
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,160
Besides, he withdrew money

579
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,340
from the joint account without our permission.

580
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,270
That was a bit too much.

581
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,660
Chen Shuo from Liangcheng Law Firm?

582
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,770
Yes.

583
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,400
I know him.

584
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,130
He's hard to deal with.

585
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,030
This Mr. Chen is sly and dishonest.

586
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,270
We didn't really want to make a fuss,

587
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,350
but it's useless to play nice.

588
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,930
He didn't discuss it with us at all,

589
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,880
and withdrew money from the account.

590
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,640
He doesn't respect us at all.

591
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,030
So,

592
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,230
after setting up the joint account,

593
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,200
he didn't get your consent

594
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,030
and then revoked your access,

595
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,880
transferring the money out of the account himself, right?

596
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,160
That's right.

597
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,480
So we think he violated the rules.

598
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,640
That depends on how you interpret it.

599
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,730
He transferred 5.6 million yuan. That's no small amount.

600
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,780
And that's just the first installment.

601
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,700
He insists on demanding the full legal fee.

602
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,200
So

603
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,820
why are you coming to me?

604
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,320
Is it because I'm cheaper than him?

605
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:48,980
No, no.

606
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,310
Because we know you handled

607
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,620
a contract dispute case with Chen Shuo three years ago.

608
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,040
You beat Chen Shuo and left him speechless.

609
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,640
We all admire you.

610
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,070
Mr. Sun also knows that you previously handled a case

611
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,880
between our company and Maoyuan.

612
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,150
That time, you represented Maoyuan.

613
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,160
From that case,

614
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,870
Mr. Sun has known your capabilities.

615
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,030
So this time, no matter what,

616
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,450
Mr. Sun wants you to help us.

617
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,180
I can take the case

618
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,350
but my agency fee

619
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,510
is 5.6 million,

620
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,680
not a penny less.

621
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,640
But the money we're after is also 5.6 million.

622
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,400
It depends on what Mr. Sun wants.

623
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,470
Is it to get back the 5.6 million

624
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,430
or to vent some anger?

625
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,830
If it's the latter,

626
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,530
then the 5.6 million

627
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,390
will be my agency fee.

628
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,740
Sun Mingshan went to Xu Zhuo for a lawsuit against us?

629
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,060
But Xu Zhuo and we are all involved in the Wanhe case.

630
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,180
Once this case falls into his hands,

631
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,260
we'll be completely at his mercy.

632
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,800
Although Xu Zhuo hasn't decided yet,

633
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,000
we have to prepare for the worst.

634
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,070
When we took on the Mingshan case,

635
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,430
Chen Shuo did promise to bear the risks.

636
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,480
But he's a member of our firm after all.

637
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,150
We must be affected.

638
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Moreover,

639
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,230
everyone knows

640
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,010
what Xu Zhuo is like.

641
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,770
Mingshan case is a small case. It's not much money.

642
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,710
But Wanhe is different.

643
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,920
If he causes trouble for us

644
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,000
in the Wanhe Case,

645
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,440
and exposes the issue of Wanhe

646
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,790
transferring assets,

647
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,790
we'll be in deep trouble.

648
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,000
Tao Zheng.

649
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,270
You introduced Chen Shuo here.

650
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,480
So, you must

651
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,510
deal with him.

652
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,310
How?

653
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,270
Get him to return the money?

654
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,230
Do you think he can return it?

655
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,010
Besides, there's no way to return it.

656
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,590
The taxes have already been paid.

657
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,280
As long as he agrees to return it,

658
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,500
the firm will cover the taxes for him.

659
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,300
Also,

660
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,790
we can promise him

661
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,110
after the Wanhe Case is settled,

662
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,960
we'll take a portion of the administrator's fee

663
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,000
for him

664
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,760
to compensate for his loss.

665
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,960
Do you think he will agree?

666
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,750
He has to agree.

667
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,670
Xu Zhuo is involved in too many interests.

668
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,940
If anything happens to Wanhe,

669
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,480
it will be a minor issue for our firm's income to drop significantly.

670
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,660
How will we explain to the local government and court?

671
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,720
Will we be able to get such cases

672
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,640
in the future?

673
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,000
Fine, I'll try.

674
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,750
But I think

675
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,290
we should deal with Xu Zhuo first.

676
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,130
He's a ticking time bomb.

677
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,030
We're not strangers to him.

678
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,810
We can at least talk to him.

679
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,920
I'll go talk

680
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,750
to Xu Zhuo.

681
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,110
Before you talk to Chen Shuo, talk to Han first.

682
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,310
Ask him to return

683
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,560
the money he got.

684
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,230
What? What?

685
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,970
Return the money?

686
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,400
How am I supposed to maintain

687
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,850
my reputation in the legal community?

688
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,450
You don't have to be so polite to Mr. Han.

689
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,030
He has to return it,

690
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,050
whether he wants to or not.

691
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,880
We don't have time.

692
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,420
Wanhe's project is more important.

693
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,470
Mr. Han,

694
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,350
the firm promises you that

695
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,480
although you didn't participate in the Wanhe Case,

696
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,060
as long as you return the money,

697
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,110
once the bankruptcy administrator's fees for Wanhe arrive,

698
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,790
we guarantee your income

699
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,200
won't be less than this amount.

700
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,240
I won't do it.

701
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,080
I deserve it. Why should I return it?

702
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,590
Mr. Han, if you insist on not returning it,

703
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,520
we'll end up in court with Xu Zhuo.

704
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,350
We can't afford to

705
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,310
have a bad relationship with Xu Zhuo right now.

706
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,940
I just don't get it.

707
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,520
A prestigious firm like Liangcheng

708
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,550
is afraid of having a bad relationship with a troublemaker

709
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,590
who's been in jail twice.

710
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,750
Does he have some sort of leverage

711
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,830
on you?

712
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,560
Mr. Han,

713
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,730
I can't tell you that.

714
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,310
But in the Wanhe Case,

715
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
our interests are closely

716
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,700
tied with Xu Zhuo's.

717
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,310
It would be very unwise for us

718
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,790
to go against him now.

719
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,760
I'm also a partner at Liangcheng Law Firm, Mr. Tao.

720
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,040
Is there anything you can't tell me?

721
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,350
Mr. Han,

722
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,930
we didn't tell you

723
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,160
to spare you from the risk.

724
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Apart from the Wanhe's working team,

725
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,300
no one else knows about this.

726
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm here to tell you to return the money.

727
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,820
For the sake of this project,

728
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
we have to make concessions in this case.

729
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,170
You're a partner too.

730
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,430
You need to think about the overall interests.

731
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,720
Okay.

732
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,750
As long as Chen Shuo returns the money, I'll return mine immediately.

733
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,720
Mr. Han.

734
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,510
Mr. Tao,

735
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,950
this case is Chen Shuo's.

736
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,350
I'm just cooperating.

737
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,480
The agency fee is mostly his.

738
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,000
If he doesn't return it and I do,

739
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,960
wouldn't that be like I'm forcing him to return it?

740
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,530
I can't do that.

741
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,590
Mr. Han,

742
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,340
you're an old-timer. Set an example.

743
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,400
Is what I'm doing still not enough?

744
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,900
For the Wanhe project, I'm sacrificing myself.

745
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,690
How much more can I do?

746
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,790
I can't set an example and leave Chen Shuo hanging.

747
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,110
I can't do that.

748
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,720
You can do it, but I can't.

749
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,110
I'll say it again,

750
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,200
I'll return the money,

751
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,200
as long as Chen Shuo does first.

752
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,270
I'll tell Ms. Fang.

753
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,720
What the hell?

754
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,050
You just think I'm an easy target, don't you?

755
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,550
Thank you.

756
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,670
I'll get straight to the point, Mr. Xu.

757
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,720
I don't want you to take the Mingshan Case.

758
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,070
Why?

759
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,070
In the Wanhe project,

760
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,970
we're on the same side.

761
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Different positions

762
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,240
take different responsibilities.

763
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,080
Xu,

764
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,240
given your current reputation,

765
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,480
I really don't think you need to

766
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,750
take on a case like Mingshan's.

767
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,860
Moreover, you're suing your own peers.

768
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,400
Don't you care about

769
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,740
your future reputation?

770
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,400
I've already got a bad reputation.

771
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,250
I'm not afraid.

772
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,510
Have you agreed to take over the Mingshan Case?

773
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,360
Not yet.

774
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,070
I've proposed an agency fee

775
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,680
of 5.6 million to Mingshan.

776
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,310
They haven't responded yet.

777
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,580
Are you willing to do anything

778
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,460
for just 5.6 million?

779
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,360
Accept the client's request

780
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,840
to fulfill their demands

781
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,440
and get what I deserve.

782
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,720
I don't understand

783
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,400
what's there to worry about.

784
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,550
Don't you even consider

785
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,750
the relationship between our two firms?

786
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,680
It's not between two firms.

787
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,450
It's Chen Shuo

788
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,580
I'm not considering.

789
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,680
Mr. Yang, are you happy that you won the case?

790
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,490
Yes.

791
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,070
We can't be happy.

792
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,520
The other side will definitely appeal.

793
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,990
We need to focus on the second trial.

794
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,400
But my retainer authority only goes up

795
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,470
to the end of the first trial.

796
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,070
So will you still entrust me for the second trial?

797
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,270
Of course.

798
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
Mr. Chen, how much for the second trial?

799
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Just name your price.

800
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,110
How much?

801
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,270
20% off?

802
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,080
My disciple said 20% off. Not enough.

803
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,680
The second trial of this case isn't that difficult.

804
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,830
Let's give it 50% off, okay?

805
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,200
That's too kind of you.

806
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
No problem.

807
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,920
You have a guest.

808
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,960
Good morning, Mr. Tao.

809
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,860
Let me introduce for you.

810
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,000
Mr. Tao, our firm's top partner.

811
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,400
Hello.

812
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,830
Hello.

813
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,550
Mr. Yang.

814
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,830
Mr. Yang, well,

815
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,110
if there's no problem,

816
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,350
I'll ask my assistant to draft the contract.

817
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,160
Please come and sign it tomorrow, okay?

818
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,790
Sure.

819
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,310
Mr. Chen, I'm leaving.

820
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:25,920
I'll come by tomorrow.

821
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,790
Okay.

822
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,130
Sorry you have to come over again.

823
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,110
Goodbye.

824
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,880
Goodbye, Mr. Yang.

825
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,550
Goodbye.

826
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,240
The client has left. Send him off for your mentor.

827
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,350
Okay, I'll see him off.

828
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,400
What's up, Mr. Tao?

829
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,590
Nothing.

830
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,860
I just came by and saw you were here.

831
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,240
I came in to chat with you.

832
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,110
Your office is a bit small.

833
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,070
At the next partners' meeting,

834
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,540
tell them to get you a bigger one.

835
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,480
No need.

836
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,960
I feel comfortable sitting with Fang Rui.

837
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,560
No need to change.

838
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,880
After all, you've created

839
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,410
considerable value for the firm.

840
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,670
That's it?

841
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,860
Chen Shuo.

842
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,960
You were introduced to Liangcheng Law Firm by me.

843
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,320
How do you feel about it?

844
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,400
I think it's nice and comfortable.

845
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,320
Quite casual.

846
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,679
You feel comfortable?

847
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,199
I'm not that comfortable.

848
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,590
I introduced you here.

849
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,550
In a way,

850
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,150
I'm your guarantor.

851
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,320
If anything happens to you,

852
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,310
I'll be the first one in trouble.

853
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,570
Mr. Tao, let's cut to the chase, okay?

854
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,110
Chen Shuo.

855
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,159
Mingshan Group has entrusted Zhuoyue Law Firm's Xu Zhuo

856
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,800
to sue our firm,

857
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,489
demanding the return of that legal fee.

858
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,810
Xu Zhuo?

859
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,889
Well,

860
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,030
they haven't reached an agreement yet.

861
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,510
But I heard Sun Mingshan went for Xu Zhuo.

862
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,440
I also think

863
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,320
they will take this case sooner or later.

864
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,950
Didn't expect that?

865
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,420
Yes,

866
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
but not too surprised.

867
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,320
It's something he would do.

868
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,170
Xu Zhuo is quite formidable.

869
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,470
You may not know him,

870
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,530
but I do.

871
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,280
As long as he thinks it's necessary,

872
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,910
he can go after anyone

873
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,360
and show no mercy.

874
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,370
I know he can go after anyone,

875
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,120
and I know he's merciless.

876
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,150
But when you just said formidable,

877
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,070
I want to experience it for myself.

878
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,720
To speak frankly,

879
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,750
Mingshan Group negotiated a settlement with the other party behind the lawyer's back,

880
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,380
sacrificing the lawyers' interests.

881
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,820
That's unethical.

882
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,280
But we also can't be faultless for

883
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,360
withdrawing high legal fees

884
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,120
without the other party's consent.

885
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,770
They demanded a refund before, and we blocked it.

886
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,030
But what if Xu Zhuo represents them in the future?

887
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,150
Things would be complicated.

888
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,670
What's so complicated?

889
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,710
Isn't the fact clear enough?

890
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,400
And I don't quite understand, Mr. Tao.

891
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,520
Xu Zhuo hasn't represented Mingshan yet, right?

892
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,780
Do we really need to be so nervous in our firm?

893
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,840
We can stay calm,

894
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
but we need to prepare for the worst.

895
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,840
Chen Shuo, do you know?

896
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,110
In the Wanhe Case,

897
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,170
Xu Zhuo represents the largest creditor, Dingxin.

898
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,590
He knows everything about Wanhe.

899
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,710
It's fair to say that

900
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,180
he and our firm are in a mutually restrictive relationship.

901
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,080
If we really fall out with Zhuoyue Law Firm over the Mingshan Case,

902
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,400
it will have a catastrophic impact on the Wanhe Case.

903
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,030
Dude,

904
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm taking the lead in the Wanhe Case's

905
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,360
administrator team.

906
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,490
So, in the long run,

907
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,730
and also to save face for me,

908
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,590
the firm and I personally

909
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,690
hope you return that legal fee.

910
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,960
Of course, the firm also guarantees that,

911
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,030
on the premise of you returning the money,

912
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,320
the firm and I will represent you

913
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,240
in negotiating with Mingshan Group

914
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,370
to protect your interests to the greatest extent.

915
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,420
Is that okay?

916
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,550
Consider it as helping a buddy in need.

917
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,230
Mr. Tao,

918
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,090
you introduced and brought me to Liangcheng Law Firm,

919
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,630
and I thank you for that.

920
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,200
If this causes you trouble,

921
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,190
I apologize.

922
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,080
But in this matter,

923
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,550
sorry, I haven't done anything wrong.

924
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,900
I definitely won't return the money.

925
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,030
So you don't need to explain anything

926
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,710
to anyone in the firm.

927
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,230
Just push all the blame onto me.

928
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,750
Okay?

929
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,670
Chen Shuo.

930
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,290
Shuo.

931
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,520
Even if I push everything onto you,

932
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,100
can I really extricate myself?

933
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,950
What will others say about me? How will they see me?

934
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,480
If it's so hard for you,

935
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,770
I'll leave Liangcheng Law Firm.

936
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,340
I can do it.

937
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,430
You heard?

938
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,070
Mentor,

939
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,120
I heard it all at the door.

940
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,320
They asked you to return the money.

941
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
I refused.

942
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,630
Then,

943
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,550
what will they do to you?

944
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,480
I don't know.

945
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,590
Maybe later...

946
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,120
Mentor,

947
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,990
it was done by both of us,

948
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,440
and I also got a share of the money.

949
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,200
So no matter where you are,

950
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,010
I'll share the burden with you.

951
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,490
Got it.

952
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,340
Thank you, Fang Rui. Back to work.

953
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,180
Fang Rui.

954
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,680
It's not that serious.

955
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,620
It's fine.

956
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Did you talk to him?

957
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,280
Yes.

958
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,690
Still refused to return the money, huh?

959
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,390
I invited him to the firm with good intentions.

960
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
What has he done

961
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,150
since he came?

962
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,150
Ms. Fang,

963
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,400
if you put it that way,

964
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,550
it's really unfair to him.

965
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,410
I just did the math.

966
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,110
Not counting this over a million,

967
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,150
he has created

968
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,710
nearly three million in value for our firm.

969
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,030
The trouble he brought is much more than that.

970
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,270
He has to return the money.

971
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,760
If he insists on not returning it,

972
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,950
then we'll have to cut ties with him.

973
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,000
Ms. Fang,

974
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,130
he is a lawyer in our firm after all.

975
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,650
We can't cut ties with him.

976
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,710
How about

977
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,590
you talk to him?

978
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,940
You introduced him here.

979
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,200
Now that there's a problem, I have to clean up the mess?

980
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,410
Drink your milk.

981
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,760
Call Mr. Chen Shuo

982
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,530
and ask him to come up.

983
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,420
Okay, Ms. Fang.

984
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,670
Mentor, I'll go with you.

985
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,540
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

986
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,840
You want to see me, Ms. Fang?

987
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,050
Have a seat, Mr. Chen.

988
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,840
Mr. Chen,

989
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,910
you should remember

990
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
when you first took on this case,

991
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,040
I had reminded you.

992
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,630
As a lawyer, of course we follow the law,

993
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,360
but real-life situations are much

994
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,770
more complex than the law.

995
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,450
And many things

996
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,350
can't be judged solely by the law.

997
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,170
I've been a lawyer for over 20 years.

998
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,700
I know some things can be done,

999
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,550
and some can't.

1000
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,640
Going with the flow is the best strategy.

1001
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,430
So what is going with the flow

1002
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,630
in this matter?

1003
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,760
Return the money.

1004
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,510
Don't go against the unknown.

1005
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,480
As for the loss you suffered in this case,

1006
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,760
the firm will definitely make up for you in the future.

1007
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,670
I can guarantee it right now.

1008
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,270
You didn't participate in the Wanhe project,

1009
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,280
but I can officially include you

1010
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,320
in the Wanhe management team.

1011
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,800
You don't have to do anything.

1012
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,950
When it comes to distribution,

1013
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:06,210
you'll get an equal share with others, okay?

1014
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,540
I refuse.

1015
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,710
It's because there are too many

1016
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,240
unknowns in this world

1017
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,650
that humans invented laws and rules.

1018
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,480
As a lawyer,

1019
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,550
I only believe in laws and rules.

1020
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,300
I won't give up what I deserve,

1021
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,560
and I won't take what I don't deserve.

1022
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,510
No matter what,

1023
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,930
you are a member of Liangcheng.

1024
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,480
You need to consider the bigger picture of Liangcheng Law Firm.

1025
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,280
Ms. Fang,

1026
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,110
this is the difference between us.

1027
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,800
You value interests.

1028
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,760
while I value

1029
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
principles and bottom lines as a person.

1030
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,400
I won't consider anything else.

1031
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,400
If there's nothing else,

1032
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,550
I'll get back to work.

1033
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,110
Don't you consider the consequences?

1034
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,880
It's my choice.

1035
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,010
I'll bear all the consequences myself.
