[Episode 7]

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560
If I want to get money out of my master,

4
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,240
I'd have to grow steel nails.

5
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,200
Steel nails?

6
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,200
You bet.

7
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,039
Mr. Tian, your package is here.

8
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,820
They need your pick-up code and the document.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,479
I'll be right there.

10
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,250
No, no, no, go now.

11
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,390
I'll stay here and watch it for you.

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,070
Okay then. Thank you, Mr. Chen.

13
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,729
Okay, okay.

14
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,350
Two copies, right?

15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,960
Yes, two copies.

16
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,180
Then let's make it three copies.

17
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,430
So, as you said,

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,090
this case is a guaranteed loss, right?

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,800
Does that mean...

20
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,840
my money will go down the drain?

21
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,190
You guys...

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,200
You didn't hear the condition I mentioned clearly.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What I said was,

24
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,090
if this case goes to court,

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
we are indeed going to lose.

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,150
Because this case is clear-cut,

27
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,400
and the other side's lawyer is my student.

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,230
The evidence must be well prepared.

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,910
What should we do?

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,610
How can we not go to court?

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,680
One word:

32
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,680
Stall.

33
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,680
Whether we stall it for a year

34
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,040
or three, it'll both work.

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,470
We could possibly even stall it until she dies.

36
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,940
How old is she?

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
Over 70 years old.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,390
If you stall long enough,

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,590
you might even stall it until the plaintiff dies.

40
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,440
Besides,

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,120
you two run a loan company, right?

42
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,910
If you stall it for three years,

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,710
how many times will that three million double?

44
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,800
That makes sense.

45
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,960
Yes.

46
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,380
Once the other side files the case,

47
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,470
the court will have to send you a summons.

48
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,630
Just don't accept it.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,710
If you don't,

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,240
the court can't hold a hearing.

51
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,790
But how can we not accept the summons?

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,520
The address you're living at right now

53
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,540
is definitely where the court will send the summons.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,410
Once you get back, move immediately.

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,910
If you don't have other places, you can rent one.

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,829
In any case, you just need to

57
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,200
move somewhere they can't find you.

58
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,079
That old woman has my number.

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,610
I can't change this number.

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,360
I need to stay in touch with my clients.

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,829
There's a trick to answering the phone.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,850
When you pick it up, say,

63
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,540
"Hello, who's this?"

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
"This is the court."

65
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,210
"Who are you looking for?"

66
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,740
"I'm looking for He Qiaohui."

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,120
"That's not me, you've got the wrong number."

68
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,560
Just insist that we don't know them.

69
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,390
Right!

70
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,340
As long as you want to avoid them,

71
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,120
even if the court people are standing right in front of you,

72
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
you can still get away from them.

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,880
As for the rest,

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
we can talk about it when they find you.

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,510
Minghui, I'm done.

76
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,120
Mr. Chen.

77
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,240
There's 15 minutes left until you're off work.

78
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,190
I won't keep you from locking the door.

79
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,320
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

80
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,240
You're the most punctual in the firm.

81
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,290
Please sign here.

82
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,680
There's still a bit of time.

83
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,730
I'll grab two more files.

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,170
Okay.

85
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,260
This file can't be borrowed.

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,310
Why not?

87
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,230
This is a rape case.

88
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,820
There's a policy in our firm.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,120
Any file involving the personal privacy of our clients

90
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,470
must be reported to the partners if it needs to be borrowed,

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,750
and it has to be approved by Mr. Tao.

92
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,920
It needs Mr. Tao's approval?

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,420
Yes.

94
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,000
Then I won't borrow it. It's too troublesome.

95
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,270
I'll give him a call another day.

96
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,390
-Okay.
-We'll talk about it then.

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,680
Okay?

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,070
Okay.

99
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,210
Mr. Chen, are you here to return files?

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,800
Yes.

101
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,070
Minghui, return the files for me.

102
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,600
Okay.

103
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,020
Let me help you. Minghui.

104
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,600
Okay, thank you, Mr. Chen.

105
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,280
Qian Zhimin?

106
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,730
Hello, Xue.

107
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,160
What's going on?

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,190
How did it go with the thing

109
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,920
I asked you to do last time? Did you ask them?

110
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,430
Yes.

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,870
That intentional injury case.

112
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,430
No, no.

113
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,780
I'm not good with words.

114
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,940
You're better at getting others to believe you than I am.

115
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,530
Yes.

116
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,360
Please talk to him again.

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,480
You can't hurt someone and then refuse to pay.

118
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,530
How does that make sense?

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,270
Yes.

120
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,280
Of course, the drinks are on me, bro.

121
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,870
Thank you.

122
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,360
-Okay.
-No problem.

123
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,120
I'll get drunk with you.

124
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,680
Sorry.

125
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,000
No problem.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,870
I'll talk to your wife.

127
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,920
I'll ask for leave for you.

128
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,750
Minghui.

129
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm leaving.

130
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,110
Okay, see you tonight.

[Wei Cheng Rape Case]

132
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,070
Not available for borrowing?

133
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
And it needs Tao Zheng's approval?

134
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,270
Righteous Luo,

135
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,650
congratulations.

136
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,960
You took on a case worth three to five million,

137
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,430
right?

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,550
Wait, Unscrupulous Chen.

139
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,770
What do you mean by three to five million?

140
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,120
I don't understand what you're talking about.

141
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,270
Don't play dumb with me.

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,560
It's a private lending case.

143
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,600
The couple came to Liangcheng Law Firm today.

144
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,030
Your business is going so well. Treat me to a drink.

145
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
See you at the same place in an hour.

146
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,210
What does that mean?

147
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,300
How does he know we took on a lending case?

148
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,010
Chen Shuo is likely

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
He Qiaohui's attorney.

150
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
I should've known earlier.

151
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,810
We need to be more vigilant.

152
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,340
But it's strange.

153
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,430
The court's summons probably hasn't been sent out yet.

154
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,110
Why did they hire a lawyer so quickly?

155
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,940
I'm going to meet with him

156
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,190
to find out what's going on.

157
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,670
Are you playing stupid games like usual?

158
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,070
I like stupid things.

159
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,490
I'm obsessed with stupid things.

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Luo Yingzi,

161
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,190
your law firm is doing well recently.

162
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,650
Can I order something expensive? It's on you.

163
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,560
Excuse me.

164
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,230
Hello.

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
Two glasses of orange juice.

166
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,120
Okay.

167
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,580
Thank you.

168
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,430
Chen Shuo, let me ask you.

169
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,190
Did you take over He Qiaohui's case?

170
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,390
What's wrong?

171
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,900
There's a saying that even thieves have their principles.

172
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,720
The entire property of the plaintiff

173
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,190
in this case was drained by your client.

174
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,830
Yet your client, despite being rich,

175
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,800
refuses to repay the debt.

176
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,160
Unscrupulous Chen,

177
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,290
are you really going to take on this case?

178
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,460
Have you no conscience?

179
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,670
You know I have no conscience and you still asked me this question?

180
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,000
You know I have no conscience and you still came here?

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,480
Could it be that subconsciously,

182
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,770
you still want to see me?

183
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,230
I just want to advise you

184
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
that even if you

185
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,960
take on this case,

186
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,120
you'll lose in court.

187
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,000
You might as well advise her to repay the money quickly

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,720
and not play dirty tricks.

189
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,500
Alright.

190
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,929
For your sake, I'll try not to play tricks.

191
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,440
I asked you out today

192
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,560
to ask you something serious.

193
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,480
What is it?

194
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,890
To get familiar with the business,

195
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,190
I've been reviewing a lot of cases

196
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,030
handled by the partners at Liangcheng Law Firm.

197
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,270
Among them, one particular case

198
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,630
is quite special.

199
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,970
If you want to borrow it, it must be registered

200
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,830
and reported to the partners. Do you know that?

201
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,150
In the past, all the case files at Liangcheng Law Firm were open.

202
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,910
Why does this one need to be reported?

203
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,910
What case?

204
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,940
A rape case handled by Mei Daliang.

205
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,120
The Wei Cheng rape case?

206
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,650
Yes.

207
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,330
Mei Daliang left

208
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,000
because of this case

209
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,320
and lost his lawyer's qualification.

210
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,320
She is your teacher.

211
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,920
Do you know anything about this case?

212
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,790
I've read this case file before.

213
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,150
And I got fired the next day.

214
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:31,850
What a coincidence, right?

215
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,000
But unfortunately,

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,910
I didn't have time to make a copy back then.

217
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,760
You read this file,

218
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,430
but they didn't ask you to register.

219
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,750
Isn't that strange?

220
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
It used to be an open case file,

221
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,100
and now suddenly it needs to be registered and reported.

222
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,360
Plus,

223
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,750
Mei Daliang was forced away

224
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,790
because of this case.

225
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,610
In that case,

226
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
it's very likely that the three of you being fired

227
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,170
was also related to this case.

228
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,980
So did you find something?

229
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,510
Let's share information.

230
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,040
Tell me what you know first,

231
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,580
and I'll tell you what I know.

232
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,300
You're so cunning. I'm telling you,

233
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,110
the parking fees here are quite high.

234
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,180
Tell me or I'll leave.

235
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,520
Do you have any new tricks?

236
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,790
You always use reverse psychology.

237
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,870
But I fell for it.

238
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,920
When I was reading the case file today,

239
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,150
I secretly took a lot of photos.

240
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,910
Now I'll send them all to you.

241
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,960
Take your time to dig into them.

242
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,290
If you find anything,

243
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,730
let's exchange information.

244
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,630
Looks like

245
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,570
it's just a rape case.

246
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,370
Why is Liangcheng Law Firm so sensitive about it?

247
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,150
There's not just this one rape case in the firm.

248
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,870
Why didn't they mention privacy protection and the issue of not lending out files before?

249
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,470
Wait.

250
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,260
Even if it's for personal privacy,

251
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
the issue isn't with this case.

252
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,770
It must be related to another case.

253
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,670
Although Mei Daliang and his wife fell because of this case,

254
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,250
there must be something behind it.

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,390
So when they found out that Luo Yingzi was looking into this case,

256
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,250
they were worried that what behind it would be exposed,

257
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,250
which is why they fired them.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It must be like that.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,550
Come in.

260
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,240
Are you busy?

261
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,270
Mr. Tao.

262
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,910
Let me introduce.

263
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,840
This is Fang Rui,

264
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,460
an intern lawyer at our firm.

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,880
Nice to meet you.

266
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,000
Nice to meet you.

267
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,620
Our firm is currently implementing a training program for intern lawyers.

268
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,660
We want experienced lawyers like you

269
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,400
to mentor the younger lawyers.

270
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,060
Fang Rui will be your assistant.

271
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,850
Assistant?

272
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,120
That won't work. We must be partners.

273
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,140
Hello.

274
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,420
Although Mr. Chen Shuo is so young,

275
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
he's an experienced lawyer.

276
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,490
From now on, learn well and ask him when you don't understand anything.

277
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,440
Also,

278
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,960
don't take advantage of your seniority

279
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,480
to bully the younger ones.

280
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I'm new here.

281
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
If he doesn't bully me, that's already pretty good.

282
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,870
Mr. Fang,

283
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,790
please guide me in the future

284
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,010
and take me under your wing.

285
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,040
Come on.

286
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,390
I'm not out yet.

287
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,840
Wait until I'm out before you bully him.

288
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
From now on, he's your master.

289
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,970
If he really bullies you, let me know.

290
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,510
Alright, you guys chat.

291
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,080
I see.

292
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,650
I see, Mr. Tao.

293
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,040
Okay.

294
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,530
I wouldn't dare. He's all muscle.

295
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,190
Master,

296
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,570
I have a desk outside.

297
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,150
How about I...

298
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,870
go out to work?

299
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,600
Wait a minute.

300
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,310
Let me emphasize two things:

301
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,770
First, never call me "master" again.

302
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,390
When you call me master,

303
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,860
I get a bit full of myself

304
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
and forget my name.

305
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,350
Just call me Chen Shuo.

306
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,100
Of course,

307
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,390
if you feel uncomfortable calling me by name

308
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,110
since I'm your senior,

309
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,900
just call me Mr. Chen,

310
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,200
alright?

311
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,480
As for the second point,

312
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,790
look, this room is so big.

313
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,410
It's just me here, all alone,

314
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,390
and it's really boring.

315
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,390
It's good that you're here.

316
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,120
Just move your stuff in directly.

317
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,240
We'll each have a desk.

318
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,780
So that we can discuss things easily. Is that okay?

319
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,360
Go get your stuff. Hurry up and move in.

320
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,860
Alright, I'll go get my stuff.

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,670
Libo.

322
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,360
Tian.

323
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:06,980
Mr. Chen.

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,550
Are you tired?

325
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,590
I'm okay.

326
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm waking myself up.

327
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,620
Your brain is sharp enough even if you don't wake yourself up.

328
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,580
Let me tell you something.

329
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,550
I was planning to tell you after I make it,

330
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,510
but it looks like

331
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,550
that's not going to happen.

332
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,510
But I have to tell you

333
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,730
so you'll know how I feel.

334
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,630
What is it?

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
Actually, I've been

336
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,250
looking for a partner at our firm.

337
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,550
Otherwise,

338
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,910
I'd be sitting alone in my office,

339
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,020
feeling lonely

340
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,280
and bored, right?
-Yes.

341
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,280
Why do I always chat with you?

342
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,750
You're sharp and capable.

343
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,780
Right? We'd make a great team.

344
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,030
However,

345
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,780
today the firm assigned me a partner.

346
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,750
Who is it?

347
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,320
The one who's packing his things.

348
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,850
I've been here for a while

349
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
and didn't even notice him.

350
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,950
Who is he?

351
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Ms. Fang's nephew.

352
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,020
He doesn't even have a lawyer's qualification.

353
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,320
He's been here for a year

354
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,600
and hasn't worked on any cases.

355
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
He hasn't even passed the qualification exam yet.

356
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,080
Then he must be a good kid.

357
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,590
Why did they assign him to me? Are they blind?

358
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,190
Mr. Chen, I have to warn you.

359
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,200
He could be

360
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,670
a spy for Ms. Fang,

361
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,660
planted by him on your side.

362
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,200
A spy?

363
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,970
Come on. You're so funny, Tian.

364
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,410
Be careful.

365
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,840
You're back.

366
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,120
What are you looking at so seriously?

367
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,010
Wait.

368
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,940
When I came back, both of you weren't here.

369
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,870
Where did you go?

370
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,280
I went to meet a client,

371
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,150
introduced by my senior.

372
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,530
It's also helping us expand our client base.

373
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,060
By the way,

374
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,170
I inquired about Liangcheng Law Firm.

375
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,750
In He Qiaohui's case,

376
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,400
our opponent turned out to be Han.

377
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,490
I can't believe it's not Chen Shuo, but Han.

378
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,590
What could Han possibly do?

379
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,080
You could figure it out without even thinking.

380
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,630
He'll stall.

381
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,680
Just wait and see.

382
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,510
It'll probably take

383
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,720
3 to 5 months just to serve the summons.

384
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,940
That won't do.

385
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,850
He can stall, but Auntie Song can't afford to wait.

386
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,320
How is Auntie Song going to manage those 3 to 5 months?

387
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,180
Not to mention, her husband

388
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,660
is still in the hospital.

389
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,810
I just don't understand.

390
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,150
We just filed the case the day before yesterday,

391
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,790
and yesterday they already went to find Han.

392
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,450
Logically, they shouldn't know about it yet.

393
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,120
You're back.

394
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,390
Luo.

395
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,270
Qiu.

396
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,070
Can I take a leave?

397
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,030
What happened?

398
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,130
My family called just now,

399
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,120
saying my mom's in the hospital.

400
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,690
Well...

401
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,910
That's a big deal.

402
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,030
You should head home right away.

403
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,950
But...

404
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,930
I just took on Auntie Song's case.

405
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,720
Don't worry about it.

406
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,420
At worst, Qiu Hua and I can handle it.

407
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,710
Go and be with your mom.

408
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,740
When I took on the case,

409
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,900
I said I'd handle it.

410
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,270
I don't want to delay your business.

411
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,960
Which is more important, your mom or the case?

412
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,750
At a time like this,

413
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,000
you don't have to fight alone.

414
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Just go.

415
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,080
Okay.

416
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,480
By the way, Luo.

417
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,750
Auntie Song has already told He Qiaohui

418
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,790
about the lawsuit.

419
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,360
She thought that this way, she could get her to pay back voluntarily.

420
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,060
Remember to contact her.

421
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,190
Who told Auntie Song to tell He Qiaohui?

422
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,820
Didn't I repeatedly tell her to keep it confidential?

423
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,640
Yes.

424
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,530
It was me.

425
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,210
I'm sorry, Qiu.

426
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,280
I didn't know you had told her that.

427
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,380
I thought we were suing openly

428
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,040
and didn't need to keep it confidential.

429
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,840
I'm speechless, Xia Shu.

430
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,160
Go home and be with your mom now.

431
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Just go now.

432
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,250
Yes, go back now.

433
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,480
You haven't spent all that 800,000, have you?

434
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,250
Do you have money?

435
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,030
Yes.

436
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,210
Then hurry up and go back.

437
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,800
Go.

438
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,680
Be careful.

439
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,040
Okay.

440
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,440
Tell us when you arrive.

441
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
I don't know what to say.

442
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,600
I've only just started finding her likable recently,

443
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,730
and now she's caused us trouble again.

444
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,480
In her world, there's always sunshine.

445
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,120
How could she feel the darkness of human nature?

446
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,050
But there's no need to rush.

447
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,190
Life itself will teach her anyway.

448
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,000
Master.

449
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,069
See? You forgot again.

450
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,740
Oh, right. Mr. Chen.

451
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,770
Mr. Chen, actually...

452
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,849
I don't have my lawyer's qualification yet.

453
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,880
So I may not be able to help you with some important things.

454
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,990
But for small things within my ability, feel free to call on me.

455
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,150
No problem.

456
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,200
Fang Rui.

457
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,440
We'll be partners from now on,

458
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,430
so I'll be straightforward.

459
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,790
I heard some gossip.

460
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,350
Is Fang Lihong...

461
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,030
your aunt?

462
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,000
Who told you that?

463
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,790
Is she?

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,280
Really?

465
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,130
Who told you that?

466
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,360
Han Zhitong, Mr. Han.

467
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,270
Don't worry about it.

468
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,330
Mr. Han.

469
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,380
Fang Rui,

470
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,290
well, let's keep it like this from now on.

471
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
If I need you, I'll definitely call you.

472
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,200
If there's nothing,

473
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,590
just sit here and focus on preparing for your qualification exam.

474
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,750
-Okay.
-And,

475
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,210
if we earn money from any case,

476
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,930
don't worry,

477
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,370
I won't leave you out, okay?

478
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,710
Well, Master.

479
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,410
Mr. Chen,

480
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,630
I'm not here for money.

481
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,450
So you're here to keep an eye on me for your aunt?

482
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,390
What does that mean?

483
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,330
Just kidding.

484
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,940
I'm here to learn from you.

485
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,680
My parents teach law at university,

486
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,140
and my aunt...

487
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
well, is a lawyer.

488
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,600
They think I should also

489
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,910
be a lawyer in the future.

490
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,880
But...

491
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,000
When I was applying to university,

492
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,230
my parents forced me to change my intended major.

493
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,550
Then after graduation,

494
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,930
all my classmates passed the bar exam,

495
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,000
but I didn't.

496
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,930
My parents think I embarrassed them.

497
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,160
Then my aunt brought me here,

498
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
to escape my parents

499
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,970
and focus on studying this.

500
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,890
It seems like you don't like law either.

501
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,110
Law...

502
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,160
is boring and monotonous.

503
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
It's all about winning or losing.

504
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,880
But life isn't all about winning and losing.

505
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,440
It's not a battle.

506
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,430
That's true.

507
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,640
So what do you like?

508
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,720
Painting,

509
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,100
singing, and dancing.

510
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,720
When I have money, I like traveling;

511
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,060
when I don't, I like staying home.

512
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,400
My dad says

513
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
that whatever costs money,

514
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,470
that's what I love.

515
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,050
So you like money.

516
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,000
Looks like we have similar interests.

517
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,270
Do you know what my nickname is?

518
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,790
My nickname is "Money String."

519
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,700
I really love money.

520
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,960
We'll definitely get along well in the future.

521
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,110
Ms. Yu,

522
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,000
about He Qiaohui's case,

523
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,480
our client

524
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,270
is now in a difficult situation

525
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,080
and can't wait any longer.

526
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,680
Do you think it's possible to arrange the hearing as soon as possible?

527
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,340
We can't arrange it yet.

528
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,770
The summons hasn't even been served.

529
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
Isn't she in this city?

530
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,930
A few days ago, she even hired an attorney.

531
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,440
We've tried everything but still couldn't serve it.

532
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,580
She rejected our calls,

533
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,310
returned our mail,

534
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
and when we went to her place to deliver it,

535
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,730
the neighbors said they no longer live there.

536
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,160
Could you provide

537
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,240
a reliable address for delivery

538
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,720
or accurate contact information of the defendant?

539
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,400
We can't just sit back and wait.

540
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,440
How about I contact Mr. Zhou

541
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,160
to see if I can find a breakthrough?

542
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,270
That works.

543
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,650
Both of us spending so much time with Auntie Song

544
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,760
is not cost-effective.

545
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,880
How about this?

546
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,350
I'll take Auntie Song around

547
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,650
and see if we can find

548
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,230
any other addresses of He Qiaohui.

549
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,240
But we need to hurry.

550
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,550
I don't think Uncle Li

551
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,350
can wait much longer.

552
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,160
Yingzi.

553
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,920
Mr. Zhou.

554
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,550
Mr. Zhou.

555
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,480
You haven't needed me for a long time.

556
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,960
Have you forgotten me?

557
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,110
If it weren't for some urgent matters,

558
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,520
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

559
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,000
You're so busy with your business.

560
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,230
Did you find out anything about

561
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,420
what I asked you yesterday?

562
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,410
You called me over so quickly.

563
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,310
Yes, yes.

564
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,350
Have a seat.

565
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,830
Look.

566
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,420
I took a look yesterday.

567
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,810
He Qiaohui and her husband

568
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,280
are definitely shady people.

569
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,400
That Shengmao Credit of theirs is a business

570
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,920
all about charging sky-high interest rates and discounting loans.

571
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,230
The money they borrow from her

572
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,560
is all life-saving money.

573
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,860
The people she scams

574
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,580
are workers and small business owners.

575
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,160
They've scammed so many people?

576
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,680
Why don't they sue them?

577
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,680
It's lucky if she doesn't sue them.

578
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,000
She either forces them to mortgage their houses in advance

579
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,890
or has them find some close relatives

580
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
to vouch for them.

581
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,090
Who dares to sue her?

582
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,420
They might even beg her not to file a lawsuit.

583
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,480
And besides, these people don't have money.

584
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,480
They won't choose to go to court.

585
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,750
Mr. Zhou,

586
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,140
you've really helped me a lot.

587
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,810
With these materials,

588
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,750
even if they can't be used directly as evidence,

589
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,140
they'll make it easier for me to communicate with the judge in the future.

590
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,700
By the way, there's one more thing.

591
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,670
It's not urgent,

592
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,260
but I need you to keep it in mind.

593
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,510
I want to gather as much information

594
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,120
as possible about the victims.

595
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,680
It might come in handy down the road.

596
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,580
Sure, I'll ask around.

597
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,090
Could you help us check on her husband,

598
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,510
Zhou Damin?

599
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,460
We've provided some information about him in our investigation letter.

600
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,330
[Jingbei Real Estate Registration and Trading Center]

601
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,200
Okay.

602
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,110
There are two properties under Zhou Damin's name.

603
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,790
How is that possible?

604
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,000
The last time,

605
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,060
those two knelt in front of me,

606
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,110
asking me to lend them the only 500,000 I had.

607
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,620
They said they were at their wits' end

608
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,100
and didn't even have money for food.

609
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,680
Hello, Ms. Yu.

610
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,350
I'm Qiu Hua.

611
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,170
I have something to report to you.

612
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,650
He Qiaohui's husband, Zhou Damin,

613
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,330
owns two more properties.

614
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,290
I just wanted to ask if you

615
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,710
sent summonses to these two property addresses as well.

616
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,810
You mean this is the only way?

617
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,720
A public notice?

618
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,080
But with a public notice,

619
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,270
we'd at least have to wait two months.

620
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
With Auntie Song in her current situation,

621
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,350
can she afford to wait?

622
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,470
We have no choice.

623
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,570
It's all thanks to Xia Shu.

624
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,800
How about I

625
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,380
accompany Auntie Song for a couple of days?

626
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,110
It doesn't matter whether I do it or you do it.

627
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,010
I'll do it.

628
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,780
Let me do it.

629
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm suitable for running errands.

630
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,980
You're just afraid I'll take out my anger on Xia Shu.

631
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,320
I just feel for her.

632
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,060
I've been through what Xia Shu

633
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,750
is going through now before.

634
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,640
These are the taxi fares for running errands with Auntie Song.

635
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,220
Ms. Luo, please reimburse me.

636
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,900
Wait.

637
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,290
Why did you take taxis?

638
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,750
Doesn't your husband have a car?

639
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,600
Quanquan's family paid for that car.

640
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,240
If I always drive it,

641
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,570
it'll be inappropriate if my mother-in-law finds out.

642
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
What's wrong with you?

643
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,940
You two are married now,

644
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,920
and there's no prenup.

645
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,310
What's his is yours, and what's yours is his.

646
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,570
In the future, it'll be all yours.

647
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,220
I feel guilty using things

648
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,670
I didn't pay for.

649
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,410
I'm leaving for the day.

650
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,260
I'll take these blueberries with me.

651
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,920
See you tomorrow.

652
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,040
Bye.

653
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,990
160.

654
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,580
Ms. Lawyer, you're back early today.

655
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,350
Are you cooking?

656
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,560
I haven't cooked for a long time.

657
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,170
I don't know if it suits your taste.

658
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,490
Is it too hot?

659
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,440
It's salty.

660
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,090
Salty?

661
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,620
A bit salty.

662
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,160
How about I adjust it a bit?

663
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,350
It's fine, I like whatever you make.

664
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,000
Alright, then hurry and wash your hands.

665
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,990
This soup is not bad.

666
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,790
Yeah?

667
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,350
It's pretty tasty.

668
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,480
Alright, you should eat too.

669
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,830
Quanquan, I need to tell you something.

670
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,610
Go ahead.

671
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,330
I'm not working at Liangcheng Law Firm anymore.

672
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,600
What happened?

673
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,230
Liangcheng Law Firm...

674
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,490
fired me and Luo Yingzi.

675
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,400
It was right after our wedding day.

676
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,260
That's why I didn't have time to go on the honeymoon with you,

677
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,620
and why I didn't get to go back to your hometown to host the wedding banquet.

678
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,280
But now we're back on track.

679
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,350
We've opened our own law firm,

680
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,370
called Yinghua Law Firm.

681
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,400
My name's in it too.

682
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,670
Although it was tough at first,

683
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,640
we've started getting cases now.

684
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,170
It'll get better step by step.

685
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,890
Don't worry.

686
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,820
Do you consider me your family?

687
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,790
Of course I do.

688
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,540
Then why didn't you tell me such a big thing

689
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,610
the day after we got married?

690
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,360
I thought I could handle it myself,

691
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,760
so I didn't tell you.

692
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,550
Forget it.

693
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,160
I won't explain.

694
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,270
Actually,

695
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,720
I've always relied on myself since I was a child.

696
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,590
So, the more I face challenges,

697
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,100
the less I want to talk to others about it,

698
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,990
for fear that

699
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,260
I'll become a burden to them.

700
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Am I someone else?

701
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,310
I'm your husband.

702
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,550
We're going to spend our lives together.

703
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,310
I'm sorry.

704
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,480
Stop it. Let's eat.

705
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,570
Now that things have come to this,

706
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,160
let's take it one step at a time.

707
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,410
Xia Shu, you're back.

708
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,250
What happened?

709
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
Xia Shu's dad

710
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,820
was officially arrested. And then?

711
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,640
And she

712
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,000
wants to go back and be her father's attorney.

713
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,270
But her dad

714
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,750
strongly disagrees.

715
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,470
If it were me, I wouldn't agree either.

716
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,200
My dad

717
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,070
did make a huge mistake,

718
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,640
but...

719
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,730
But he's my dad.

720
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,680
He loves me.

721
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,470
Now that he's in trouble,

722
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,870
there's nothing I can do to help.

723
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,310
Xia Shu,

724
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,050
you should know

725
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,310
your own abilities.

726
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,360
Since it has already happened,

727
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,440
crying won't help.

728
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,730
You should think of a solution quickly.

729
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,310
Have you hired a lawyer?

730
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:41,840
Yes.

731
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,960
Xia Shu,

732
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,660
now you should realize that you need to work hard.

733
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,000
Your parents raised you.

734
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,680
When the family faces trouble,

735
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,670
you have to be able to support it,

736
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,370
understand?

737
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
Go wash your face.

738
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,030
Okay.

739
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,030
Qiu Hua.

740
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,030
Sit here. Let me tell you something.

741
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,110
The 800,000 yuan Xia Shu got from selling that car—

742
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,790
after paying for Auntie Song's lawsuit fees—

743
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,560
was all

744
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,640
used to

745
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,560
hire a lawyer for her father.

746
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,790
So, that means we don't have any money left.

747
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,610
As for Auntie Song's case,

748
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,870
we don't even know when the court hearing will be,

749
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,160
let alone

750
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,750
if we can make any money from it.

751
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,830
As for the case your senior introduced,

752
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,920
even if the negotiations go smoothly,

753
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,440
at most

754
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,440
we'll only get 30,000.

755
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,590
We can't keep going like this.

756
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,430
I've thought about it.

757
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,400
How about we have Xia Shu

758
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,640
handle Auntie Song's case herself?

759
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,270
In terms of work,

760
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,860
it will give her some experience,

761
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,770
and in terms of life,

762
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,750
it'll help distract her a bit

763
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,550
during this time.

764
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,200
As for us,

765
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,730
let's see if there are any other cases we can take on

766
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,690
to support ourselves.

767
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,360
Okay, no problem.

768
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,790
The car is over there.

769
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,920
It'll be yours for the next couple of days.

770
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,190
Okay.

771
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,770
Xia Shu.

772
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,270
Remember:

773
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,920
right now, you have no right to pity others.

774
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,580
You don't know how pitiful you look

775
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,370
in others' eyes.

776
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,450
As long as you catch them,

777
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,960
you must get the subpoena into their hands, no matter what.

778
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,760
Don't worry.

779
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,110
They're not kids.

780
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,290
They should know that avoiding won't solve anything.

781
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,660
I'm leaving.

782
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,120
Xia Shu.

783
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,200
You've really grown up.

784
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,320
Be careful.

785
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,270
It's this one.

786
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,090
The "for rent" sign is on it.

787
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,000
Hello, the number you dialed is not in service.

788
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,710
Please check and dial again.

789
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,740
What are you doing?

790
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
Sorry for the disruption.

791
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,570
It's not in service.

792
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,030
Who are you guys?

793
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,450
I'm from the Chengdong District People's Court.

794
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,850
Where are the people in this company?

795
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,080
I heard they were sued a couple of days ago and have run off.

796
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,960
Sir,

797
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,790
do you know how I can contact them?

798
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,790
How would I know?

799
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,380
-Is that it?
-They're coming.

800
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,440
Ms. Xia.

801
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,830
Damin.

802
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,200
I'm going in to grab something.

803
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,190
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

804
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,110
Ms. He Qiaohui!

805
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,640
We're from the People's Court!

806
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
We're here to deliver your summons!

807
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
-Don't go!
-Hurry up! Let's go!

808
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,110
Don't go!

809
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,190
You weren't there.

810
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,720
Let me tell you, that scene...

811
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,670
Young people chasing the car is one thing,

812
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,550
but she's over seventy,

813
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,640
and she was also chasing it.

814
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,030
Stop!

815
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,440
That was putting money over life!

816
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,200
I've been a lawyer for many years.

817
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,960
I've seen all kinds of people.

818
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,330
Are you alright, Auntie Song?

819
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,750
This person...

820
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,400
is really evil.

821
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,860
If you ask me,

822
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,460
it has to be Mr. Han.

823
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,750
No matter how difficult the case,

824
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,240
he can handle it.

825
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,830
But...

826
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,090
Mr. Han,

827
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,590
we can't...

828
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,310
keep hiding,

829
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,830
right?

830
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,960
It's tough for the court, and it's tough for us, too.

831
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,200
Besides,

832
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,160
if we keep hiding like this,

833
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,320
what about our business?

834
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,550
Mr. Han,

835
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,720
you told us to hide, and we did it, right?

836
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,440
But we can't keep hiding forever.

837
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,980
You've got to think of another way.

838
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,440
Well,

839
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,230
there are other ways, of course.

840
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,160
But your case

841
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,000
is very complicated.

842
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,990
Last time, I acted on my own

843
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,180
and only took 130 thousand from you.

844
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,650
The firm criticized me for that.

845
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,940
They think the case

846
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,820
is risky and difficult,

847
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,940
and they don't allow me to lower the fee.

848
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,980
Do you think

849
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,550
there's room for negotiation here?

850
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,620
Is there?

851
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,400
Well...

852
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,750
Mr. Han,

853
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,720
I was wondering why

854
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
something about you feels off.

855
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,130
Your "Yintang" looks dark.

856
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,480
What's going on?

857
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,630
Nothing.

858
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
What's "Yintang?"

859
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,240
You don't even know

860
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,160
where "Yintang" is?

861
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,030
Mr. Han, we really should believe in

862
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,160
traditional Chinese medicine.

863
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,790
For some difficult and complicated conditions,

864
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,090
Western medicine may have no solution,

865
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,330
but with three doses of Chinese medicine, it'll be effective.

866
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,420
Your "Yintang" is so dark.

867
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,020
Something bad might happen.

868
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,040
I know an old traditional Chinese medicine doctor.

869
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,330
There's no illness he can't treat.

870
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,920
How about this?

871
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,180
Please help us think of a way,

872
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,590
and when you're not busy,

873
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,830
I'll drive you

874
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
to see this old doctor

875
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,350
and have him treat you.

876
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,430
What do you think?

877
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,330
Your "Yintang."

878
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,680
I've read your defense,

879
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,090
and it can be described as unique in style.

880
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,760
I've been a lawyer for many years,

881
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,220
and I've seen all kinds of defense statements.

882
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,250
But this is my first time

883
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,270
seeing one like yours.

884
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,680
Han must be so happy and proud

885
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,940
to have you as his disciple, right?

886
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,150
Do you really think it will work?

887
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,030
Of course.

888
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,540
But Han scolded me terribly.

889
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,890
He said what I wrote was nonsense even to a dog.

890
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,290
Why does it have to make sense to a dog?

891
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,620
Why does it have to make sense to a dog?

892
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,470
Who does it have to make sense to?

893
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,400
It should...

894
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,310
make sense to the judge.

895
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,480
As long as the judge understands, that's more important than anything else.

896
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,710
Well then, I'm relieved now.

897
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,239
Tian.

898
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,000
Well...

899
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,920
In that big case you recently took on,

900
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,050
you performed so well.

901
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,280
Didn't Director Han assign you

902
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,330
the important task of preparing the defense statement?

903
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,280
Don't even mention it.

904
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,889
There's no one like him.

905
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,400
If it weren't for me having no money and no other options,

906
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
I would never take on this dirty job.

907
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,650
The client has money

908
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,730
but refuses to pay back that old lady.

909
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,199
Her husband is waiting for the money to save his life.

910
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,030
Director Han only taught them how to hide.

911
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,489
Isn't that immoral?

912
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,830
Don't you think so, Fang Rui?

913
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,800
"Immoral" is a bit too much.

914
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,230
Director Han's method

915
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,080
may not be entirely above board,

916
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,010
but...

917
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,630
it's effective.

918
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,040
Right? As lawyers,

919
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,120
giving our clients some advice

920
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,760
isn't wrong.

921
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,420
However,

922
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,040
there's another method

923
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,590
that's even more effective.

924
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,010
But this case involves a clear creditor-debtor relationship,

925
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,290
and the other party has evidence.

926
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,970
If it were you, how would you handle it?

927
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,360
Your master taught them to stall, right?

928
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,110
But no matter how long they stall, as long as the other party doesn't withdraw the lawsuit,

929
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,600
the case still has to go to trial.

930
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,750
And once it's in court, they'll lose anyway.

931
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,380
Yes.

932
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,440
So,

933
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,390
the most effective method is…

934
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,630
Mr. Han

935
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,560
can be a bit sensitive sometimes.

936
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,320
So when you talk to him and interact with him,

937
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,730
you need to be careful, got it?

938
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,270
I just learned from you.

939
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,480
Tian.

940
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,980
Mr. Han.

941
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,740
How did it go?

942
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,340
They're broke and stingy.

943
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,320
I can't make any extra money from them.

944
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,400
It's a good thing that I didn't take this case.

945
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,710
Why did it take you so long to buy food?

946
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,130
There were too many people at the restaurant you ordered from, so I had to wait in line.

947
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Why were you with them?

948
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,200
I ran into them while buying the food.

949
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,920
Mr. Chen just joined our firm and isn't familiar with things yet,

950
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,520
so I was introducing him around.

951
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,890
He's not a good person.

952
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,400
Stay away from him in the future.

953
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,800
Okay.

954
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,580
Mr. Chen.

955
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,030
Wasn't the idea you just gave Director Han

956
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,570
setting that old lady up?

957
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,440
So?

958
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,800
This is her

959
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,110
life-saving money.

960
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,840
The other party has their own lawyer.

961
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,910
Mr. Han is the lawyer for the couple.

962
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,570
So it's not wrong for him to give them advice.

963
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,110
He has to fulfill their request.

964
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,030
Tian,

965
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,900
take our two clients back.

966
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,840
Okay.

967
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,870
Wait.

968
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,920
Mr. Han,

969
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,510
you need to think of a way for us.

970
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,170
You can't let us hide forever, can you?

971
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,120
Why are you panicking?

972
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,150
Don't panic.

973
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,950
We haven't seen the old Chinese medicine doctor yet, right?

974
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,410
Here's the deal. When you get back,

975
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,150
think about what I said,

976
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,130
and let's talk later.

977
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,930
Mr. Han...

978
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,590
What's wrong with this guy?

979
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,380
Mr. Chen,

980
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,070
when you usually handle cases like this,

981
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,330
can your conscience live with it?

982
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,090
No, it can't.

983
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
So, what do you do about it?

984
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,740
Think of a way, of course.

985
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,260
Do you have a way?

986
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,690
Call me Master.

987
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,310
Now you're allowing me to call you Master?

988
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,020
Master,

989
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,920
what's your way?

990
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:16,920
If you think

991
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,460
your client is a bad person,

992
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,650
then don't sign the contract with them.

993
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,840
Just don't take the case.

994
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,880
That's it?

995
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,490
Just like this?

996
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,220
Just like this.

997
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,520
If you don't represent them, you won't feel uncomfortable.

998
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,900
Listening to you

999
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,900
is like hearing nothing at all.

1000
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,960
What's he doing?

1001
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,180
He obviously wants us to pay more.

1002
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,390
We haven't gone to court yet, and they're only asking for money.

1003
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,040
Money, money, money. We're not paying.

1004
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,940
Exactly.

1005
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,800
So, the 130,000 we gave

1006
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,890
just bought us one word: "hide," right?

1007
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,070
Do...

1008
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,300
Do we need him to teach us this?

1009
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,280
Haven't we already been hiding?

1010
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,710
You're right.

1011
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,720
Are you talking about the case just now?

1012
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,170
Mr. Tian.

1013
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,320
You've been working with Mr. Han

1014
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,390
on our case, right?

1015
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,710
What do you think?

1016
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Mr. Han only told us to hide.

1017
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,770
How long

1018
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,030
do we have to keep hiding?

1019
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,070
Exactly.

1020
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,170
How long have we been hiding?

1021
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,910
Don't worry.

1022
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,720
Actually...

1023
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:21,910
The elevator's here.

1024
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,810
Let me take you down.

1025
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,270
Okay, okay.

1026
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:25,820
Let's go.

1027
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,700
Come on.

1028
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,120
You were right.

1029
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,050
Hiding is just a temporary measure.

1030
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
But your case

1031
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,800
isn't without a solution.

1032
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,640
I can tell

1033
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,100
that you're much sharper

1034
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,880
than Mr. Han.

1035
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,150
You're young, promising, and full of drive.

1036
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,070
Tell me, what can we do?

1037
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:51,860
Divorce.

1038
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,090
Divorce.

1039
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,040
-What?
-What?

1040
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,230
Yes.

1041
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,960
Wait, it is a method.

1042
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,700
Why didn't my master think of it?

1043
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,630
Although he didn't think of it,

1044
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,880
isn't it the same that his disciple did?

1045
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,200
But...

1046
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,930
I don't know how Mr. Han

1047
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,480
would feel about

1048
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,550
you being smarter than him.

1049
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,450
Mr. Chen, you don't think I'm foolish, do you?

1050
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
I remind him?

1051
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,920
I'd rather remind the client

1052
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,420
than him.

1053
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,250
You have a bright future.

1054
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,360
You have a bright future.

1055
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,090
A fake divorce.

1056
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,640
Whose name was the money

1057
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,100
borrowed under at the time?

1058
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,840
Mine.

1059
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,510
So when you borrowed the money,

1060
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,030
were you two married then?

1061
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,030
No.

1062
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,360
Let me tell you,

1063
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,280
back then, his family was poor as dirt.

1064
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,760
Whether they were really poor or pretending to be poor, I don't know.

1065
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,630
But anyway, they were unwilling to spend a penny.

1066
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,320
They didn't even offer several tens of thousands in bride price.

1067
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,900
We were really poor.

1068
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,930
What was I thinking when I decided to marry you?

1069
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,540
Anyway, it took us a long time

1070
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,570
to finally get the marriage certificate.

1071
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,280
In that case,

1072
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,480
you should

1073
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,580
first go get the divorce

1074
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,920
and divide the assets.

1075
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,000
It's difficult to enforce pre-marriage debts.

1076
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,510
Once...

1077
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,480
everything blows over,

1078
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,300
you two can remarry.

1079
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,550
I understand now.

1080
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,190
Look at Mr. Tian.

1081
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,890
He's way better than Mr. Han

1082
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,760
you picked.

1083
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,990
As the old saying goes,

1084
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,120
the waves behind drive on the waves ahead,

1085
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,150
and the front waves—

1086
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,630
bam—

1087
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,730
get smashed on the beach.

1088
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,670
Then it's settled.

1089
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,380
We won't have Mr. Han handle it anymore.

1090
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,440
We'll hire you to handle it for us.

1091
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,710
No, no, no, that won't do.

1092
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,630
Mr. Han is my master.

1093
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,280
See? He's so loyal.

1094
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:22,790
Yes.

1095
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,630
Well,

1096
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,840
how about this?

1097
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,030
We'll have Mr. Han

1098
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,920
handle our lawsuit,

1099
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,150
and we'll entrust

1100
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,280
the fake divorce to you, okay?

1101
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,570
I'm afraid that's not possible either.

1102
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,150
A law firm

1103
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,050
can't represent both parties at the same time.

1104
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,230
Oh my.

1105
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,280
Why is it so complicated?

1106
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,090
How about this?

1107
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,000
Can you recommend a reliable lawyer for us?

1108
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,480
I know a lawyer.

1109
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,860
-I think he…
-Cut the crap.

1110
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,480
That Mr. Han you picked

1111
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,310
didn't do anything and charged us over a hundred thousand.

1112
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,280
Let me tell you,

1113
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,710
I only trust Mr. Tian.

1114
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,550
Actually, I know almost

1115
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,530
all the lawyers in the city.

1116
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,390
How about this?

1117
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,610
I'll pick one for you.

1118
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,790
You two can go back and wait for my call.

1119
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,680
Thank you.

1120
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,190
Thank you.

1121
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm counting on you.

1122
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,320
Okay, no problem.

1123
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,280
Alright, let's go.

1124
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,050
Wait a minute.

1125
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,250
Well...

1126
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,830
If we refer the case

1127
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,220
to someone else,

1128
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,840
we may need to charge a small...

1129
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,160
referral fee.

1130
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,650
Mr. Tian.

1131
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,920
I transferred 2,000 yuan to you.

1132
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,700
You're too kind.

1133
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,030
Come in.

1134
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,470
Shuo.

1135
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,570
What did you call me, Tian?

1136
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,930
Shuo.

1137
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,790
"Mr. Chen" sounds too formal.

1138
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,440
Calling you "Shuo" is more friendly.

1139
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,700
We're close, aren't we?

1140
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,500
What happened?

1141
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,440
My stomach hurts.

1142
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,210
Excuse me.

1143
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,550
Is he good?

1144
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,750
He's just a kid who hasn't grown up yet.

1145
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,350
He's definitely not as talented as you.

1146
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,210
Of course.

1147
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,590
But Shuo,

1148
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,070
you can't be too careless.

1149
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
He can prepare

1150
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,670
for exams anywhere.

1151
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,550
Why does he have to do it in your office?

1152
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,840
It's definitely because Ms. Fang doesn't trust you

1153
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,380
and arranged for him to keep an eye on you.

1154
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,040
That's not necessary.

1155
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,880
What is there to monitor about me?

1156
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,510
I'm just sitting here and working diligently.

1157
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,700
She sent me an assistant

1158
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,970
to run errands for me.

1159
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm quite comfortable.

1160
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,730
Don't say things like that.

1161
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,360
Let's get down to business.

1162
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,200
I just mentioned the fake divorce

1163
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,440
to those two clients.

1164
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,200
They agreed

1165
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,390
and even asked me to introduce a lawyer to them.

1166
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,490
But...

1167
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
Shuo, as you know,

1168
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
I don't know any other lawyers

1169
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,270
except for those at our law firm.

1170
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,780
So, could you recommend one to me?

1171
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,000
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

1172
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,860
Isn't this taking someone else's benefit?

1173
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,110
You came up with this idea.

1174
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,130
Don't say that.

1175
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,550
Shuo,

1176
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,270
you've got to recommend one to me.

1177
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,030
How about this? Once we win the case,

1178
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,340
I'll ask them for a referral fee,

1179
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
and I'll give you

1180
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,550
one-third of it.
