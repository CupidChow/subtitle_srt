[Episode 14]

3
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,039
What does it mean to say "the younger generation is formidable"?

4
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,759
I finally got to see it today.

5
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,100
Dealing with these people,

6
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,930
you have to be sharp and alert at all times.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
You're really humble, Mr. Han.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,120
Aren't you already sharp and alert?

9
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,039
I'm getting old.

10
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,370
These old arms and legs can't move like they used to.

11
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,940
I can't handle all the running around anymore.

12
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,360
I'll leave that to you, okay?

13
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll just keep an eye on them,

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,040
make sure they

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,250
don't sell us out behind our backs.

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,139
Alright, alright, it's settled then.

17
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,710
You just focus on keeping watch

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,860
the most important thing.

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,440
Then we're definitely saved.

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,700
Also, Mr. Han,

21
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,910
about hiring

22
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,310
the accounting firm,

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,610
I've thought about it again.

24
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,320
We're up against such a big group like Minghai,

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,890
and they have such strong backing.

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
We need to be extra cautious when taking them to court, right?

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,590
So, I did some research

28
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,140
about Fangzhong you mentioned. Am I right?

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,650
Fangzhong.

30
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,710
They have a bad record.

31
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,820
We can't hire them.

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,800
What's there to fear about a bad record?

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,520
No way.

34
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,820
As long as the reports they issue are accepted by the court,

35
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,940
that's all that matters.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,940
No, no, no.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,370
This case is too big.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,720
We can't afford any carelessness.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,040
Let's switch to another firm, okay?

40
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,790
But... but that won't work.

41
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,470
Hiring a big firm will cost a fortune.

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm not like you. I don't have that kind of money.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,590
I knew you'd say that.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,329
Don't worry.

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,630
I'll cover the audit fees, okay?

46
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,860
I'll take care of it.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,160
Then... then our profit split...

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,790
It will still be 70-30, okay? No changes.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
That's generous.

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,330
Since you're being so generous,

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,590
I can't drop the ball either.

52
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,060
No, let's change the split.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,790
You take 80%, I'll take 20%. 80-20, okay?

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,190
Since when did I know

55
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,360
such a kind Mr. Han?

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Are you trying to say I'm a bit of a fool?

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,590
No, no, you're being too kind.

58
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,600
Too kind, really.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,430
Actually, I really envy you.

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,960
You're so young,

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
yet you've already achieved financial freedom.

62
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,180
Not at all.

63
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,800
I still have to mortgage a property.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
Financial freedom?

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm not rich, really, Mr. Han.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,730
I'm just young,

67
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,520
a bit reckless, willing to take risks.

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,140
Youth is your capital.

69
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,980
Someone like me doesn't dare to take risks.

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,500
By the way, Mentor,

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,110
I recorded the entire conversation earlier.

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,950
If they try to break the contract in the future, we're covered.

73
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,750
This kid's really something.

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,950
He used to be the least interested in being a lawyer in our firm.

75
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,100
But after just a few days with you,

76
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,800
he's already like a completely different person.

77
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,020
Mr. Han, you're too kind.

78
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,680
Tian is also doing well, Mr. Han.

79
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,310
Mr. Chen,

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,670
we'd like to measure and take a look at the bedroom.

81
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,560
Sure, go ahead.

82
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,870
-After you go in, it's on the left.
-Alright, thank you.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,750
-Okay.
-No problem.

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,950
I'm meeting Wang tonight.

85
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,630
You're here really early.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,750
I didn't drive. Won't you drive?

87
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,800
I took the subway.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,220
Why waste two cars?

89
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,450
Bro, seriously, my sister-in-law is really lucky

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,430
marrying you.

91
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,190
You're both a devoted husband and good at managing the household.

92
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,690
Here, have some water.

93
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,480
Thanks.

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,720
Are they done yet?

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
All this measuring and taking photos,

96
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
they've been busy here for a while.

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,190
You know, my house usually doesn't have visitors.

98
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,360
This sudden activity is annoying.

99
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,490
Well, it's all self-inflicted, isn't it?

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,240
I've told you before.

101
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,340
Luo Yingzi's foreclosed house isn't even being lived in.

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,530
You could've used that as collateral, but no,

103
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,120
you had to mortgage this one instead.

104
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,659
What were you thinking?

105
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Well,

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,870
I actually went there twice.

107
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,000
I stood in that house and thought,

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,950
maybe I should just make a clean break,

109
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,950
just cut it off.

110
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,600
But in the end,

111
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,460
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

112
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,570
Do you think

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,430
I'm stuck with her for life?

114
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
You're definitely stuck with her.

115
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,020
There's something I want to ask you.

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,710
Go ahead.

117
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,560
If one day you moved into that house,

118
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,720
and everywhere you looked,

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,630
there were traces of Liu Ming,

120
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,800
wouldn't that

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,920
make you uncomfortable?

122
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,080
Wouldn't it bother you?

123
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,330
Oh, look at you, asking such a clever question.

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
Let me ask you, wouldn't it make you uncomfortable?

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,720
How would you feel?

126
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,510
It would bother me.

127
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,600
Well, it would bother me too.

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm a man. That's normal, right?

129
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,270
No matter what I do with her,

130
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,480
I wouldn't feel happy inside.

131
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,120
Exactly.

132
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,360
So, do you think Luo Yingzi

133
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,870
put some kind of spell on me?

134
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,200
It does seem like it.

135
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,000
But sometimes,

136
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,900
when I think about her now,

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
I feel concerned about her,

138
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,440
and it makes me feel happy.

139
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,560
It's nice.

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,600
Really.

141
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,230
At least you're not as careless as you used to be.

142
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,680
It's really good.

143
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I've grown, right?

144
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,280
You've grown.

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,909
Yeah, I think I'm doing pretty well too.

146
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,720
Oh, and about the agency fee for the Zhou Damin case,

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,680
I transferred half to your account.

148
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
Check it yourself.

149
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Why half?

150
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,110
Didn't we agree on 70-30?

151
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,050
You're giving me 50-50.

152
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,720
Should I accept it or not?

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,830
Bro, can you stop pretending?

154
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,830
This money is like free cash.

155
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,040
Just check it and take it.

156
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,430
Alright then,

157
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,870
I'll accept it.

158
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,600
Hit it.

159
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,450
The defense has objections to this set of evidence.

160
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,920
At the same time, I would like to remind the court that

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,930
the defendant is a congenitally deaf-mute individual.

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,770
[Defendant: Zhao Liang]

163
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,560
He dropped out of school in first grade

164
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,000
and has a severe lack of legal knowledge.

165
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,600
His ability to communicate is also extremely limited.

166
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,600
We cannot rule out the possibility

167
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
that the defendant's intended meaning

168
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,750
was not accurately conveyed due to communication errors.

169
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,620
In conclusion,

170
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,360
[Founder of Zhuoyue Law Firm: Xu Zhuo]

171
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,560
we believe that this case does not meet the standard of

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
clear facts and sufficient evidence.

173
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,680
Your Honor,

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
we request to question the witness.

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
Granted.

176
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,440
Witness Cui Jianguo,

177
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,470
on the night of the incident,

178
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,490
you were walking in the middle of Ren'ai Alley

179
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,520
when suddenly, three boys ran up from behind.

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,720
These three were committing theft in a busy area

181
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,800
and were being chased by patrolling police.

182
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,470
The boy running at the front knocked you down.

183
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,450
At that moment,

184
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,870
the defendant, Zhao Liang, happened to be walking behind you.

185
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,620
He saw you fall

186
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,060
and tried to help you up,

187
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,070
but you grabbed hold of him

188
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,070
and identified him as

189
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,680
the suspect who knocked you down. Is that correct?

190
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,440
No.

191
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,570
He's the one who knocked me down.

192
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,110
If he were the suspect,

193
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,159
why would he risk

194
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,680
being caught by the police to help you up?

195
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,490
Wouldn't that be turning himself in?

196
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,510
If he didn't knock me down,

197
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,310
why would he help me up?

198
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,950
Yes, he's the one who knocked my dad down!

199
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,510
Order in the court!

200
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,270
Your Honor,

201
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,480
my side requests to present a video

202
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,480
from the police body camera.

203
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,190
Permission granted.

204
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,270
On the night of the incident,

205
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,720
the police first chased the suspect in the downtown area.

206
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,070
When they arrived at Ren'ai Alley,

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,870
the body camera footage

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,390
only captured this scene.

209
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,190
The situation on site was very chaotic at that time.

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
The alley was very dark.

211
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,360
A young person with normal vision

212
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,560
might not be able to see clearly,

213
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,510
let alone an elderly person.

214
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,870
I can see clearly.

215
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,420
I recognize his clothes.

216
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,750
He was wearing a hooded jacket

217
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,390
with a cap on.

218
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,840
Please play the second video.

219
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,909
This is the footage from the police body camera

220
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,750
recording the pursuit of the suspect

221
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,360
in the downtown area that night.

222
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,630
This is a photo of Zhao Liang

223
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,890
being arrested on the day of the incident.

224
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,150
As you can see,

225
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,880
one of the escaping suspects

226
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,700
was wearing a hooded sweatshirt,

227
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,750
just like Zhao Liang.

228
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,760
And their body builds and ages

229
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,020
are very similar.

230
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,360
The lighting in Ren'ai Alley was very dim at that time.

231
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Based on this,

232
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,060
we have reason to suspect

233
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,820
that the witness might have confused the two individuals.

234
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,080
The witness will step down.

235
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,080
Does the defense have anything else to say?

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,750
The defendant has been under custody

237
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,960
and undergone numerous interrogations since his arrest,

238
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,000
but he is still in a state of fear

239
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,610
from being questioned and misunderstood.

240
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,470
Therefore, we hope that Zhao Liang

241
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,800
can publicly and completely state the facts of the incident.

242
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Your Honor,

243
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,780
my side requests to allow the defendant to speak for a few more words.

244
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,140
Permission granted.

245
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,010
Zhao Liang,

246
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,510
state the facts clearly to the court.

247
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,110
Trust me.

248
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,840
That night,

249
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,430
I was walking in the alley.

250
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,490
It was very dark.

251
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,510
Suddenly, three people came from behind me

252
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,510
and knocked down the elderly man.

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Then,

254
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,670
all three of them ran away.

255
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,460
I went to help the elderly man,

256
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,910
but he grabbed me tightly.

257
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,190
When the police arrived,

258
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,790
they arrested me.

259
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,000
The prosecutor presents their opinion.

260
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,890
The defendant's statement just now

261
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
does not match his previous confession

262
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,240
to the public security organs.

263
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,510
Moreover, this statement cannot serve as evidence

264
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,360
to prove that the defendant

265
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,580
did not commit the crime.

266
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
Relying solely on the defendant's previous confession

267
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,480
also cannot certify

268
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,920
that the defendant committed the crime.

269
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,170
Innocence requires evidence,

270
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,480
and guilt requires evidence as well.

271
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,430
Convicting someone

272
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,710
should not overly rely on evidence of guilt

273
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,720
while ignoring the possibility of innocence.

274
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,290
We must abide by the law and believe in the rule of law.

275
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,470
Today, the court has given the defendant

276
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,790
an opportunity to present another possibility.

277
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,160
At the same time, I also hope

278
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,860
that the court can give Zhao Liang

279
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,620
a fair verdict.

280
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,600
If it weren't for you,

281
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,080
we wouldn't be able to make our case clear at all.

282
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,150
This is our duty.

283
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Sorry,

284
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,670
we do not accept interviews.

285
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,990
Mr. Xu, hello.

286
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,610
You are...

287
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,030
This is Madam Mei's

288
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,730
recommended lawyer, Luo Yingzi,

289
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,750
Madam Mei's last disciple, Ms. Luo Yingzi.

290
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,210
Nice to meet you.

291
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,160
Mr. Xu, hello.

292
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,450
When Madam Mei told me

293
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,440
about recommending our firm

294
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,630
to join your team,

295
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,240
I was a bit confused at first.

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,610
I didn't know much about the situation.

297
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,270
But after watching your defense

298
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,240
in court just now,

299
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,440
I think if

300
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,510
we can join your team,

301
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,300
that would make us very happy.

302
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,430
Your speech in court was really fantastic.

303
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
Regarding the collaboration,

304
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,960
besides Madam Mei recommending your firm to us,

305
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,960
there are also several other firms that have expressed interest

306
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,930
in working with us.

307
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,670
I will carefully consider this matter

308
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,040
and make a decision.

309
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,550
I understand. I completely understand.

310
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,900
I was just too excited.

311
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,670
You have a lot on your plate, so I won't disturb you any further.

312
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,530
I'll take my leave now.

313
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,720
I'll wait for your message.

314
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,670
Ms. Luo.

315
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,270
I have a public legal education event on Friday

316
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,570
about communicating

317
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,170
with deaf-mute people.

318
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,990
If you and your colleagues

319
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,010
are interested and have time,

320
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,050
you can come and take a look.

321
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
That sounds great.

322
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,360
Then I'll contact Ms. Zhang.

323
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,100
No problem.

324
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,630
Mr. Xu, goodbye.

325
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,620
I hope to see you on Friday.

326
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,910
Goodbye.

327
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,130
Goodbye, Ms. Luo.

328
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,080
Mr. Xu.

329
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,290
I must bring you on board.

330
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,330
Are you saying that we might get to participate in

331
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,830
a bankruptcy case worth over a billion yuan,

332
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,150
with administrator fees exceeding ten million?

333
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,000
I find that hard to believe.

334
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,870
It's true.

335
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,560
Madam Mei recommended us,

336
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,020
but

337
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,240
it's not just us.

338
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,030
We'll be working with other teams.

339
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,950
Meaning,

340
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,040
they get the meat, and we get the soup?

341
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,000
But even with the soup,

342
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
there are still different levels of richness, right?

343
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,180
And such a good fortune falling from the sky?

344
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,240
We're not joining Fang Lihong's team, are we?

345
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,210
If it were, I'd really look down on you.

346
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,240
But considering the generous conditions

347
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,690
and substantial amount, I'll forgive you.

348
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,910
How could it be?

349
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,440
I can't be swayed wealth.

350
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
Have you heard of Zhuoyue Law Firm, run by Xu Zhuo?

351
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,840
Have you heard of Xu Zhuo?

352
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,720
Who?

353
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,950
Xu Zhuo? You've heard of him?

354
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,590
I've not only heard of him,

355
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,960
I've even attended one of Mr. Xu's classes.

356
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,670
So does that mean we'll be working with him?

357
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,490
Qiu, pinch me.

358
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,550
Is this real?

359
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,720
Stop shaking!

360
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,030
Do you have to be like this?

361
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,710
They haven't even asked us to work with them yet.

362
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,030
Besides, they're also

363
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,760
considering other firms this time.

364
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,410
Your Mr. Xu

365
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,750
only said he would consider it.

366
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,030
So don't get too excited too soon.

367
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,020
Luo, you must try your best.

368
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,090
This is Xu Zhuo, Mr. Xu,

369
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,390
my idol.

370
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,840
Qiu Hua, what's wrong with her?

371
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,420
She's gone crazy.

372
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
I still can't forget

373
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,260
his last lesson.

374
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,130
Let's make an assumption.

375
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,520
If your neighbor

376
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,920
killed your mother,

377
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,600
what would you do?

378
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,410
Call the police.

379
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Call the police.

380
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,080
Right.

381
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Revenge.

382
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,650
Right, revenge.

383
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,230
Revenge.

384
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,030
Those of you who said revenge,

385
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,250
how did you get accepted into law school?

386
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,150
Alright, let's make that assumption.

387
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,220
To seek revenge,

388
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,080
you kill his father,

389
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,350
and then he kills your brother.

390
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,320
After several rounds, there's no one left to kill.

391
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,540
Then

392
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,040
he kills your maid,

393
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,270
and the maid's family chooses revenge too.

394
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,940
From this case,

395
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,750
what is the significance of building

396
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,480
the judicial system?

397
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,120
Mr. Xu, could you please come out with me for a moment?

398
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,600
Xu Zhuo,

399
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,670
you've been reported for alleged illegal publication.

400
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,550
Please come with us to cooperate with the investigation.

401
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,140
[Summons]

402
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,650
Give me a few minutes. I'll finish the lecture.

403
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,270
You all perk up

404
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,190
when there's gossip, huh?

405
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,790
Alright, let's continue.

406
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,030
Back to this question,

407
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,240
what is the significance of building the judicial system?

408
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,370
One,

409
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
to punish criminals.

410
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,110
Two,

411
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,110
to maintain order.

412
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,120
The key is three,

413
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,160
to restrain one's impulse

414
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,970
for revenge,

415
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,140
to curb the cycle of retaliation,

416
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,840
and to establish an order

417
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,360
that prevents individuals

418
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,110
from seeking justice through private punishment.

419
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,190
It also requires us to adhere to

420
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,440
justice derived through procedural reasoning,

421
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,160
justice implemented within procedures.

422
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,610
Only in this way

423
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,390
can justice

424
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,200
go further.

425
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,440
Students,

426
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,240
today's lesson

427
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,150
ends here.

428
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,109
So, he really is a good teacher?

429
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,440
I heard he's been to jail twice.

430
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,849
How good can he be?

431
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,599
Qiu,

432
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,380
I won't allow you to talk like that about my idol.

433
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,200
It's true he's been inside twice,

434
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,530
but the court found him not guilty both times.

435
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
Who knows if he's guilty or not?

436
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,069
But in my opinion,

437
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,000
this case is still up in the air.

438
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,920
We're a newly established law firm.

439
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,590
Why would they choose us?

440
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,670
I advise you not to get your hopes up too high.

441
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,780
The bigger the hope, the bigger the disappointment.

442
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,440
Luo,

443
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
you must try your best to get this.

444
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,750
Please.

445
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,000
But today,

446
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,030
I observed his defense

447
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,790
for deaf-mute people.

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
And when we were leaving the court,

449
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,480
he invited us

450
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,260
to a public welfare event at a school

451
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,160
for the deaf this Friday.

452
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,990
I think this could be

453
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,220
a good opportunity for us.

454
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,160
So, should we go?

455
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,500
Of course we should go.

456
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,680
I might even get an autograph.

457
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,530
Qiu Hua, what do you think?

458
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,260
I'm not a fan of him as a person,

459
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,000
but if we can get

460
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,350
this big case,

461
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,290
it would be great.

462
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,030
Then let's go.

463
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,550
Instead of waiting for doom,

464
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,440
we should strike while the iron is hot.

465
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,270
Come on.

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,400
Great!

467
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,080
Seeing three beautiful ladies as soon as I arrive,

468
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,220
my mood has improved instantly.

469
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,890
Do you have to be so competitive?

470
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
Come to a bar to enjoy a drink,

471
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,790
yet you bring a laptop

472
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,830
to discuss a case?

473
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,330
Who are you extending the legal helping hand to?

474
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,460
Hey, where did you come from all of a sudden?

475
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,570
You scared us.

476
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,990
Who came from nowhere?

477
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,150
I walked in through the door rightfully.

478
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,970
Are you feeling guilty?

479
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,360
What are you plotting?

480
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,510
What we're plotting has nothing to do with you.

481
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,980
Xia Shu, pack up the laptop.

482
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,200
You're not a spy sent by Liangcheng Law Firm

483
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,120
to steal our business secrets, are you?

484
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,590
With your little insignificant case,

485
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,590
who would bother eavesdropping?

486
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,090
Come on, why is the atmosphere

487
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,700
so tense as soon as I arrive?

488
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,660
Let's talk about something meaningful.

489
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,860
I'm going to do volunteer work at a nursing home on Friday.

490
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,400
Such a positive thing.

491
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
You three beautiful ladies can't refuse, can you?

492
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,340
Come with me.

493
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,000
Volunteer work? You wouldn't do it without personal gain.

494
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,540
Are you eyeing some wealthy old lady

495
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,060
at the nursing home,

496
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,290
hoping to get her pension?

497
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,360
Why do you have such a stereotype of me?

498
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,110
If you don't believe me, come with me and see for yourself

499
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,750
if I'm after her pension.

500
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,120
Let's talk based on facts, okay?

501
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,310
Whether you're after something or not has nothing to do with me.

502
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,400
Besides, we're not interested.

503
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,290
We have plans for Friday.

504
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,590
Plans? What plans?

505
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,310
We're going to Mr. Xu Zhuo's...

506
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,740
Xia Shu.

507
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,240
She already let it slip.

508
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,110
Xu Zhuo. Which Xu Zhuo?

509
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,190
Is he the one I know?

510
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,550
The one who speaks

511
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,160
two languages besides Chinese?

512
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,030
Him? That's him?

513
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,920
Chen Shuo, take a mirror

514
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,150
and look at yourself.

515
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,600
What kind of demeanor is that?

516
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,550
What's wrong with me?

517
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,030
Besides, this bar is so big.

518
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,350
Why do you have to sit next to us?

519
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,290
I like sitting here.

520
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,890
Just move to another seat.

521
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,790
You change your expression so quickly.

522
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,450
Do you know what a judge is?

523
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,930
We're all studying law, lawyers, judges.

524
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,300
Goodbye, and don't let the door hit you on the way out.

525
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,130
Bye, Ms. Qiu.

526
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,830
You've still got that poker face even after getting married.

527
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You scared me.

528
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,200
Didn't you say that I was scary?

529
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,300
I have to fulfill my mission.

530
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,880
One whiskey, please.

531
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,270
Sure thing.

532
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,960
It's settled.

533
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,240
Okay.

534
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,000
Come on.

535
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,830
Come on.

536
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,000
Xia Shu, tell us more about Mr. Xu.

537
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,980
Mr. Xu

538
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,050
is the most wise

539
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,630
and just man I've ever met.

540
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,950
Keep your voice down.

541
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,050
And?

542
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,880
When I went to his class before,

543
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,960
I was always the first to arrive.

544
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,880
Do you know why?

545
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,970
Because Mr. Xu would arrive much earlier every time.

546
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,160
If I was the first one there,

547
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,250
I could chat with him for a bit longer

548
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,570
and ask him a few questions.

549
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
Chatting about Mr. Xu.

550
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,770
Right.

551
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,210
Mr. Xu is really graceful.

552
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,240
Thank you all.

553
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,160
Thank you all.

554
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,590
Here he comes.

555
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,160
Mr. Xu,

556
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,110
Ms. Luo, thank you for coming.

557
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,920
You're too kind.

558
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,880
Let me introduce you.

559
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
This is Qiu Hua,

560
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,070
the founding partner of our firm.

561
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,960
Nice to meet you.

562
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,750
Nice to meet you, Ms. Qiu.

563
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,030
Are you also Madam Mei's student?

564
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,230
I'm not.

565
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,640
This is Xia...

566
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,550
Mr. Xu, I'm Xia Shu.

567
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,510
I attended your class.

568
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,510
Do you remember me?

569
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,080
Hi.

570
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,760
Can I take a photo with you?

571
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,850
Xia Shu, you...

572
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,800
It's okay. Come on.

573
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,410
Can you take a photo for us?

574
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,470
I'm not good at it. You take it for her.

575
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,160
I don't know how to use this.

576
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,110
Click this.

577
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,870
Got it. Come here.

578
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,690
Xia Shu, come back.

579
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,720
Mr. Xu,

580
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,480
we want to talk to you about

581
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,880
the Wanhe case.

582
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,250
Do you have a moment now?

583
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,510
Sure, let's chat over here.

584
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,550
Great, thank you.

585
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,720
Can you sign an autograph for me later?

586
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,350
Xia Shu.

587
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,890
[Wanhe Group Asset Appraisal]

588
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Regarding this case,

589
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
there's nothing more to say, right?

590
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,510
We're determined to win it.

591
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Look at the other firms competing.

592
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
They're not even comparable to us.

593
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
If we lose,

594
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,680
it will truly be a shame for us.

595
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,850
I've looked at the other firms.

596
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,750
Indeed,

597
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
they're not a competition for us.

598
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,900
But there's one person we shouldn't underestimate.

599
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,200
You mean Xu Zhuo?

600
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,920
Although Xu Zhuo's Zhuoyue Law Firm is relatively small,

601
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,470
we do know him well.

602
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,010
He's decisive and ruthless.

603
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,850
Another thing we need to note

604
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,310
is the presiding judge of this case

605
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,680
once presided over

606
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,620
the trial of Xu Zhuo's second case

607
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
and acquitted him personally.

608
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,250
Of course,

609
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,680
we have no evidence to suggest

610
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,900
that the judge will be biased towards him because of that,

611
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,720
but he definitely made a strong impression on him.

612
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,830
If our firm

613
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,640
takes on this major case,

614
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,390
will we still have the capacity to handle other cases?

615
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,680
What if we collaborate with Xu Zhuo's Zhuoyue Law Firm

616
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,600
to jointly compete for the appointment?

617
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,820
Absolutely not.

618
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,200
For this bid,

619
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,640
we must defeat all our opponents.

620
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,800
It's not just because the case value is high,

621
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,340
but mainly because

622
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,330
if we participate,

623
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,330
we must win.

624
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,530
This time,

625
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,960
Tao Zheng will lead the team.

626
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,140
Tao Zheng.

627
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,210
You have full discretion over all lawyers in the firm.

628
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,470
No exceptions.

629
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,300
Okay.

630
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,110
Mr. Xu, this is one of the cases

631
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,070
we handled before.

632
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,720
It's a patent litigation case

633
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,660
involving very specialized knowledge

634
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,280
such as two-position three-way solenoid valves.

635
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,480
Before this,

636
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,960
Qiu Hua and I

637
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,270
knew nothing

638
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,480
about electrical components.

639
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,670
But through our efforts,

640
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,340
we still won the case.

641
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,920
What I'm trying to say is,

642
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,720
we haven't handled

643
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,230
bankruptcy cases before either,

644
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,160
but I have full confidence in us.

645
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,950
Right, Qiu Hua?

646
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,620
Yes.

647
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,920
After we left Liangcheng Law Firm,

648
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,200
Mr. Dong from the patent case came to see us several times,

649
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,550
wanting to take the mandate away from Liangcheng Law Firm

650
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,920
and give it to us to continue.

651
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,850
Please trust in our abilities as well.

652
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,070
I don't doubt your abilities,

653
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,030
but serving as a bankruptcy administrator,

654
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,920
especially for

655
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,950
a large company like Wanhe,

656
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,250
is a complex and arduous process.

657
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,070
When choosing a partner,

658
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,830
we must consider carefully.

659
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,400
I have to be responsible for the rights of all parties involved.

660
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,990
I completely understand.

661
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,230
Our firm is still young.

662
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,070
Although we don't have the qualification to serve as administrators yet,

663
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,030
if you are willing

664
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,680
to give us a chance

665
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,830
to learn from you,

666
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,920
we are also willing to

667
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,510
cede some of our interests.

668
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,980
Excuse me,

669
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,310
Mr. Xu. They're ready for the interview over there.

670
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,310
I understand

671
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,590
your intention.

672
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,310
Regardless of the outcome,

673
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,350
I will notify you as soon as possible, okay?

674
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay.

675
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,850
Alright.

676
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,610
Thank you for coming.

677
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,670
-Goodbye, Mr. Xu.
-Thank you.

678
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,270
Thank you.

679
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,060
Goodbye. Mr. Xu.

680
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,240
Shall we go?

681
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Let's go.

682
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,900
Do you still want this file bag?

683
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,920
Of course.

684
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,110
We're still in the startup phase and need to spend wisely.

685
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,800
You do realize we're in the startup phase, right?

686
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,830
And yet you still want to cede interests to someone else.

687
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
You have to spend money to make money.

688
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,450
Xia Shu,

689
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,690
your eyes are on him?

690
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,820
Let's go.

691
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,840
But ultimately, we must advocate for

692
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,540
and educate the deaf community.

693
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,550
It hasn't been released yet.

694
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,160
It will be.

695
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,480
The conversation's going well.

696
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,590
-Are you going to watch a movie together?
-Mr. Chen.

697
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,340
We still need to make arrangements.

698
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,840
You're dressed quite colorfully today.

699
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,750
It's not okay?

700
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,590
It's fine.

701
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,790
Has the contract with Dadao Accounting Firm

702
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,710
arrived yet?

703
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,290
I've looked over the contract.

704
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,600
The commission fee is quite high.

705
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,070
The first payment is 70% upfront.

706
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,510
Well, you get what you pay for.

707
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,920
It's definitely better than the unreliable company

708
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,290
Han recommended.

709
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Mr. Han...

710
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,960
He isn't paying a single cent.

711
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,490
You'll never run out of money to make.

712
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Why are young people so calculative?

713
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,710
Besides,

714
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,690
do you really think the firm sent Mr. Han here

715
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,440
just to co-represent this case with me?

716
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,530
And you still play along with him?

717
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,490
Why wouldn't I?

718
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,160
Mr. Han is so interesting. I like him.

719
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,610
Being with him is fun.

720
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,370
All the partners are here.

721
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,750
What kind of meeting is this?

722
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,680
I don't know.

723
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,720
You never know anything.

724
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
You're just chatting with people over there.

725
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,710
I knew it.

726
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,480
Whenever there's good news, Tao Zheng is involved.

727
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,220
If the firm keeps going like this, it's doomed.

728
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,710
The case wasn't assigned to you?

729
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,620
Nor to you.

730
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,240
Mr. Han, you've got the Mingshan case.

731
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,170
20% of it.

732
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,160
Can't you be a bit more generous?

733
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,510
That's just a pie in the sky.

734
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,730
I can see it, but I can't eat it.

735
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,210
Let's see if you can eat it or not.

736
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,070
It's been a while since we've had a proper chat.

737
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,400
Let's find some time to grab a drink.

738
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,750
I just thought, since you

739
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,400
just took on a big case,

740
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,350
I didn't want to bother you.

741
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,940
With your status now...

742
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,440
What status?

743
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,640
Are you trying to flatter me to death?

744
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,190
I'm just saying, going to a street-side stall now

745
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,350
might not be appropriate.

746
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,790
So you want to go somewhere fancy, huh?

747
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,830
You pick, okay?

748
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,140
Alright, alright, I'll choose.

749
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,100
You're just laughing.

750
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,170
Earlier, I saw so many partners

751
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
rushing downstairs like that.

752
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,510
What kind of meeting was it?

753
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
You don't know?

754
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,030
I just got back.

755
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Our firm

756
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,070
is competing for a big case.

757
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,200
The bankruptcy liquidation case of Wanhe Group.

758
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
That's a lucrative deal.

759
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm sure many law firms are eyeing it.

760
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,870
That's why today,

761
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,410
all the capable partners in our firm showed up.

762
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,320
But from what I've heard,

763
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,320
the only real competitor we have

764
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,180
is Zhuoyue Law Firm.

765
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,370
The others are just there to make up the numbers, no chance.

766
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,910
You don't understand.

767
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,920
In situations like this,

768
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
many small law firms will team up

769
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,750
to compete for the appointment.

770
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,120
They can actually be quite competitive.

771
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,960
Really?

772
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,020
Of course.

773
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,940
What firm did you mention earlier?

774
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,430
Zhuoyue Law Firm.

775
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,700
Zhuoyue Law Firm?

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
Their boss is Xu Zhuo.

777
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,110
We will go to Mr. Xu Zhuo's...

778
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,760
Xia Shu.

779
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,620
I heard he's been in jail.

780
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,100
Twice.

781
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,460
And divorced three times.

782
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,270
No way.

783
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,390
The whole industry knows.

784
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,710
Shuo,

785
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,620
when are we going out to eat?

786
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,720
You arrange it, I'll pay.

787
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,510
I've looked into this case.

788
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,030
Several law firms are competing for it right now.

789
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,030
Zhuoyue is just one of them,

790
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,590
and actually the smallest one.

791
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,160
Zhuoyue is small?

792
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,550
That's why I think this is also

793
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,160
the reason they're looking for external support.

794
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,490
There's another law firm

795
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,720
you're very familiar with.

796
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,240
If I'm very familiar with it,

797
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,750
I'm sure you are too.

798
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,660
Xia Shu, what is it?

799
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,850
Liangcheng Law Firm?

800
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,750
Yes. So, I don't think

801
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,350
you should get your hopes up too high.

802
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,740
Even if Xu Zhuo wants to use us,

803
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,920
we might not be able to compete with others.

804
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,040
At least we've tried our best.

805
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,310
We'll do our best and leave it to fate.

806
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,740
But we still need to fight for it.

807
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,910
I didn't even get his autograph today.

808
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,920
Xia Shu,

809
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,570
Ms. Xia.

810
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,680
Can you please act like a lawyer?

811
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,960
If I hadn't stopped you today,

812
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,490
you would have literally jumped on him.

813
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,750
He's married. Is that appropriate?

814
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,590
Don't talk nonsense.

815
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,440
Mr. Xu is probably still single.

816
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,310
He's at that age,

817
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,200
still single?

818
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,700
He was married, but divorced.

819
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,280
To be exact, divorced three times.

820
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,630
Three times? He must be rich.

821
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,480
How much does he give in each divorce?

822
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,310
What a scumbag, a player!

823
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,880
Sounds like "sea turtle" in Chinese!

824
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,670
No, no.

825
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,610
Sea turtle?

826
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,330
No, listen to me.

827
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,850
I saw it in the news.

828
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,310
Mr. Xu

829
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,570
had three wives before.

830
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,590
The first two

831
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,200
divorced him

832
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,440
when he was in jail.

833
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,910
After he got out,

834
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,370
he didn't complain about his ex-wives at all.

835
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,360
After he made a comeback,

836
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,000
he even gave them financial compensation

837
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,970
and support

838
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,440
to make up for the fright and harm

839
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,550
they suffered

840
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,380
when they were with him.

841
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,110
Every time the two ex-wives mention Mr. Xu,

842
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,210
they express longing and regret.

843
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,130
Regret?

844
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,780
Maybe they didn't get enough money in the divorce.

845
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,380
Later, he had a third wife

846
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,800
and they were very happy.

847
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,540
But they still ended up divorced.

848
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,440
He also expressed blessings and apologies

849
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,200
to his third wife,

850
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,160
saying that she had suffered with him.

851
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
He was so obsessive.

852
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,400
You must have some misunderstanding about obsession.

853
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,710
It's not like what you think.

854
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,640
Luo.

855
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,880
Drop me off

856
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,860
at the next intersection, okay?

857
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,680
I have an appointment with a friend.

858
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,030
A friend?

859
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,240
A female friend or...

860
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,750
A female elder.

861
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,720
I didn't say it's a male.

862
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,240
So it's not a boyfriend.

863
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,020
We feel sorry and reluctant for you.

864
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,900
I don't need a man!

865
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,620
You're still too young, Xia Shu.

866
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,330
You spoke too soon.

867
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,220
You want to see me?

868
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,920
What do you think

869
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,970
about the Wanhe case?

870
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,240
Haven't we talked about it before?

871
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,250
We will win it.

872
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,990
Among the law firms competing for it,

873
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,410
Xu Zhuo's Zhuoyue Law Firm

874
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,160
is the biggest competitor.

875
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Plus, the presiding judge

876
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,270
is the one who acquitted him

877
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,640
in his second case.

878
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,940
He has a better

879
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,330
and deeper impression of Xu Zhuo

880
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,680
than us.

881
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,860
It's not good for us.

882
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,480
Their firm is small.

883
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,240
They can't handle such a big case alone.

884
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,030
I think

885
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,970
they'll look for external help

886
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,060
to expand their team.

887
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Then the situation will be different.

888
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,140
So we need to think of a way

889
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,120
to exclude Xu Zhuo's team and his firm

890
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,270
from our competitors from the beginning.

891
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
How can we?

892
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,060
The court accepts public registration.

893
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,640
If they want to register,

894
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,750
how can we stop them?

895
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,080
So, you mean

896
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,240
the court has already issued an announcement.

897
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
The presiding judge can't be changed, right?

898
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,030
Of course.

899
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,550
Actually,

900
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,400
when the presiding judge acquitted Xu Zhuo

901
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,660
in his second case,

902
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,750
there was quite a bit of controversy.

903
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,310
Even now, some people

904
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,420
are still upset about it.

905
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,550
What do you mean?

906
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,190
Try to come up with a solution.

907
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,220
As you know,

908
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
the court is strict

909
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,380
with anti-corruption now.

910
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,630
I believe the judge

911
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,210
knows how to avoid suspicion.

912
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,680
Right?

913
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,970
Mr. Xu.

914
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,140
The terms of Fangyuan Law Firm are too excessive.

915
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,990
Their scale is bigger than ours.

916
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,010
Regarding benefits,

917
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,770
I think we can make some concessions.

918
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,200
But they can't force you

919
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,480
to give up the position

920
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,240
of the team leader.

921
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,550
Mr. Xu.

922
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,810
You must not compromise on this.

923
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,030
We can say that the court's competitive selection conference

924
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,930
will start soon.

925
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,510
It's too late to make changes.

926
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,180
You know the personality of Mr. Jiang

927
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,400
from their firm.

928
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,240
He's not the type to be subordinate to others.

929
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,720
Once he's selected,

930
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,270
he might act high and mighty.

931
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,060
What if we talk to Weipeng Law Firm again?

932
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,470
What's the point of talking to them?

933
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,630
Relying on other firms' interest in them,

934
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,550
they asked for a 60% share

935
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,690
from us right away.

936
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,520
It's obvious that they didn't give Mr. Xu any face.

937
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,200
Neither Fangyuan nor Weipeng will work.

938
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
Then who else can we talk to?

939
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,940
Zhang,

940
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,830
Help me find some case materials.

941
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,550
All the cases handled

942
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,690
by Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua.

943
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,640
As detailed as possible.

944
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,020
Okay, I'll do it when I get back.

945
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,830
I just got to the doorway.

946
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,510
On the right?

947
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,240
Xia Shu,

948
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,880
Over here.

949
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,980
Sister Zhang Lan,

950
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,750
I haven't seen you in ages.

951
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,030
How have you been?

952
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,420
When did you come back?

953
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,720
Not long ago.

954
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,950
You've changed. You look more mature.

955
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,940
Come, sit down first.

956
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,830
Thank you.

957
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,920
How's your father's case?

958
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,200
It was indicted a few days ago.

959
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,990
The lawyer said

960
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,940
he might face more than ten years in prison.

961
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,639
[Zhang Lan]

962
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,260
I studied law.

963
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,230
I know the laws by heart.

964
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,590
But when my dad got into trouble,

965
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,550
I couldn't help him at all.

966
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,150
Giving your father's case

967
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,880
to the most capable lawyer

968
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,210
is the biggest help for him.

969
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,630
Seeing you like this,

970
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,300
I feel more at ease.

971
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,840
Sister Zhang Lan, why did you come back this time?

972
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,480
I came back to visit my family.

973
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,460
My parents are getting older,

974
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,110
so I have to come back often.

975
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,440
I came to see you today

976
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,750
because there's another matter.

977
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,070
What is it?

978
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
Our family

979
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,400
has been acquaintances with Mr. Hao of Xincheng Mining Group for generations.

980
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,670
I have shares in their company.

981
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,210
Before I went abroad, I sold some of them.

982
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,170
Now I still have 2% left.

983
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm a small shareholder of their company.

984
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,510
The reason I came to see you today

985
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,920
is that Mr. Hao's son

986
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,630
has encountered some legal issues.

987
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,260
So I want to ask for your help.

988
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
Thank you.

989
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,640
What issues did he encounter?

990
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,210
Mr. Hao has a son named Hao Lei.

991
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,680
He's around your age.

992
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,770
But the difference is

993
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,320
his father is a businessman.

994
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,760
He owns a mine

995
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,140
and a mining machinery factory.

996
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,360
Let's just say he's a wealthy man.

997
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,410
Hao Lei is a rich second-generation,

998
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,950
so he's very playful and doesn't study hard.

999
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,590
Later, his father

1000
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,480
sent him abroad to study.

1001
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,010
He's indeed a bit like me.

1002
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,550
Our families have always had business dealings.

1003
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,230
Hao Lei is someone I've watched grow up since childhood.

1004
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,000
So after he went abroad,

1005
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,840
his father entrusted him to me.

1006
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,280
He stayed with our family.

1007
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,190
He's lived very freely

1008
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,590
abroad these years.

1009
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,000
I thought he'd probably mess around for the rest of his life.

1010
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,880
But unexpectedly,

1011
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,320
his father suddenly passed away.

1012
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,390
You're back.

1013
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,550
Lei.

1014
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,620
Your dad passed away suddenly.

1015
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,690
But he didn't suffer much.

1016
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,660
He passed away peacefully.

1017
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,850
Thank you. Thank you.

1018
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,570
Thank you.

1019
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,400
Hao Lei doesn't understand what happened.

1020
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,360
Yet his eldest uncle and third uncle

1021
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,050
have already made arrangements for his fate.

1022
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,630
After Mr. Hao died,

1023
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,340
the two brothers wanted to seize the power?

1024
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,360
That's right.

1025
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,230
His two brothers

1026
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,230
grew up in the countryside.

1027
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,030
Their vision, abilities, and outlook

1028
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,170
are far inferior to those of Mr. Hao.

1029
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Suddenly, such a huge amount of assets

1030
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,810
was handed to them.

1031
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,040
Of course, they have bad intentions.

1032
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,000
Lei,

1033
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,470
after handling your dad's funeral arrangements,

1034
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,720
you

1035
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,190
should go back to the US

1036
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,800
to continue your studies.

1037
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,570
Your dad's biggest wish before he passed

1038
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,850
was for our Hao family

1039
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,940
to have a college graduate, right?

1040
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,370
To defy fate.

1041
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,180
Right.

1042
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,870
Your dad would be very happy to know this,

1043
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,980
wouldn't he?

1044
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,590
You can study whatever you want.

1045
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,580
After graduating from college, you can continue to

1046
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,680
pursue a master's, a doctorate,

1047
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,290
and even a postdoctoral degree.

1048
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,480
We'll support you

1049
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,560
no matter how far you go in your studies.

1050
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,670
Money is not a problem.

1051
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,090
Lei, don't worry.

1052
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,370
Everything will remain the same as when your dad was around.

1053
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,440
Sister-in-law, don't worry either.

1054
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,190
When you feel better,

1055
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,330
we'll buy you a villa

1056
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,410
in a picturesque place

1057
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,640
and hire some people to take good care of you.

1058
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,630
Lei

1059
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,940
will study there peacefully.

1060
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,950
Even if Hao Lei is naive,

1061
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,180
he understood their meaning.

1062
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
His uncles meant that

1063
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,660
this family business would belong to them from now on.

1064
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,150
Hao Lei and his mother

1065
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,520
would be supported by them.

1066
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,210
So Hao Lei decided

1067
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,460
to stay in the country and not go back.

1068
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,280
Your uncles have proposed

1069
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,880
to buy out my shares and those of the other

1070
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,070
three minority shareholders.

1071
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,740
They each now

1072
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,350
hold 20% of the shares.

1073
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,150
If they add

1074
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,000
the 11% held by me

1075
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,030
and the other three minority shareholders,

1076
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,550
[Uncle Liang, Deputy Director of Xincheng Mining Group]

1077
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,420
Isn't it obvious

1078
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,510
that they want to become the controlling shareholders?

1079
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,710
They want to kick me out.

1080
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,710
About the other three minority shareholders,

1081
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,820
besides Directors Yang and Ma,

1082
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,860
there's also Zhang Lan.

1083
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,110
The agreement for share transfer has already been presented.

1084
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,630
Didn't you know about this?

1085
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,440
I... I didn't know.

1086
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,120
So what are they going to do

1087
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,310
with my dad's shares?

1088
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,560
They didn't tell you?

1089
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,480
But your eldest uncle told me that

1090
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,480
they would hold them on your behalf.

1091
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,030
Uncle Liang.

1092
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,230
I don't plan to go back to the US.

1093
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,820
My dad is gone,

1094
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,010
but someone has to inherit his business.

1095
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,170
I'm back to take over his work.

1096
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,820
And you shouldn't leave either.

1097
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,480
Together, our shares

1098
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,630
add up to 49%.

1099
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,160
If we can win over one more shareholder,

1100
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,590
we'll still have a say in the company.

1101
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,720
You want to be the chairman, huh?

1102
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,590
Yes.

1103
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,270
Taking over your dad's business

1104
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,550
won't be easy.

1105
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,070
It won't be easy, but I'll take it.

1106
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,440
As long as you support me,

1107
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,030
I'm confident.

1108
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,630
Lei,

1109
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,280
your dad and I

1110
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,470
have been together for over ten years.

1111
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,960
In terms of both sentiment and reason,

1112
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,170
I shouldn't refuse you.

1113
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,600
But

1114
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,500
business is like a battlefield.

1115
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,040
Personal relationship is important,

1116
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,800
but the company is more important.

1117
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,490
Can you shoulder the responsibilities of running this company?

1118
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,270
As long as you support me,

1119
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,360
I'm confident.

1120
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,410
Confidence isn't just words.

1121
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,880
How about this?

1122
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,160
If you can keep the company afloat

1123
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,150
and win over other shareholders

1124
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,570
before the shareholders' meeting,

1125
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,000
then I'll work with you.

1126
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,450
Deal.

1127
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,080
Although Hao Lei is like my younger brother,

1128
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,360
if I sell my shares to him in the future,

1129
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,590
we'll have to be clear about the accounts.

1130
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,190
On the one hand,

1131
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm worried that if I give him my shares,

1132
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,360
he might lose everything for me.

1133
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,110
On the other hand,

1134
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,090
I want to see

1135
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,110
what he can accomplish

1136
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,190
in these three months.

1137
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,000
Xincheng Mining has a high total assessed value,

1138
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,190
with mining rights, exploration rights, and various equipment

1139
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,550
worth over a billion yuan.

1140
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,150
But the key is whether it can be liquidated.

1141
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,090
If it can't, it's worthless.

1142
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,590
You see things clearly.

1143
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,280
The company has been supported

1144
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,340
by Mr. Hao for so many years.

1145
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,230
Now that he's passed away,

1146
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,190
the company's business has stagnated,

1147
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,030
and many long-time clients

1148
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,800
have switched sides.

1149
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,840
Even if Hao Lei is naive,

1150
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,070
he knows that developing the company's business

1151
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,000
and stabilizing morale are the most important things now.

1152
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,340
But he's just a playboy.

1153
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,090
He doesn't understand business at all.

1154
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,230
So, in such a situation,

1155
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,030
he hastily sold some mining equipment.

1156
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,150
Unexpectedly,

1157
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,550
after the goods were delivered,

1158
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,880
not a single company paid for them.

1159
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,320
The company was already unstable,

1160
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,320
and now it's in an even worse situation.

1161
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,550
His uncles,

1162
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,840
who were silent before,

1163
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,720
took advantage of his mistake

1164
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,710
and accused him of being incompetent,

1165
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,700
forcing him to hand over power.

1166
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,710
When my dad first passed away,

1167
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,410
those who relied on him before

1168
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,050
ran away faster than anyone else.

1169
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,380
So Hao Lei's top priority now

1170
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,190
is to clean up the mess

1171
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,960
he created as soon as possible.

1172
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,190
Those payments,

1173
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,670
if they can be recovered, should be recovered immediately.

1174
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,040
That way,

1175
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,630
he can prove himself

1176
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,920
to Uncle Liang,

1177
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,800
his uncles,

1178
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,960
and everyone else.

1179
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,590
So now,

1180
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,670
he desperately needs someone

1181
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,440
who can help him in a short period.

1182
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
He came to me,

1183
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
hoping I could recommend some lawyers to him.

1184
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,730
I recommended you.

1185
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,210
What can I do to help him?

1186
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,660
Of course, I hope

1187
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,810
you can be the legal advisor for his company.

1188
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,090
But the top priority now

1189
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,330
is to help him collect debts.

1190
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,640
Can you do it?

1191
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,320
I can.
