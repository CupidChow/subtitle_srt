[Episode 22]

3
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,990
You wanted to see me?

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,270
Come in.

5
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,200
Chen Shuo and Mingshan Group

6
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,650
have set up a joint account,

7
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,520
but the account privileges are on our side.

8
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,700
In fact,

9
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,810
this account belongs to our Liangcheng Law Firm.

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,650
Did you know about this?

11
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,920
No, I didn't.

12
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,130
I...

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,640
Well.

14
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,310
Mr. Fang,

15
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,320
just pretend I don't know.

16
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,650
I have other things to do. I'll go now.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,470
Stop.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,710
Come back.

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,930
Why are you running away so fast?

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,180
What are you afraid of?

21
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,230
I don't have anything particular to say.

22
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,180
I just wanted to tell you.

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,710
Well, why are you telling me?

24
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,150
I don't want to know.

25
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,120
Ms. Fang.

26
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,520
Why did you

27
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,500
want to tell me about it?

28
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,660
Because of your negligence.

29
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,490
I assigned you to this case,

30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,690
what did I tell you?

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,130
You need to handle it properly

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,400
and keep a close eye on Chen Shuo.

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,690
Now he's pulling these stunts behind our backs,

34
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,690
and you didn't notice anything.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,890
How were you supervising him, Han?

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,430
Well, you know

37
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,100
how cunning that guy is.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,360
I can't guard against him on everything.

39
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,270
Is he more cunning than you?

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,770
Well...

41
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,390
You're actually telling me that he's cunning?

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,700
No, Ms. Fang.

43
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,920
If you knew there was a risk with this joint account,

44
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,930
you should have stopped him directly

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,280
instead of telling me.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,670
Why should I stop him?

47
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,890
When Chen Shuo took this case,

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,670
he promised

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,010
to bear the risks himself

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,880
and pay for the upfront costs.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,520
Obviously,

52
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,560
Mingshan is trying to set us up.

53
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,320
I think it's a good idea

54
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,940
to let Chen Shuo

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,160
handle them.

56
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,790
It has nothing to do with our Liangcheng Law Firm, right?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,790
Right,

58
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
it has nothing to do with our firm.

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,980
And it has even less to do with me, right?

60
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,250
How can it have nothing to do with you?

61
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,760
Don't you get a 20% commission?

62
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,030
You don't want it anymore?

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,170
Ms. Fang.

64
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,480
Well, Fang, you can't do this to me.

65
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,480
You didn't let me participate

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,140
in the Wanhe project,

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,450
which is such a great opportunity,

68
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,170
but you're forcing me

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,030
into this risky case.

70
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,680
That's just not fair.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,450
The benefits of the Mingshan Group case are enormous.

72
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
You can count on your fingers.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,670
Isn't this case enough for you to live on for a year?

74
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,850
Do you know how many people in the firm are eyeing this case?

75
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,450
And you're still not satisfied?

76
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,410
Actually, I called you here today

77
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,190
to tell you

78
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,970
that Chen Shuo is too bold.

79
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,550
I'm afraid he might do something

80
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,130
that will bring risks to our firm.

81
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,659
So,

82
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,320
you must keep a close eye on him.

83
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,960
The firm relies on you.

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,290
Don't you understand?

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,870
Of course, I understand.

86
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,620
Chen Shuo, what are you thinking?

87
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
With the Mingshan case

88
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,870
giving us so many headaches,

89
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,460
why are you involving yourself in Wanhe now?

90
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,540
What's your motive?

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,050
It's all for Luo Yingzi?

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,880
Out of my own curiosity.

93
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,670
The more they don't want me to participate,

94
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,220
the more I want to know why.

95
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,150
Why don't they want me to participate?

96
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,470
Something's going on here.

97
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,000
They don't want you to know.

98
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,600
Today, I specifically mentioned

99
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,010
the Zhucheng Case to Tao Zheng.

100
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,430
He didn't even respond.

101
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,000
I guess he's afraid I'll find out

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,010
what's really going on.

103
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,570
Do you know where I'm heading now?

104
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,970
I'm going to see the boss of Zhucheng Group

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,060
to ask him why.

106
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,350
Pretty smart of me, huh?

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,210
Be careful.

108
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,020
Safety first.

109
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,250
Alright, I gotta go.

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,490
This is ridiculous.

111
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,659
Boss, someone's here to see you.

112
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,270
Thanks.

113
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,730
Mr. Yu.

114
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,070
Who are you?

115
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,490
Mr. Yu, I've heard so much about you.

116
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,330
Nice to meet you.

117
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,740
My name is Chen Shuo. I'm a lawyer.

118
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,120
A lawyer?

119
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,730
What do you want with me?

120
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,940
Mr. Yu, you used to be the CEO of Zhucheng Group, right?

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,340
Just tell me what it's about.

122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Well,

123
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,490
I've heard about some of your past experiences,

124
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,710
and you've been through a lot.

125
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,960
[Former CEO of Zhucheng Group, Yu Cheng]

126
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,170
What exactly do you want with me?

127
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,710
Do you know Mei Daliang?

128
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,950
The lawyer?

129
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,159
Yes, the lawyer.

130
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,130
Because of your case,

131
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,970
she's also suffered a lot

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
and it's been really tough for her.

133
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,380
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,090
Whether she's suffered or not

135
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,450
has nothing to do with my case.

136
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,450
It may not seem related on the surface,

137
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,650
but as we talk,

138
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,880
it might become relevant.

139
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,870
Mr. Yu,

140
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,950
I'm here today

141
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,600
to ask you about

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,310
the events of the Zhucheng Case back then.

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
Who exactly are you,

144
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,050
and why are you concerned about my case?

145
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,750
Which law firm do you represent?

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,350
Liangcheng Law Firm.

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,160
What firm?

148
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,830
Liangcheng Law Firm.

149
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,880
Liangcheng Law Firm?

150
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,710
Right.

151
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,380
What do you want?

152
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,970
You took my company and put me in jail.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,750
Is that still not enough for you?

154
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,950
What more do you want?

155
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,150
Get out of here right now.

156
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,920
I haven't been at Liangcheng for long.

157
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,700
No, no, no.

158
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,920
Look.

159
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,030
Security, escort him out!

160
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,270
Mr. Yu, this happened a long time ago.

161
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,950
Are you leaving or not? Security!

162
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,870
Let's sit down and talk properly.

163
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,870
Why don't we sit down and chat?

164
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,360
No. Security!

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,720
Hurry up.

166
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,950
I can leave by myself, you guys...

167
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,240
Don't waste time, just go.

168
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm a lawyer, come on.

169
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,300
So what if you're a lawyer? Get out.

170
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,440
Hey, you guys.

171
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,800
Do you have to be this harsh?

172
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,680
What's the grudge?

173
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,710
What did Fang Lihong do?

174
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,790
Mr. Chen.

175
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,750
Mr. Yang, what are you doing here?

176
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,870
Have you made progress?

177
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
I came here for this very reason.

178
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,660
They could have declined our case,

179
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,170
but they can't treat us like this.

180
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
What did they do?

181
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,810
Ms. Xia from their firm

182
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,480
gave Nannan's contact information

183
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,870
to one of her classmates,

184
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,420
leading them to find Nannan.

185
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,250
Many people called and insulted her.

186
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,010
Xia Shu?

187
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,920
Isn't that stupid? What was she thinking?

188
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,360
Forget it.

189
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll call them.

190
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,700
We'll give up.

191
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,169
We'll just consider ourselves unlucky.

192
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,799
Nannan already told them to terminate the agreement,

193
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,190
but they won't agree.

194
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,870
Mr. Chen, please tell them for us

195
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,490
that we're terminating the agreement.

196
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,710
The money we paid,

197
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,740
we don't want it back.

198
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,770
Mr. Yang,

199
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,070
it's not just about the money.

200
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,670
You can let it go, but I can't.

201
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,870
I introduced this case,

202
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,080
and I have to see it through to the end.

203
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,030
Alright,

204
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,830
don't worry too much or get too angry.

205
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,790
Wait for my news,

206
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,750
and I'll give you an answer.

207
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,340
Alright, I trust you.

208
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,770
I'm really sorry about this.

209
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,910
Wait for my news.

210
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,200
Okay, I'll leave now.

211
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,940
Alright, alright.

212
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,880
[Jingbei Zhuoyue Law Firm]

213
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,320
Come in.

214
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,560
Let's talk outside.

215
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,270
No, come in here.

216
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,450
The feng shui in there isn't good. I won't go in.

217
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,820
Alright, then I'll just freeze out here.

218
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,600
It is pretty cold. Here, take my jacket.

219
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
No, no, no. Just wear it.

220
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,480
Why do you keep running

221
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,910
over here for no reason?

222
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,000
You're making money,

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,550
but we're still struggling to make ends meet.

224
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,720
Do you think

225
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,390
Xiao Nannan hasn't suffered enough,

226
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,510
and you want to add insult to injury?

227
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,600
What do you mean?

228
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,120
I told you before

229
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,750
that I was worried about Xia Shu's work ability.

230
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,960
I asked you not to let her handle Xiao Nannan's case,

231
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,670
but you didn't listen.

232
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,550
Now it's a mess.

233
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,360
She went to find the people who bullied Xiao Nannan before.

234
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,000
That's fine,

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but why did she give her contact information

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,730
to these people?

237
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,620
Now

238
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,030
several people are calling and harassing Xiao Nannan.

239
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,960
And Qiu Hua.

240
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
She's such a mature lawyer,

241
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,570
but she actually went to talk to Xiao Nannan

242
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,510
and told her not to be so fragile and to be strong.

243
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,330
Let me ask you. If Xiao Nannan could be strong,

244
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,600
would she have come to the law firm looking for us?

245
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,550
Stop, Chen Shuo.

246
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,250
You need to be responsible for what you say.

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,670
Are you saying they're professionally unethical

248
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,630
and did this deliberately?

249
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,460
Yes, that's what I mean.

250
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,190
Who told you this?

251
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,070
Yang Shu.

252
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,670
He came to our law firm to see me.

253
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,910
If you don't believe me, call him.

254
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,370
Alright.

255
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,510
I'll

256
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,320
go back to the law firm and look into it.

257
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,530
If it's really like you said,

258
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll apologize to them personally

259
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,080
and take over the case myself.

260
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,170
You'll have to apologize to them.

261
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,690
Since I introduced this case,

262
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,320
I should be involved too.

263
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,750
No need. It's like killing a chicken with...

264
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,790
With a cleaver.

265
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,670
You admitted that I'm the cleaver.

266
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,200
Killing a chicken with a nail clipper?

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
I'll handle it myself.

268
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,880
They trust me,

269
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,360
and I trust you.

270
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,830
So I have to be involved in this.

271
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
They only gave us 20,000 yuan.

272
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
I don't have any extra money to give you.

273
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,630
Don't worry about that.

274
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,200
I don't even care about that little bit of money.

275
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
I just made over 8 million.

276
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,120
Yeah,

277
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,470
but that money hasn't even landed in your pocket yet.

278
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,880
You're shouting it from the rooftops.

279
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,550
Aren't you afraid of kidnappers?

280
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,410
Why don't you kidnap me?

281
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,660
I'll transfer the 8 million to you right away.

282
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,910
Kidnap you? That's a lot of effort.

283
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,690
Just wait.

284
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,030
I'll go tell Mr. Xu,

285
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,910
and then I'll head back to the firm.

286
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,840
Why do you have to tell

287
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,360
this Mr. Xu about everything?

288
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,820
He's the one paying me.

289
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,690
Should I report to you instead of him?

290
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,200
I can also pay you.

291
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,750
Let's talk about that later.

292
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,150
Mr. Xu,

293
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,390
we've finished processing those.

294
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,720
Here's the comparison directory,

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,080
and there are some miscellaneous items.

296
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,030
Do you want us to have a lawyer from our firm

297
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,840
continue handling it,

298
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
or should I ask Qiu Hua to come over and follow up?

299
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,630
Either is fine.

300
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,160
It's up to you.

301
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
It should be fine.

302
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,630
The case you're working on

303
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,980
is a campus bullying case from ten years ago.

304
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,910
It didn't cause any physical harm.

305
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,080
But it changed the girl's life.

306
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
This case may not have a resolution,

307
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,010
so you and your client

308
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,160
need to be prepared.

309
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,840
You remind me of

310
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,870
when I used to specialize

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,360
in pro bono cases ten years ago.

312
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,150
Those days are gone forever.

313
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,770
Actually, I envy you.

314
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,000
You're still willing to

315
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,240
work hard on something that may not have a result.

316
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,870
Don't worry.

317
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,660
I'll have Ms. Qiu

318
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,240
take over the Dingxin case.

319
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,990
Go ahead and focus on this one. I support you.

320
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,930
Thank you, Mr. Xu. Thank you.

321
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
But why didn't any of you tell me

322
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,300
about such a big thing?

323
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,270
Now Xiao Nannan has terminated the agreement.

324
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,750
Xia Shu and I are partners, too.

325
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,530
Since you entrusted this case to us,

326
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,270
we handled it as we saw fit.

327
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,670
Luo, it's my fault.

328
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,940
I thought too highly of people's goodness.

329
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,200
That person promised me

330
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,910
he would apologize to Xiao Nannan,

331
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,690
so I gave him the contact information.

332
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,550
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,300
I also bear some responsibility for this.

334
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,440
I've already scolded Xia Shu

335
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,730
for giving out the contact information.

336
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,630
But my opinion remains the same.

337
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,020
This case won't have a result.

338
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,950
It's better to end it sooner rather than later.

339
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,510
And Qiu Hua,

340
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,870
did you really call Xiao Nannan fragile

341
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,960
and not strong enough?

342
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,320
I was just being honest.

343
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,240
Don't tell me you also said

344
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,790
that she was like this today because she accepted her fate

345
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,400
and put up with whatever came her way?

346
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,410
But Xiao Nannan didn't just put up with it either.

347
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,060
This is how the world is.

348
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
Major evils are still rampant.

349
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,760
What can we do about minor evils?

350
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,660
Qiu,

351
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,770
I disagree with you on this.

352
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,520
Evil should be eradicated,

353
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,000
regardless of whether it's major or minor.

354
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,660
Well, if you disagree, then you go do something about it.

355
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,840
I am doing something about it.

356
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,120
The result is that the victim suffered

357
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,230
another round of harm.

358
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,550
I...

359
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Xia Shu.

360
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,680
Qiu Hua's last sentence was right.

361
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,330
Ultimately,

362
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,630
you are the one who started this.

363
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,330
If you hadn't given out the contact information,

364
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
they wouldn't have harassed Xiao Nannan, right?

365
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,790
If Xiao Nannan wasn't harassed,

366
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,210
then this case wouldn't have fallen apart.

367
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,080
Now that you're a partner,

368
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,810
you should

369
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,040
try your best to find a way

370
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,990
to make amends, okay?

371
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,650
Also, I'd like to talk to Qiu Hua separately.

372
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,970
Okay.

373
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't you think your approach to Xiao Nannan

374
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,020
was inappropriate?

375
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,620
Then what would be appropriate?

376
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,240
From a legal and human perspective,

377
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,070
the chances of winning this case are slim to none.

378
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,150
If it drags on for years with no result,

379
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,260
she'll be even more devastated.

380
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,700
It's better for her to strengthen her inner strength

381
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,280
and move past this hurdle herself.

382
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,870
Law is just a tool,

383
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,150
and it has never been perfect.

384
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,390
That's why we fight cases

385
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,690
that are likely to fail,

386
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,840
to raise awareness

387
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,550
and drive social change.

388
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,880
That's idealism,

389
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,110
a utopia.

390
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,890
Even if there was a case

391
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,360
that could drive social change,

392
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,670
it definitely wouldn't be this one

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,570
because it's too common.

394
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,150
Then let's not talk about the law.

395
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,480
As professional lawyers,

396
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,650
shouldn't we respect others' pain?

397
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,270
Some people just can't move on

398
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,040
when faced with pain,

399
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,100
like Xiao Nannan.

400
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,910
So, is she just going to

401
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,350
stay stuck forever?

402
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,550
Xiao Nannan was being bullied,

403
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,910
and the law can do nothing about it.

404
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,240
All she can do

405
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,880
is to become stronger.

406
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,510
Otherwise, all the help from others

407
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,040
would just be meaningless kindness.

408
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,090
Shouldn't a lawyer be objective

409
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,340
rather than projecting their own feelings onto others?

410
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,240
Xiao Nannan just can't be that strong.

411
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,490
She can't be rational and objective

412
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,150
or weigh the pros and cons in everything.

413
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,180
You can't expect everyone to be like you.

414
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,680
Is it wrong to weigh the pros and cons?

415
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,650
Forget it. Let's not talk about this anymore.

416
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,870
It's meaningless to discuss this further.

417
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,630
I don't agree with your idea

418
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,270
about Xiao Nannan's case,

419
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,990
but I respect your opinion.

420
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,910
I'll continue to work

421
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,890
on this case with Xia Shu.

422
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,870
You go to Zhuoyue Law Firm

423
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,660
and help Mr. Xu with the accounts, okay?

424
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,750
Okay.

425
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
I know you don't want to hear this,

426
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,580
but I have to burst your bubble.

427
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,150
No matter how hard you try,

428
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,630
the result will still be accepting reality

429
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,550
and letting it go.

430
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,590
Maybe there's a turning point in Xiao Nannan's case.

431
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,870
If that day ever comes,

432
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,310
I hope you can change your mind too.

433
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,069
Honey, dinner's ready.

434
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,640
Dinner's ready?

435
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,200
Come on.

436
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,740
Okay.

437
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,260
What's all this about today?

438
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,589
So many delicious dishes,

439
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,640
and even alcohol?

440
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,230
What's the occasion?

441
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm being promoted to deputy section chief.

442
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,550
That's great news!

443
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,420
The organization department talked to me today.

444
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,910
They said the announcement will be made in a couple of days,

445
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,170
and it's final after that.

446
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,830
Good news! Congratulations!

447
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,640
Come on.

448
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,350
Cheers!

449
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,350
Let's drink up!

450
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,270
No, no, no. Let's not drink it up..

451
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,030
Alright, I'll drink

452
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,160
it up.

453
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,980
Have some dishes first.

454
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,350
Take your time and enjoy it.

455
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,550
Qiu Hua, I was thinking.

456
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,750
I'm 28 this year.

457
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,760
In four years,

458
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,120
I'll be 32.

459
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,950
By then, my dad won't have retired yet.

460
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,550
I'll try to become an duputy director.

461
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,250
Another four years later, I'll be 36.

462
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,070
I'll work harder to become a director.

463
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,640
By then,

464
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,610
our family's future

465
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,170
will look very promising.

466
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,230
Is it worth stressing over this?

467
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,810
What's the big deal about stressing over it?

468
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,300
Even if it's stressful,

469
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,170
I think it's worth it as long as I get promoted.

470
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,640
Does the path of advancement ever end?

471
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,990
Quanquan, I've told you before,

472
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,300
as long as you're happy,

473
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,450
even if you're just a clerk your whole life,

474
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,680
I'll be with you.

475
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,000
I really don't think it's necessary

476
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,680
to go through so much trouble

477
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,640
just to get promoted.

478
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,800
You're so ambitious about your career.

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,070
Why don't you want me

480
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,670
to be ambitious about mine too?

481
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,230
I'm not saying don't be ambitious.

482
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,070
I'm saying

483
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,880
everything should be based on one's own abilities,

484
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,070
not on connections.

485
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,610
Don't always bring up Dad.

486
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,310
You should earn your promotion by yourself

487
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,380
so you can eat your meal with peace of mind,

488
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,290
right?

489
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,490
Aren't you also relying on connections?

490
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,880
Dad introduced you to Mr. Wu.

491
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,950
Didn't you take his business card and go see him?

492
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,720
Well, I went to see Mr. Wu

493
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,710
not because I wanted to,

494
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,370
but because I was afraid

495
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,300
you'd be upset if I didn't.

496
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,880
Besides, I didn't end up

497
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,110
taking Mr. Wu's case.

498
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,510
All the cases I'm handling now

499
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,510
are earned through my own hard work.

500
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,440
When did I ever use connections?

501
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,620
Then I think you somewhat underestimate me.

502
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,830
When did I say I underestimate you?

503
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,050
Why would you think that?

504
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,270
It's because you have no expectations

505
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,590
for my career.

506
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,270
We're married,

507
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,900
but we're not a team.

508
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,920
Why do I have to have expectations

509
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,820
for your career?

510
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,050
If I'm a clerk my whole life,

511
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,510
not only you,

512
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,960
but even I won't respect myself.

513
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,230
As a man, how embarrassing would it be

514
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,790
to be like this?

515
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,510
Alright,

516
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,180
I've said too much.

517
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,090
From now on, I won't interfere in your affairs, okay?

518
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,990
We're life partners,

519
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,830
and it's not necessary for us

520
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,960
to share the same values in everything.

521
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,950
You can do whatever you like.

522
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm just reminding you

523
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,590
to rely on yourself as much as possible, not on Dad.

524
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,150
Let's eat.

525
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,910
I'm sorry.

526
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,160
We apologize to both of you.

527
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,150
Not only did we fail to seek justice for Ms. Xiao,

528
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,080
but we also caused you secondary harm.

529
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,210
This is a mistake in our work.

530
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,650
Ms. Xiao,

531
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm really sorry.

532
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,410
This is a major mistake in my work,

533
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,420
and I apologize to you.

534
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,730
It's okay.

535
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,010
It's all my fault.

536
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,180
Now that I think about it,

537
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,330
I shouldn't have boasted back then

538
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,130
and told them I had endless money in my card.

539
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,700
Even if you did boast,

540
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,270
it's still their fault.

541
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,710
They shouldn't have treated you like that.

542
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,830
Don't blame yourself

543
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,010
for their mistakes.

544
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,920
Ms. Xiao,

545
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,710
they definitely made mistakes in their work this time,

546
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,390
but their intention was good.

547
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,080
They wanted to seek justice for you.

548
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,440
So,

549
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,510
can you give them another chance?

550
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,420
We may not be able to make everyone

551
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,320
apologize to you for what they did back then,

552
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,440
but we can strive

553
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,550
to make those leaders apologize to you.

554
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,720
Tomorrow, I will go to

555
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,950
that county myself again.

556
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,750
I'll go with her

557
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,140
and keep an eye on her

558
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,810
so she doesn't make mistakes again, right?

559
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,900
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

560
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,660
It's my duty.

561
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,890
How cool! That little attitude.

562
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,460
Good morning.

563
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,230
Good morning.

564
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,200
Love breakfast.

565
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,980
My hands are not available. Hold it for me while I open the door.

566
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Not treating yourself as an outsider, huh?

567
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,440
Double rhyme.

568
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,920
Let's drive.

569
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,420
Here, princess.

570
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,350
You scared me!

571
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,830
What considerate service!

572
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,680
Warn me next time.

573
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,960
Let me see...

574
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,020
It should be... Yes,

575
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,110
on page 55 of the third book. Take a look.

576
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,940
And regarding the transactions with Changfeng,

577
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,550
you can ask Mr. Xu.

578
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,620
He knows about it.

579
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,550
Alright, thank you. Bye.

580
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,160
So busy!

581
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,040
Yeah, how can I compare to you?

582
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,260
Making big money

583
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,750
and achieving financial freedom.

584
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,450
All you think about now is picking up girls.

585
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,950
I'm not picking up anyone!

586
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,080
Well, not exactly.

587
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,760
There is one girl I want to pick up,

588
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,290
but I haven't succeeded.

589
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,270
Don't be ridiculous.

590
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,310
I really want to know

591
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
why you're so persistent about this small case.

592
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,410
What, have you made enough big money?

593
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,120
Not yet.

594
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,970
The firm won't let me touch big cases anymore.

595
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,030
Fang Lihong and Tao Zheng

596
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,790
won't let me participate in the Wanhe bankruptcy case...

597
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,740
Stop right there.

598
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,590
What's going on?

599
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,660
Unscrupulous Chen, stop.

600
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,750
Your firm

601
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,550
is the administrator of Wanhe.

602
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,940
We represent Wanhe's creditors.

603
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,070
There's a conflict of interest between us.

604
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,820
Please shut up.

605
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,490
Don't talk to me about this case anymore.

606
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,440
Besides,

607
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,310
you've already made enough money to achieve financial freedom.

608
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,830
You shouldn't keep obsessing over Wanhe.

609
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,410
Alright, alright. No wonder you're Righteous Luo

610
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,510
You know I made eight million on one case.

611
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,960
Didn't you brag about it?

612
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,750
How much did you spend on this lawsuit?

613
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,040
Forget it.

614
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,510
I hired an accounting firm

615
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,880
to sort out that mess between them,

616
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,110
which cost me 600,000 yuan.

617
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,770
600,000 yuan!

618
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,680
Out of my own pocket.

619
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,590
Liangcheng Law Firm didn't chip in a penny.

620
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,760
What a spendthrift, Mr. Chen.

621
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,880
Don't mock me.

622
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,350
I had to mortgage my house.

623
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,880
Actually, at first,

624
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,330
I wanted to use your foreclosed house as collateral.

625
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,680
Why didn't you?

626
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,720
I couldn't bear to.

627
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,270
Isn't it still unused?

628
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,400
I said I couldn't bear to.

629
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,550
I bought that house

630
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,090
to sell it to you at a higher price later,

631
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,170
making a profit on the difference.

632
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,200
I couldn't bring myself to sell it.

633
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
I knew you'd say that.

634
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,790
Unscrupulous Chen, give it up.

635
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,130
I won't buy it.

636
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,110
I want to see how that house of yours

637
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,550
will backfire on you.

638
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,920
Alright, it's my own fault.

639
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,490
I'm willing to take the loss.

640
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,650
So your firm isn't involved

641
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,310
in this lucrative case at all,

642
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,630
and you're taking on all the risks yourself?

643
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,230
No risks. What risks?

644
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,680
We won the case, and the other party didn't appeal.

645
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,490
It's already in the execution phase.

646
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,070
You...

647
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,640
Be careful.

648
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,720
I'm fighting this lawsuit openly and honestly,

649
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,680
making money openly and honestly.

650
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,750
I have nothing to fear.

651
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,240
It's one thing if you don't make any money,

652
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,920
but if you do,

653
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,310
trouble might follow.

654
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,180
It's fine.

655
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,190
I told Fang Lihong about all my moves.

656
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,030
That's what I was going to remind you of.

657
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,830
You need to watch out for Fang Lihong.

658
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,480
Weird.

659
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,680
Who told me before

660
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,910
that Fang Lihong

661
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,020
is the most upright person at Liangcheng Law Firm?

662
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,570
Who said that?

663
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,580
I still say it now.

664
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,880
But in the face of huge profits,

665
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,170
anything

666
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,360
can happen.

667
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,160
Be careful.

668
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,320
Okay.

669
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,990
Are you worried about me?

670
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,400
You're overthinking it, buddy.

671
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,510
Come on,

672
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,810
does someone as despicable as you need worrying about?

673
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,670
Why are you so stubborn?

674
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,520
If you're worried, just say so.

675
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,610
Why is this car seat so hard?

676
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,550
It's not comfortable at all.

677
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,310
This town isn't big.

678
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,450
Not big at all.

679
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,750
Where to first?

680
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,860
Let me

681
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,470
see, in my bag.

682
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,790
We're going to find

683
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
a woman named Wang Nana.

684
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,030
She's the one who started all this.

685
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,920
Back then,

686
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,270
she exaggerated that Xiao Nannan didn't eat meat,

687
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,030
saying her family was so rich

688
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,830
that they didn't even eat meat, just fed it to pigs.

689
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,350
Later, she was the first one

690
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,820
to spread this rumor everywhere.

691
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,480
After that,

692
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,160
she spat on Xiao Nannan's face

693
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,030
and slapped her.

694
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,670
What kind of person is she?

695
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,160
I heard she works

696
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,670
as a cashier at a supermarket called Youxuan Shengxian.

697
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,820
Shall we go there?

698
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,130
Youxuan Shengxian, right?

699
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,220
Yeah, let me do it.

700
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,540
Alright, search for it.

701
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,430
Step a little closer to the side.

702
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,750
Don't crowd my cash register.

703
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,590
That cashier.

704
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,080
Is it she?

705
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,880
It looks like her.

706
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,200
But...

707
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,840
She looks much older

708
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,650
than Xiao Nannan.

709
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,230
That's what life does to her.

710
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,200
Would you mind not dropping things?

711
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,480
Why are you dropping them again?

712
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,350
Who are you?

713
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,590
Why are you giving orders?

714
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,270
What attitude is that?

715
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,240
Why are you pointing?

716
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm pointing at you! At you!

717
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
Come here!

718
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,920
Come here, what's your problem?

719
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,440
I'm coming.

720
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,200
Dare you lay a hand on me?

721
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Madam, madam!

722
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,640
She's actually laying hands on her?

723
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,940
How dare you talk to me like that?

724
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,990
How dare you?

725
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,090
She is so fierce.

726
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,670
If you really push my buttons,

727
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,570
I'll hit you back like that.

728
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,050
Is it necessary?

729
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,540
She's definitely capable of bullying.

730
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,590
Wang Nana!

731
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,120
Stop it!

732
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,110
That's enough, what are you doing?

733
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,960
Manager, she cursed me first!

734
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,590
You can't fight with customers, though!

735
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,410
You've been watching all the time.

736
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,350
I'm learning how to fight.

737
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,510
Come on. Let's go.

738
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,000
She's definitely going to lose her job.

739
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,510
Let's wait for her outside.

740
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,920
Did you start it or did I?

741
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,400
Alright.

742
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,310
Madam, madam!

743
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,240
Don't fight.

744
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
Wang is definitely not a nice person.

745
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
She started hitting before they could say a few words.

746
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,000
She even pulled the customer's hair.

747
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,190
When she comes out,

748
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,360
you go first, I'll follow.

749
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,510
Come on, Chen Shuo, how can you?

750
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,470
As a man,

751
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,270
you insisted on coming,

752
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,560
but now you're hiding?

753
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm afraid she'll pull my hair.

754
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,590
So I'm not afraid of hair-pulling?

755
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,270
With your hair volume...

756
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,330
What a mess.

757
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,030
I quit!

758
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,900
She's coming out.

759
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,590
Ms. Wang.

760
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
Ms. Wang!

761
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Hello, are you Ms. Wang Nana?

762
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,180
I'm Luo Yingzi.

763
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,400
This is my business card.

764
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,420
This is Mr. Chen, the lawyer.

765
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,040
We need to talk to you.

766
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,720
A lawyer surnamed Xia called me a while ago.

767
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,030
Are you in cahoots with her?

768
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,060
I told her,

769
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,960
I didn't steal or rob.

770
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
Why are you still coming after me?

771
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,280
Ms. Wang, how about

772
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,160
we find a quiet place

773
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,840
to sit and talk?

774
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,300
You can say it here.

775
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,990
Alright.

776
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,590
Since Ms. Xia

777
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,830
has called you,

778
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,000
you should know

779
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,350
why we're here.

780
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,720
Come on, will you ever stop?

781
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,990
What did I do to her?

782
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,440
Who hasn't had a fight with classmates in school?

783
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,030
Is it necessary to hold a grudge over such a trivial thing until now?

784
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,430
Is she being petty?

785
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,770
Just tell her,

786
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,270
if I see her again, I'll slap her.

787
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,600
If I see her again, I'll spit on her.

788
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,380
Such a drama queen.

789
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,560
Ms. Wang,

790
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,570
would you mind being respectful?

791
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,030
You bullied my client, Xiao Nannan,

792
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,960
eventually causing her severe mental trauma

793
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,720
that hasn't healed until now.

794
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,310
And all she wants

795
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,270
is an apology from you.

796
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,290
I'll apologize to her?

797
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,380
Who will apologize to me?

798
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,120
She's the one who's not self-respecting, posting selfies,

799
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,820
trying to seduce people.

800
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,010
She doesn't even allow others to speak, does she?

801
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,640
And what did you say about bullying?

802
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,590
I won't accept that.

803
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,030
If you keep talking nonsense like that, I'll...

804
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,210
I'll...

805
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,420
I'll sue you for defamation!

806
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,440
Defamation?

807
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,640
Did you ever spit on her,

808
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,820
slap her,

809
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,540
or say that their family's meat is for feeding pigs?

810
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,220
She hasn't forgotten

811
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,150
those words and deeds until now.

812
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,480
If you insist on this,

813
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,550
I can only advise my client to sue you.

814
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,480
Can you afford the consequences of that?

815
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,880
Sue me if you dare!

816
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,030
My life is already like this,

817
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,030
I'm not afraid of anyone anymore.

818
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,200
I work two jobs a day,

819
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,240
and now I've lost my job

820
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,510
because of a crazy person.

821
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,400
My...

822
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,310
My husband ran away with another woman,

823
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,950
leaving my child uncared for.

824
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,030
I'm poor, jobless, and my life

825
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,320
is in shambles.

826
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,700
Who will apologize to me?

827
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,640
If you ask me to apologize to her again,

828
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,060
I'll hit you too.

829
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,230
No, no, no!

830
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,440
Ms. Wang, Ms. Wang,

831
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,100
calm down, calm down.

832
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,810
It's very uncivilized

833
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,940
to fight on the street.

834
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,920
Ms. Luo's attitude just now

835
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,750
was indeed not good.

836
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,540
I apologize for her on behalf of her, okay?

837
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,610
-Chen Shuo.
-Don't say anything.

838
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,000
Can't you see? Ms. Wang

839
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
just lost her job and was fired.

840
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,750
She's in a bad mood.

841
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,720
Ms. Wang,

842
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,920
what happened

843
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,550
in the supermarket just now

844
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,200
was clear as day to Ms. Luo and me.

845
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,110
In the whole incident,

846
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,240
both parties are responsible.

847
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,720
But that customer's

848
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,040
attitude was really terrible,

849
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,270
extremely rude.

850
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,750
If I were you, I wouldn't have been able to control myself too,

851
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,760
and might have hit back.

852
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,470
So on this matter,

853
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,350
I can sympathize with you.

854
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,270
You lost your job,

855
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,820
it's really unfair.

856
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,630
Let's step aside and talk.

857
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,510
I heard everything you said just now.

858
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,900
You're raising a child alone, right?

859
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,640
You work hard

860
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,550
to support your child,

861
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,820
taking several jobs a day.

862
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,770
It's too hard.

863
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:46,830
From where I'm standing,

864
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,270
I think you're a particularly great mother,

865
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,480
kind and diligent.

866
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,480
So, about what we mentioned earlier,

867
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,200
the bullying that happened a long time ago,

868
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,160
I think it must have been unintentional,

869
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,830
just like you said,

870
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,350
who hasn't made mistakes when they were young?

871
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,500
Well.

872
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,510
My name is Chen Shuo,

873
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,160
from Liangcheng Law Firm. My phone number is on it.

874
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,270
If you have

875
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,990
any legal issues in the future

876
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,440
and need my help,

877
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,070
I can do it for free, okay?

878
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,000
Keep it.

879
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,160
And let me apologize to you on behalf of my colleague again.

880
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,530
Goodbye.

881
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,320
Chen Shuo, are you addicted to scolding me?

882
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,550
Why should we apologize to her?

883
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,920
She's clearly a bully who picks on the weak.

884
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,680
You're the strong one, right?

885
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,900
You almost got beaten up just now, didn't you?

886
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,290
We're here to negotiate,

887
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
not to make enemies.

888
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,790
Can we be strategic about this?

889
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,440
Next stop.

890
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,750
20 yuan is really not expensive, it's a tempered glass screen protector.

891
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,800
15 yuan, alright?

892
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,470
15 yuan, and I'll get it done here.

893
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,080
I don't even make a profit at 20.

894
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,150
I bought it for 20.

895
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,300
It can't be less than that.

896
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,120
Last time I got one from you for 18,

897
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,000
and I realized outside

898
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,750
that others were only selling it for 12.

899
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,160
But cheap things are no good, right?

900
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:03,880
I'm leaving.

901
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,920
15 yuan, I'll paste it for you. Come back, come on.

902
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,680
15.

903
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,540
So stingy.

904
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,560
Welcome.

905
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,550
Are you here to choose a phone or get a screen protector?

906
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,920
Are you Mr. Liu?

907
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,260
Yes.

908
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,550
We came from Jingbei

909
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,700
specifically to visit you.

910
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,790
Visit me?

911
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,320
What's the occasion?

912
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,590
Mr. Liu,

913
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,370
when you were in high school,

914
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,070
you were the moderator of the forum of Class 5, Grade 12

915
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,180
on the school's bulletin board, right?

916
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,240
[Campus Bullying Perpetrator: Liu Jianming]

917
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,480
When you were moderating the forum,

918
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,070
you intentionally guided

919
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,160
verbal attacks against Ms. Xiao Nannan.

920
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,990
You even compiled

921
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,550
a collection of insulting quotes about her being a rich girl.

922
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,920
Everything you did

923
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,480
caused her great harm.

924
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,870
Later, when she went to college,

925
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,250
you reposted those contents

926
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,240
on her college's website,

927
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,160
further expanding

928
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,610
the harm and impact on her.

929
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,790
As a result, Ms. Xiao Nannan

930
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,930
hasn't recovered from the trauma until now.

931
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,440
We're here today on her behalf

932
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
to make representations to you

933
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,640
and hope that you will formally apologize to her

934
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,160
for what you did back then.

935
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,250
Xiao Nannan?

936
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:06,930
Yes.

937
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,199
What do you think about the demand I just mentioned?

938
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,920
I remember now.

939
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,230
My old classmate.

940
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,000
Where is she now? How is she?

941
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,840
What's she doing?

942
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,120
Her current life has nothing to do with you.

943
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
She just wants to seek justice

944
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,449
for the harm she suffered back then.

945
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,510
If I remember correctly,

946
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,830
her family is from Jingbei, right?

947
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,110
She's still in Jingbei?

948
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,870
She's still in Jingbei

949
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,969
and has become a graphic designer.

950
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,480
She became a graphic designer?

951
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,860
She's living a very happy life.

952
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,630
Not only does she have a loving boyfriend,

953
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,920
but he's also very impressive.

954
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,139
He started a startup company

955
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,090
that several major internet giants are interested

956
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,350
in acquiring at a high price.

957
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,860
Mr. Liu,

958
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,030
Ms. Xiao Nannan wants you

959
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,110
to write a formal apology letter to her.

960
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,320
She found a good partner,

961
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,440
isn't that great?

962
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,550
Yes, I said she's very happy.

963
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
And she has good conditions. Her father is wealthy.

964
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,710
Didn't you know that before?

965
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,090
They have a big house, luxury cars, everything is ready.

966
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,700
What do you think about Ms. Xiao Nannan's demand?

967
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,730
You just said

968
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,800
she has a boyfriend, but she's not married yet, right?

969
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,800
No, she's not.

970
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,280
You also know that some girls nowadays

971
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,360
don't want to get married so early.

972
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,880
So they just stay with their boyfriends,

973
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,890
happy and sweet,

974
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,070
forever like being in a relationship.

975
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,550
What do you think about apologizing?

976
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,360
Apologize for what?

977
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,500
You were the forum moderator back then.

978
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,650
Shouldn't you apologize

979
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,710
for those posts?

980
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,380
Why should I apologize?

981
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
There were many people posting at that time.

982
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,440
Why don't you go find them?

983
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,950
If you want me to apologize, forget it.

984
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,030
Get out of here

985
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,350
and don't disturb my business.

986
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,400
If you want to buy a phone, you can come to me.

987
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,460
I'll give you a discount.

988
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,810
Mr. Liu said to come back when buying a phone.

989
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,510
Come back when buying a phone.

990
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,350
Just leave.

991
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,760
Drive slowly on the road.

992
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,190
Okay, okay.

993
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,070
Don't fall into a ditch.

994
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,970
You think I'll apologize?

995
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,510
In your dreams.

996
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,360
What's wrong with you?

997
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,000
Why did you talk to him so much?

998
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,110
I was just being nosy and talking for no reason.

999
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,960
I think so too.

1000
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,510
You two seem to hit it off right away.

1001
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,000
Birds of a feather flock together.

1002
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,310
I took a shine to him.

1003
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,810
Like bad fish find bad shrimp.

1004
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,150
I'm the bad fish?

1005
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,760
Here we are.

1006
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,630
We've arrived.

1007
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,440
This is the last stop. Mission accomplished.

1008
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,140
Xu Shuyun ranked last in the exam again.

1009
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,290
Filling in the blanks with words based on pinyin.

1010
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,620
Out of the whole class, you got every single question wrong.

1011
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,420
Look at your test paper. How many checkmarks are there?

1012
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,420
Is it even bearable?

1013
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,110
And this workbook...

1014
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,030
Ms. Fang is talking to a parent right now.

1015
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,800
Please wait for a moment.

1016
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,040
Is learning for my benefit, or not?

1017
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,450
Learn if you want to, or don't.

1018
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:45,860
So harsh.

1019
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,370
Ms. Fang.

1020
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,670
My granddaughter failed the exam.

1021
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,560
It's because I don't know how to teach her.

1022
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,430
But I really don't know what else to do.

1023
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,880
Her parents are working in the city.

1024
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,670
I'm just an old lady.

1025
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,440
I don't know anything.

1026
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,840
Ms. Fang.

1027
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,950
Please pay more attention to her.

1028
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,470
You should

1029
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,700
tell her parents to take her home as soon as possible.

1030
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,670
What's the use of having her grandmother come every day?

1031
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,540
If her parents don't come soon,

1032
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
she doesn't need to come to class anymore.

1033
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,190
I really can't teach this child.

1034
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,030
She's dragging the whole class down.

1035
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,430
With grades like these,

1036
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,320
they're not even close to others' scores.

1037
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,850
Last year, I told you to go to the hospital

1038
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,760
and get a certificate of mental retardation for her.

1039
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,980
In my opinion,

1040
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,270
she has a pig's brain.

1041
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,520
Ms. Fang.

1042
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,840
With this kind of speaking level, how can she be a teacher?

1043
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,450
Right.

1044
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,960
We'll talk about it after you call her parents.

1045
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,190
Take her away now.

1046
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,030
Zhao Chenqi,

1047
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,170
are your parents here?

1048
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,550
Ms. Fang, someone is looking for you outside.

1049
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,070
Whose parents are they this time?

1050
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,960
We're not parents.

1051
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,040
We're from Jingbei.

1052
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,880
We're lawyers.

1053
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,710
We're here specifically to see you.

1054
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,840
Wait a moment, please.

1055
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,310
Okay.

1056
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,160
-Ms. Fang.
-Come with me over there.

1057
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,390
Alright.

1058
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,480
Hello, Ms. Fang.

1059
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,630
Here's my business card.

1060
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,280
We're lawyers from Jingbei.

1061
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,550
We'd like to talk to you.

1062
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,000
A few days ago, a lawyer surnamed Xia

1063
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,850
called me.

1064
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,710
Is it about the same thing?

1065
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,670
Yes.

1066
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,920
We hope you can formally

1067
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,010
apologize to Ms. Xiao Nannan.

1068
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,710
You once caused her great harm,

1069
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,590
to the point where she's still...

1070
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,360
How she lives her life now

1071
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,440
has nothing to do with me.

1072
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,330
My life is like this. Who did I ever go to?

1073
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,430
Kids playing around and joking is one thing,

1074
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,280
but after all these years, you still want an apology?

1075
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,400
Ms. Fang,

1076
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,670
please be mindful of your tone.

1077
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,460
You are a teacher now.

1078
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,330
You once bullied your classmate

1079
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,280
and now you're educating your students like this.

1080
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,510
After all these years,

1081
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,920
you haven't improved at all.

1082
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,070
Someone like you,

1083
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,630
what qualifications do you have to be a teacher?

1084
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,730
If you think I'm not good enough, fire me.

1085
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,260
That Xiao Nannan is an idiot.

1086
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,960
Just thinking about her pretending to be innocent

1087
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,860
makes me sick.

1088
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,580
I did curse her back then,

1089
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,360
but she deserved it.

1090
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,280
Ms. Fang,

1091
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,640
aren't you afraid of being sued?

1092
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,960
Who are you trying to scare?

1093
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,380
Get out of here if you have nothing to say.

1094
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,420
You're so annoying.

1095
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,110
These parents have good tempers.

1096
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,150
If I were a parent, I would slap her.

1097
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,940
Then I'll slap her with you.

1098
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,670
Weren't you hiding behind me just now?

1099
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,650
The teacher doesn't want you now.

1100
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,230
Your parents can't control you,

1101
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,550
and I don't want you either.

1102
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,880
Grandma, don't leave me!

1103
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,600
Wait a moment.

1104
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,710
With your attitude, not doing homework

1105
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,400
and getting zeros on exams,

1106
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,960
how am I supposed to help you?

1107
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,920
I'll be right back, wait for me.

1108
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,670
Later, you can go

1109
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,280
stay with your mom and dad.

1110
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,730
Auntie.

1111
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,400
Excuse me for interrupting.

1112
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,890
Is this your granddaughter?

1113
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,550
Yes.

1114
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,800
Is she in Ms. Fang Renmei's class?

1115
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,450
Yes.

1116
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,930
Let me introduce myself.

1117
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,780
My name is Chen Shuo,

1118
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,630
and I'm a lawyer.

1119
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,960
Here's my lawyer's license for you to see.

1120
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,890
The licensee is Chen Shuo, a lawyer.

1121
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
I came to the school today to handle some business,

1122
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,420
and by coincidence,

1123
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,280
I overheard Ms. Fang's conversation

1124
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,110
with you outside the office door.

1125
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,630
To be honest,

1126
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,630
when a child doesn't perform well academically,

1127
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,920
both the teacher and the parents are undoubtedly worried.

1128
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,880
Besides the child's own reasons,

1129
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
sometimes they might be naughty

1130
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,370
or disinterested in learning.

1131
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,760
In that case,

1132
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,830
the teacher should also bear some responsibility,

1133
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,450
as they are teachers

1134
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,400
and role models, right?

1135
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,630
However,

1136
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,550
what Ms. Fang just said

1137
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,730
was a bit harsh.

1138
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,250
Listening from outside,

1139
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,140
I felt it wasn't particularly appropriate.

1140
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,240
Imagine

1141
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,620
a first-grader

1142
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,230
constantly exposed

1143
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,840
to such a language environment in class.

1144
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,610
It's definitely detrimental

1145
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,830
to her physical and mental growth.

1146
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,880
As her grandmother,

1147
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,350
have you ever considered doing something

1148
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,900
to improve this situation?

1149
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,220
Her parents are working in the city

1150
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,980
and don't come back often,

1151
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,120
so they can't take care of her.

1152
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,330
As for me, an old lady in the countryside,

1153
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
what can I do?

1154
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,800
I can't do anything.

1155
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,310
How about this?

1156
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,000
I'll leave you my business card.

1157
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,840
When you see her parents,

1158
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,260
you can discuss with them.

1159
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,110
If there's anything

1160
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,190
I can help with,

1161
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,260
please feel free to contact me,

1162
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,680
especially regarding what I mentioned earlier.

1163
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,900
Alright,

1164
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,200
thank you in advance.

1165
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,770
We'll keep in touch.

1166
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,280
Okay.

1167
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,150
Don't be upset anymore.

1168
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,280
She's just a kid, isn't she?

1169
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,280
Little girl, don't cry.

1170
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,000
You're great!

1171
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,440
Keep studying hard.

1172
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
Come on!

1173
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,200
Well done! I didn't expect that from you.

1174
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,590
You even encouraged that kid like this.

1175
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,120
You're good at coaxing kids.

1176
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,970
What's the use? I didn't manage to coax you.

1177
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,070
I'm not a kid.

1178
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,780
This was a wasted trip.

1179
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,420
We didn't get any results.

1180
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,840
Mr. Xu,

1181
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,060
didn't I tell you

1182
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,150
I was out of town

1183
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,690
handling the campus bullying case?

1184
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,900
Well.

1185
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,510
Among the materials you prepared,

1186
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,170
I noticed some inconsistent data,

1187
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,560
and Ms. Qiu said

1188
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,260
you were in charge of this part.

1189
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,710
It's okay. We can talk about it when you get back.

1190
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,400
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

1191
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,130
I'm on my way back

1192
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,060
and should arrive in the afternoon.

1193
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,230
Take your time.

1194
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,550
Drive safely.

1195
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,350
I'm not driving.

1196
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,550
I hired a driver.

1197
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,800
Alright, then. Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

1198
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,930
Chen Shuo, can you turn around?

1199
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,120
I want to find a café

1200
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,960
to work on that case of mine over there.

1201
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,120
Is it that urgent?

1202
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,270
We'll be on the expressway soon.

1203
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,470
Where are we going to find a café?

1204
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,230
Just look around, there must be one.

1205
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,430
It's pretty urgent.

1206
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,280
Come on, are you really treating me like a driver?

1207
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,250
Aren't you?

1208
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,500
Mr. Chen.

1209
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,200
Alright.

1210
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,280
Driver Chen.

1211
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,580
Okay, okay, I'm just a driver.

1212
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,610
Fine, fine, whatever.
