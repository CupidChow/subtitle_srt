[Episode 24]

3
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,490
It costs tens of millions for a case's agency fee.

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,120
Which company would agree?

5
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,330
It's better to negotiate with Mingshan before the two sides

6
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,900
reach an agreement,

7
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,280
and lower our expectations.

8
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,780
Make as much money as we can.

9
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,000
You can't say that.

10
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,590
The price Mingshan offered initially

11
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,160
was much higher than what we signed,

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,560
but still, no one was willing to take it, right?

13
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,870
Without us,

14
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,960
they wouldn't even get the 20 million.

15
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,680
Okay, Mr. Han.

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
I have to go back to the firm.

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,950
Okay.

18
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,530
Mr. Wang,

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,500
I owe you one, thank you.

20
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,840
70% is 50 million.

21
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,090
50 million times 8%,

22
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,890
minus the firm's share,

23
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,060
that will be 640,000.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,720
It's not much.

25
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,490
Something is better than nothing.

26
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't worry.

27
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,490
We're good partners.

28
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,810
Don't worry, no problem.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,220
Okay.

Come in.

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,530
Mr. Sun, Mr. Chen is here.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
I have a guest here.

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,000
Talk to you later.

34
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,120
Sorry to bother you.

35
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,990
Not at all.

36
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,630
Did you come now because you knew

37
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm having crabs in the canteen today?

38
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,870
Don't leave later.

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,710
Have a meal here.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,630

No, Mr. Sun.

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,079
Eating is not important.

45
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,470
We just came to bring some good news.

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,520
The first installment of the execution payment

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,660
has arrived in the joint account.

48
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,400
Really?

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,300
The court should have notified you, right?

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,100
Did they?

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,610
Well, maybe they didn't tell me yet.

52
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,400
I don't know.

53
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,410
They definitely notified.

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
It's arrived.

Sit down.

The information we provided

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,079
was extremely accurate,

58
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,470
so the execution went smoothly.

59
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,000
Also, the court said,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Minghai will

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,850

Great. Great.

63

So, Mr. Sun,

64
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,560
according to our agreement,

65
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,520
shall we take out the first

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,960
installment of our agency fee soon?

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,390
Why are you in such a hurry?

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,430
This is just the first installment, right?

69
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,910
Isn't that what the agreement says?

70
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,380
It's supposed to be withdrawn in batches.

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,640
installment to me first,

80

so I can arrange normal production.

81
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,770

Yes, they're all from 2015.

That day, Qiu Hua and I

91
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,830
saw them and chatted privately,

92
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,620
saying they all look very beautiful.

Aren't you gossiping right now?

97
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,730
What?

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,950
Do you want to gossip about why we got divorced,

99
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,030
or

100
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,770
why I have three ex-wives?

101
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,360
I want to ask about both.

102
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,540
Actually,

103
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,760
there's nothing strange about it.

104
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,270
Two of them married me when I was

with no money, no future.

107
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,740
And it just so happened that I went to the detention center twice.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,620
They suffered a lot with me,

109
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,130
so we got divorced before I even

110
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,120
left the detention center.

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
Didn't you stay in the detention center

112
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,680
for long back then?

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,630
So they wanted to get divorced so quickly?

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,680
That's normal.

115
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,480
Every woman in a marriage

116
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,750
is an independent individual.

117
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,250
A wife has no obligation to wait for her husband.

118
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,240
You can understand that, right?

119
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,160
Absolutely right.

120
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,330
Rather than suffer with me,

121
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,070
I hope they can live well.

122
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,720
And at that time, they didn't know

123
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,070
I would be acquitted either.

124
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,750
But to be honest, Mr. Xu,

125
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,830
I always thought a big part of the reason

126
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,680
you were acquitted

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,140
was luck.

128
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,830
So I don't really understand,

129
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,270
why were you so daring to refuse to plead guilty back then?

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,310
The risk was just

131
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,490
too great, wasn't it?

132
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,750
When I was in the detention center,

133
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,390
there weren't many good books to read.

134
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,280
Just this collection of Petőfi's poems

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,870
was barely readable.

136
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,170
That overused line,

137
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,720
"Liberty, love!

138
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
These two I need.

139
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,870
For my love I will sacrifice life,

140
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,160
For liberty I will sacrifice my love."

141
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,000
At that time,

142
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,250
I suddenly understood it.

143
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,950
Everyone advised me to plead guilty,

144
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,620
saying that if I did, I'd get at most three years.

145
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,390
Minus the detention time,

146
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,110
I'd probably only serve a year.

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,190
Even my wife at the time advised me to plead guilty.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,950
Compared to prison,

149
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,980
these people's words were more like a cage.

150
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,950
I am a lawyer.

151
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,830
Not guilty is not guilty.

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,960
The law is the truth, freedom is not.

154

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,870
at that time, you were already inside,

what the future would be like.

In that case,

159
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,070
did you still think the law

160
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,630
was worth maintaining at all costs?

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,310

to a rule-of-law society,

190
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,910
Let's meet at the usual place

191
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,150
at eight tonight, okay?

192
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,870
I've got something that needs your advice.

193
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,000
Then you're buying.

194
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,730
My treat.

195
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,710
Okay, bye.

196
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,560
Qiu Hua.

197
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,290
I find that

198
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,840
Mr. Xu is

199
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,030
no ordinary person.

200
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,670
How so?

201
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
I just asked him about

202
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,190
his time in the detention center.

203
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,840
This guy is really tough.

204
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,580
He'd rather sit in jail

205
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,910
than plead guilty.

206
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,750
That's what you call sticking to legal principles.

207
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,100
Unlike us,

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,560
who at best earn a few bucks

209
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,960
and be money-grabbers.

210
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,100
Come on.

211
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,860
Is he working pro bono now?

212
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,600
He seemed pretty calculating when we were

213
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,660
discussing the contract.

214
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,960
He's holding onto the money.

215
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,240
I don't see him giving us any.

216
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,440
I meant that

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,990
he practiced what he preached,

218
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,130
sticking to his principles.

219
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,470
I've seen those two cases of his,

220
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,190
and I don't think it's like that.

221
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,160
What do you think it is then?

222
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,720
Those two cases of his

223
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,980
are actually

224
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,020
in the legal gray area.

225
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,770
I suspect it's because he knows the law so well

226
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
that he exploited the loopholes.

227
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,870
Forget it.

228
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,080
Since we're in the legal profession,

229
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,750
let's respect the legal judgment.

230
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,970
What a job.

231
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,810
I thought we were joining his team,

232
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,990
but it turned out we're just doing the work for him.

233
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,520
What does the client write here?

234
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,720
Can't read it clearly.

235
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,790
Just like him, no ice.

236
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
How much did you drink?

237
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,720
Are you okay? Drunk already?

238
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,970
I'm fine.

239
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,750
I'm in trouble.

240
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,230
A lawyer who throws around millions like that...

241
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,240
Thank you.

242
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,390
A great lawyer

243
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,860
can still have trouble?

244
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,300
You're just being sarcastic.

245
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,720
They're planning to welsh on the payment.

246
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,760
Your client?

247
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,630
Yes, them.

248
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,480
This case, initially, was about

249
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,100
the Mingshan Group, which I was representing, suing Minghai.

250
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,220
They wanted to collect a debt.

251
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,670
The contract amount is huge.

252
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,000
So I went all in.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,410
I even mortgaged my house

254
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,760
and put everything into this case.

255
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,940
We won the first trial.

256
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,060
But the Mingshan Group

257
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,480
was really underhanded.

258
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,650
They violated the contract

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,290
and secretly negotiated with Minghai behind my back.

260
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,910
And I found out that

261
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,790
not only did they welsh on the payment,

262
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,080
but their whole purpose of suing

263
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,840
was to use me, the lawyer,

264
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
to pressure Minghai

265
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,030
into negotiating.

266
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,650
So, I, Chen Shuo,

267
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,930
am just a pawn being dangled.

268
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,600
I get it.

269
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,300
This huge sum of money

270
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,120
is like the carrot in front of a donkey's head.

271
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,770
You can see it but can't eat it. It's frustrating.

272
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,540
I'm desperate.

273
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,410
So,

274
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,550
I'm asking you to help me think of something.

275
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,380
Use your wit.

276
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,790
The two options I can think of are,

277
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,490
one, to confront Mingshan head-on

278
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,370
and get the full payment.

279
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,050
But that means a fight to the death.

280
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,790
The second option

281
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,150
is to negotiate.

282
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
You might get back about a million.

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,240
Admit defeat.

284
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,160
Only one million?

285
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,180
Which should I choose?

286
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,080
Logically,

287
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,750
you should get what the contract says.

288
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,200
But then again,

289
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,080
a million isn't enough for you to spend?

290
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,960
Moreover, neither of these

291
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,410
companies seems simple.

292
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,360
It's not worth it to go head-to-head.

293
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,670
It's not your style either.

294
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
What's my style?

295
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,160
Money-minded.

296
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,000
You're not a person to argue with reason.

297
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,430
Besides,

298
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,910
you're not the type to stick to principles.

299
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,270
So you earn more than others.

300
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,030
Luo Yingzi,

301
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,840
don't you know

302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,850
the case that made Chen Shuo famous?

303
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,270
A client once tried to welsh on me.

304
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,560
I sued him.

305
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,970
The contract amount was one yuan.

306
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:49,960
You know why?

307
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,910
It wasn't about the money, but the principle.

308
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,870
Of course I know.

309
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,840
Fang Lihong has told both me and Qiu Hua.

310
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,150
But come on,

311
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,680
can their backgrounds

312
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,240
and contract amounts be the same?

313
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,360
One person, one group,

314
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
what's the difference?

315
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,550
Stubborn.

316
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,250
I'm giving you advice here,

317
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,750
and you won't even thank me?

318
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,240
Luo Yingzi, do you know...

319
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,990
why I asked you here today?

320
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,610
You're confused

321
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,550
and want to ask for my opinion.

322
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,240
That day going to Wanxian,

323
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,720
I was just a quiet driver.

324
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
I was like a persistent dog,

325
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,270
sticking to you,

326
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,200
While you just

327
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,600
kept chatting with Xu Zhuo

328
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,240
non-stop,

329
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
completely ignoring me.

330
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,840
What do you mean today?

331
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,070
You actually agreed to have a drink with me.

332
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,410
Now

333
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,570
you're blaming me?

334
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm drinking with you,

335
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,250
not with Mr. Xu, right?

336
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,560
Understand me, will you?

337
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,500
This Dingxin case is our firm's

338
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,710
first big job.

339
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,020
I'm under a lot of pressure.

340
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,510
Moreover,

341
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,150
I have to work with an expert

342
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,240
like Mr. Xu.

343
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm afraid of making a fool of myself.

344
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,440
I want to do everything perfectly.

345
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,810
You haven't seen much of the world.

346
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,370
Is Xu Zhuo really an expert?

347
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,350
Is he?

348
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,030
I think,

349
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,630
if Mr. Xu were to face this,

350
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,640
if someone tried to welsh on him,

351
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,240
given his unwavering

352
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,630
commitment to the law and principles,

353
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,870
♫Why are your eyes squinting?♫

354
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,150
even if he were jailed,

355
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,060
he'd still want to get to the truth.

356
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,240
Learn from Mr. Xu.

357
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,360
For the sake of the law,

358
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,150
♫Awaiting a breeze♫

359
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,730
he'd forsake everything.

360
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,040
Okay?

361
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,970
No.

362
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,810
Why should I learn from him?

363
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,210
♫To wake her up♫

364
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,360
Is he constantly brainwashing you

365
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,810
with Petőfi's poems?

366
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,670
Packaging himself

367
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,960
into a national hero

368
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,250
♫The sun on her shoulders♫

369
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,440
to gild his lily.

370
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,870
This narcissist.

371
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,930
♫And the weight of the rain♫

372
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,150
But he has been consistently supporting

373
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,030
the disabled in the judiciary for over a decade.

374
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,410
♫She never mentioned it♫

375
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,000
Isn't that a fact?

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,030

What?

383
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,420
You can't talk about anything else but him?

384
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,750

keep some distance.

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,230

Hold the bow like this,

462
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,550
place it under your chin,

463
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,200
close your left eye, open your right eye,

464
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,780
and then shoot.

465
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,380
It's actually quite easy. Practice it yourself.

466
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,370
Okay.

467
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,880
You seem off.

468
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,350
How much did you drink yesterday?

469
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,110
Sober up.

470
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,480
About Luo Yingzi?

471
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I misjudged her.

472
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,410
Since I was young, my view on relationships has always

473
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,750
been to pass through a hundred flowers without a single leaf sticking to me.

474
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,540
I never give my true feelings to anyone.

475
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,310
But after meeting Luo Yingzi,

476
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,820
I knew I was done for.

477
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,750
I was losing my mind.

478
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,000
But I don't regret it.

479
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,650
I'm willing to.

480
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,720
But after going through all these things,

481
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,850
I'm disappointed in her.

482
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,400
All she cares about now is

483
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,750
the empty fame and halo of being a success.

484
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,160
No matter what I do,

485
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,590
I want her to see my existence,

486
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,260
but she can't see it.

487
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,310
I've figured it out.

488
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,440
I'll stay single from now on.

489
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,680
I won't give my feelings

490
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,780
to anyone anymore.

491
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,780
I won't be infatuated or suffer anymore.

492
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,120
How can you be so sure that she has no feelings for you?

493
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm very sure.

494
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,310
She's now completely obsessed

495
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,460
with that fame-seeking hypocrite.

496
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,670
Well,

497
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,420
it's common

498
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,270
for a woman to be confused

499
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,310
sometimes.

500
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,730
Luo Yingzi may seem smart,

501
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,030
but she can't escape this rule either.

502
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,590
We have to give her time

503
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,790
to let her wake up.

504
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,640
Wake up?

505
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
What about me before she wakes up?

506
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,110
I have to turn into a stone there,

507
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,310
always waving at her.

508
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm here. I'm waiting for you.

509
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,400
Am I that bored?

510
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Anyway, from now on,

511
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,360
if I ever get jealous, infatuated, or silly again,

512
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,620
you should kick me. Kick me awake.

513
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,650
I want to kick you right now.

514
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,420
Aren't you being jealous right now?

515
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,490
No, I think it's good.

516
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,790
I've said everything

517
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,550
I wanted to say,

518
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,510
I'm happy.

519
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,910
From now on, I'll just be a money-grabber.

520
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,000
Earning money is my top priority.

521
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,790
That's right.

522
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,510
Well...

523
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,140
I've transferred 200,000 to you.

524
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,140
Check it.

525
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,310
And

526
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,430
tell me how much the information

527
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,510
you provided today is worth.

528
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,840
Let's drop it for today.

529
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,110
If you insist on giving,

530
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,690
the more, the better.

531
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,520
Profit talk, true mates.

532
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,320
Bye.

533
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,540
Shuo,

534
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,920
well,

535
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,050
don't confront Mingshan

536
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,960
head-on about that matter.

537
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,110
Get what you deserve,

538
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,440
and take as much of the remaining money as you can.

539
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,280
If you can't earn the money this time,

540
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,680
you can earn it next time.

541
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,590
The key is

542
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,930
not to hurt yourself.

543
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,160
I'm not the same Chen Shuo as before.

544
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,790
Now I can only fight.

545
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,740
Thanks for your concern.

546
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,640
Bye.

547
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,070
Take care.

548
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,750
Call me.

549
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,350
Won't even open the door.

550
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,020
Sir, who are you looking for?

551
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm Chen Shuo, a lawyer from Liangcheng Law Firm.

552
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,830
I'm here to see Mr. Sun.

553
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,270
Sorry, you can't go in.

554
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,480
I was allowed in last time.

555
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,810
We haven't received any instructions.

556
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,160
You need instructions?

557
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,960
Ms. Liu, it's Chen Shuo.

558
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,830
I'm here to see Mr. Sun.

559
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,110
The security downstairs won't let me in.

560
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,430
Mr. Chen.

561
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,590
Ms. Liu, sorry to trouble you.

562
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,490
What brings you here?

563
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,710
I'm here for something.

564
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,510
I was allowed in last time.

565
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,660
Why not this time?

566
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,800
It's to guard against me?

567
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,750
Mr. Chen, you must be joking.

568
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,350
What brings you here today?

569
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,110
Well,

570
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,630
I'm heading back to the firm

571
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,960
and send you a letter on behalf of

572
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
Liangcheng Law Firm,

573
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,630
requesting to withdraw our first installment

574
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,190
of the retainer fee from the joint account.

575
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,230
Is there any problem on your side?

576
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,510
Wait, Mr. Chen.

577
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,830
Didn't Mr. Sun already

578
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,720
talk to you about the execution payment?

579
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,650
You need to transfer the 20 million to us first

580
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,550
so that the factory can arrange production.

581
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,900
Once we get our business back on track,

582
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,200
you'll get your pay.

583
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,440
No, no, no.

584
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,850
That's not how it works, Ms. Liu.

585
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,960
We're not bargaining here like buying vegetables.

586
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,010
Like if I buy 1 kg of eggplants

587
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,000
you'll give me some free green onion.

588
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,310
We need to follow the contract.

589
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,350
You can't make the decision.

590
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,420
I'll go see Mr. Sun.

591
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,250
Mr. Chen,

592
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,770
Mr. Sun is in a meeting

593
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,240
and won't see anyone today.

594
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,060
In a meeting

595
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,550
with Minghai?

596
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,830
So you're violating the contract.

597
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,480
I have to see him even more.

598
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,400
Mr. Chen. Security, security.

599
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,720
No, you're violating the contract.

600
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,680
Sir, sir, sir.

601
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,640
Mr. Chen, you really can't go in today.

602
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,590
How about we reschedule?

603
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,680
Come on,

604
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
is Mr. Sun afraid of seeing me?

605
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,460
Or do you never intend to pay the money?

606
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,240
You can talk to Mr. Sun about the money later.

607
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,050
I'm sorry.

608
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,480
Mentor, how's Mingshan doing now?

609
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,830
They must have reconciled with Minghai behind our backs.

610
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,550
I just went to Mingshan,

611
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,750
but the security guard stopped me.

612
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,250
I didn't even get to see Sun Mingshan.

613
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,110
These people are really treacherous.

614
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,460
Fang Rui,

615
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,590
draft a letter right away and send it to them,

616
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,790
demanding they fulfill the contract

617
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,750
and transfer the first installment of the money to us quickly.

618
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,440
I calculated, it should be more than five million.

619
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,030
5.62474 million.

620
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,240
Alright, no need to be so precise.

621
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,790
Ignore the decimal points.

622
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,110
Just get them to transfer the money to us quickly.

623
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,380
After the letter is drafted,

624
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,160
have me review it.

625
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,830
If there's no problem,

626
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,040
stamp it and send it to them.

627
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,030
I'll notify them right now.

628
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,350
Mentor, one more thing.

629
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,460
Mingshan Group sent a notice of demand.

630
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,450
Take a look.

631
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,870
It says to transfer the 20 million execution payment

632
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,510
from the joint account to them.

633
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,490
This notice was sent directly to our law firm.

634
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,590
What's going on?

635
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,350
The debtor is more anxious than the debt collector.

636
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,880
Chen Shuo,

637
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,880
come to my office.

638
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,190
I'd like to discuss something with you.

639
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,560
Alright, I'm on my way.

640
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,070
Didn't I just say

641
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,590
to draft a letter right away?

642
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,750
Why are you just standing there?

643
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
I know about this.

644
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,240
After all, I have more experience than you.

645
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,870
I've thought of

646
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,260
these things early on.

647
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,920
The more the situation is like this,

648
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,660
the less we should rush.

649
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,100
Don't go head-on.

650
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,940
The execution payment

651
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,650
has already arrived in the joint account.

652
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,440
I think

653
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,030
we should withdraw it.

654
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,840
Withdraw as much as we should.

655
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,350
This is to show them

656
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,400
we're not pushovers.

657
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,890
We have ways to deal with them.

658
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,790
But after withdrawing,

659
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,190
we need to negotiate with them immediately.

660
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,510
Draft a supplementary agreement,

661
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,720
and discuss a price acceptable to both parties.

662
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:52,880
No.

663
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,850
Mingshan is not an ordinary private enterprise.

664
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,950
They have connections.

665
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,110
We can't confront them head-on.

666
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,570
It's enough for us to withdraw the money from

667
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,270
the joint account.

668
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,880
We are lawyers.

669
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,750
How do lawyers make money?

670
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,130
By time.

671
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,960
You're wasting a lot of time

672
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,420
on this case.

673
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,720
With this time,

674
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
you could have earned this money

675
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,670
from somewhere else.

676
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,270
Mr. Han.

677
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,680
I really appreciate you

678
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
telling me all this sincerely.

679
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,260
But I'm in charge of

680
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,060
this case.

681
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,510
I have the final say.

682
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,720
Now I'm telling you my attitude.

683
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
I will fight against Mingshan.

684
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,680
I will get

685
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
every penny they owe me.

686
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,960
As for your share, don't worry.

687
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,110
Once the money arrives,

688
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,120
I will transfer it to your account.

689
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,480
Alright, I'm leaving.

690
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,200
Did Mingshan disagree?

691
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,080
They didn't say so,

692
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,160
but they're just playing dumb.

693
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,830
I went to see Sun Mingshan,

694
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,030
but the security guard wouldn't let me in.

695
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,960
Later, the secretary came down,

696
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,720
but whatever I asked her, she was evasive,

697
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,830
saying she couldn't make the decision.

698
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,240
Anyway, I made it clear.

699
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,590
I said I would send them a letter,

700
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
demanding they pay our first installment

701
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,350
of the agency fee as per the agreement.

702
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
But they didn't listen.

703
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,720
Today, they sent another notice of demand,

704
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,000
asking us to cooperate

705
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,550
and transfer the 20 million execution

706
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,510
payment to them.

707
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,280
So, what are you thinking?

708
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,540
I was thinking,

709
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,030
Ms. Fang, how about this?

710
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,480
The firm gives me authorization,

711
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,910
and I go to the bank and suspend that U-Shield

712
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,030
in their possession.

713
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,380
I'm a lawyer.

714
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,400
Everything I do

715
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,830
is to protect the firm's

716
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,270
and my own best interests.

717
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,140
Alright, then you go to Zhang Zhi and get one.

718
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,960
Fang Rui, I'm going out.

719
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,650
Mentor, I'll do the errand.

720
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,350
This time, keep that U-Shield safe.

721
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,160
Okay.

722
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,030
I'm your assistant.

723
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,270
We should take the responsibility together.

724
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,240
Give me the letter. I...

725
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,960
Don't.

726
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,480
Don't worry. Thank you.

727
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,240
You're welcome.

728
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,030
Keep it well.

729
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,880
Bye. Take care.

730
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll keep it well.

731
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,880
I don't know

732
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
what will happen next.

733
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,680
I don't want to get you involved.

734
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,800
Be good.

735
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,410
Mr. Chen,

736
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,000
after deducting the firm's share,

737
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
there's still 4.48 million.

738
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,440
After taxes,

739
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,160
shall I transfer it all to your account?

740
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,640
Transfer 20%

741
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,770
to Mr. Han Zhitong's account.

742
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,570
Besides,

743
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm going on vacation

744
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,920
tomorrow.

745
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,070
If it's convenient for you,

746
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,790
please notify Mingshan that

747
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,640
we've withdrawn our share

748
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,960
as per the agreement,

749
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,200
and the rest is their money

750
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,820
which can be transferred to their account at any time.

751
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,000
Well,

752
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,030
Chen Shuo said he's already sent a letter to Mingshan,

753
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,270
demanding distribution as per the agreement.

754
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,550
Are you aware of this?

755
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,960
He told me.

756
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,070
But Mingshan ignored him.

757
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,820
This case was handled by the two of you.

758
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,440
What are you going to do?

759
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,590
Mr. Chen, come here.

760
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,640
What's up?

761
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,220
I'm here to report on the work.

762
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,890
Is it okay?

763
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,440
I've withdrawn 5.6 million

764
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,550
proportionally of Mingshan's money

765
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,110
and transferred to our firm's account.

766
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,480
According to the agreement I signed with the firm,

767
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm supposed to get 80%,

768
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,200
which should be 4.48 million.

769
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,790
Can I...

770
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,220
withdraw the money?

771
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,350
Sure.

772
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,130
Leave the taxes and take the rest.

773
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,720
Mr. Han.

774
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,550
Although we've divided 4.48 million,

775
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,060
all the cost at the beginning is over one million.

776
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,590
Now you've changed your face.

777
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,520
Don't worry. I won't deduct the money this time.

778
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,240
Your 20% has been

779
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
transferred to your account.

780
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,130
Check it yourself.

781
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,360
Okay.

782
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,520
No. Well...

783
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,000
It's not right

784
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,300
not to deduct for the costs.

785
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,410
In that case, I'll transfer back 300,000 to you.

786
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,690
Consider it as the cost.

787
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,550
There's no need.

788
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,110
You've done a lot in the early stage, Mr. Han.

789
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,850
Thank you.

790
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,310
If you really want to be do it,

791
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,270
next time, okay?

792
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,610
One more thing, Ms. Fang.

793
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,060
I want to take a vacation.

794
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,510
No problem.

795
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,990
Just make sure everything at the firm is sorted out.

796
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,960
I've already arranged everything at the firm.

797
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,290
Also, there are just a few loose ends

798
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,110
with the execution.

799
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,410
I've spoken to the court.

800
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,320
They said it's fine.

801
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,350
Okay.

802
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,590
I'm leaving.

803
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,790
Sorry to disturb you all.

804
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,000
Besides,

805
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,750
Ms. Fang, I won't be answering my phone

806
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,730
during the vacation.

807
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,750
Just for this one case,

808
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,110
he's made a few million.

809
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,480
That's just the first installment.

810
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,270
Right.

811
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,160
Why?

812
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,940
How much do we earn from the cases we handle?

813
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,030
His case only had one court session, right?

814
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,440
The profit-sharing ratio was agreed upon by the firm.

815
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,640
We're all in the legal field.

816
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,830
Can we have some contractual spirit here?

817
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,570
Han, you...

818
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,160
If you're envious,

819
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,490
you can do the same.

820
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,560
I have to go. See you.

821
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,480
Mr. Xu, I'll follow your car.

822
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,020
It's okay. You can take my car.

823
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,270
Does it bother you

824
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,780
how we talk?

825
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,810
You're with Mr. Xu.

826
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,410
Who is with you?

827
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,830
Are you ever going to stop?

828
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,250
So annoying.

829
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,720
Now Mingshan and Minghai

830
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,120
♫Shoulders covered in morning dew♫

831
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,000
negotiated secretly.

832
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,850
Mingshan is playing a delaying tactic.

833
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,080
♫Facing the sunrise, with the crowd at my back♫

834
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,850
They tricked you.

835
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,780
Mingshan is not an ordinary private enterprise.

836
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,840
They have connections.

837
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,900
♫Hearing the baby crying♫

838
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,930
We can't confront them head-on.

839
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,240
A million isn't enough for you to spend?

840
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,240
♫Suddenly recalling the very start♫

841
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,920
It's not worth it to go head-to-head.

842
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,270
It's not your style either.

843
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,880
What's my style?

844
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,010
♫Floating between black and white♫

845
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,620
Money-minded.

846
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,200
You're not a person to argue with reason.

847
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:19,400
♫The lantern-bearer fears not the storm or fog♫

848
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,000
Besides, you're not

849
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,200
the type to stick to principles.

850
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,810
♫The seeker of light in the distance♫

851
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,510
So you earn more than others.

852
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:28,070
♫Wishes to light your way♫

853
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,510
All she cares about now is

854
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,880
the empty fame and halo of being a success.

855
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,120
No matter what I do,

856
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,290
♫No need to ask♫

857
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,750
I want her to see my existence,

858
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,790
♫Whether right or wrong, rise or fall♫

859
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,510
but she can't see it.

860
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,270
I'd look for someone

861
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,660
♫The path of chasing the wind alone♫

862
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,430

Hello, my name is Chen Shuo.

873
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,210

00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:08,929
Hello.

00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,320
I'll take you to the dorm to clean up.

877
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,070
You know the phone needs to be handed over, right?

878
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,510
No problem, here you go.

879
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,250

There's still no news from Han?

896
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,990
I called him last weekend and he said

897
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,920
he hadn't come back yet.

898
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,920
Really?

899
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,660
How could it take a week to get evidence?

900
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
He said there was a minor mishap,

901
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,000
and asked for another week.

902
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,030
This old fox isn't playing tricks on us, is he?

903
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,230
No way.

904
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,440
Liu Jianming doesn't want to go to court, right?

905
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,590
If he doesn't want to go to court,

906
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,030
he'll have to negotiate with us.

907
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,340
He won't do anything else, will he?

908
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,760
Alright, I'm leaving.

909
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,400
The work at Zhuoyue Law Firm isn't finished yet.

910
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,030
Okay.

911
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,440
Bye.

Hello, Luo.

919
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,410
Xia Shu, check the time

00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,230
of the last post Liu Jianming made online,

921
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,670
and see if it's been more than five years.

922
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,420
Okay.

923
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,940

924
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,440
Luo, come back.

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,030
come and see.

When Xiao Nannan was a junior in college,

929
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,850
Liu Jianming posted a new

March 1st, 2013.

933
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,960
It was this act that completely broke Xiao Nannan.

934
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,230
The next month, she dropped out of school.

935
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,110
Today is March 2nd.

936
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,320
The maximum sentence for defamation is less than three years.

937
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,190
For crimes with a maximum sentence

938
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,280
of less than five years,

939
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
after five years, prosecution no longer takes place.

940
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,960
Today it's already expired.

941
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,710
We've been tricked by that old fox.

942
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,880
He must have calculated the statute of limitations.

943
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,050
At that time, it was less than half a month left.

944
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,710
He kept finding all sorts of excuses to delay.

945
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,000
Now he's finally dragged it past.

946
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,840
Xia Shu, come with me.

947
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,720
Let's go find him.

948
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,280
What's the point of going to find him now?

949
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,480
We have to find him.

950
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,460
We can't just let it go.

951
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,190
Let's go.

952
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,800
Ms. Luo, Ms. Xia, what's the matter?

953
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,830
Looking for Han.

954
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,490
No.

955
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,360
What's going on?

956
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,260
I'm sorry.

957
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,080
Mr. Han said he's busy with a case.

958
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,800
Please make an appointment with him.

959
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,960
Okay, tell Director Han

960
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,210
I'm going to the parking lot to see if his car is there.

961
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,150
If the car's there and he still doesn't show up,

962
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,370
then don't blame me.

963
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,080
Luo, what are you doing here?

964
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,840
Tell Han

965
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,190
I’ll give him one minute.

966
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,030
What are you doing?

967
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,010
Open it for me.

968
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,290
Luo, it's my fault.

969
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,760
You and Qiu have been busy with Zhuoyue Law Firm.

970
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,830
I should have thought of this.

971
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,550
Stop it.

972
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,280
Our car is over there.

973
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,910
I know.

974
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,110
Hello.

975
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,630
I'm at the parking lot

976
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,710
of Liangcheng Law Firm's building.

977
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,720
One of the cars got into my car.

978
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,310
The license plate number is Bei A03088.

979
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,070
Can you notify the owner and ask him to come down

980
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,170
to discuss compensation with me? Okay?

981
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,940
I'll wait by his car.

982
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,960
Wait here.

983
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,770
He will come down soon.

984
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,000
What...

985
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,280
Stop looking.

986
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,050
Director Han,

987
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,880
do you think this is appropriate?

988
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,050
Yingzi, I think you're so cute now.

989
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,510
It's like two people in the ring.

990
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,620
You tell me which punch is okay, which one isn't.

991
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,400
This case has passed

992
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,880
the statutory prosecution period.

993
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,410
To be exact, there's no case anymore.

994
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,320
What you should do now

995
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,040
is follow our advice

996
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,510
and help the parties become friends.

997
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,590
My hopeless nephew

998
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,600
is having a divorce with his wife.

999
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,480
If Ms. Xiao doesn't mind,

1000
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,070
I think they...

1001
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,960
What are you talking about?

1002
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,190
What do you mean by that?

1003
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,510
Are you speaking human language?

1004
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,670
I may not speak human language,

1005
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,590
but I don't do inhumane things.

1006
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,880
You're doing criminal private prosecution

1007
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,400
over something trivial,

1008
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,960
and you didn't even notice the statute of limitations passed.

1009
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,530
Do you call that human behavior?

1010
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,630
And you still dare come here

1011
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,630
and kick my car?

1012
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,600
I'm telling you,

1013
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
if you really damage it,

1014
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,400
I'll charge you with intentional property damage.

1015
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,110
Let’s go.

1016
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,070
Luo, don’t be angry. It’s all my fault.

1017
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,110
I don’t deserve to be a lawyer.

1018
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,670
How could I overlook something as sensitive as

1019
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,710
the statute of limitations,

1020
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,410
and lose to someone like Han?

1021
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,630
Back already?

1022
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,150
No results, right?

1023
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,480
Qiu Hua, I don't want this year's

1024
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,400
year-end bonus.

1025
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,920
I'm just a big fool.

1026
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,070
Don't worry.

1027
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,280
It's not hopeless.

1028
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,710
As for defamation, many opinions

1029
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,920
say the limitation period

1030
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,150
can start from the end of the act.

1031
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
I just checked.

1032
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,560
Liu Jianming hasn't posted anything new,

1033
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,030
but the old posts

1034
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,400
are still online.

1035
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,030
You can still search them today.

1036
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,610
So, his harm to Xiao Nannan

1037
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,920
is ongoing.

1038
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,510
In this sense,

1039
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,400
the statute of limitations hasn't expired.

1040
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,630
I know. I thought about it on the way.

1041
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,110
But who knows

1042
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,730
how the judge will rule?

1043
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,360
They will definitely argue

1044
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,490
that the harm ended five years ago.

1045
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,240
Then let's give it a shot.

1046
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,180
We'll try our best.

1047
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,190
But if Xiao Nannan goes to court

1048
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,380
and loses,

1049
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,700
isn't that just more harm to her?

1050
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,110
The more I think about it, the more I feel I can't forgive myself.

1051
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Criminal private prosecution is already hard to win,

1052
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,030
and then this Han set me up.

1053
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,070
We should honestly

1054
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,710
tell Xiao Nannan about the situation

1055
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,870
and let her decide.

1056
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,070
I'll call Xiao Nannan.

1057
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,700
I'm really sorry.

1058
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,830
It was my oversight.

1059
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,070
I apologize to both of you.

1060
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,480
I see.

1061
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,000
Ms. Xiao, Mr. Yang,

1062
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,440
about your case,

1063
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,550
the three of us discuss it together often.

1064
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm also often criticized by these two.

1065
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,230
But today, I want to

1066
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,840
express my opinion again.

1067
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,110
Even if the case could be filed,

1068
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,960
the chances of the judge ruling the harm is still ongoing

1069
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,280
are small.

1070
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,360
That is to say, Ms. Xiao might

1071
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,020
face the awkward situation

1072
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,560
of not getting legal relief

1073
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,760
and being

1074
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,550
harmed again.

1075
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,030
So,

1076
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,230
I still stick to my opinion.

1077
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,150
Ms. Xiao,

1078
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,630
rather than asking the world for help,

1079
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,880
it's better to rely on yourself.

1080
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,110
Force yourself to become stronger in the face of harm.

1081
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,140
I've decided.

1082
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,490
I'm going to fight this lawsuit.
