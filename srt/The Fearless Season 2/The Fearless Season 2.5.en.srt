[Episode 5]

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,640
You wanted to use him to get rid of He Ming

4
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,789
and then have Xu Jianshe sent back to prison,

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,550
but unexpectedly

6
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,420
He Ming caught wind of it and ran off,

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,900
ruining your plan.

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,509
Am I right?

9
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,470
You two are overthinking this.

10
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm not that capable.

11
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,979
Besides,

12
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,520
if Xu Jianshe does end up in prison,

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,230
you can't expect me to live like a widow forever.

14
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,380
Ms. Ma,

15
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,110
let's not dodge the real issue, okay?

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,360
He Ming has already fled,

17
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,280
and as long as Xu Jianshe isn't caught,

18
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,250
He Ming won't dare come back.

19
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,110
Your plan to use others to eliminate him won't work.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
Do you know what's going on with Xu Jianshe now?

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,340
He's a fugitive wanted by the police,

22
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,700
and who knows what he might be up to

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,120
while in hiding.

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,829
Harboring him is already a crime.

25
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,750
If he commits another crime,

26
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,870
you'll be his accomplice,

27
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,190
and the punishment will be even harsher.

28
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,550
You should think for yourself now.

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,710
The smartest choice

30
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,380
is to turn him in voluntarily.

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,190
Let's not even talk about anything else;

32
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,620
your personal safety

33
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,910
would at least be guaranteed, right?

34
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,720
I'll take that as true.

35
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,150
Xu Jianshe has been on the run for quite a few days now.

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,150
If I were to hand him over to the police now,

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,020
wouldn't that count as harboring a fugitive?

38
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,360
I mean if,

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,700
I'm just saying, not that it's true.

40
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,800
But if you willingly hand him over,

41
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,820
we are willing to represent you as your lawyers.

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,930
Harboring him earlier was definitely a crime.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,480
However, if you voluntarily hand him over and show remorse,

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,750
we will do everything we can to

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,450
help reduce your sentence.

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,910
I knew you two were waiting for this.

47
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,070
You still haven't given me back

48
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,030
the money you pocketed from me before.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
Let me ask you,

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,400
if I hand this case over to you two,

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,100
can you guarantee that my assets will be protected?

52
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,860
Ma Lili,

53
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,750
are those really your assets?

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,350
If Xu Jianshe is actually caught at your place,

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,320
the matter of you illegally transferring his assets

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,250
will come back to light.

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,520
When he finds out what role you played in all this,

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,630
do you think he'll still let you

59
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,150
manage his money?

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Besides,

61
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,640
you've already made plenty off of him.

62
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Be satisfied.

63
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,890
What's more, what could be more important than life?

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,870
Let me think.

65
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,329
I'll let you know once I've made up my mind.

66
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,770

I'd like to hire a lawyer as my representative.

Auntie, my surname is Xia.

Auntie Song,

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
what cases did you mention earlier?

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
Someone owes me money,

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,390
but I can't get it back now,

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,790
so I'd like to hire a lawyer as my representative.

126
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,470
How much does she owe you?

127
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,960
Auntie, here's the thing.

128
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,400
I need to remind you that

129
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,880
filing a lawsuit comes with costs.

130
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,860
It's not worth it if it's too small.

131
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,960
She owes me over three million.

132
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Over three million?

133
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,450
Including the part without evidence,

134
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,260
it's close to five million.

135
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,200
That much?

136
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,670
You just said you have evidence.

137
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,310
The evidence means the other party's IOU,

138
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,500
bank statements, or something similar.

139
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,370
Do you have those?

140
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,580
Yes, I do.

141
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,280
Here.

142
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,240

Let me see.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Are all these real?

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,310
Could they possibly be forged by me?

146
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,430
No, I didn't mean that.

147
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,450
The amount involved in your case is significant.

148
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,750
I'll need to go back and inform my two partners first.

149

Then I'll set up a time to meet with you. Okay?

150

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,180
Xia Shu?

189
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,910
Hello, Xia Shu. What's wrong?

190
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,460
Luo.

191
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,940
Where are you and Qiu?

192
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,990
Wait, what's wrong with your voice?

193
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,890
What happened?

194
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:18,820
I...

195
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,360
I...

196
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,020
I was driving

197
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,480
out to handle a case

198
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
and got hit by someone.

199
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,210
He

200
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,630
ran away,

201
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,150
and I'm injured.

202
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,490
My phone's dead too.

203
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,850
Can you

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,920
come pick me up?

205
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,030
Xia Shu, you're injured?

206
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,960
Is it serious?

207
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,790
Hurry and send us your address,

208
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,120
we'll come get you right now.

209
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,030
I'm

210
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,300
at the No. 3 Warehouse, the No. 3 Plastic Factory

211
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,990
on Pingling Road.

212
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,600
What case is she handling at the plastic factory?

213
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,740
Xia Shu's car was sold long ago.

214
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,800
She couldn't have crashed.

215
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,270
Something must have happened to her.

216
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,580
Could it be Xu Jianshe?

217
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,210
Boss.

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I'm begging you.

219
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,410
You're seeking revenge

220
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,170
on the wrong person.

221
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,150
We've always wanted to help you.

222
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,260
The two of them have been looking for you,

223
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,870
wanting you to turn yourself in

224
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,330
so you can get a reduced sentence.

225
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,150
It's Ma Lili

226
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,410
who has been lying to you.

227
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,770
She is together with another man now.

228
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,360
Go on;

229
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,410
keep talking.

230
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
It was her who caused all of this.

231
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,390
She gave us 300,000

232
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,720
at the time,

233
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,130
and then she wanted it back.

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,400
We barely managed to get your case sent back for retrial,

235
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,610
and then she replaced us.

236
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,580
She never had any intention of getting you out.

237
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,950
Keep making up stories.

238
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,340
Let me tell you,

239
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
in all the time I've been in prison,

240
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,120
only Lili came to see me.

241
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,560
She even took care of my mother for me.

242
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,720
Your mother

243
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,540
has been dead for a long time.

244
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,410
It's true.

245
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,520
What are you talking about?

246
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,960
What are you talking about?

247
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,490
Say it again!

248
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,750
It's true.

249
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,840
It's true.

250
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,450
I swear.

251
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,990
Your mother passed away

252
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
while we were handling your case.

253
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,820
Ma Lili has been lying to you all along.

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,250
She wants to control you.

255
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,190
She wants to keep you in check.

256
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,120
She wants your property.

257
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,480
It's true.

258
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,740
She's dating

259
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,340
a lawyer named He Ming now.

260
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,040
They're living in your house,

261
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,100
and spending your money.

262
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,320
If you don't believe me,

263
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,180
you can call to confirm.

264
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,210
You can call to confirm.

265
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm not lying.

266
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,260
Fine.

267
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,120
Fine.

268
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,740
Sister.

269
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,390
It's me,

270
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,280
Jianshe.

271
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,630
Jianshe.

272
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm here, Jianshe.

273
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,030
Jianshe.

274
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,760
I've brought the money for you, Jianshe.

275
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,680
Jian...

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,870
Rui.

277
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,310
What should we do?

278
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,700
Go outside and call for backup.

279
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,330
Walk quietly.

280
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,920
Jianshe.

281
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,790
Jianshe, what are you doing?

282
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,720
Jianshe, I'm here to give you money.

283
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,390
Jianshe.

284
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,500
Take the money and run.

285
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,470
Money?

286
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,170
Yes.

287
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,650
Jianshe, what are you doing?

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,829
Jianshe.

289
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,660
You want my money, right?

290
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
My mother died,

291
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,880
right?

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,089
No, Jianshe.

293
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,540
I'm taking good care of her.

294
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,250
I'm taking good care of her.

295
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,920
Who told you that?

296
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,190
She.

297
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,390
You bitch!

298
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,410
Jianshe,

299
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,980
don't listen to these lawyers.

300
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,790
None of them is good.

301
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,930
The three of them have cheated us out of so much money!

302
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,550
Jianshe.

303
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,330
Do you still...

304
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,370
Let me ask you,

305
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
where were you

306
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,400
when my mother died?

307
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,000
Jianshe.

308
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,490
She's fine, Jianshe.

309
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,120
Jianshe.

310
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,960
Jianshe, I was wrong.

311
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,320
Stop beating me, Jianshe.

312
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,720
How dare you spend my money

313
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,240
while sleeping with another man?

314
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,050
No.

315
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
How dare you lie to me about my mother's death.

316
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
It wasn't me, Jianshe.

317
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,320
It wasn't me; it's He Ming.

318
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,580
Let me explain.

319
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,020
It's He Ming.

320
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,280
He Ming knew that I transferred the money.

321
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,400
He wanted to send me to jail, Jianshe!

322
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,330
If I went to jail, how could I save you, Jianshe?

323
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,830
Jianshe!

324
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,110
Go die!

325
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:15,930
Don't move!

326
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,030
I'm a cop.

327
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't come here!

328
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,030
Xu Jianshe,

329
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,510
if you're still a man,

330
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,440
don't take your anger out on women when things go wrong.

331
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,460
Put the knife down and you still have a chance.

332
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,030
My life's worthless.

333
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,610
I'll die anyway.

334
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,630
Officer,

335
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,890
you have only two choices right now:

336
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,770
One,

337
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,610
we all die here.

338
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,110
Two,

339
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,570
you bring Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua here;

340
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,960
I have something to ask them.

341
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,880
Call them here!

342
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,510
Captain Zhang.

343
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,210
Shang, what's going on inside?

344
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,200
The wanted criminal Xu Jianshe has taken two hostages.

345
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,990
The floor is covered with gasoline.

346
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,320
Captain Wang is inside trying to calm him down,

347
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,510
but he's still very agitated.

348
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,440
Ms. Luo.

349
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,760
You can't go in there.

350
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,520
Is Xia Shu kidnapped by Xu Jianshe?

351
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Is Xia Shu injured?

352
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,270
Rui is taking care of it inside.

353
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,470
Reinforcements have arrived.

354
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,600
You all should listen to me

355
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,430
and wait in the car.

356
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,030
Officer Shang, Xu Jianshe taking Xia Shu hostage

357
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,050
is definitely because he's looking for us.

358
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
We must go in.

359
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,590
Besides, Officer Wang is inside.

360
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,960
As long as we don't get close to Xu Jianshe,

361
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,790
we won't be in danger.

362
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,680
Please let us in.

363
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,000
We're on a mission.

364
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,880
-Hello, Officer Wang.
-Follow my instructions.

365
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,720
Go back to the car.

366
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
We're at the entrance of the warehouse.

367
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,420
But they won't let us in now.

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,480
Okay.

369
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,720
It's Officer Wang's call.

370
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,860
Hello, Rui.

371
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,370
Shang.

372
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,810
Bring them in.

373
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,070
Get up!

374
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,890
Calm down.

375
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,400
They'll be here soon.

376
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,720
Jianshe.

377
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,070
Jianshe.

378
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,410
Ms. Luo.

379
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,400
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

380
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,880
The entire underground is filled with gasoline,

381
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,400
and he still has a lighter in his hand.

382
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,950
We can't shoot easily.

383
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
Xu Jianshe wants to talk to you.

384
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,610
Don't irritate him.

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,920
Xu Jianshe.

386
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,590
The people you want to see are here.

387
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,070
Can you release the hostages?

388
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,410
I want to ask them

389
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
why didn't you tell me

390
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,220
about my mother's death?

391
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,510
Jianshe, it's all my fault.

392
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,450
Shut up!

393
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,200
Xu Jianshe.

394
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,430
We didn't know that

395
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,060
you were unaware of this matter as well at the time.

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,950
Ma Lili never told us

397
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,380
whether she had mentioned it to you.

398
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,070
During our interactions with you,

399
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,590
we felt that you had violent tendencies.

400
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,090
So,

401
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,010
we thought bringing up this matter

402
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,600
would trigger you

403
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,060
and affect the subsequent handling of the case,

404
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,650
which is why we didn't mention it to you.

405
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,090
You know Ma Lili lied to me, right?

406
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,150
We only found out

407
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,050
after we were replaced.

408
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,110
At that time, Ma Lili

409
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,270
repeatedly asked us to meet with you,

410
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,920
bringing along the power of attorney for you to sign

411
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,620
in order to handle your property.

412
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,380
We felt something was off,

413
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,850
and later we found out

414
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,660
she wanted to take your assets for herself.

415
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,200
Jianshe,

416
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,000
the two lawyers have deceived us out of so much money;

417
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,680
do you still believe them?

418
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,390
Shut up!

419
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,000
Why should I believe you two?

420
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,790
You used to tell me that my case

421
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,550
would receive a light sentence,

422
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,010
but in the end,

423
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,620
it turned out to be a heavy sentence with no possibility of parole.

424
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,600
Because your case lacked evidence,

425
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,290
there was room for discretion in the trial.

426
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,000
Ms. Luo and I focused on that point

427
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,080
and communicated with the court at the time.

428
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,550
As long as you actively cooperated with

429
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,480
the victim's family's compensation request,

430
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,240
the court also believed it could reduce your sentence,

431
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,240
but later…

432
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,240
Later,

433
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,920
it was replaced by He Ming, right?

434
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,280
Did they two get together?

435
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,990
No, Jianshe, he forced me.

436
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,560
He Ming forced me, Jianshe.

437
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,500
Jianshe, He Ming forced me to do it. It's true.

438
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,990
You deserve to die!

439
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,850
Xu Jianshe!

440
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,910
Xu Jianshe.

441
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,710
It's true.

442
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,490
He Ming did

443
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,870
help Ma Lili

444
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,910
transfer your property; that's true.

445
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,400
But He Ming also secretly hid evidence,

446
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,720
and he used that evidence to blackmail Ma Lili.

447
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,510
That's how he later became the vice president of Ma Lili's company.

448
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,490
Xu Jianshe,

449
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm telling you,

450
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
it's meaningless to talk about this now.

451
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
What's most important now

452
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,930
is that you need to understand one thing:

453
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,530
Ma Lili is definitely guilty.

454
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,420
She will face legal judgment.

455
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,680
But if you make your own crimes worse

456
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,800
because of her,

457
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,920
it will not be worth it.

458
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,810
Now, put down the knife,

459
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,920
put down the lighter,

460
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,440
and let the two hostages go.

461
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,920
You still have a chance.

462
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,580
My mother died.

463
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,170
Nothing matters anymore.

464
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,790
Who would give a prisoner a chance?

465
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,350
Xu Jianshe, there will be a chance.

466
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,750
As long as you surrender,

467
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,060
you can still seek leniency, Xu Jianshe.

468
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,920
I...

469
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,920
Both Ms. Qiu

470
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,880
and I

471
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,640
can become your attorney agents.

472
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,000
But if you really

473
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,480
intend to harm Ma Lili,

474
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,830
the punishment you'll face will also be greatly increased.

475
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,750
My mother died.

476
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,430
My mother died.

477
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,170
Xu Jianshe!

478
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,400
Xu Jianshe, think about your mother.

479
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,270
If she saw you like this now,

480
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,590
how heartbroken would she be?

481
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,210
You...

482
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,480
Don't you want to go to your mother's grave

483
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,450
and pay your respects?

484
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,660
She would definitely want you to live well.

485
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,650
Xu Jianshe.

486
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,960
Think about it.

487
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,410
Think about your mother.

488
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,340
Think about what the two lawyers said.

489
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Your mother doesn't want to see you like this.

490
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,040
You deserve to die!

491
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,200
Xu Jianshe!

492
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,630
I'll turn myself in.

493
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,010
Handcuffs! Hurry!

494
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,510
I have...

495
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,620
I have evidence proving Jianshe's guilt.

496
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,470
Xia Shu.

497
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,210
There's an ambulance outside.

498
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,750
It's alright now.

499
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,440
Let go of me!

500
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm innocent. Let go of me!

501
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,070
I can provide evidence against Xu Jianshe.

502
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,750
I can provide evidence against Xu Jianshe.

503
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:36,970
Goodbye.

504
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,400
Okay.

505
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,750
See you.

506
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,070
Thank you.

507
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,830
Hello?

508
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,470
I'm calling to ask you

509
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,090
if there's any progress with Xu Jianshe's matter.

510
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,050
Has he been arrested?

511
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,210
You called at the right time.

512
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,060
Xu Jianshe was arrested just now.

513
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,640
He has been arrested?

514
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,170
That's good.

515
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,510
I'm relieved.

516
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,960
I've been waiting downstairs at Luo Yingzi's place all afternoon,

517
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,860
I didn't eat.

518
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,060
I'm tired and hungry.

519
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,680
I'll head back now to eat.

520
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,320
Don't hang up.

521
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,160
Ms. Luo, Ms. Xia,

522
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,660
and Ms. Qiu were all at the scene earlier.

523
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,960
Was Luo Yingzi there too?

524
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,160
She was tricked into coming by Xu Jianshe.

525
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
Didn't anything happen?

526
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,650
They had a confrontation for a while.

527
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,480
She has gone to the hospital.

528
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,130
I have something to do. I have to hang up.

529
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,570
What are you doing?

530
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,420
Who are you looking for?

531
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,400
I'm looking for someone.

532
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,510
Excuse me.

533
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,920
Is there a patient named Luo Yingzi?

534
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,450
This is the observation room.

535
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,440
There's no such person.

536
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,880
You can go check the emergency room next door.

537
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,420
This way?

538
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:02,930
Yes, check over there.

539
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,640
Can... Can I pass through?

540
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,030
Sure.

541
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,920
Okay, thank you.

542
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,170
[Emergency]

543
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,070
Officer,

544
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,810
we'll be done soon.

545
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,630
Please wait here.

546
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,270
Will giving the statement later

547
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,370
take long?

548
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,820
No, it won't take long.

549
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay, thank you.

550
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,290
Luo.

551
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,030
Qiu.

552
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,580
I caused trouble again.

553
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,820
I just wanted to remind you,

554
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,010
but Xu Jianshe hung up the phone.

555
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,930
Okay, Xia Shu, you've made progress;

556
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,830
at least you're reflecting on it now.

557
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,260
Xia Shu, in today's society,

558
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,570
I don't believe that

559
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,750
if someone says they'd rather diethan yield

560
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,210
even with a knife at their throat.

561
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,080
Most likely, they're just a hypocrite.

562
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,870
In such extreme situations,

563
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,460
none of this is your fault,

564
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,640
so don't take it to heart.

565
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,570
Just make sure the wound doesn't get wet

566
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,320
and remember to change the dressing on time, okay?

567
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,110
Thank you.

568
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,830
Thank you.

569
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,030
Why are you crying again?

570
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,220
It's okay.

571
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,990
Everything is fine.

572
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,450
There, there.

573
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,830
What's wrong?

574
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,270
Or do you want to wipe it yourself?

575
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,160
Sis, you better help me wipe it.

576
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,430
My whole body hurts.

577
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,650
Are you addicted to being a spoiled princess again?

578
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,750
Fine.

579
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,160
Just for today, I'll care for you like a mother.

580
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,680
But only this once.

581
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,640
Sis.

582
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,420
I'm thirsty.

583
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,270
Okay, my lady, I'll go buy some.

584
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
Remember to buy hot water.

585
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,510
There's no hot water.

586
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,560
How about I warm it up for you under my armpit when I get back?

587
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,020
Okay?

588
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,460
Okay.

589
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,370
Then just make do with drinking the cold one.

590
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,870
I've been looking all over; where is she?

591
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:00,690
Luo Yingzi.

592
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,410
Why are you here?

593
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,800
I heard you were in the hospital, so I came.

594
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,680
Where did you get hurt?

595
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,550
No.

596
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,160
Let me see.

597
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,240
Wait, stop touching randomly.

598
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,070
I'm fine.

599
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,960
I just have ticklish spots.

600
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,160
Why are you so stubborn?

601
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,480
Who do you think you are?

602
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,960
How dare you confront a murderer?

603
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,850
Didn't I tell you

604
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,780
to move out earlier?

605
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,010
But you wouldn't listen. You stayed at home.

606
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,310
Do you think you were lucky yesterday, lucky today,

607
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,070
and will be lucky tomorrow?

608
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,790
That you'll be lucky every day from now on?

609
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,800
Do you think you're a cat

610
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,730
which has nine lifes?

611
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,910
I know you hate me.

612
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,900
But you don't have to do this.

613
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
You just took your safety so lightly.

614
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,960
Are you done talking?

615
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
No.

616
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,920
You won't listen to me until you've suffered, right?

617
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,830
You don't know what's good for you.

618
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,480
I know Xu Jianshe wanted to hurt you,

619
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,200
so I've been hanging around downstairs at your place these past couple of days,

620
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,300
just in case he tries something.

621
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,100
It's true that the onlooker is more worried than the player.

622
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,880
Where are you hurt? Let me see.

623
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,880
I really didn't get hurt anywhere.

624
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,030
I'm fine.

625
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,640
Wang Rui said you were injured.

626
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,590
But the one who's injured isn't me.

627
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,050
Here comes the injured one.

628
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,390
Mr. Chen,

629
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,970
you are so well-informed.

630
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,240
You arrived so quickly.

631
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,620
Ms. Xia is injured.

632
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,610
How can you say that?

633
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,400
Anyone who got injured is not good.

634
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,280
Earlier, he was adamant that I was hurt.

635
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,990
Ms. Xia was kidnapped.

636
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,150
It's just an external injury, a couple of days of rest, and she'll be fine.

637
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,980
We'll wait for you in the car.

638
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,330
Here.

639
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,800
Okay.

640
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,160
See?

641
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,280
However,

642
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,680
I was careless this time.

643
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,710
I admit

644
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,970
your concern this time is right.

645
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,150
Yeah, just say it like this.

646
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,930
Just be obedient.

647
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,070
Are you treating me like a puppy, petting me?

648
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,880
Alright.

649
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,520
Hearing you say that,

650
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,270
I know you're fine.

651
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm relieved.

652
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,270
Okay, I'm leaving.

653
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,450
I still need to stay with Xia Shu to take her statement.

654
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:42,830
I'm leaving.

655
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,300
I'll go with you. I'm familiar with Wang Rui.

656
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,590
You don't need to go.

657
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,200
What if they end up treating you as a suspect

658
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,030
and arresting you?

659
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,330
I can't bear that.

660
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,400
I know you're injured, and I rushed over,

661
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,270
and now you're leaving?

662
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,270
But Chen Shuo,

663
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,010
you did a great job this time.

664
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,190
I'll give you a thumbs up.

665
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,800
Exactly.

666
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,710
Keep a safe distance.

667
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,200
What are you doing?

668
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,540
I'm leaving.

669
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,570
Okay, I'm relieved that you're fine.

670
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,690
Xia Shu.

671
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,500
Here, drink this cup of milk,

672
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
and you can sleep well.

673
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,830
What are you looking at?

674
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,800
Luo,

675
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,730
there's a layer of milk skin on top of the milk you heated.

676
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,730
Yes.

677
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,510
That's how boiled milk always is.

678
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,200
You've never boiled milk before?

679
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,440
No.

680
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,640
I actually love this layer of milk skin.

681
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,590
When I was in middle school,

682
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,960
my mother would heat a cup of milk for me

683
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,550
every night before bed.

684
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,640
She said

685
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,440
only milk heated in a small pot would have milk skin,

686
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,780
not in the microwave.

687
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,190
It never stopped for all 365 days a year.

688
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,200
If you like it,

689
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,820
I'll make it for you more often.

690
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,640
It's not that I love it,

691
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,310
I just...

692
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,170
I found something interesting.

693
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
When people

694
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,140
encounter something,

695
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,410
the first person they think of is always their mother.

696
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,410
Have you noticed that?

697
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,840
Like, when you're scared or shocked,

698
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,130
the first thing you shout is "mother!"

699
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,640
And after it passes,

700
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,750
you're still thinking about your mother.

701
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,900
Not only you,

702
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,500
but actually Qiu Hua and I were shocked.

703
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But I found

704
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,830
you are quite lucky.

705
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,440
You can always get out of danger.

706
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,150
It's all in the past.

707
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,890
Just consider it done,

708
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,430
and don't be scared anymore.

709
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,590
Qiu Hua and I are with you.

710
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,030
Thank you, Luo,

711
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,810
and Qiu.

712
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,110
But Xia Shu,

713
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,400
you have to learn from this.

714
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,110
In the future, be more careful

715
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,110
when you go out.

716
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,030
I was just going to get a facial;

717
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,570
I didn't expect he'd block me at the door.

718
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,440
I hand out business cards at the courthouse every day,

719
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,240
and my face has even gotten sunspots.

720
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,830
But it's all worth it.

721
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,440
You got kidnapped, and you still think it was worth it?

722
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
Of course.

723
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,030
I got a case.

724
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,230
And it's a big one.

725
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,790
How big?

726
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,950
This case involves an amount of 3 million.

727
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,560
I met a client at the courthouse,

728
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,560
Auntie Song.

729
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,380
She lent out 5 million,

730
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,410
and 3 million of that

731
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,400
is backed by IOUs and bank statements.

732
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,160
I've read it. It should be true.

733
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,660
She even reached out to me herself,

734
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,200
wanting us to help her with the lawsuit.

735
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,800
You met her by handing out business cards?

736
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,230
Why do I feel so unreliable?

737
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,640
How about I meet with her tomorrow and talk it through.

738
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,290
Whether it's reliable or not, we'll know after the conversation.

739
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,840
Okay.

740
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,630
Drink the milk.

741
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,949
It'll help you sleep well.

742
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,800
I'll call Qiu Hua

743
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
and tell her about this.

744
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,670
Okay.

745
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,320
Morning.

746
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,960
Morning.

747
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,290
Morning, Ms Qiu.

748
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
I brought breakfast;

749
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,150
have it while it's still hot.

750
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,920
Thank you.

751
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,360
Xia Shu,

752
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,920
there's some for you too. Come over and have some.

753
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,760
Thank you, Qiu, but I'll skip.

754
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,630
I've got an appointment with Auntie Song,

755
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,730
and I need to go pick her up.

756
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,030
I'm leaving.

757
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,650
See you at the cafe at 9:30.

758
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,110
You got hurt yesterday;

759
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,920
aren't you taking a day off today?

760
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

761
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm leaving.

762
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,190
Tough as nails.

763
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,860
There's no case. Don't need to rush.

764
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,190
Take your time.

765
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,520
Here, this is Qiu's kind gesture.

766
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,230
-Have it on the way, okay?
-Okay.

767
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,250
Okay, I'm leaving.

768
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,600
Bye-bye.

769
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,320
Bye-bye.

770
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,150
She has made progress.

771
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,510
[Madam Mei]

772
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,050
Madam Mei is calling.

773
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,680
Madam Mei, why are you calling so early? Is something wrong?

774
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,780
Yingzi,

775
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,610
I've decided

776
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,190
to give up on that case; I'm not going to investigate it anymore.

777
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,230
Why?

778
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,030
I work in law,

779
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,090
so I understand the finality of judicial decisions.

780
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,360
It's over.

781
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,890
There's no need for me to cling to it

782
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,190
because of my own obsession.

783
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,150
Madam Mei.

784
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,550
are you really just going to give up like this,

785
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,000
even though Mr. Yu's death is so unclear?

786
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,800
There's nothing unclear about it.

787
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,800
He died of a stroke.

788
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,110
Alright, let's not talk about it anymore.

789
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,590
I've made up my mind.

790
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,110
I'm sorry that

791
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
this cost you your job,

792
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,230
but if you ever need my help in the future,

793
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,510
I'll be there without hesitation.

794
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,400
Madam Mei, you see...

795
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,200
Hello.

796
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,480
She hung up.

797
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Wait, so

798
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,630
we've been going all out to help her,

799
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,630
and yet she's backed out when it mattered.

800
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,150
Yingzi, didn't you notice?

801
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Notice what?

802
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,250
Madam Mei has already figured it out that

803
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,190
Liangcheng Law Firm fired all three of us

804
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,970
because of this case,

805
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,630
which means Liangcheng Law Firm's involvement in this

806
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,480
is far from ordinary.

807
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,720
So you're suggesting that

808
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,310
more than one person is behind framing her?

809
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,320
Could it be a coordinated effort?

810
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,070
Is that possible?

811
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,420
Do you think Fang Lihong is also involved?

812
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,440
It's hard to say.

813
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,180
Since Madam Mei doesn't want us to keep investigating,

814
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,990
there's probably a reason for it.

815
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,150
Maybe

816
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,960
she wants to handle it herself,

817
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,110
or maybe she thinks

818
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,230
continuing the investigation

819
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,630
could end up being worse for us.

820
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,760
If she doesn't want to commission it, fine.

821
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,450
I'll investigate on my own, no one can stop me.

822
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,670
But we've already been fired,

823
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,070
and we have no idea

824
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,190
what's going on inside Liangcheng Law Firm. How are we supposed to investigate?

825
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,440
I should have planted an undercover agent

826
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,630
within the Liangcheng Law Firm.

827
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,200
Speaking of undercover agents, there actually is one.

828
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,230
And he's the best.

829
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,920
I know who you're talking about.

830
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,790
Well.

831
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,100
You think that guy is the best in your heart?

832
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:25,970
He's not bad.

833
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,440
Let me tell you,

834
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,190
even if the whole world were gone,

835
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,160
I still wouldn't turn to him.

836
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,810
I'm serious.

837
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,190
Chen Shuo likes you so much,

838
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,810
so he'd definitely be willing to go undercover for you.

839
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,120
I know,

840
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,000
but there's no way we could be together.

841
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Why not?

842
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,960
I just don't like that type.

843
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,900
So, what's your type then?

844
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,260
You like men of Liu Ming's type, right?

845
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,230
That guy's the one who screwed you over.

846
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,930
Is there really no one else in this world

847
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,840
besides Chen Shuo and Liu Ming?

848
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,870
Are these the only two men left?

849
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,590
Anyway, I can't stand his arrogant, slick attitude.

850
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,180
He changes girlfriends more often than he changes clothes.

851
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,320
That's true.

852
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,510
You didn't see it, did you?

853
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,380
Actually, I need security too.

854
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,440
Wasn't I screwed over enough by Liu Ming?

855
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,230
If I have a boyfriend,

856
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,480
I have to constantly worry about

857
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,320
which girl he's flirting with.

858
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,760
Who can stand it?

859
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,440
I can't stand it anyway.

860
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,800
Forget about him.

861
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,190
I'm going to apply lipstick.

862
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,670
Then let's go to see the old lady.

863
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,630
Wait.

864
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,780
Aren't you going to eat the breakfast I bought for you?

865
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,840
I'll eat on the way.

866
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,630
You drive, and I'll eat beside you.

867
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,570
Once I'm done, I'll touch up my lipstick.

868
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,550
Don't worry.

869
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,800
You go ahead.

870
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,810
Is there any meaning to an eyelid twitch?

871
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
My right eyelid has been twitching all morning.

872
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,030
Oh no.

873
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,700
Left eyelid twitching means good luck, right eyelid twitching means bad luck.

874
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,630
Forget what you said.

875
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,680
Go in first.

876
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,890
I'll call them back.

877
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,030
Hurry up.

878
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,480
Okay.

879
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,650
Ms. Qiu.

880
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,760
Hello, Ms. Qiu.

881
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,630
Mr. Chen, you mentioned before that

882
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,760
I should let you know

883
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,370
if I remembered anything

884
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,390
related to Madam Mei's case.

885
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,130
Today, we contacted Madam Mei,

886
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,000
and now I'm certain that

887
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,590
the reason we were all fired by Liangcheng Law Firm

888
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,380
is connected to the rape case from back then.

889
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,460
There's nothing else.

890
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,030
I just wanted to let you know.

891
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,400
That's all. Bye.

892
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,810
Why didn't you go in?

893
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,360
Look at Xia Shu;

894
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,410
she's daydreaming again.

895
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,160
This is the old lady who lent someone 3 million?

896
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,190
Plus another 2 million with no proof?

897
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,340
Qiu Hua, don't blame her.

898
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,550
You put too much pressure on Xia Shu.

899
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,220
It's my fault?

900
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,320
Well, let's not go in.

901
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,130
We have to go in.

902
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,190
Before Xia Shu's condition gets worse,

903
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,400
we have to stop her.

904
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,670
We can't let her cause any major trouble for us.

905
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,590
We've just opened,

906
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,880
so let's not set the bar too high

907
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,760
for consultation fees.

908
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,380
Ten yuan an hour should be fine.

909
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,860
Ten yuan?

910
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,760
Is that even enough to cover the water in front of her?

911
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,320
Xia Shu.

912
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,070
Luo. Qiu.

913
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,270
This is Auntie Song.

914
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,800
Auntie Song, this is Ms. Luo,

915
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,700
and this is Ms. Qiu.

916
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,800
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

917
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,410
Hello.

918
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,710
Sorry for the trouble.

919
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,400
I'll go get some drinks.

920
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,230
Xia Shu, we don't drink anything.

921
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,440
It's fine to sit for a while.

922
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,400
Auntie, I heard from Xia Shu that you want to file a lawsuit.

923
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,590
It's good that you have strong legal awareness.

924
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,400
But I need to talk to you a bit more

925
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,590
about the lawsuit.

926
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,070
For a typical civil dispute,

927
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,350
the litigation route is something you resort to

928
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,780
when there's no room left for negotiation,

929
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,400
a last resort.

930
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
In other words,

931
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,250
it means you and the other party are beyond reconciliation,

932
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,820
things have reached a point where it's impossible to make up.

933
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,820
Litigation relies on evidence.

934
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,360
Once it's in court,

935
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,870
reasoning and emotional appeals won't be very useful.

936
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,810
So in the end,

937
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,400
if you don't get the outcome you want,

938
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,590
not only

939
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,110
will it waste judicial resources,

940
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,880
but

941
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,390
it will also waste your own financial resources, energy,

942
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,180
and time.

943
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,360
I can tell you're a reasonable person, Auntie,

944
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,690
so...

945
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,070
But she owes me over 3 million.

946
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,170
Auntie Song has evidence.

947
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,310
I just looked at those IOUs

948
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,840
and the bank statements again;

949
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,740
they're all real.

950
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,700
They're all here.

951
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,650
[Transfer Voucher]

952
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,020
Auntie Song,

953
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,510
these two lawyers

954
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,760
are very capable.

955
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,320
They previously got a murder case

956
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,620
reopened for retrial.

957
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,760
Don't worry.

958
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,620
Xia Shu.

959
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,590
How about you order an Americano for me?

960
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,600
Qiu Hua, what would you like?

961
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,400
I just want lemon water.

962
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,870
Okay.

963
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,550
Hello.

964
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,780
Hello, what would you like?

965
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,690
You're Auntie Song, right?

966
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,820
Judging from these IOUs

967
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,170
and bank transfer records,

968
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
it seems

969
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,190
you lent over 3 million to someone named He Qiaohui.

970
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,800
Why did you lend her so much money?

971
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,590
It's a long story.

972
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,640
I'm afraid it might take up too much of your time.

973
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,100
No.

974
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,140
We've just opened,

975
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,480
so we're not charging for

976
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,390
legal consultations.

977
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,030
If you're over 60, it's free.

978
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,200
Go ahead.
