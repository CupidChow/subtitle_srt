[Unbreakable Ⅱ]

2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,759
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,729
I accept the punishment fate has given me.

4
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,650
As for you,

5
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,729
how you view your actions back then

6
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,979
is your own business.

7
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,730
As a lawyer,

8
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,010
I still want to ask everyone one last question.

9
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,009
You still refuse to admit

10
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,650
that your actions back then

11
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,120
crossed a lawyer's bottom line

12
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,470
and indirectly harmed others, right?

13
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,710
Madam Mei doesn't think so anymore.

14
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,820
What does that have to do with you?

15
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,490
I was just informing her

16
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,420
of the legal consequences of committing perjury.

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,860
If she hasn't committed perjury,

18
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,350
then why be afraid?

19
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,820
I simply analyzed for her

20
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,490
the legal responsibilities of a rape victim

21
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,730
versus those of a prostitute.

22
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,730
Of course,

23
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,300
there is a distinction between the two.

24
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,770
I did not threaten her

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,670
or imply what she should do.

26
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,560
How she understands it

27
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
is beyond my knowledge.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,280
I certainly wouldn't use any legal consequences

29
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,300
to threaten her.

30
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,329
I just told her

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,490
that the reputations of rape victims and prostitutes

32
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,770
are not the same.

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,140
If it's prostitution,

34
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,570
what reputation would it be?

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,000
Do I have to say it?

36
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,220
You may not have said anything outrageous,

37
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,890
but when you piece together your statements,

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,380
Yang Cuili will understand.

39
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,980
Once she changes her testimony to admit it was a transaction,

40
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,700
even if what she says afterward is the truth,

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,210
it will still be questioned as perjury.

42
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,140
That's why she turned on the other party in court.

43
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,140
You are the ones

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,980
who harmed Madam Mei and Mr. Yu.

45
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,570
Which one looks better?

46
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,820
Are you asking me?

47
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,230
Our usual clothing styles are different.

48
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,420
Just pick one for me.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,780
I'm fine with anything.

50
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,900
Sisters,

51
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,420
the rent on the 17th floor

52
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,490
has gone up again.

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,220
We need to seize the time to check it out

54
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,290
and make a decision.

55
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,300
Otherwise, prices might increase again in the future.

56
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,220
So, do we have enough in our budget?

57
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,780
Honestly, it's a bit tight.

58
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,750
But if we can negotiate

59
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,100
a lower price with them,

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,710
if we live frugally,

61
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,760
we can just about afford it.

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,480
Why do we have to rent

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,550
above Liangcheng Law Firm?

64
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,050
Don't forget our original intention, little comrade.

65
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,780
We established Yinghua Law Firm

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,900
for this day, right?

67
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,010
Hello, which one is Ms. Xia?

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,880
It's me.

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,930
I'm here to pick up a package.

70
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,930
Just a moment.

71
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,930
Let me verify your pickup information.

72
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,690
The pickup code is 3161.

73
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,220
It's for an express delivery within one hour in the city, right?

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,690
Yes.

75
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,370
Let me confirm the recipient information.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,270
Dingxin Group, Liu Zhengjun, correct?

77
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,830
Yes.

78
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,810
It's cash on delivery, right?

79
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,370
Yes.

80
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,490
Thank you.

81
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,130
Okay.

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,340
Xia Shu.

83
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,340
What are you sending to Mr. Liu?

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,420
A voice recorder.

85
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
What recording?

86
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,130
It's the recording of Xu Zhuo refused to investigate

87
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,980
Wanhe's overseas assets.

88
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,460
He betrayed and hurt others,

89
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,630
playing with the female party,

90
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,730
and harming his peers.

91
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,370
There should be some retribution for that, right?

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,180
Xia Shu, you really know how to go all out.

93
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,050
You're out to destroy him completely.

94
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,290
I'm just giving this self-absorbed, middle-aged cheesy man

95
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,420
a lesson,

96
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,250
and it counts as a contribution

97
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,170
for the many wronged women and innocent lawyers.

98
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,250
It seems

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,140
that Zhuoyue Law Firm is about to face a storm.

100
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,659
Have you found out

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,350
who wrote this anonymous letter?

102
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,690
Mr. Liu, we are currently investigating.

103
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,210
The shipment of precious metals from Wanhe mentioned in the letter

104
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,490
is real.

105
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,060
Mr. Liu, look at this.

106
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,660
And this, listen.

107
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,880
Mr. Xu, I heard that Mr. Wan's daughter

108
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,510
graduated from UC Berkeley.

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,340
I have a classmate who also graduated from there.

110
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,960
Do you need me to ask that classmate

111
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,240
to investigate Mr. Wan's daughter?

112
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,980
Investigating his daughter seems unnecessary, right?

113
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,950
If we look into it,

114
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,380
we can better know

115
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,690
Wanhe's assets.

116
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,620
But it will cost a bit.

117
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,350
How much?

118
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,370
It's not that much.

119
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,040
It won't bankrupt Zhuoyue Law Firm.

120
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,100
Not needed for now.

121
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,170
Mr. Xu,

122
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,730
today is truly a double happiness for me.

123
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,250
Go ahead and tell me.

124
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,490
What's this recording about?

125
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,130
Ms. Fang, you're here.

126
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,720
What happened?

127
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,970
Several creditors from Wanhe

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,730
have come to the office.

129
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,540
They said they received an anonymous letter.

130
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,420
The letter claims that during the reorganization,

131
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,340
Mr. Wan's daughter bought a shipment of precious metals

132
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,460
worth 300 million USD.

133
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,580
After the reorganization was successful,

134
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,050
it didn't dock but was directly transferred overseas.

135
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,700
Anonymous letter? Where did this anonymous letter come from?

136
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,200
I don't know.

137
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,050
But they said

138
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,000
the anonymous letter was accompanied

139
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,410
by screenshots of an investigation report

140
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,540
from an American consulting firm.

141
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,050
It doesn't seem like it's baseless.

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,750
They are very emotional right now.

143
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,810
You need to hurry and go upstairs.

144
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,130
Look. Take some notes.

145
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,110
Call Zhang Zhi and Zhao Bin to join me.

146
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,580
This recording and this anonymous letter

147
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,860
are enough to show

148
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,170
that you have not fulfilled your duty

149
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,570
of diligence and care.

150
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,590
Your work has serious errors.

151
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,420
You have caused me to lose billions for nothing.

152
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,100
This is negligence, Xu Zhuo.

153
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,610
You just need to tell me

154
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,350
if what this letter says is true.

155
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,660
Mr. Liu...

156
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,820
Xu Zhuo,

157
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,420
you need to be careful with your words.

158
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,900
Anything that comes out of your mouth now,

159
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,220
you will be held responsible for.

160
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,980
Our people are recording everything.

161
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,130
I cannot explain to everyone right now

162
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,059
because I don't know

163
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,270
if what this anonymous letter says is true or not.

164
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,450
Then, Ms. Fang,

165
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,650
are you denying this incident?

166
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,770
I'm not denying it.

167
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,830
I just cannot prove its authenticity.

168
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,580
It seems we only have to go to court

169
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,180
to prove it.

170
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,850
During our time as administrators,

171
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,730
we used all our resources

172
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,490
to investigate Wanhe's financial situation,

173
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,730
and recovered the assets they hid

174
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,410
and transferred by law.

175
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,250
We found only 200 million yuan.

176
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,100
But this letter suddenly claims

177
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,460
that 300 million USD worth of assets

178
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,450
have flowed overseas

179
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,920
and are floating in the open sea.

180
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,530
If what they said about it floating in the open sea is true,

181
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,250
I want to ask everyone,

182
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,060
what channels can we use to investigate?

183
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,730
You initially assured me

184
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,580
that Wanhe's unaccounted funds were only 200 million.

185
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,860
With only 200 million yuan, we might not even be able to recover it.

186
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,860
At that time, you advised me

187
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,060
to take the money and leave early.

188
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,250
But what's the reality?

189
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,100
The reality is that it's 300 million USD, Xu Zhuo!

190
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,060
If we add this 300 million USD,

191
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,340
Wanhe's assets would exceed 3 billion.

192
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,340
This is basically consistent with the rumors

193
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,700
before the reorganization.

194
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,810
So, what we should have taken back

195
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,370
should be around 60%,

196
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,010
not just over 30%.

197
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,490
Who's going to pay for our losses?

198
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,100
Did you have any exchanges in interests

199
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,890
with the strategic investor, Qiwu Group?

200
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,300
I guarantee with my character

201
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,860
that we have no exchanges

202
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,130
with Qiwu Group.

203
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,250
But can the takeover be the same when their assets

204
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,010
are 1.8 billion and 3 billion?

205
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,100
You sacrificed our interests

206
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,770
as small and medium creditors

207
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,370
to benefit them alone

208
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,300
and still dare to say you didn't receive any benefits?

209
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,340
I paid you over ten million yuan in legal fees

210
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,530
so that you could be responsible for supervising Liangcheng Law Firm every day?

211
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,360
If such a situation really occurs,

212
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,860
the first responsibility lies with Liangcheng Law Firm.

213
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,820
The duty of due diligence is theirs.

214
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,010
We have not charged a single extra penny

215
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,100
other than the administration fees.

216
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,820
You took over fifty million yuan

217
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,700
yet you know nothing about

218
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,370
such a large asset of Wanhe being overseas?

219
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,700
Do you administrators

220
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,940
only know how to take advantage of our money?

221
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,650
I will definitely hold Liangcheng Law Firm accountable.

222
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,820
What I'm asking now is you.

223
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,180
I gave you so much money.

224
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,370
Where's your due diligence?

225
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,970
Xu Zhuo,

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
wait to receive the summons.

227
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,770
What else is there to discuss with them?

228
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,010
We'll see each other in court.

229
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,770
Mr. Xia.

230
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,180
Mr. Liu.

231
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,590
Don’t touch me!

232
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,590
Ms. Ma.

233
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,610
You've gone too far.

234
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,610
Mr. Li.

235
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,050
Please let me explain, Mr. Li.

236
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,430
Let's discuss this further.

237
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,250
Where did that letter come from?

238
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,490
No matter where it came from,

239
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,370
it seems to be genuine based on the screenshots.

240
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,060
Ms. Fang,

241
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,680
think of a way to handle this.

242
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,370
Director Han, going to the firm?

243
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,180
You're quite aggressive, huh?

244
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,220
Going to our firm? Is there something?

245
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,150
To the floor above yours.

246
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,940
What for?

247
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,610
Our law firm moved.

248
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,890
Just moved to the floor above yours.

249
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,060
You've learned to boast.

250
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,010
Last time you said you were moving,

251
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,650
but I didn't see you actually move.

252
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,640
Last time was just a reconnaissance.

253
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,860
Director Han, now you're on the 16th floor,

254
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,770
we're on the 17th floor.

255
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,800
We'll be neighbors upstairs and downstairs.

256
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,370
Let's interact more.

257
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,300
Let's interact more, Director Han.

258
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,650
What's everyone doing?

259
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,370
What are you chatting about?

260
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,370
Is there nothing to do?

261
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,960
Everyone, work hard.

262
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,980
Tian,

263
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,180
why are you spacing out?

264
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,220
You want to quit?

265
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,230
Mr. Han.

266
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,370
All partners are in the meeting room.

267
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,980
Ms. Fang asked you to hurry over.

268
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,490
Alright.

269
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,720
Liu, put my bag in the office.

270
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
Everyone, work hard!

271
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,680
Alright, let's disperse.

272
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,130
Yes.

273
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,530
It's me.

274
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,770
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

275
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,180
I'm the only one telling you about this.

276
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,460
Is it true?

277
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,450
Yes, make sure to confirm quickly.

278
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,710
I'm feeling uneasy.

279
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,300
What's going on?

280
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,940
What's happening here?

281
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,580
Take a look at this.

282
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,060
-Okay. I’ll talk to you later.
-Okay.

283
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,730
Here.

284
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,080
What's going on here?

285
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,410
Everyone, today is the darkest day

286
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,970
in our firm's history.

287
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,580
We have been framed.

288
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,300
Someone sent an anonymous letter to Wanhe's creditors.

289
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,100
The anonymous letter accuses us

290
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,700
of failing to conduct

291
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,460
due diligence on Wanhe's assets,

292
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,130
resulting in a 300 million USD outflow of assets.

293
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,650
We just received summons from the court.

294
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,700
Several of Wanhe's creditors have sued us,

295
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,650
seeking compensation

296
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,490
of 200 million yuan.

297
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,250
200 million yuan!

298
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,370
200 million yuan!

299
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,700
Although we cannot yet confirm

300
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,610
the authenticity of what the anonymous letter says,

301
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,980
we must prepare for the worst.

302
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,000
200 million yuan.

303
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,860
Even if we sell everything we own

304
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,010
and starve ourselves,

305
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,370
we still couldn't afford to pay it back.

306
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,820
They're asking for compensation,

307
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,170
and you called us here.

308
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,220
When you organized the team of administrators back then,

309
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,490
why didn't you call us?

310
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,980
300 million USD in assets are floating overseas,

311
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,610
and you failed to uncover it.

312
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,530
You've been working here for several months,

313
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,060
and so far you've found nothing.

314
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,370
How do you explain that?

315
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,060
Mr. Han,

316
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,580
I worked hard for a year to earn just a few hundred thousand yuan.

317
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,530
I still have a mortgage and a car loan.

318
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,700
My wife just gave birth to our second child.

319
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,650
Just gave birth!

320
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,410
Isn't this asking for our lives?

321
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,770
Even if we sold ourselves, we couldn't come up with 200 million yuan!

322
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,530
Ms. Fang, Ms. Fang!

323
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,370
Such a big incident has happened.

324
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,720
Someone has to take responsibility, right?

325
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,220
Someone has to step up and take responsibility!

326
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,730
Who? Who is responsible?

327
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Give us an explanation.

328
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,580
Um, let me say a couple of words here.

329
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,300
Ms. Fang,

330
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,250
while it's true that partners bear unlimited liability

331
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,100
to the firm,

332
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,100
but the Wanhe Case was handled by you few,

333
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,770
right?

334
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,300
Since I have no right

335
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,530
to share in the huge profits,

336
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,750
I won't take

337
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
the huge risk.

338
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,580
Exactly.

339
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,860
When I wanted to join the team of administrators,

340
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,340
you all didn't want me.

341
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,370
Now you want us to share the responsibility?

342
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,480
No way!

343
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,870
You're absolutely right.

344
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,980
We won't take this responsibility.

345
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,810
we won't be held responsible.

346
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,630
No way!

347
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,820
Today, there must be a reasonable explanation.

348
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,100
Otherwise, no one leaves.

349
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,190
Xia Shu.

350
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,410
What do you think?

351
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,940
This really is a great place.

352
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,560
The key is that renting here

353
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,160
would allow us to look down on Liangcheng Law Firm.

354
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,250
Qiu Hua, what about you?

355
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,180
I think we could win against them

356
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,930
even if we're not on the 17th floor.

357
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,680
But this really is my ideal.

358
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,850
I want to seize this opportunity and take it.

359
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,730
Something happened.

360
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,370
What's wrong?

361
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:20,900
Look.

362
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,390
Liangcheng Law Firm has been sued?

363
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,830
[Zhuoyue Law Firm may face millions of compensation.]

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,830
[Liangcheng Law Firm Condemns Creditors for Demanding Compensation of 200 Million]

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,830
[Wanhe Group is in trouble again]

366
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,410
The news says that several creditors of Wanhe

367
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,580
are suing Liangcheng Law Firm,

368
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,820
seeking 200 million yuan.

369
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,100
And Dingxin is also planning to sue Zhuoyue Law Firm

370
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,010
for tens of millions yuan.

371
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,010
200 million yuan.

372
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,530
What's their basis for suing

373
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,370
Liangcheng Law Firm?

374
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,370
What do you think it is?

375
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,660
Tian.

376
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,120
I heard our firm has to pay 200 million in compensation.

377
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,730
Is Liangcheng Law Firm going down?

378
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,860
Why don't we leave?

379
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,700
Where do we go?

380
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,100
Well, bro, let's leave first and talk later.

381
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,130
The ship is sinking now.

382
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,610
That's 200 million yuan!

383
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:08,930
Ms. Fang.

384
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,890
Don't go! Ms. Fang!

385
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,410
Ms. Fang!

386
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,060
Ms. Fang!

387
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,609
The matter isn't resolved yet.

388
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,730
Calm down.

389
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,060
You need to calm down.

390
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:17,690
Ms. Fang.

391
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,540
We have to clarify everything today.

392
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,130
Distribute the profits.

393
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,300
Before we go to court,

394
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,930
we must distribute the profits.

395
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,740
Right, exactly.

396
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,890
You were so proactive

397
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,020
when it came to collecting commissions,

398
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,540
but when it comes to profit sharing, you keep delaying.

399
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,820
If we don't distribute the profits now,

400
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,580
by the time the other party

401
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,690
freezes our law firm's accounts,

402
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,930
then we won't be able to distribute at all.

403
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,500
That's right.

404
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,100
Ms. Fang.

405
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,740
You should have given me 200,000 yuan last year,

406
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,500
but the firm said it needed to grow, so I didn't get anything.

407
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,610
This year, I'm still owed over 200 thousand yuan.

408
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,500
If you just pay me this 500-some thousand,

409
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,100
I won't ask for a penny from the money

410
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,130
Wanhe Project makes in the future.

411
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,260
And don't come looking for me if something happens.

412
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,170
Also,

413
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,670
where did the materials for that anonymous letter come from?

414
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,340
It must have been those two, Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua.

415
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,300
If you hadn't fired them back then,

416
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,020
could they have become enemies with our firm?

417
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,690
That's right.

418
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,970
It would have been better to just fire those two.

419
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,450
but instead, you brought in Chen Shuo.

420
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,060
What's the relationship between Chen Shuo and Luo Yingzi?

421
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,820
Don't you know?

422
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,820
Now, it turns out they're working together

423
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,470
to bring down our firm.

424
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,920
Mr. Tao,

425
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,170
why did you introduce Chen Shuo to us in the first place?

426
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,610
Fine, let's set that aside.

427
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,130
When he was in a lawsuit with Mingshan,

428
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,780
you insisted on cutting ties with him.

429
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,450
If you hadn't been so heartless,

430
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,290
could he have teamed up with Luo Yingzi

431
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,340
against us now?

432
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,950
Exactly!

433
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,420
It's true that I recommended Chen Shuo.

434
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,890
But you should know

435
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,780
how much value he brought to our firm.

436
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,450
Also, cutting ties was a collective decision

437
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,540
made at the partner meeting.

438
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,650
You can't blame it on one person.

439
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,500
Saying anything won't help.

440
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:29,970
Ms. Fang.

441
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,100
Ms. Fang, give us an explanation.

442
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,740
Speak up, Ms. Fang.

443
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,170
You must give us an explanation.

444
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,470
You must give me an explanation today!

445
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,520
I won't leave

446
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,770
if I can get my money today.

447
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,850
Speak up!

448
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Speak up!

449
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,650
What do you want me to say?

450
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,500
What do you want to hear?

451
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,540
Since Madam Mei left Liangcheng Law Firm,

452
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,450
over the nine years followed,

453
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,500
how many difficulties has Liangcheng Law Firm faced?

454
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,170
When did any of you step up?

455
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,650
Isn't it just me, Fang Lihong, holding everything up?

456
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,580
What have you done?

457
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,410
Now that disaster has struck,

458
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,780
you've pushed all the responsibility

459
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,740
onto me, a woman.

460
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,290
How could you?

461
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,060
This is entirely different.

462
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,970
Fang!

463
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,340
What does this have to do with anything?

464
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,360
Tao Zheng.

465
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,490
Fang!

466
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,580
Open the door!

467
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,500
Step aside!

468
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,860
Open the door!

469
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,970
You can't come in.

470
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,970
-Hurry up.
-You can’t go in.

471
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,970
You can't go in.

472
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,690
It's over. Liangcheng Law Firm is finished.

473
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,170
She even calls herself a woman.

474
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,140
Tao Zheng, say something.

475
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
What good idea do you have?

476
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,940
You tell us.

477
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,540
Open the door!

478
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,590
You can't go in.

479
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,260
Blocking the way, are you?

480
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,100
Pull her away!

481
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,820
What does this have to do with you? Get out!

482
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,150
What does this have to do with you?

483
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,860
Hurry up.

484
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,900
You can't go in.

485
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,860
Come out!

486
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,240
Everyone, stop!

487
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,370
Madam Mei.

488
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,860
Where's Fang Lihong?

489
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,540
She's inside.

490
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,860
Step aside!

491
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,500
Mentor.

492
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,270
Quickly wipe away your tears.

493
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,210
Why are you crying?

494
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,250
This law firm still needs you.

495
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,780
I am the founder of Liangcheng Law Firm

496
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,580
and also a supervising partner.

497
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,260
I've returned.

498
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,690
I've reflected

499
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,370
on the past.

500
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,340
My late husband Yu and I

501
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,450
did many wrong things.

502
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,100
Here, I apologize to everyone.

503
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,270
Please don't do this, Madam Mei.

504
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,180
Now,

505
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,110
Liangcheng Law Firm is facing a catastrophic disaster,

506
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,410
but Liangcheng Law Firm cannot collapse.

507
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,860
Liangcheng Law Firm must survive

508
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,970
because

509
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,260
all of our partners

510
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,060
bear unlimited responsibility for the firm.

511
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,890
Not a single one

512
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,130
can escape.

513
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,170
But Madam Mei,

514
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,740
they're demanding

515
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,580
200 million yuan from us.

516
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,500
That's not a small amount.

517
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,650
When disaster strikes,

518
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,340
there's no escaping it.

519
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,160
Complaining is useless.

520
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,540
Let's focus all our efforts

521
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,620
on dealing with this lawsuit.

522
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,890
As long as the evidence in the other party's hands is genuine,

523
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,300
we must bear corresponding responsibilities.

524
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,780
We will do our best to minimize the losses

525
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,790
and compensation.

526
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,580
Perhaps we will end up losing

527
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:48,970
all of Liangcheng Law Firm's assets,

528
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,340
and maybe each of us will have to use our own assets

529
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,820
for compensation,

530
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,540
but what does it matter?

531
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,650
As long as Liangcheng Law Firm is still standing,

532
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,130
there's hope for everything.

533
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,730
We can endure this

534
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,250
and rise again.

535
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,540
I don't have a lawyer's qualification.

536
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,870
Who can appear in court

537
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,300
for this case?

538
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,410
Well,

539
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,480
I can do it.

540
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,550
Lihong,

541
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,330
if you back down this time,

542
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,580
you'll never

543
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,900
be able to rise again in your life.

544
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,260
Are you sure

545
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,740
you won't do it?

546
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,410
Mentor, I...

547
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,170
I hope you can take the lead.

548
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,170
Behind you,

549
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,860
I'll be there.

550
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,180
Alright,

551
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,180
it must be me.

552
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,690
But I require

553
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,340
Tao Zheng,

554
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,650
Zhang Zhi,

555
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,650
and Han together.

556
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,930
Come in, everyone.

557
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,160
Let's discuss this.

558
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,810
Okay.

559
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,370
Well, she...

560
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,660
Um, everyone.

561
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Listen to me.

562
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,500
Since Madam Mei is here,

563
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,260
let's wait until they

564
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,840
come up with a result before we talk.

565
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,610
Okay?

566
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,200
Liangcheng Law Firm hasn't disbanded yet.

567
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,660
Let's go back.

568
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,410
Of course, all information

569
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,370
needs to be submitted to the court first

570
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,410
before we can see it.

571
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,930
This information,

572
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,930
where did it come from?

573
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,080
It must be Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua.

574
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,340
They joined Zhuoyue Law Firm's lawyer team.

575
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,340
They're very familiar with the Wanhe Case.

576
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,520
Moreover, that Xia Shu has connections in the U.S.

577
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,340
No wonder they were so arrogant when they came to check out the office space,

578
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,930
especially on the 17th floor.

579
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,890
Don't they want to step on our heads?

580
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,860
Luo Yingzi?

581
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,520
She is on the17th floor?

582
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,580
I just found out.

583
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,010
Is she really moving to the 17th floor?

584
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,860
I just ran into them.

585
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,580
Mentor.

586
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,500
Luo Yingzi is your last disciple.

587
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,230
She's really ruthless against us.

588
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,500
Why are we checking out the office space at this time?

589
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,210
It's truly absurd.

590
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,210
Let's go, comrades.

591
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,130
I won't go with you.

592
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,630
I have an appointment with Hao Lei.

593
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,410
What if we run into them downstairs?

594
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,740
Would they think we harmed them?

595
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
What are you afraid of?

596
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,310
We did nothing wrong.

597
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,130
Let's go.

598
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,250
It's Madam Mei.

599
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,690
[Madam Mei]

600
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,130
Hello, Madam Mei.

601
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,500
Yingzi, you're on the 17th floor?

602
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,780
Yes, we came here to check out the office space.

603
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,820
We were just about to leave.

604
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,260
I’m at your feet. Can you come down for a moment?

605
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,970
I have something to ask you.

606
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,700
She is on the floor below.

607
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,050
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Yang.

608
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,130
Madam Mei, Ms. Fang.

609
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,100
Ms. Luo has arrived.

610
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,670
Madam Mei.

611
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,280
Take a seat.

612
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,130
You want to see me?

613
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,300
You showed me this

614
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,020
because you suspect I sent it?

615
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm not asking you.

616
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,650
You tell me.

617
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,300
If you don't ask, I won't answer.

618
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,890
What's written in this letter is true.

619
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,820
I know.

620
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,680
Whether or not I sent it,

621
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,820
Liangcheng Law Firm did indeed

622
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,890
have some work flaws

623
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,100
in conducting the asset investigation of Wanhe.

624
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,780
If you are held accountable today,

625
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,100
then it's your own fault.

626
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,720
As for whether I sent it,

627
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,650
it depends on everyone's judgment.

628
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,210
Is there anything else?

629
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,630
No, that's all.

630
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,300
Goodbye.

631
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,860
It must be her.

632
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,110
It's not her.

633
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,180
She has always been someone who holds grudges.

634
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,980
I don't think it's her either.

635
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,120
Then it must be Qiu Hua.

636
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,450
Or Xia Shu.

637
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,410
Stop guessing.

638
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,820
What she said is right.

639
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,260
Liangcheng Law Firm, in the Wanhe Case,

640
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,470
did indeed have flaws.

641
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,780
So what is their basis

642
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,540
for suing Liangcheng Law Firm?

643
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,690
What do you think it is?

644
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,170
If we run into them downstairs now,

645
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,390
will they think we harmed them?

646
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,310
What are you afraid of?

647
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,610
We did nothing wrong.

648
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,020
I'm back!

649
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,170
You're back.

650
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,690
Luo,

651
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,780
the news about Dingxin suing Xu Zhuo

652
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,340
has spread widely.

653
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,780
Even Hao Lei knows about it.

654
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,160
Do you think if Xu Zhuo really has to pay out tens of millions,

655
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,890
the court won't leave him with even his underwear?

656
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,120
Your recording played a crucial role.

657
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,860
My recording?

658
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,690
At most, my recording can only

659
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,130
prove that Xu Zhuo

660
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,370
failed to fulfill the duty of diligence and loyalty.

661
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,890
It still relies on that anonymous letter

662
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,860
that swept through Zhuoyue Law Firm

663
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,260
and annihilated Liangcheng Law Firm.

664
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,810
Qiu is really something.

665
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,610
Do you also think she sent it?

666
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,740
What else could it be?

667
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,340
Luo, don't overthink it.

668
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,050
Xu Zhuo is much more ruthless than us.

669
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,320
Don't you feel satisfied seeing him like this now?

670
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,690
But many of Wanhe's creditors

671
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,610
received that letter,

672
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,540
and Liangcheng Law Firm has also been sued by the creditors

673
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,810
for a claim of 200 million yuan.

674
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,780
I'm back.

675
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,890
Perfect timing, everyone is here.

676
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,210
I need to tell you something.

677
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,640
Wanhe's creditors want to hire us

678
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,820
to represent them in the lawsuit

679
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,610
against Liangcheng Law Firm.

680
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,030
We can earn over ten million yuan from this case.

681
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,370
If you have no objections,

682
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,340
I'll sign the agency agreement with them.

683
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,840
Qiu Hua.

684
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,650
That

685
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,520
anonymous letter,

686
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
you sent it, didn't you?

687
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,200
Yes, I did.

688
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,040
What's the matter?

689
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,610
I just informed

690
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,340
the deceived creditors of the facts.

691
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,580
Did I do something wrong?

692
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,690
You didn't do anything wrong,

693
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
I just feel that

694
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,540
maybe we shouldn't

695
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,820
get involved in this case, okay?

696
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,690
Why shouldn't we get involved?

697
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,540
Why leave money on the table?

698
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,060
I feel a bit uncomfortable about it.

699
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,320
Well, what do you mean by that?

700
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,980
You're taking the moral high ground again?

701
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,370
Did they have any remorse

702
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,780
when they expelled us?

703
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,370
As administrators,

704
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,450
they made a lot of money

705
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,060
but didn't conduct a responsible

706
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,450
and thorough investigation of the bankruptcy assets.

707
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,580
They were wrong.

708
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,920
What does it have to do with us?

709
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,730
One is negligent.

710
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,300
and the other will file a lawsuit.

711
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,450
We represent one party.

712
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,500
What's the problem with that?

713
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,930
There's no problem. I just feel...

714
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,090
You feel like I'm betraying someone. Is that it?

715
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,200
I don't think I've done anything wrong.

716
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,410
Yingzi, we worked for Xu Zhuo

717
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,450
for a few months,

718
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,410
and just because of your words,

719
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,500
we left without taking a penny.

720
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,890
Why? On what grounds?

721
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,410
I'll be honest with you,

722
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,570
I thought about today back then,

723
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,820
which is why I agreed to give up

724
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,500
our right to compensation.

725
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Now we finally have the chance

726
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,780
to take on a big case.

727
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,260
And you're telling me to give it up?

728
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,950
No, that's not what I meant.

729
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,370
Then what do you mean?

730
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,060
I don't know.

731
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,970
Maybe I haven't thought it through.

732
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,930
How about this? Qiu Hua,

733
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,460
if you want to take it, then go ahead.

734
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,480
I'm really not sure.

735
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,500
How about we represent Dingxin?

736
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,130
Mr. Liu is familiar with us.

737
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,060
If we propose to represent them now,

738
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,140
he will definitely agree.

739
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,350
Xia Shu. Stop talking nonsense, okay?

740
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,170
You clearly know

741
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,300
we were part of Zhuoyue Law Firm's team of administrators.

742
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,020
If we represent Dingxin,

743
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,860
won't Xu Zhuo seize

744
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,300
our weakness. right away?

745
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,150
Yes, it's inappropriate to represent Dingxin.

746
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,710
What do you mean by that?

747
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,130
Just because the other party is Liangcheng Law Firm,

748
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,490
you're suddenly feeling sympathy for them?

749
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,480
It shows that I'm ruthless

750
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,820
and mean, right?

751
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,090
Isn't this just a normal business?

752
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,210
Tell me what's wrong here.

753
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,580
Back when I was at Liangcheng Law Firm,

754
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,610
Han bullied me.

755
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,820
I went to Fang Lihong to complain.

756
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,909
Did she show me any sympathy?

757
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,090
When the three of us were kicked out,

758
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,510
did she ever feel sorry for us?

759
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,820
Chen Shuo made a lot of money for them.

760
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,699
But when things went wrong, they cut him off.

761
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,360
Did they sympathize with Chen Shuo?

762
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,780
So why is it that when it comes to me,

763
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,570
I can't do normal business

764
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,010
without having to feel sorry for them?

765
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,300
Qiu Hua. Don't misunderstand.

766
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,780
I didn't say that.

767
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:27,929
That's not what we meant.

768
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,260
Then what do you mean?

769
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,630
Fine, you are more noble than I am,

770
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,449

771
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,889
You are rich people,

772
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,900
You leave money on the table

773
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,219
to show your integrity.

774
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,530
I can't afford that. I don't have money. I need to earn.

775
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,139
If you don't agree to take the case,

776
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,090
I'll find another firm

777
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,170
to represent them with me.

778
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,940
Is that okay?

779
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,180
Okay, then I agree.

780
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,050
What do you think, Xia Shu?

781
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,160
Qiu. Are you trying to split from us?

782
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,140
I didn't say that.

783
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,930
Then I agree.

784
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,300
We three agreed to never split up.

785
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,850
We are a team.

786
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:10,930
Okay.

787
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,090
I'll find another firm

788

789
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,620
I believe any firm would want this case.

790

I don't know.

793
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,830
Actually, Qiu Hua was right,

794
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,140
but

795
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,450
I really can't go through with it.

796
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,120
This case

797
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,660
would push Liangcheng Law Firm back to the Stone Age.

798
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,860
But no matter who takes the case,

799
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,140
they'll be pushed back to the Stone Age.

But what about Qiu Hua?

804
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,010
Are we going to hurt our own partner

805

806

If we don't take it, she can still take it.

That shouldn't hurt her, right?

I don't know.
