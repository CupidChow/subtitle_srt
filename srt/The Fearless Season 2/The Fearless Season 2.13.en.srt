00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,670
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,090
Mr. Zhao, you can't barge in.

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,680
You need to make an appointment to meet a lawyer.

5
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,950
Let go.

6
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,160
Mr. Zhao, I'll call security if you keep this up.

7
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't drag me.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Sun,  it's okay.

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,310
It's okay.

10
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,690
Don't drag me.

11
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,509
Mr. Chen, no matter how busy you are,

12
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,789
you must take my case.

13
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,840
Mr. Zhao, you are really strange.

14
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,070
It's just a bigamy charge.

15
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,590
At most, you'll get two years.

16
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,070
Any lawyer can handle it.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,760
And hiring me is expensive;

18
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,860
why make such strength?

19
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,030
I know you're impressive.

20
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,690
I can tell that

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,150
the two female lawyers

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,150
have a good relationship with you, right?

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,320
This case must be handled by you.

24
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,780
Wait, you figured that out?

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,590
Then I must not be hiding deep enough, huh?

26
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,579
Come in, Mr. Zhao.

27
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,840
Are you sure you want me to represent you?

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,430
Then I will make requirements,

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,430
like I said,

30
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,560
600,000, not a cent less.

31
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,120
Mr. Chen,

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,540
if I had money, never mind 600,000;

33
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,250
I'd pay 6 million.

34
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,880
But you know my situation,

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,910
I'm still on the defaulters' list.

36
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,000
Save it.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,960
People like you

38
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,050
might owe money,

39
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,440
but that doesn't mean you're broke.

40
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,460
Besides,

41
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,640
you don't have to pay

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,250
the 600,000 yuan.

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,070
Who?

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,560
Think about it. If Ms. Jiao

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,220
doesn't sue,

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,340
you won't need to pay the legal fee—

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,670
you save that money.

48
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,000
If Ms. Jiao does sue

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
and you go to jail for bigamy,

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,310
you won't end up with

51
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,680
nothing.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Even a 90-10 split

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
would be worth more than 600,000, right?

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,870
Wait,

55
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,120
Do you want me to represent you or not?

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,490
If you do, don't wait for Ms. Jiao's money;

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,290
transfer it to me now.

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,829
Once you do, I'll renegotiate with them right away

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,800
and try to stop them from suing you.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Even if they do sue, I'll fight for a lighter sentence.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,560
If you get their forgiveness,

62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,260
you might not even have to serve time.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,560
Mr. Chen.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,750
I'm giving you five seconds to decide.

65
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,190
If you don't sign, that's it.

66
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,360
Find someone else,

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,630
I'm not taking the case.

68
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,360
Five.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,030
Four.

70
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,400
Three.

71
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,560
Two.

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,430
One.

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,079
Please.

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,990
I'll sign it.

75
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,280
I'll sign it.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,210
Are you signing it?

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,030
Unscrupulous Chen, you're here.

78
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,960
What does this mean?

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,430
This is my first time here.

80
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,540
To show my sincerity,

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,150
I brought a flower basket.

82
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,300
Where's your client?

83
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,900
Here.

84
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,510
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,710
Come in.

86
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,390
Just leave it at the door.

87
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,250
Thank you.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
We didn't just bring a flower basket;

89
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,160
we also brought a banner.

90
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Let me open it and show you.

[Bonnie of Legal Community, Righteous Luo]

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,800
Chen Shuo, you're not young anymore.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,870
Why do you spend your days doing nothing serious?

94
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,800
What do you mean I'm not doing anything serious?

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Last time, we cooperated

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,120
and won He Qiaohui's case

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,980
so brilliantly.

98
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,900
We should give ourselves a banner

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,560
to celebrate how well we did.

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,390
Well, if I say we're like the Smiths,

101
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,510
and you say I'm not as handsome as Brad Pitt,

102
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,750
then I'll go with Bonnie and Clyde.

103
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,270
Hang it in the office, okay?

104
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,240
No, no. Put it back.

105
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,730
Let's get down to business.

106
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,750
Ms. Jiao hasn't arrived yet.

107
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,750
How about this,

108
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,870
Mr. Zhao, take a seat.

109
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,490
Ms. Qiu went to pick up Ms. Jiao.

110
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,420
They'll be here soon.

111
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,920
Are you nervous? It's okay.

112
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,070
You can spin your chair a bit to relieve some stress.

113
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,720
Wait, he likes spinning in the chair.

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,080
Ms. Jiao, this way, please.

115
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,920
Coming.

116
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,390
Ms. Jiao.

117
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,280
Yanling, I was wrong.

118
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,120
How about we talk it through again?

119
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't sue me.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,430
Ms. Luo, I'm short on time.

121
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,630
Let's make it quickly.

122
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,830
Okay. Have a seat.

123
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,290
-Mr. Chen.
-Go.

124
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,950
Well,

125
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,650
I don't think

126
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,750
there's much need for further discussion today

127
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,950
because my client's

128
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,110
position is already quite clear.

129
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,360
No, no, let's keep things peaceful.

130
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,390
And Mr. Zhao Wei

131
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,830
has realized his mistake,

132
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,800
right, Mr. Zhao?

133
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Yanling.

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,750
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm an animal.

136
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,420
I don't deserve to be your husband,

137
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,909
nor do I deserve to be the father of our child.

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,750
I don't want anything now.

139
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,380
I just beg you to let me go.

140
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,070
After all, we were once married,

141
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,570
and I'm still the child's father.

142
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,260
If I go to jail,

143
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,310
it won't be good for the child, right?

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,210
Do you have anything else to say?

145
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Yanling.

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,430
She's very sincere.

147
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,160
Come on.

148
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,680
I was wrong.

149
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,230
Please let me go.

150
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,390
Please forgive me.

151
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't go to jail.

152
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,840
My child outside is still young,

153
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,950
and that woman is useless.

154
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,070
I've got a huge debt outside.

155
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,870
Get up and sit down.

156
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,340
Let's talk this through properly.

157
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,950
Say whatever you need to say.

158
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,000
You can hit me or scold me.

159
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,560
If you don't forgive me, I won't get up.

160
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,750
Don't kneel!

161
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,330
Stand up!

162
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,440
Sit down.

163
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,960
Talk to me

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,710
like a man.

165
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,370
Zhao Wei,

166
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,740
you know my condition isn't good;

167
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,860
I have a disability in my leg.

168
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,360
Since I was a child,

169
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,800
I've always felt like

170
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
no one in the world would ever like me,

171
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,610
so I've been very insecure and weak.

172
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,770
Whenever someone shows me even the slightest bit of kindness,

173
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I cherish it doubly.

174
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,720
Until I met you.

175
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,260
Although we didn't live together for long,

176
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,710
you gave me care and warmth.

177
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,190
You showed me that life can be lived in a different way.

178
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
All these years,

179
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,810
even though you haven't been by my side,

180
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,950
I've always cherished

181
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,120
the beautiful days you gave me.

182
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,320
I miss them too.

183
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,990
It's been18 years.

184
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,850
Zhao Wei,

185
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,340
I always thought I was living for you.

186
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,920
I thought, as long as I worked hard

187
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,640
to build a career,

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
I could hand it all over to you

189
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,300
when you came back.

190
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,930
But later, I realized I was wrong.

191
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm not living for you.

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,320
I'm not living for anyone else.

193
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,320
I'm living for myself.

194
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,310
And by living for myself, I became stronger.

195
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,840
You're strong too.

196
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,400
Can you stop talking?

197
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,610
Do you understand?

198
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,799
Yes.

199
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,260
Actually,

200
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,870
I didn't want to be so heartless.

201
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,750
I wanted to leave some dignity for you,

202
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,130
for me, and for the child.

203
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,790
But you slowly

204
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,120
tore everything apart.

205
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,160
I didn't come here to settle scores with you.

206
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm here to thank you.

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,670
I want to thank you

208
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,380
for once giving me such a warm home,

209
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,290
for giving me such an excellent son.

210
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,060
I also want to thank you

211
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,670
for making me so strong.

212
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,150
For that, I will give what I need to give,

213
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,120
but you

214
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
have to face what you need to face.

215
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,250
Zhao Wei,

216
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,290
you have to grow up.

217
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Ms. Luo,

218
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,550
I'll leave the rest to you.

219
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,260
Okay, let us see you off.

220
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,690
See you, Ms. Jiao.

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,860
Yan...

222
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,720
Ms. Jiao,

223
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,120
what you just said is great.

224
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,750
We would like to

225
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,960
seek your opinion once more.

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
You have two options.

227
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,150
The first option is

228
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,410
to use the threat of not suing him for bigamy

229
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,870
to pressure him into giving up his claim to property division,

230
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
and have him leave with nothing.

231
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,110
The second option is

232
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
to sue him for bigamy,

233
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,190
which would lead to legal consequences for him,

234
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,200
but part of your property

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,730
would also be taken by him.

236
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,200
I choose the second option.

237
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,420
Mr. Chen,

238
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,230
what should we do next?

239
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,790
Look what you've done

240
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,970
to such a good woman.

241
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,760
You saw how resolutely she left just now.

242
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,220
She's definitely going to sue you for bigamy.

243
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,750
Suing him for bigamy?

244
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,440
Yes.

245
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,350
Give him what's his.

246
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,560
It's all money I earned before.

247
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
I can still make more in the future.

248
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,140
Let him receive the punishment he deserves.

249
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,310
Got it.

250
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,120
Then, from now on,

251
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,600
let's focus all our energy on the criminal part.

252
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,960
As for the outlook, I've already explained it to you.

253
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,620
The legal consequences are unavoidable.

254
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,480
Right now, you should just focus on behaving well

255
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,120
so that she might forgive you.

256
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,290
That way, you might get a lighter sentence.

257
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,390
Okay, I'll listen to you.

258
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,070
Thank you.

259
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
It's my duty.

260
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,780
It's my duty.

261
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
If a woman becomes confident,

262
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,790
her aura will be unstoppable.

263
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,000
But Unscrupulous Chen

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,140
can make some money again.

265
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,840
How does he always manage to

266
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,140
get something out of everyone?

267
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,750
You're back, Ms. Luo.

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,600
I just saw Ms. Jiao leave so decisively,

269
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,510
but you also saw Mr. Zhao

270
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,710
kneel down directly right there.

271
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,670
He truly sincerely apologized.

272
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,510
So,

273
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,630
please help him get another chance to meet

274
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,460
and talk, alright?

275
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,270
You did see it too, didn't you?

276
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,580
How can they talk about this?

277
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,390
It can only be settled in court.

278
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,680
Ms. Luo,

279
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,340
I'm begging you,

280
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,910
can you help me plead for a chance?

281
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
No, no, no.

282
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,870
Mr. Zhao.

283
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,100
Don't make it difficult for Ms. Luo.

284
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,270
I know what you want to say.

285
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll discuss the rest with Ms. Luo.

286
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,640
Please go back and wait for my news.

287
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,240
Okay.

288
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Don't worry.

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,390
Thank you.

290
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,210
I'm leaving. Bye.

291
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,540
Close the door. Thank you.

292
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,000
Go ahead.

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,550
What do you want to discuss on his behalf?

294
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,910
Congratulations on winning me again.

295
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,150
Congratulations on making another dishonest profit.

296
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,550
Dishonest profit is money.

297
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,910
But don't worry.

298
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,030
Zhao Wei

299
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,320
hasn't fulfilled any

300
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
parental duties in the past 18 years.

301
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,370
We'll make sure he leaves with nothing.

302
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,620
And you can't get the money you want.

303
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,440
Don't worry.

304
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,820
The 600,000 agency fee...

305
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,630
It's

306
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,670
already fully paid.

307
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,150
And one last thing,

308
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,910
please

309
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,920
pass on to Ms. Jiao that

310
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,220
our side is willing to accept a smaller share of the property division.

311
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,390
But could you help us

312
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,020
get a written acknowledgment signed?

313
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,860
One third.

314
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
One quarter.

315
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,870
As long as the debt is cleared, is that okay?

316
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Wait, Chen Shuo, are you kidding me?

317
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
You know

318
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,200
I can't make decisions for the client.

319
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll try to help you

320
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,790
communicate with Ms. Jiao.

321
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,060
Okay, thank you.

322
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,080
And by the way,

323
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,550
take your little ragged banner with you.

324
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
You're driving a luxury car,

325
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,200
but you're giving me a tiny little banner?

326
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Are you kidding me?

327
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,270
I've seen and experienced enough, alright?

328
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,920
What does seeing and experiencing have to do with it?

329
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,560
It's just fun.

330
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,120
She's still very resistant.

331
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,730
Be patient.

332
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,420
Be patient.

333
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,030
Great. Thank you.

334
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,790
Welcome to come often.

335
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,870
It's been a while since you've been here.

336
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,360
Yes.

337
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,790
Ask the kitchen to hurry with this table's dishes.

338
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,360
You can try other dishes next time.

339
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,550
Okay.

340
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,440
Enjoy your meal.

341
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,300
Mingshan Group, which was established in 1998,

342
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,550
is the largest iron ore production enterprise

343
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,120
in Jingnan City.

344
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,600
It has been supplying iron ore to another large private enterprise,

345
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,980
Minghai Steel Group, year-round.

346
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
The two companies have established

347
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,150
a long-term and stable supply-demand relationship.

348
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,750
The owners of these two companies

349
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,010
are not outsiders.

350
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,220
They are brothers.

351
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,870
The man on the left, Sun Minghai,

352
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
is the founder of Minghai Steel Group

353
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
and the older brother.

354
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,300
The man on the right,

355
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,880
Sun Mingshan, is the younger brother

356
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,290
and the founder of Mingshan Mining Group.

357
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,680
One runs a mining business, and the other runs a steelmaking business.

358
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,350
At their peak,

359
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,080
the taxes and profits generated by both companies

360
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,240
accounted for over 20%

361
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,390
of Jingnan City's fiscal revenue.

362
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,200
It's not an exaggeration to say that

363
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,960
these two companies

364
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,730
are the lifeblood of Jingnan.

365
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,510
This kind of case is the hardest to handle.

366
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,400
The year before last, Minghai Group underwent restructuring,

367
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,910
and a state-owned enterprise took over.

368
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,730
Sun Minghai was ousted

369
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,530
and soon passed away from illness.

370
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,500
Minghai Group changed its owner,

371
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,400
while Mingshan Group began pressing for payment.

372
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,940
However, Minghai Group

373
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,620
turned its back and refused to pay.

374
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,780
By this time, the outstanding debt had reached

375
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
over 50 million,

376
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,680
with late fees

377
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,170
exceeding 17 million.

378
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,220
At this point, Mingshan Group

379
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,780
is also on the brink of bankruptcy

380
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,810
due to the burden of this debt.

381
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,120
Mr. Qian,

382
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
these are the repayment agreements

383
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,500
[Mingshan Group Founder, Sun Mingshan]

384
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,510
for the long-standing debt between our two companies.

385
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,400
Minghai Group is our big boss

386
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,890
and a long-term client.

387
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,550
If it weren't for this overdue payment

388
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,230
putting us in such a difficult position,

389
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,210
we wouldn't have invited everyone here today.

390
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,430
Mr. Qian, I hope you can consider our

391
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,130
long-standing cooperation

392
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,560
and at least repay a portion of the debt

393
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,980
so we can maintain normal operations.

394
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,280
A new administration doesn't deal with old debts.

395
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,260
Everyone knows the relationship

396
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,300
between the former Minghai Group executive and your company.

397
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,240
[Minghai Group's Current Executive, Mr. Qian]

398
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,860
Agreements between blood brothers

399
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
are highly questionable.

400
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,150
If Mingshan believes we're being unreasonable,

401
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,360
then Mr. Sun, you have to take this matter elsewhere.

402
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,550
Sorry, I'm busy.

403
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,480
I won't deal with it any further.

404
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,720
Mr. Qian.

405
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,440
Mr. Qian.

406
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,830
Recently, Mingshan Group announced an open tender

407
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,530
to hire a law firm to sue

408
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,070
Minghai Group for debt repayment.

409
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,390
The litigation agency fee

410
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,230
is set at 9% of the recovered debt,

411
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
plus 50% of the late fees.

412
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,000
Theoretically,

413
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,290
this could amount to over ten million.

414
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,970
More than ten million?

415
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,720
That's a lucrative deal.

416
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,270
This is great news.

417
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,580
As long as Mingshan Group

418
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,240
has solid evidence,

419
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,350
there's no reason they would lose this case.

420
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,530
Nothing comes from nothing.

421
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,620
Since Mingshan Group can't

422
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,880
afford the legal fees,

423
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,840
they're offering

424
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,300
a full contingency arrangement

425
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,270
and adding a series of harsh conditions.

426
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,670
In other words,

427
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,240
Mingshan Group will pay nothing

428
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,150
for this case.

429
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,760
All litigation expense

430
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,940
will be covered by the law firm.

431
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,840
Just hiring an accounting firm

432
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,720
to audit the accounts

433
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,170
could cost hundreds of thousands.

434
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,390
Besides,

435
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,000
all agency fees

436
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,780
will come from the recovered funds

437
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,520
after a successful lawsuit.

438
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,710
Even if we win the case,

439
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,600
if there's no way to enforce it,

440
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,740
the lawyers won't get paid.

441
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,990
Ms. Fang,

442
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,829
If we take the case,

443
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,130
will the firm bear the risk?

444
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
If someone takes it,

445
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,829
he'll have to shoulder most of the risk himself.

446
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,770
Like what?

447
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,829
Upfront costs.

448
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,270
In other words,

449
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,829
even if we win the case

450
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,829
but the losing party doesn't pay,

451
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,240
we still have to shoulder

452
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,560
the upfront costs ourselves, right?

453
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,310
Yes.

454
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,880
That means

455
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,480
no one should take it, right?

456
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,920
Who wants to take it?

457
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,500
Who wants to take it?

458
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,920
No. No.

459
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,310
No one wants to make the big sum of money?

460
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,530
Let me take it.

461
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,060
I'll take it.

462
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,550
Well,

463
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,280
young man can't be too ambitious.

464
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,200
Just listen to me.

465
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,240
This case

466
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,200
comes with high risks and high costs.

467
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,720
If you win, of course

468
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,460
most of the money will go to you.

469
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,850
But if you lose...

470
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,960
If I lose, Mr. Han, will

471
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,360
No.

472
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,690
Do all the other partners have any losses?

473
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,160
No.

474
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,510
That's right. So if there are no losses,

475
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,180
doesn't that prove that our firm has no losses?

476
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,010
I will personally bear all the litigation costs.

477
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,080
Since

478
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,620
I'm taking on the costs,

479
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,640
the corresponding profits should increase as well.

480
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,010
According to the firm's usual practice,

481
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,960
the commission for a case

482
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,270
is 30%,

483
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,910
but for this case,

484
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,540
it's 20%,

485
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,650
and the remaining will go to me personally.

486
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,460
Why didn't we

487
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,970
think of that idea?

488
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,950
He

489
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,290
has no sense of the bigger picture.

490
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
That's exactly his trait.

491
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,760
I recommended him

492
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,870
for this trait back then.

493
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,820
Our firm is too set in its ways;

494
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,830
we need fresh blood like this.

495
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,970
What do you think of his plan?

496
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,960
Same as you.

497
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,920
I'm fully supportive.

498
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,130
Although we voted in favor,

499
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,110
I'm still a bit hesitant

500
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,590
to leave everything to him.

501
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,990
So, what do you plan to do?

502
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,830
You go talk to Han.

503
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,150
I have nothing to talk to him; you can talk to him.

504
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,260
Tao Zheng.

505
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,400
Let's talk.

506
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,110
Come in.

507
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
Ms. Fang.

508
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,070
Are you free now?

509
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,960
Yes. Anytime.

510
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,470
Have a chat.

511
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,480
Okay.

512
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,750
Have a seat.

513
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,800
Fang Rui, could you step aside for a moment?

514
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,790
He's doing well. He's been very dedicated here with me.

515
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,480
Your courage is commendable

516
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,270
for accepting the case just now,

517
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,920
I really admire you.

518
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,890
Really? I'm so happy.

519
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,880
Chen Shuo,

520
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,890
as I mentioned in the meeting earlier,

521
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,720
the firm isn't

522
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,160
completely at ease

523
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,520
handing such a big case over to you.

524
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,840
In case something goes wrong,

525
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,380
the firm will still have to cover for you.

526
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,610
We decided to arrange someone

527
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,310
to work with you on the case.

528
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,400
Arrange someone?

529
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,780
Is it Mr. Han?

530
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,680
Han.

531
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,940
The leader is here.

532
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm just feeling a bit uncomfortable.

533
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,660
The new guy is always eager to show off.

534
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,310
We veterans should just step aside.

535
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,030
When I saw him at the time,

536
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,210
he was really eager to give it a try.

537
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,990
The firm has really put a lot of thought into this.

538
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,330
Now, I'll give you a chance to assist him.

539
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,590
You and Chen Shuo take this case together.

540
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,250
What do you think about it?

541
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,560
I feel like it's because you're

542
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,480
not confident in us newcomers,

543
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,680
so you're sending someone to keep an eye on me.

544
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,400
No, no, no.

545
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,480
That's not what I meant.

546
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,030
To be honest, I'm really not at ease

547
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,510
handing such a big case over to him.

548
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,790
With you,

549
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,510
first,

550
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,610
you'll supervise the whole process

551
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,050
as a partner,

552
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,100
and second,

553
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,120
you'll ensure everything goes smoothly

554
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,350
while still making money.

555
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,880
To be honest, I'm not sure whether Mr. Han

556
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,240
has handled cases like this before.

557
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,440
I'm worried he might hold me back.

558
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,850
He's dealt with all sorts of cases.

559
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,350
Besides, Han is a veteran.

560
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,140
Exactly.

561
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,840
I don't care about money at all.

562
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm just loyal.

563
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,350
I'm fine with it.

564
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,980
Okay.

565
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,430
Are you feeling better?

566
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,890
When have I ever been sick?

567
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,320
I hope you have a good cooperation.

568
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,350
Of course.

569
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,580
Let me remind you,

570
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,550
the real challenge of this case

571
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,540
lies outside the case itself.

572
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,590
These two companies

573
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,310
have very complicated backgrounds

574
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,680
and relationships locally.

575
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,880
If things escalate to an unmanageable level,

576
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,420
it's very likely, as Mr. Han mentioned,

577
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,110
that the clients

578
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,470
might betray us.

579
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,960
So, Chen Shuo,

580
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
you need to be mentally prepared.

581
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,100
Ms. Fang, I know when to assess the situation

582
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,850
and weigh the pros and cons.

583
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,680
If I do come across any

584
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,550
extreme situations,

585
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,520
I'll make sure to cut my losses in time.

586
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,460
Don't worry.

587
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,130
Let's get back to the case.

588
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,900
If they owe money,

589
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,070
they should pay it back, right?

590
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,820
If the other party refuses to pay,

591
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,430
then I believe in the law.

592
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,710
The law is fair,

593
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,080
and it will issue a just ruling.

594
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,480
I hope so.

595
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,250
Okay, that's it.

596
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

597
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,680
Mr. Chen,

598
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,980
by the way,

599
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,240
ever since you joined the firm,

600
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,680
it seems you've been going through old case files.

601
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,210
Is there something on your mind?

602
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
No.

603
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,170
I just studied.

604
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
You know, every firm has its own style,

605
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,810
and its own way of handling cases.

606
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
I'll follow the customs, right?

607
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,830
So, now that I'm at Liangcheng Law Firm,

608
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,830
I will definitely

609
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,370
review all the major cases

610
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,960
handled by our partners.

611
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,900
It'll help me improve my practice.

612
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
Take that case you handled,

613
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,720
the one representing Donghai Ocean Corporation, as an example.

614
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,030
Don't mention my case.

615
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,320
Your thinking is just…

616
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,020
My case has been over for a long time.

617
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,960
Forget it.

618
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,840
The future of Liangcheng Law Firm depends on you guys.

619
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,960
I will work hard.

620
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,920
Thank you.

621
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,870
I'll get going. You carry on.

622
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,830
No need to see me out.

623
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,290
She claimed it was for my own good,

624
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,410
but actually, she's just putting someone to keep an eye on me.

625
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,050
The older, the wiser.

626
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,240
Bro, I never really escaped your grasp.

627
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,710
Don't say that.

628
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,880
The firm thinks I'm busy all day but not making any money.

629
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,130
You take the big share, and I just get the leftovers.

630
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,280
You really know how to put it.

631
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,240
Come on.

632
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,370
Let's get down to business.

633
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
I did the math;

634
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,220
litigation costs and audit fees

635
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,050
are roughly split fifty-fifty.

636
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,070
You're leading the litigation,

637
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,380
so that part's on you,

638
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,710
and I'll cover the audit fees.

639
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,680
What do you think?

640
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,480
What do you mean?

641
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,780
Do you think the audit fee is cheap?

642
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,680
No, no, no.

643
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,070
Wait, Mr. Han, let me remind you,

644
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,800
the audit fee is expensive.

645
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,450
If you hire a good accounting firm

646
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,110
to go through these past 10 years of accounts thoroughly,

647
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,660
it'll cost around five to six hundred thousand.

648
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,940
With other expenses added in,

649
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,160
the total will come to about one hundred thirty or forty thousand.

650
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,330
That's quite a lot of money.

651
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,260
No matter how much it is, I'll pay.

652
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,720
Why do I feel like there's a trap?

653
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,510
There's an accounting firm that

654
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,710
still owes me agency fees and hasn't paid.

655
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,610
How can someone owe you money?

656
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,220
We haven't been at odds for a while.

657
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,850
Is your ability to get scammed decreasing?

658
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Which lawyer hasn't been screwed over by his clients?

659
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,410
They've owed me hundreds of thousands

660
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,880
for over a year and still won't pay.

661
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,830
So this time,

662
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,430
I'll give them the audit work

663
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,660
and consider it as payment for the agency fees.

664
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,110
They'll definitely agree.

665
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,650
Which accounting firm?

666
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,520
Fangzhong.

667
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,310
I know all the famous accounting firms

668
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,400
in Jingbei.

669
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,680
I've never heard of Fangzhong.

670
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,930
It's a small firm, only established for less than two years.

671
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,560
It hasn't even been two years, but it owes you hundreds of thousands?

672
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,600
I take back what I said.

673
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,180
You're amazing, brother.

674
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,950
No.

675
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,160
Well, brother,

676
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,190
could you just do me a favor?

677
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:19,960
It's settled then.

678
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,070
Thank you.

679
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,770
You're welcome.

680
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,760
As for the cost,

681
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,640
we'll split it evenly, alright?

682
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,650
But for the agency fee...

683
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,070
We absolutely can't split it evenly.

684
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,720
Don't blame me.

685
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,500
Didn't you hear it at the meeting?

686
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,370
This case is my own.

687
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,280
You are just here to assist me.

688
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,030
So, under the circumstances,

689
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,510
if you agree, it'll be a 70-30 split.

690
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll take 70%, you take 30%.

691
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,990
That can't be possible.

692
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,110
Stop talking.

693
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,970
You are too much.

694
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,190
Just kidding.

695
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,910
I'll take 30%, you take 70%.

696
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm kidding.

697
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Deal.

698
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Look, without even realizing it,

699
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,640
our two great hands have come together again.

700
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,680
We could have four.

701
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,350
Even greater.

702
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,030
You're here.

703
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,560
Mr. Wei,

704
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,270
your scheduled guest has arrived.

705
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,410
Okay.

706
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,210
Hello, Mr. Wei Cheng.

707
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,110
I'm Luo Yingzi,

708
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,110
a lawyer at Yinghua Law Firm.

709
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,110
Madam Mei Daliang was my teacher during the judicial exam.

710
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,670
Sit.

711
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,790
Ms. Luo,

712
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,750
what brings you here?

713
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,750
I came to learn about

714
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,310
your case from back then.

715
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,730
Who asked you to come?

716
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,840
Madam Mei?

717
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,400
No, she doesn't know.

718
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,650
Madam Mei is my teacher.

719
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,750
I know she and her husband

720
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,070
were treated unjustly

721
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,620
because of that case.

722
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,770
Her husband lost his life because of it.

723
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,270
But Madam Mei has always believed that

724
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,810
what happened back then wasn't rape,

725
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,590
but rather a mutual transaction.

726
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,270
And you were involved in that case.

727
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,960
Ms. Luo,

728
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,980
I don't want to bring up the past again.

729
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,990
Mr. Wei,

730
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,270
I know you're doing well

731
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,570
in your father's company now,

732
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,960
but if

733
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
that case from back then isn't cleared up,

734
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,270
you'll always have a criminal record.

735
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,110
However, if we can

736
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,880
uncover the truth,

737
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,070
it could be...

738
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,880
Ms. Luo,

739
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,640
I don't want to find out the truth.

740
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,890
I have a meeting at 10:30.

741
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,610
Please leave now.

742
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,550
Mr. Wei, could you please

743
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,130
think about Madam Mei and her late husband?

744
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,030
After all, they both suffered

745
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,490
because of your case back then.

746
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,030
If you really came here for that case,

747
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,990
then I'm not the one you should be asking.

748
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,720
I know nothing,

749
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,370
absolutely nothing.

750
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,400
Mr. Wei,

751
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,740
I hope you can think it over.

752
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,070
If you've made up your mind,

753
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,350
feel free to contact me.

754
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,160
Thank you.

755
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,110
Come in.

756
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,070
Hello, I'm No.33 beautician

757
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,470
and I'll be serving you today.

758
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,640
Madam, haven't you changed yet?

759
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,110
Hello, are you Ms. Yang Cuili?

760
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,270
Who are you?

761
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm a lawyer from Yinghua Law Firm.

762
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm Luo Yingzi.

763
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,490
Ms. Yang, can we talk?

764
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,730
About what?

765
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,030
I'd like to talk to you

766
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,160
about your case with Wei Cheng from back then.

767
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,070
You approached Madam Mei back then,

768
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,350
saying it wasn't rape but a transaction.

769
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,210
But why did you

770
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,290
change your story in court?

771
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,880
Did Mr. Mei ask you to come?

772
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,890
Don't get me wrong.

773
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,550
This has nothing to do with her.

774
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,290
She didn't ask me to come to you.

775
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,890
But I want to get to the bottom of the truth.

776
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
I believe someone was trying to frame Madam Mei.

777
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,430
Ms. Yang,

778
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,810
it's just the two of us now.

779
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,560
I can assure you that

780
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,620
anything you tell me

781
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,410
will not be mentioned anywhere

782
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,120
without your consent.

783
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,510
There's no truth to uncover.

784
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,880
The truth is what I said in court.

785
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,240
But I know Madam Mei.

786
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,800
She wouldn't have encouraged you to commit perjury.

787
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,890
I believe something

788
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,750
must have happened

789
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,640
between the testimony you gave to the prosecution back then

790
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,510
and the change of statement in court later.

791
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,990
Did someone say something to you?

792
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,740
Can you tell me?

793
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,200
Why should I tell you?

794
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,190
What's in it for me?

795
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,170
Madam Mei lost her lawyer's license

796
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,640
because of this.

797
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,640
And her husband lost his life

798
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,690
because of it.

799
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,990
I'm sorry. I'll have someone else serve you.

800
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,630
I have nothing to say about that.

801
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,340
I have a husband and children now.

802
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,870
If you disturb my life again,

803
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,710
don't blame me for being rude to you.

804
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:38,790
Yang...

805
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,570
[Madam Mei]

806
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,750
Hello, Madam Mei.

807
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,720
Yingzi,

808
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,810
why are you still looking into that case?

809
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,270
Yes, I never give up on it.

810
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,750
I was just too busy recently

811
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,720
to focus on it.

812
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,290
Wei Cheng told you, didn't he?

813
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,420
Come to me

814
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,260
when you are free.

815
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,420
[Complex Building]

816
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,000
Madam Mei.

817
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,370
Come in.

818
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,790
Madam Mei.

819
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,480
Look,

820
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,280
I brought you a small gift.

821
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,200
Stand here.

822
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,590
What's wrong?

823
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,680
I already told you that

824
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,270
I'm not looking into the Wei Cheng's case anymore.

825
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,350
Why did you still go to him?

826
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,290
Madam Mei, I really don't understand.

827
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,440
Do you truly believe

828
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,270
Liangcheng Law Firm

829
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,310
was involved in this case?

830
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,890
If things are really as you suspect,

831
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,950
then all the more reason to uncover the truth.

832
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,000
That's the only way

833
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,160
to clear your and Mr. Yu's names.

834
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,120
This case

835
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,820
happened almost 10 years ago.

836
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,880
The people involved

837
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,790
have moved on with their lives.

838
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,340
There's no need to disturb them anymore.

839
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,150
If you don't understand that, then stop investigating.

840
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,800
You must stop.

841
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,110
Madam Mei,

842
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,520
maybe I approached this the wrong way.

843
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,620
I promise

844
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,020
I won't contact the people involved again, okay?

845
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,720
I'll find another way

846
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,550
to look into it.

847
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,790
Has your new firm

848
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,030
found its footing?

849
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,440
It's not easy.

850
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,200
What do you mean by "not easy"?

851
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,400
I'm

852
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,950
barely making ends meet at best.

853
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,730
I'm not planning to lend you money.

854
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,860
Madam Mei, you're even cracking jokes now.

855
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,480
How about I refer you to a case?

856
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,640
That's great.

857
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,880
But just so we're clear,

858
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,880
my

859
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
quote is high now.

860
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,790
You're smart.

861
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,480
But success can make people lose their grip.

862
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,790
The case I'm referring you to

863
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,650
is bigger than your usual pay grade.

864
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,750
Wanhe Group

865
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,330
is a diversified holding company

866
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,880
with businesses in consumer goods manufacturing,

867
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,680
real estate, and infrastructure.

868
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,990
Last year, poor management

869
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,860
led to a financial collapse,

870
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,200
leaving the company deep in debt

871
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,270
with massive bank loans.

872
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,470
They had no choice

873
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,250
but to file for bankruptcy.

874
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,640
Wanhe?

875
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,600
My old house was a Wanhe property.

876
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,040
Back when they first went on sale,

877
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,370
you even had to enter a lottery to get one.

878
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,070
It's only been a few years.

879
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,710
Thinking about it, it's been quite a few years.

880
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,679
Now both the homes and the people are gone.

881
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,370
Madam Mei,

882
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,360
I see it says

883
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,230
"bankruptcy administrator" here.

884
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,070
You don't expect our firm

885
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,570
to take on the role of bankruptcy administrator, do you?

886
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,510
That's definitely above my pay grade.

887
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,320
It's a pretty lucrative job.

888
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,630
Come on.

889
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,630
Your firm is newly established.

890
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,880
Do you have the qualifications to act as a bankruptcy administrator?

891
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,710
Can you handle such a large case?

892
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,110
So can't I even dream about it?

893
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,600
The administrator team

894
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,830
has to be publicly selected by the court.

895
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,670
Now there's a firm looking to participate.

896
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,630
They have the qualifications to act as a bankruptcy administrator,

897
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,400
but they're a small firm and need a partner.

898
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,590
They approached me, and I thought of recommending your firm.

899
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,440
Are you asking us to work for them?

900
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,920
I won't do it.

901
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,040
It's better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond.

902
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,510
Forget it then.

903
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,080
I'll just reject Xu Zhuo.

904
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,800
Madam Mei, he's not the lawyer

905
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,510
who represents disadvantaged groups, is he?

906
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,280
It's him.

907
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,320
His Zhuoyue Law Firm wants to participate in

908
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,860
the bankruptcy administrator bidding

909
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,440
and needs a partner.

910
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,530
He approached me, and I recommended your firm to him.

911
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,770
I see.

912
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,110
Didn't you have him give a lecture before?

913
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,320
But isn't he a public interest attorney?

914
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,200
How come he's taking on a case like this?

915
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,370
Public interest attorneys need to make a living too.

916
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,680
Xu Zhuo started as a public interest attorney,

917
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
but recently

918
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,700
he has shifted the focus of his firm.

919
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,960
Over the past few years,

920
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,400
he's been involved in investment, mergers,

921
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,840
and IPOs,

922
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,860
and has gained quite a reputation.

923
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,370
It seems you really admire him.

924
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,390
Madam Mei, did he

925
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,900
serve time in prison twice?

926
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,710
Twice in detention.

927
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,490
He was acquitted both times he went to court.

928
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,990
During his time in detention,

929
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,160
he even came up with ideas for two law books.

930
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,310
What's the deal?

931
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,810
Do you have an opinion about him?

932
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,250
What opinion could I have?

933
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
My firm is small.

934
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,670
My opinion doesn't matter

935
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,320
in the face of opportunities like these.

936
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,680
In my life,

937
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,920
I've had quite a few disciples and students.

938
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,150
What I admire the most

939
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,440
are Fang Lihong

940
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,920
and Xu Zhuo.

941
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,960
Aren't there any others? What about me?

942
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,110
You haven't quite reached that level yet,

943
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,030
but if you team up with Xu Zhuo

944
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,140
this time,

945
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,880
I believe the future holds great potential for you.

946
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,020
This is his business card.

947
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,160
If you're interested, you can go meet him.

948
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,320
Okay, I'll meet him.

949
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,150
Let me see

950
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,850
what charm Xu Zhuo has.

951
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,480
[Zhuoyue Law Firm, Xu Zhuo, Lawyer, Founding Partner]

952
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,840
Pay the salaries!

953
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,050
We need to live!

954
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,550
We need to live!

955
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,230
Be quiet!

956
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,060
Be quiet!

957
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,600
Dear workers,

958
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,140
the company guarantees,

959
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,510
by the end of this month at the latest,

960
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,510
we'll pay one month's salary first,

961
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,230
so you can get by for now, okay?

962
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,550
They've owed us for several months.

963
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,800
How can they just pay one month's salary?

964
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,150
Is that even enough?

965
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,760
Don't listen to him, everyone.

966
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,370
They said the same thing last month,

967
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,060
but we haven't seen a cent since.

968
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,100
They don't have the final say.

969
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,110
Where is Sun Mingshan?

970
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,750
Bring Sun Mingshan out to talk.

971
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,320
Yes.

972
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,630
Yeah, bring Sun Mingshan out to talk.

973
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,290
Come in.

974
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,590
Mr. Sun, our lawyers are here.

975
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,340
Please come in.

976
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,960
May I have your name?

977
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,310
Mr. Sun, I'm Han Zhitong.

978
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,960
Han Zhitong.

979
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,400
Hello, Mr. Han.

980
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,070
I'm Chen Shuo.

981
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,110
Hello, Mr. Chen.

982
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,800
Hello.

983
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,670
I'm Fang.

984
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,080
I've been waiting for you.

985
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,920
Please have a seat.

986
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,880
Please have a seat.

987
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,510
Go get some water.

988
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,280
Come, have a seat.

989
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,000
Please.

990
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,880
Have a seat.

991
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,260
You all saw it

992
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,440
when you came in, right?

993
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,520
Yes.

994
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,480
Mr. Sun, it's tough for you.

995
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,560
Not just tough,

996
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,440
I even want to die.

997
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,040
What should we do now?

998
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,150
They owe us tens of millions.

999
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,210
They're denying it now.

1000
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,140
Isn't this forcing us into a corner?

1001
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,640
If you two

1002
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,880
can help us

1003
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,090
get this money back,

1004
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,730
you'll be the lifesavers

1005
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,400
of me, Sun Mingshan,

1006
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,080
and all the employees of Mingshan Group.

1007
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,170
Did you hear that? We bear huge responsibility.

1008
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,390
Very huge.

1009
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,030
Mr. Sun,

1010
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,860
we understand how you feel.

1011
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,800
Let's get back to work.

1012
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,110
Okay.

1013
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,880
Let's find a place

1014
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,640
where we can have a good talk with your relevant team members.

1015
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,350
How is it?

1016
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,040
There are no big problems.

1017
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,710
Okay.

1018
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,620
Mr. Sun,

1019
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,000
we've already gone through

1020
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,280
the copies of all these materials

1021
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,760
before we came.

1022
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,260
Yes.

1023
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,880
We believe the evidence for the lawsuit

1024
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,960
is quite solid.

1025
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,760
So, the purpose of our visit this time is twofold:

1026
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,320
first, we want to discuss the contract between both parties,

1027
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,110
and second, there are a few questions we'd like to clarify

1028
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
before signing the contract.

1029
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,150
Go ahead.

1030
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,580
Chen, you say it.

1031
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Okay, I'll do it.

1032
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,150
Mr. Sun,

1033
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,890
as far as we know,

1034
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,840
both Mingshan Group and Minghai Group

1035
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,110
are quite influential in Jingnan City.

1036
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,880
But the conflict between your two companies

1037
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,760
has been ongoing for a long time.

1038
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,840
Didn't you

1039
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,440
try negotiating or mediating before?

1040
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,710
Of course, we tried negotiating.

1041
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,550
Who in business

1042
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,190
wants to go to court?

1043
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,110
As soon as we realized

1044
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,230
they had no intention of repaying,

1045
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,360
we first tried to negotiate with them.

1046
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,190
But it didn't work.

1047
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
At first,

1048
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
we asked them to repay the debt, but they refused.

1049
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,150
Then we thought,

1050
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,080
maybe we could reduce the debt

1051
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,400
and let them pay less,

1052
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,030
but when they spoke up,

1053
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,840
they wanted to cut it in half.

1054
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
We couldn't agree to that,

1055
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,510
so the situation

1056
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,070
just stayed deadlocked.

1057
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,070
Later, we thought that

1058
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,840
even getting half of it back

1059
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,360
would be good,

1060
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,550
but they still refused.

1061
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,690
We had no choice

1062
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,320
but to resort to litigation.

1063
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,260
Now we're going to file a lawsuit,

1064
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,900
the other side has started to act like a bully,

1065
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,130
refusing to engage in any further negotiation.

1066
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,280
Not accepting it now,

1067
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,470
doesn't mean that they won't accept it later.

1068
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Mr. Han,

1069
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,760
in front of all of you,

1070
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,430
I want to make it clear on behalf of our Mingshan Group:

1071
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,540
if we still have any hopes

1072
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,630
for negotiating,

1073
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,190
then we won't resort to the litigation.

1074
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,620
The reason we've chosen litigation

1075
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,030
is because we're ready to fully confront them.

1076
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,570
Don't worry. We guarantee that

1077
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,870
we won't accept any negotiations or talks

1078
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,330
outside of the legal terms.

1079
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,540
This can be listed in the contract, right?

1080
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,370
Sure.

1081
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,850
Fang Rui, write it in the contract.

1082
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,800
One more thing,

1083
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,840
the CEO of Minghai Group

1084
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
was your brother.

1085
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,880
Do you know

1086
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
if Minghai Group has any assets

1087
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,870
other than the blast furnace?

1088
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,360
After all, even if we win the lawsuit,

1089
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,230
if the other party has no assets

1090
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,360
to execute,

1091
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,330
we can't just dismantle their blast furnace, can we?

1092
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,150
But I'm really

1093
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,550
not sure about that.

1094
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,770
My brother passed away two years ago.

1095
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,860
They've made major changes

1096
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,540
in the past two years.

1097
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,830
They've demolished and rebuilded.

1098
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,360
What my brother had worked so hard to build

1099
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,110
has almost been completely undone by them.

1100
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,480
But as the old saying goes,

1101
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,460
A starved camel is bigger than a fat horse.

1102
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,830
Yes.

1103
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,310
When my brother was still alive,

1104
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,460
although

1105
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,630
Minghai Group's business

1106
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,700
wasn't doing too well later on,

1107
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,670
but in terms of overall assets,

1108
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,990
they still have a stronger foundation than we do.

1109
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,910
They just owe tens of millions.

1110
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,750
As long as they want to pay it back,

1111
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,330
they can definitely afford it.

1112
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,400
Mr. Sun,

1113
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,710
I just took a look;

1114
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,340
our group initially proposed

1115
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,510
the lawyer commission rate

1116
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,930
of 9%, right?

1117
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,440
Given the current

1118
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,070
financial situation,

1119
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,530
I have a suggestion:

1120
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,800
we can lower it by one point,

1121
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,030
down to 8%.

1122
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,740
Great.

1123
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,630
Hold on, don't celebrate just yet.

1124
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,410
There's one more condition.

1125
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,950
We need to add a breach of contract clause.

1126
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,440
What is it?

1127
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,070
Once our

1128
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,440
agency agreement is signed,

1129
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,800
without my

1130
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,790
written approval,

1131
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,440
Mingshan Group

1132
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,030
must not engage in any form of negotiation or settlement

1133
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,700
with Minghai Group.

1134
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,440
If you breach this agreement,

1135
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,230
it will be considered that we have fully fulfilled

1136
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,000
our contractual obligations,

1137
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,000
and you will be required to pay the full agency fees.

1138
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,030
So once the Minghai Group

1139
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,710
makes the payment to you,

1140
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,510
you must immediately transfer it to us.

1141
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,870
Immediately.

1142
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,240
Don't worry.

1143
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,940
They've put us through enough suffering.

1144
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,130
We absolutely won't settle with them.

1145
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,950
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1146
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,300
Alright, I'll add these clauses in.
