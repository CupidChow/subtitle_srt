00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,800
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,950
Mr. Zhao, Xue and I

4
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,950
are really good friends.

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,110
He introduced you to me.

6
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,430
I'll definitely keep your matter in mind.

7
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,490
Thank you.

8
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,789
Don't worry.

9
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,050
I'll contact them as soon as possible.

10
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,960
Let's stay in touch by phone.

11
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,080
You've been writing it down.

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,800
I've written down everything you said.

13
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,070
Didn't you say you don't care about winning?

14
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,840
Then why were you writing it down?

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,150
I don't care about winning,

16
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,450
but I have to be responsible.

17
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,330
This is my job.

18
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,600
And besides, Mr. Zhao looked so despicable.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,920
What if...

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,630
What if one day he turns around

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,419
and bites us?

22
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,020
These things will be useful.

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,480
So,

24
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,190
do you think we should sue

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,310
or negotiate with them?

26
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,720
Anyway, I don't want him to get the money.

27
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,960
That's not professional.

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,280
[Righteous Luo]

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,410
I need to take this call.

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,430
Righteous Luo,

31
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,620
you haven't seen me for days, so you miss me, right?

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,720
I want to hit you.

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,560
See you at the bar at 7 o'clock tonight.

34
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,590
You'll be doomed if you don't show up.

35
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,250
What's going on?

36
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,270
Every time I haven't finished speaking, she hangs up on me.

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
Shuo, Fang Rui,

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,470
it's my treat.

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,060
Order whatever you want.

40
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,610
Come on.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,110
Then we can't just drink beer.

42
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,540
Order some wine.

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,380
Shuo.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,520
Just kidding. Come on.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,079
Come on.

46
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,030
Cheers.

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,990
You have quite a sense of justice.

48
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,610
You were pushing Zhao Wei so hard today.

49
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,530
You look down on him, right?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,910
You despise him.

51
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,150
But just a reminder,

52
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,430
this isn't very professional.

53
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,850
Representing such a person

54
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,590
is just aiding evil.

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,570
You're not prepared enough.

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
You're a lawyer.

57
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,100
You can't fight for justice.

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,800
You should fight for the agency fee.

59
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,920
Seriously.

60
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,900
You should drink more to clear your head.

61
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,880
I'm going to the bathroom.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,510
I've been a lawyer for so long,

63
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,990
and I only follow two principles.

64
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,240
Remember,

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,270
first,

66
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,840
don't judge your clients by your

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,820
personal moral standards.

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,560
Second,

69
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,360
always prioritize protecting

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,960
the clients' interests.

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,850
Keep these two points in mind.

72
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,430
Mr. Chen,

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,660
are you having a class here?

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,630
No.

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm just sharing some legal insights with a junior.

76
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,230
Let's talk.

77
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,670
Well, please have a seat.

78
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,800
Wait for me, Fang Rui.

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,360
Go.

80
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,740
What do you want to talk about?

81
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,300
You decide if we should talk about a matter concerning our whole lifetime.

82
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
I'm talking business.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,730
Well,

84
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,800
let's talk about the divorce case of Zhao Wei and Jiao Yanling.

85
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,870
We've already filed the lawsuit.

86
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,850
There's nothing to talk about.

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,870
If there's anything, we can settle it in court.

88
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,240
That's our intention too,

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
settling everything in court.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,000
But

91
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,470
we should respect the clients' wishes, right?

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,950
The wife hopes to

93
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,400
sit down and talk again.

94
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,890
There's nothing to talk about.

95
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,159
Chen Shuo, are you trying to play hard to get with me?

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,510
Do you want to talk or not?

97
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,010
No.

98
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,780
Okay, see you in court.

99
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,210
Let's talk at Liangcheng Law Firm.

100
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,790
Alright, see you then. Bye.

101
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,720
She's really all business.

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Ms. Luo?

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,150
I heard that

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,870
Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu had a life sentence case

105
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,690
retried.

106
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,830
That's like a legend to us.

107
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,240
Legend? That's overdramatic.

108
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,880
Tian.

109
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,300
Just in time. I should thank you.

110
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,510
Thank you for introducing the case to me and Qiu Hua.

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,890
You're welcome, Ms. Luo.

112
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,750
Those two women are really impressive,

113
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,070
both strong on the inside,

114
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,600
but a little different from each other.

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,310
Ms. Qiu is more reserved and subtle.

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,600
But Ms. Luo,

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,950
though she looks like a hedgehog,

118
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,950
is actually

119
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,920
incredibly kind and soft-hearted deep down.

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,000
She's a nice person.

121
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,190
But, Tian, to be honest,

122
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,510
isn't your referral fee

123
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,780
a bit too high?

124
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
The standard referral fee

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,240
for this kind of case is usually 5% to 10%.

126
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,710
Considering

127
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,680
we used to be colleagues and even desk mates,

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,480
how about giving me a discount?

129
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,530
I can't make that call.

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
I'm just a middleman.

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,390
Someone asked me to refer this case to you.

132
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,550
You have an upstream contact? Who is it?

133
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,250
Mr. Chen.

134
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,590
I need to take this call.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,560
Hello?

136
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,360
Mr. Chen, you're praising Ms. Luo so much.

137
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,740
Do you have a bit of a crush on her?

138
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
Is it that obvious?

139
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,200
I just heard that

140
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,990
the main reason you came to Liangcheng Law Firm

141
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,210
was Ms. Luo.

142
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,780
No, no. I'm really

143
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,830
just a money-driven person.

144
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,240
Wherever there's money, I go.

145
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,390
Liangcheng Law Firm has a lot of cases,

146
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,800
so I came here.

147
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,670
You came back because you want to see me again?

148
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,560
I was wondering why luck

149
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,040
suddenly came to our firm.

150
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,760
So it was you, Unscrupulous Chen.

151
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,380
You're cashing in on both the plaintiff and the defendant.

152
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,430
You found out.

153
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,030
Don't be angry.

154
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,950
I just want to defeat you in court one more time.

155
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,490
Who knows who will win?

156
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,390
That's true, we're evenly matched.

157
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,120
Who knows who will win?

158
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,950
Sir, your wine is here.

159
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,480
Excuse me,

160
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,870
how much is this drink?

161
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,040
2800 per bottle, madam.

162
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,670
Thank you.

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,150
Only 2800.

164
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,260
Alright.

165
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,720
Unscrupulous Chen,

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
you've earned a referral fee.

167
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,350
This bottle of wine is mine now.

168
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:33,810
She has some personality, doesn't she?

169
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,659
Wait.

170
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,750
Why did she take the wine I ordered?

171
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,570
She said she loves it, so she took it.

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,150
How could she...

173
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,760
That's half a month's salary for me.

174
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,950
Just buy another bottle with half of your month's salary.

175
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,310
Oh, come on.

176
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,630
Did you say something to her?

177
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,370
She asked about the 20% referral fee.

178
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,780
20% referral fee?

179
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,450
Yes.

180
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,870
Isn't the standard 5%

181
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,630
to 10%?

182
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,340
Why did you take 20% from her?

183
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,970
Shuo,

184
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,830
isn't there a 10% for you in this?

185
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,830
Come on, Tian, thank you so much.

186
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,240
I don't need your 10%.

187
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,390
You really got me into a bind.

188
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
She's mad at me now.

189
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,120
I'm back.

190
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,680
Luo,

191
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,880
what's that in your hand?

192
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
This?

193
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,230
The supermarket at the entrance gave it to me for free.

194
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,600
The supermarket was giving out such good wine?

195
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,470
I know.

196
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,730
They might be going out of business.

197
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
How about your side?

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,570
The verdict has been made.

199
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,240
The court supported all of our claims.

200
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,510
After seeing the verdict, the other party said they would appeal.

201
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,370
Did they?

202
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,600
They just said they would.

203
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,480
They still need to go through the procedure with the court.

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,559
Han is definitely up to something again.

205
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,130
Did Auntie Song know about it?

206
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
After her husband passed away,

207
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,230
she had no one to rely on.

208
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,030
She went to the court with me today.

209
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,730
Before, the court paid six months' rent for her,

210
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
but it's up now.

211
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,330
The landlord is urging her to pay the rent.

212
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,150
She cried

213
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,600
and told me she wanted to talk to He Qiaohui's lawyer.

214
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
I didn't agree.

215
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,960
If she goes, she will be pissed off by Han.

216
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,070
So,

217
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,640
she doesn't know what to do now.

218
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,450
What about you?

219
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,150
What do you plan to do next?

220
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm going to find Han.

221
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Mr. Zhao, can you stop spinning?

222
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,750
I have a suggestion.

223
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
You requested the legal division of the couple's joint property,

224
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,910
which is legally supported, and that's fine.

225
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,790
But morally,

226
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,270
you won't get public recognition and sympathy.

227
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,150
So,

228
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,710
I think you should know when to stop.

229
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,600
Mr. Chen,

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,960
I hired you with my money.

231
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,960
You should listen to me, right?

232
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,680
Yes.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,390
Then say no more.

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,750
Let's talk first.

235
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,530
Very well.

236
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,100
Mr. Chen, they are here.

237
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,080
Mr. Chen.

238
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
Ms. Luo.

239
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,510
Ms. Jiao.

240
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,280
Ms. Qiu.

241
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Ms. Jiao is here.

242
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,910
Mr. Zhao, you're husband and wife, after all.

243
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,630
A friendly handshake wouldn't hurt.

244
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,440
You're here.

245
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,790
Sit.

246
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,550
Ms. Jiao, please sit in the middle.

247
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,430
Well,

248
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,790
since

249
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,510
you've proposed

250
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,760
resolving the property division issue

251
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,340
in a gentler way,

252
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,030
I hope

253
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,510
both sides can truly show

254
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,400
mutual respect

255
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,910
and reasonableness in solving the problem.

256
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,500
Is that acceptable?

257
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Go ahead, Mr. Chen.

258
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,960
First of all, I want to emphasize

259
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,790
that my client,

260
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,840
Mr. Zhao,

261
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,290
has already filed for divorce with the court.

262
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
We should actually be meeting

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,840
in the courtroom,

264
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,540
not in our law firm's conference room.

265
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,060
But why did we agree to this?

266
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,750
Because we want both Ms. Jiao

267
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
and Mr. Zhao

268
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,240
to have some dignity left

269
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,570
in the end as a couple.

270
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,210
Actually, our demands are very simple.

271
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,950
First, they have been separated for 18 years,

272
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
and their marital relationship

273
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,260
is essentially non-existent,

274
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,560
so we are requesting a divorce.

275
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,630
Second,

276
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,750
in accordance with the law,

277
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,170
we request an equal division of the couple's joint property.

278
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,910
Mr. Chen,

279
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,550
regarding the first request you mentioned—the divorce—

280
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,400
we agree.

281
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,150
But regarding the second one,

282
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,700
we must seriously point out that,

283
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,200
for the past 18 years, your client

284
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,900
has abandoned his wife and children,

285
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,670
showing complete irresponsibility

286
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,750
toward them

287
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,740
and failing to fulfill any obligations.

288
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,150
Strictly speaking,

289
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,030
he can be charged with the crime of abandonment.

290
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,320
We are fully entitled to pursue his criminal liability.

291
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,930
Moreover, he has absolutely no contribution

292
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,580
to this family property,

293
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,360
and there is absolutely no basis for him to request a division of it.

294
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,420
On the contrary, Mr. Zhao should pay

295
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,250
child support for the past 18 years.

296
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,440
Ms. Luo,

297
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,440
a criminal offense

298
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,980
is a very serious accusation.

299
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,360
Whether it constitutes abandonment

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
depends on the severity

301
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,680
of the circumstances and the consequences.

302
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't think I need to educate you two lawyers on the law, do I?

303
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,330
Also, as soon as you sat down,

304
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
you immediately accused my client, Mr. Zhao Wei,

305
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,840
of a criminal offense.

306
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Is this the attitude and approach that should be taken in a negotiation?

307
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Mr. Chen, aren't you being unreasonable?

308
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,440
You clearly know that Ms. Jiao has worked hard for many years

309
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,210
to become a successful entrepreneur

310
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,560
and has

311
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,140
raised her child alone with great effort.

312
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,360
Her success and the process of raising her child

313
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,250
have nothing to do with Mr. Zhao.

314
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,220
How can it have nothing to do with him?

315
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,690
They haven't divorced, have they?

316
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,090
That means they are still married.

317
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,080
So, their marital relationship

318
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,150
is still in effect.

319
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,970
Am I right?

320
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,910
Legally speaking,

321
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,860
all of Ms. Jiao's assets

322
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,610
are indeed marital property.

323
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,670
But the objective fact is that

324
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,550
all of the assets

325
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,460
were created solely by Ms. Jiao.

326
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,840
It has nothing to do with you.

327
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,400
Now you're asking for half of it.

328
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,890
Does that make sense morally?

329
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,860
Ms. Qiu, you are a lawyer.

330
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,000
Ms. Luo and I are also lawyers.

331
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,070
There are three lawyers here,

332
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,120
so let's talk about the law, not morals,

333
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,790
shall we?

334
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,230
Our proposal is that,

335
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,830
given the historical circumstances,

336
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,870
Ms. Jiao is willing to divide

337
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,360
one-tenth of her assets with Mr. Zhao.

338
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,160
One-tenth?

339
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,240
Anything less than half is unacceptable.

340
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,280
Mr. Zhao, it is impossible.

341
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,460
You may not know,

342
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,970
but your lawyer should know that

343
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,240
given your situation,

344
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,360
even the judge

345
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,180
would never support you in court.

346
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,570
Let's be practical.

347
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,920
What's your bottom line?

348
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,650
How much can you give?

349
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,350
One-third, no more.

350
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,630
Ladies, please wait a moment.

351
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,200
I'll have a private talk with Mr. Zhao, okay?

352
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,750
Mr. Zhao, let's go to my office.

353
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
Fang Rui, take care of the three ladies.

354
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,720
No need.

355
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,770
Fang, please excuse us too.

356
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,510
We need to talk to

357
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,870
our client too.

358
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Mr. Chen,

359
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,830
you were really good just now.

360
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,610
Seriously,

361
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,150
one-third is over ten million.

362
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,960
That's a lot.

363
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,720
I'm telling you, even if we take this to court,

364
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,150
we might not get more than this.

365
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,560
Can we agree to this, Mr. Zhao?

366
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,310
If I can get half, why settle for one-third?

367
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,940
I've made myself very clear.

368
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,690
I'm here for the money.

369
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,500
Once I get the money, I'll go back to the south.

370
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,840
I must get

371
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,510
half of the marital property.

372
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,430
Ms. Jiao,

373
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,280
it seems

374
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,750
that your husband

375
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,960
won't agree to only one-third.

376
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,630
Then give him a little more.

377
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,920
But if I give too much,

378
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,650
I won't be able to run my business.

379
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,720
Ms. Jiao, you know as well

380
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,650
that one-third is already quite a lot.

381
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
In court,

382
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,770
the judge might not even grant him this much.

383
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,630
I don't want to go to court.

384
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,890
I'm afraid it will be too ugly.

385
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,510
Ms. Jiao,

386
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,000
do you have no idea

387
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,960
how Mr. Zhao has been doing

388
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,680
in the south all these years?

389
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,920
Not at all.

390
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,850
Ms. Jiao,

391
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,150
what we mean is that

392
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,270
the marital property

393
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,600
isn't just your property.

394
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,210
His property is also joint property.

395
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
You have the right to take your share too.

396
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,770
Isn't that inappropriate?

397
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,510
Listen, Mr. Zhao.

398
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,320
Let me emphasize again:

399
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,410
marital property

400
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,320
refers to both yours and hers.

401
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
If you're asking for half of hers,

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,320
she can also claim half of yours. Do you understand?

403
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,180
Okay.

404
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,490
I was just thinking of dividing it with her.

405
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,380
I'm just afraid she won't accept it.

406
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,250
So is it appropriate for him to take a share of your property?

407
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,430
Now he's trying to take a share of your son's property,

408
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,910
your own son's property.

409
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,710
I owe several million in the south.

410
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,870
Before I came here, I was already

411
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,110
on the court's restricted spending list.

412
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,080
How much do you owe?

413
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,540
3.67 million and...

414
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,910
Let's just say it's 3.67 million.

415
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,350
To be honest,

416
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,620
the 200 thousand I gave you

417
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,030
was borrowed.

418
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,350
You have to speak for me.

419
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,040
Mr. Zhao, how about this?

420
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,430
Let's go over now.

421
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,120
I promise we'll have another round of talks,

422
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,630
and I'll fight for more for you, okay?

423
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,690
I'm not going back.

424
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,270
I have an appointment.

425
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,610
I have to go over there now.

426
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,870
I'll leave the rest to you.

427
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,700
I have faith in you.

428
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,940
Do I need that from you?

429
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,050
Sorry

430
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,040
for making you wait.

431
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,950
I'm terribly sorry, Ms. Jiao.

432
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,790
Mr. Zhao

433
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,150
had to leave due to something

434
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,910
very important.

435
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,420
I'll speak with you on his behalf.

436
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,390
How did your discussion with him go?

437
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,290
He refused.

438
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,670
We request an equal division of the marital property

439
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,750
in accordance with the law.

440
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,920
Then we also request

441
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,520
an equal division of the husband's property.

442
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,360
Seriously?

443
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,560
Is this your request,

444
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,450
Ms. Jiao?

445
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,650
That's great.

446
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,200
This is also our request.

447
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,630
Your husband now owes 3.67 million.

448
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,840
We request

449
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,870
an equal division of this debt according to the law.

450
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,710
Alright, we'll see you in court.

451
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,510
Sorry again, Ms. Jiao,

452
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,750
for making you come all the way here today.

453
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,410
I'm sorry.

454
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,550
Bye, Ms. Luo.

455
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,740
Bye, Ms. Qiu.

456
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,160
Ms. Jiao,

457
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,859
this is the result of being soft-hearted.

458
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,890
He asked for your property earlier,

459
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,700
and now he's asking you to pay his debts.

460
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,220
Who knows what he'll do tomorrow?

461
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,700
Ms. Jiao, next time,

462
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,590
you can't be so soft-hearted.

463
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,400
So...

464
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,400
Ms. Xia, who are you looking for?

465
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,030
Han Zhitong.

466
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
We'll go first.

467
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,000
Director Han,

468
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,350
Ms. Xia is coming for you.

469
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,270
It's fine, let her in.

470
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,960
Ms. Xia,

471
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
the director is busy now, Ms. Xia.

472
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,510
Are you going over the accounts?

473
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,360
Master, I couldn't stop her.

474
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,460
What brings you here?

475
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,970
Mr. Han, the verdict from the first trial is out.

476
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,540
Since you've already stated that you would appeal,

477
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,120
don't delay any longer.

478
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,240
Does everyone at your law firm

479
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,550
have such a short temper?

480
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,870
Girls

481
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,310
get pimples when they get angry.

482
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,270
How about I introduce you to an old Chinese medicine doctor

483
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,030
to help cool your internal heat?

484
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,640
I've already made it very clear.

485
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,090
Please have your client appeal immediately.

486
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,380
Go find the person who lost the case in court.

487
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,140
How would I know if the defendant is willing to appeal?

488
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,610
Why are you coming to me?

489
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,480
Ladies, please don't go in.

490
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,680
One of you has already gone in.

491
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,310
But we need to see

492
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,680
-what's going on.
-Yes.

493
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,880
Ms. Xia,

494
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,910
you've only been away for a while.

495
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,950
You used to be so great.

496
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,690
Wearing shorts

497
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,050
and a short coat,

498
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,300
young and beautiful.

499
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,280
Your long, white legs were swaying back and forth.

500
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,710
You were so beautiful back then.

501
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,700
You're leaving?

502
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,200
Han Zhitong, you're shameless!

503
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,440
What are you doing?

504
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
What?

505
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,030
You harass your colleagues in the workplace

506
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,440
and act like a rogue in court.

507
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,140
You're always holding a calculator, doing calculations.

508
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,320
Maybe I should buy you an abacus so you can calculate yourself to death.

509
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,750
Luo, call security

510
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,680
and have her thrown out!

511
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,550
Don't you dare!

512
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,310
Keep yelling.

513
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,550
Shout loudly.

514
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,240
You're rich as hell,

515
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,480
and your employees are poor and struggling.

516
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,050
Do you think they really want to deal with you?

517
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,870
You're trying to delay until my client dies.

518
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,350
You don't deserve to be a lawyer!

519
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,650
You're the daughter of a criminal,

520
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,900
and you have the nerve to judge me?

521
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,140
Right now, you're nothing but a shrew!

522
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,280
You should go to jail with him!

523
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,830
I'm suing you for defamation!

524
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,960
You've already taken the case,

525
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,720
and you have the authority to receive legal documents.

526
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,870
But you deliberately delayed,

527
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,000
refusing to accept the first-instance summons,

528
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,240
and let my client's husband die in waiting.

529
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,100
Let me tell you,

530
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
if you don't appeal,

531
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,310
I'll report you to the bar association and the judicial bureau right now.

532
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,870
This is the verdict. Take a good look.

533
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,520
Either appeal or compensate!

534
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,510
Awesome.

535
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,050
What're you looking at?

536
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,370
Go home and have some kids!

537
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,860
Xia Shu,

538
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,200
you've got quite a mouth on you.

539
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,360
I'm impressed.

540
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,550
To deal with a rogue like Han,

541
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,620
you've got to use rogue tactics.

542
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,410
You're right.

543
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Xia Shu, you're amazing.

544
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,070
You threw it at Mr. Han,

545
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,640
and he fled in panic.

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,110
The women from Yinghua Law Firm

547
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,320
are really tough.

548
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,700
Unscrupulous Chen, shut up.

549
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,110
With you and your client's

550
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,550
shameless faces today,

551
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,410
we'll definitely see each other in court again.

552
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,890
By then, I'll throw the summons right in your face.

553
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,580
If you throw it, I'll definitely put my face right in front of it.

554
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,000
Also,

555
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,310
go back and tell Ms. Jiao

556
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,670
that we insist on an equal division of the property.

557
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,160
The men from Liangcheng Law Firm are really mean.

558
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,060
And have no conscience.

559
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,470
This matter still isn't fully resolved.

560
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
They've appealed,

561
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,540
but it could take another year or more

562
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,420
to go through the second trial and execution process.

563
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,240
But Auntie Song can't afford to wait anymore.

564
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,510
She has no place to stay.

565
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,050
Right.

566
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,880
For this case,

567
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,640
we've paid all the compensation we could

568
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,320
and used up all our resources.

569
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,550
There's one more thing left to do.

570
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,750
Xia Shu.

571
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,060
This is the information Mr. Zhou gave us.

572
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,000
Take it

573
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,070
and find those clients who borrowed money

574
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,230
from He Qiaohui's company.

575
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,430
Why are we looking for them?

576
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,320
To learn about the operations of her company

577
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,160
and gather information about her illegal activities.

578
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,460
Even if we

579
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
win this case in the end,

580
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,440
we won't be able to get back the money that lacks evidence

581
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,400
of being borrowed.

582
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,880
Not to mention, for the past few years,

583
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,010
she's been using Auntie Song's money to lend out

584
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,680
and has already made a fortune.

585
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,070
We need to first gather information on her illegal business practices.

586
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,700
♫I follow♫

587
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,020
Are you the one who called me?

588
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,210
Are you Mr. Sun?

589
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,730
♫The direction the wind blows♫

590
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,000
It's me.

591
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,580
Then we'll use imprisonment to force them to submit.

592
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,980
Once they're truly scared,

593
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,830
Auntie Song will get her money back.

594
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,470
♫Chasing the sunlight and the soil♫

595
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,280
Did you borrow money

596
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,750
from Shengmao Credit Company?

597
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,750
Yes, I did.

598
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,240
♫Growing freely♫

599
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,500
It was this loan

600
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,780
that broke me.

601
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,150
As for the other people's money,

602
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,430
we'll figure something out.

603
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,650
Sooner or later, we'll strip He Qiaohui

604
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:04,790
♫The wind says never stop your pursuit♫

605
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,950
and her husband of everything.

606
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,000
Here's the thing.

607
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,070
We're currently looking for

608
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,770
the victims of Shengmao Credit Company.

609
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,270
You're the first person we've found.

610
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,190
Would you be willing to tell me

611
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,160
the details of what happened back then

612
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,600
♫Be a believer without hesitation♫

613
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,110
so we can gather more evidence

614
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,670
and eventually hold them legally accountable?

615
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,020
Yes, yes, yes.

616
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,990
♫Without distractions♫

617
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,610
Here's my injury report.

618
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,670
My arm still hurts.

619
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,790
Take a look.

620
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,790
These are the threatening messages they sent me.

621
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,130
♫But there will always be detours♫

622
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,070
I borrowed money from them

623
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,360
to buy a house.

624
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,000
♫Take a few more steps♫

625
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,450
But it just kept growing.

626
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,750
♫The night is just the fog of dawn♫

627
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,290
Later, I was fired by the company.

628
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,880
Now, I can only make a living by delivering food.

629
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,960
I earn a few bucks per order.

630
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,250
♫Let it cross mountains and seas of clouds♫

631
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,200
How can I pay it back? With my life?

632
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,350
I borrowed the money from them because I needed

633
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,000
♫I have my stars to love♫

634
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,270
to pay for my mother's medical treatment.

635
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,350
Recently,

636
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,480
they even came to the hospital and caused a scene.

637
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,400
They even hit me.

638
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,380
By the way,

639
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,910
♫Walking too hastily♫

640
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,750
Ms. Xia,

641
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,120
the day they hit her at the hospital,

642
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,630
♫I'll be my own light♫

643
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,030
my daughter recorded it.

644
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,880
♫And illuminate the confusion that once was mine♫

645
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,640
Is it useful to you?

646
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,750
Of course.

647
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
We've already contacted

648
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,400
ten victims.

649
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,550
In addition to the written materials,

650
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,100
♫Accept all withering and start anew♫

651
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,810
video evidence will also be very helpful

652
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,830
for our lawsuit.

653
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,640
Then Auntie, are you willing to sue them?

654
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,000
Of course.

655
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:07,100
♫I have my tomorrow to wait for♫

656
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,270
♫I'll take my time♫

657
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,710
♫Be my own gentle light♫

♫Drifting freely♫

659
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,880
Morning.

660
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:30,780
Hush.

661
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,390
Xia Shu.

662
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,350
Why is she sleeping here?

663
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,160
She's been contacting the victims these days

664
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,650
and didn't get enough rest.

665
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,710
She didn't even go back to my place last night.

666
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,920
Did she organize all of this?

667
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,340
Not bad.

668
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,210
After she went crazy at Han's place,

669
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,680
this young lady has completely changed.

670
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,110
After being hit by reality,

671
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,680
she has really grown up.

672
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,690
She scared me.

673
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,750
Looks like she's really tired.

674
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,750
She's very diligent.

675
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,750
Her spirit is admirable.

676
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,670
Xia Shu has worked so hard

677
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,930
to gather all this evidence.

678
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,940
Should we show it to He Qiaohui?

679
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,960
Not only should we show it to her,

680
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,470
we also need to sue her.

681
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,680
But currently,

682
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,200
we're handling Auntie Song's case,

683
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,960
and there's a conflict of interest with them.

684
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,070
We must be careful

685
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,220
not to let them turn around and accuse us of extortion.

686
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,260
That would cause Auntie Song trouble.

687
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,030
Even if we can't do this,

688
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,320
I can always find someone else to do it for us.

689
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,510
Don't worry.

690
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,020
I ordered breakfast. Give it to her.

691
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,930
I'm not eating.

692
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,110
I have something else to do in there.

693
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,960
Let me ask you again.

694
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,480
Now that the case has turned out like this,

695
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,790
are you going to remarry me?
Remarry?

696
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,790
Remarry?

697
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,510
How many times do I have to tell you?

698
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,350
I'm  telling you!

699
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,240
Hurry up and remarry me!

700
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,550
Are you serious?

701
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,070
You want to use my money on that woman?

702
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,510
Put that rolling pin down!

703
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,590
I'll kill you!

704
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,790
I'll kill you!

705
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,470
You're using my money

706
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,480
-on that woman!
-The divorce is real!

707
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,870
Do you think I was practicing with you?

708
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,350
I've had enough of you!

709
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,070
How dare you leave!

710
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,670
I'm telling you, you can't go anywhere!

711
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,430
Why are you two here?

712
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,350
He Qiaohui,

713
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,550
the verdict has arrived.

714
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,130
We're here to inform you that

715
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,420
we'll be filing charges against you.

716
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,590
Charges against me? I'm appealing!

717
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,630
Go ahead and sue us.

718
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll just stall.

719
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
We'll drag that old woman out.

720
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,430
Of course we know you won't pay back the money.

721
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,440
Here's the evidence of all the

722
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,350
illegal activities involved

723
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,320
in your small loan company over these years.

724
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,350
We've also gathered more than 10 victims

725
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,350
to file criminal charges against you.

726
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,750
It doesn't matter if you don't repay the money.

727
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,550
In the end,

728
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,010
not a penny of it will be yours anyway.

729
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,170
Don't talk nonsense.

730
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,660
My company has no problems at all.

731
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,830
Well, ladies,

732
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,790
this company is hers.

733
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,070
It has nothing to do with me.

734
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,790
You should go to her if you want anything.

735
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,960
-Well, I…
-What are you doing?

736
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,200
You want to leave?

737
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,050
Wait.

738
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,240
He Qiaohui, I'll give you two choices:

739
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,670
either pay back Auntie Song's money,

740
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,790
or we'll sue you.

741
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,710
And you, Zhou Damin.

742
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,550
Don't think that just by

743
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,960
transferring the company to He Qiaohui's name,

744
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,220
you can get away.

745
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,110
We also have evidence

746
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,030
of you participating in the company's operations

747
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,760
and illegal violent debt collection.

748
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,440
Take a look at this.

749
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,480
This...

750
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,750
Your godmother wants us to die.

751
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,640
He Qiaohui,

752
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,200
I've told you before

753
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,380
not to borrow money so aggressively

754
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,200
and so much.

755
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,160
But you didn't listen.

756
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,750
You are greedy, you know?

757
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,130
Stop wasting time.

758
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,120
Zhou Damin,

759
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,400
are you even a human?

760
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,440
I did all these for you.

761
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,400
You asked for the house.

762
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,350
And the car was bought for you.

763
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,590
The watch, the belt—what have you been lacking?

764
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,990
And those bags of your little temptress—

765
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,500
-Cut the crap!
-you bought so many!

766
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,240
Now they're suing us.

767
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,510
And it has nothing to do with that temptress—no!

768
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,960
It has nothing to do with that woman.

769
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,310
Let me ask you.

770
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,620
What should we do now?

771
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,660
Are we really going to jail together?

772
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,750
Let's pay the money back.

773
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,920
Paying back the money

774
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,350
is better than going to jail.

775
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,510
Thank you.

776
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,050
You're welcome.

777
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,960
Here, Righteous Luo.

778
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,830
It's rare for you to ask me out.

779
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,030
Don't act all innocent.

780
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,660
Let me ask you,

781
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,550
was it your idea for He Qiaohui and Zhou Damin

782
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,930
to get a fake divorce?

783
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,240
Can their divorce

784
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,000
be fake?

785
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,960
Of course, it's real.

786
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,200
But I didn't handle this case.

787
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,110
It was Xue.

788
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,540
He came up with the idea.

789
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,590
Don't you know how bad this guy is?

790
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,160
I've got a case here. Are you going to take it?

791
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,910
There's no case I, Unscrupulous Chen, won't take.

792
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,480
Give it to me.

793
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,890
The referral fee.

794
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,470
The standard is 5% to 10%. I'll give you 10%.

795
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,640
You're pretty clear about it, huh?

796
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,440
Then how dare you ask me for 20%?

797
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,640
No, I...

798
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,440
Referral fee?

799
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,550
20%.

800
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,140
I'll say it again.

801
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,420
I didn't take the 10% extra last time.

802
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,450
Tian took it himself.

803
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,630
I don't believe you.

804
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,830
These ten or so victims,

805
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,350
like Auntie Song,

806
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,160
have been ruined by He Qiaohui

807
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,920
and her husband.

808
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,960
Some of them

809
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,600
lost their houses,

810
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,270
others put all the money meant for their elderly family members'

811
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,950
medical bills into it.

812
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,180
Now they're just waiting to die in the hospital.

813
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,430
Haven't we already taken

814
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,510
Auntie Song's case?

815
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,350
So we can't directly represent these victims

816
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,820
and file criminal charges.

817
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,510
But you can.

818
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,960
As long as you can get Han to waive the conflict of interest

819
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,580
with Liangcheng Law Firm.

820
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,030
Honestly,

821
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,550
Zhou Damin and He Qiaohui

822
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,380
are really bad. They exploit others.

823
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,000
As for Han, it's simple.

824
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,930
Just say it.

825
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,190
How do you want me to handle this case?

826
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,310
Be ruthless. Don't hold back.

827
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,740
Okay.

828
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,720
Does this mean I've officially joined

829
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,550
the League of Justice

830
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,710
of Righteous Luo?

831
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,740
Just this once.

832
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,350
Come on, we can make a great team.

833
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,290
Partners in crime,

834
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Bonnie and Clyde,

835
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
or Mr. and Mrs. Smith if you want.

836
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,480
You really know how to flatter yourself.

837
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,100
Do you think you look like Brad Pitt?

838
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,560
Pitt must be very handsome.

839
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,720
Come on, Peter Chen.

840
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,960
Come on, Julie Luo.

841
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,470
You have to win.

842
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,050
Absolutely.

843
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,390
Ms. He.

844
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,630
Are you sure you don't want to appeal anymore?

845
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,950
No, no, no. Let me explain.

846
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,180
These loan cases are always like a long march.

847
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,360
The longer we drag it out, the better.

848
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,710
We've barely started,

849
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,400
and you want to give up?

850
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,400
Mr. Han.

851
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,440
Are you still trying to fool me?

852
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,700
Listen,

853
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,270
don't contact me again!

854
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,040
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

855
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,920
You deserve to be sued!

856
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,220
Come in.

857
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,580
Can I come in?

858
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,060
Of course, you can.

859
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,650
Mr. Chen, you can definitely come in.

860
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,730
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

861
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
You deserve to be sued!

862
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,640
I heard you. I didn't dare to come in.

863
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,510
Nothing.

864
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,470
Who are you angry with?

865
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,390
It's none of our business.

866
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,730
Someone is just stupid.

867
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,130
You have something to say?

868
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,900
Yes.

869
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,560
I need your help with something.

870
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,590
Go ahead.

871
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,330
I'm representing a case

872
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,030
against illegal fund-raising.

873
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,450
Coincidentally,

874
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,130
some of my clients, exactly the victims

875
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,070
of the lending company run by He Qiaohui

876
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,330
and her husband, are among the plaintiffs.

877
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,310
So, since you're already

878
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,450
representing them,

879
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,600
you need to give me an exemption.

880
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,680
He Qiaohui?

881
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,170
Yes.

882
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,750
The one you're suing for illegal fund-raising

883
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,890
with Zhou Damin?

884
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,710
That's it.

885
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,470
Well.

886
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,960
Their company has been operating

887
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,310
for years with no issues.

888
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,780
It depends on who the opposing lawyers are.

889
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,320
Isn't it me, Unscrupulous Chen?

890
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,060
I have plenty of evidence.

891
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,830
Really?

892
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,360
Absolutely.

893
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,270
Sue her.

894
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,680
You should sue her.

895
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,000
I told them

896
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,440
their company was operating illegally.

897
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,610
It was bound to implode.

898
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,550
She wouldn't listen.

899
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,400
Those two

900
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,160
are stingy and stupid.

901
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,070
They deserve what's coming to them.

902
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,680
You have a strong dislike for them, don't you?

903
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,120
Who likes villains?

904
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,480
Don't worry.

905
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,090
I'll write the exemption for you right away.

906
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,200
I'll have Tian deliver it to you after I'm done.

907
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,300
Thanks, Mr. Han.

908
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,460
You take such good care of yourself.

909
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,340
Was that He Qiaohui earlier?

910
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,280
Did she make you that angry?

911
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,030
Goodbye, Mr. Han. Thanks.

912
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,590
He Qiaohui, Zhou Damin,

913
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,400
you are under arrest for illegal business operations

914
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,590
and picking quarrels

915
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,780
and provoking troubles.

916
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,710
Officer, I'm innocent.

917
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,200
I was forced into it.

918
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,940
[Jingbei Municipal Public Security Bureau]

919
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,790
It was all Zhou Damin's idea. He made me do it.

920
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,720
Hear me out.

921
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,270
I'm really innocent.

922
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,680
I swear.

923
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm really innocent.

924
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,920
Officers, do something.

925
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,550
Officer, this is personal attack.

926
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,440
Somebody should stop this!

927
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,920
We're innocent!

928
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,030
Mom, Mom, Mom!

929
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,580
Mom, save me! Mom!

930
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,970
Mom, I was wrong. Mom!

931
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,490
Mom, please save me! Mom!

932
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,890
Don't obstruct justice. Calm down.

933
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,730
Mom!

934
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,750
I was wrong, Mom!

935
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,960
Save me, Mom!

936
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,870
We'll talk about it back at the bureau.

937
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,680
Mom!

938
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:56,960
Auntie Song.

939
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,390
Hello, hello.

940
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,590
We can't be soft-hearted anymore.

941
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,000
It's best to have her arrested.

942
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,200
How did it go?

943
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,350
Julie Luo, Peter Chen did well, right?

944
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,700
I just won another case.

945
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,650
I'll transfer the 20% to your account anytime.

946
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,250
Behave yourself.

947
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,870
What did you say?

948
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,190
Move aside.

949
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,830
Didn't you just say "behave yourself"?

950
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,900
Auntie Song, let's go.

951
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,750
Ms. Xia.

952
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,170
The case is settled.

953
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,040
The debt has been recovered.

954
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,220
I'll pay back the money I owe you.

955
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,120
Since you're offering, I won't refuse.

956
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,310
Auntie Song.

957
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,550
The house the court rented for you,

958
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,550
we renewed it once as an exception,

959
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,940
but it's almost expired.

960
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,350
Where will you live after that?

961
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
I don't know.

962
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,030
To be honest with you,

963
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,030
I secretly went back

964
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,360
to my old neighborhood yesterday.

965
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,820
I saw my old house is now lived in

966
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,190
by a family of three. It's very cozy.

967
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,070
Now that you've got your money back,

968
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,480
if you want to move back to your old neighborhood,

969
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,659
you actually can.

970
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,020
Jia Sheng is gone.

971
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,960
It's meaningless for me to move back.

972
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,760
Auntie Song.

973
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,570
You won the lawsuit,

974
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,300
but I don't see you happy about it.

975
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,020
Did I win?

976
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,880
Of course, you did.

977
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,760
But why do I feel like I lost?

978
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,370
Look,

979
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,949
I don't have a home anymore.

980
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,330
My husband is gone.

981
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,370
My house is gone.

982
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,950
I even feel like my life is gone.

983
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,530
Even if I get all my money back,

984
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,010
it's meaningless.

985
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,190
Auntie Song.

986
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Do you think

987
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,910
the life you used to live

988
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,660
was real?

989
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,710
What do you mean?

990
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,480
I don't understand.

991
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,800
You've had food and clothing without worry all your life.

992
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,920
Your husband protected you

993
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,000
like keeping you in a small cage.

994
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,400
But you should know best

995
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,070
that all of this was just an illusion.

996
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,360
Actually, you might not imagine

997
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,150
that I've also gone through tremendous changes in my life.

998
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,320
I used to have

999
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
a happy family,

1000
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,520
but later,

1001
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,030
after a series of sudden events,

1002
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,600
my life was completely shattered.

1003
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,470
And my mother also passed away because of the changes

1004
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,070
in my family.

1005
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,920
After these things happened, I realized

1006
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,240
that the happy family and life

1007
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,880
I once thought I had

1008
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,590
were all fake.

1009
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,910
For a while, I was just like you,

1010
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,700
choosing to escape.

1011
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,850
But life

1012
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,800
just kept throwing one thing after another at me,

1013
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,950
forcing me to face it.

1014
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,880
Actually, whether it's Ms. Qiu

1015
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,080
or Ms. Xia,

1016
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,570
they both have their own difficulties.

1017
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,040
But I also believe

1018
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,400
that none of the three of us

1019
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,410
are the hardest ones in this world.

1020
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,380
Of course, you're not either.

1021
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,860
So, Auntie Song, what I want to say to you most is,

Try from now on,

embrace this real world.

1026
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,700
Get over this hurdle,

1027

will be all good.

it's me.

Where did you get so much cash?

Aren't you afraid of attracting thieves?

From Auntie Song's case,

1047

we earned 480,000 yuan.

After deducting the firm's operating expenses,

1049
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,730
the rest is for the three of us to split.

1050
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,330
We can just transfer it directly.

Why did you get so much cash?

No, no, no.

Let me tell you,

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,960

Only real cash

1058
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,800
can relieve all the bad luck I've had.

1059
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,800
But if it's just a transfer,

1060
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,030
it'll just be an unremarkable line in your text messages.

1061

But if it's cash,

That's right.

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,390
help you keep your assets,

1114
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,400
but we can't help you keep your husband

1115
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,370
and your marriage.

1116
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,950
But those are exactly what you care about the most.

1117
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,370
I actually understand you very well.

1118
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,230
But from a professional perspective,

1119
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,890
I still hope you can consider

1120
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,950
our advice.

1121
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,080
Ms. Qiu, don't you think

1122
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,920
that meeting him in my life

1123
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,080
was also my luck?

1124
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,040
I have a disability.

1125
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,730
No one has ever cared about me since I was a child.

1126
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,140
I was so insecure that I didn't dare to meet people.

1127
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,570
But when I met him,

1128
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,330
he made me feel

1129
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,100
warmth and care.

1130
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,590
Even if it was only for a few days,

1131
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,370
even if it was

1132
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,980
for a very short time.

1133
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,790
We had a child together

1134
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,070
and built a home together.

1135
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,840
Even if he's leaving now

1136
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,320
and hasn't given me a proper look since then,

1137
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,030
but back then,

1138
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,800
the little warmth and care he gave me

1139
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,590
are something I'll never forget.

1140
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,280
I don't want to break up on bad terms

1141
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,080
because of the divorce.

1142
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
If that happens,

1143
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,070
I'm really afraid that

1144
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,030
it will tear away the little hope I have in my heart.

1145
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,900
Then I'll really have nothing left.

1146
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,250
I see.

1147
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,960
I'll discuss it with Ms. Luo

1148
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,720
and we'll try to make the divorce decent

1149
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,890
and amicable.

1150
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,890
Thank you.

1151
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,550
Hello, who is this?

1152
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,630
Ms. Qiu, hello.

1153
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,000
This is Bai,

1154
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,960
the HR from Yuanfang Law Firm.

1155
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,180
You've passed the interview.

1156
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,420
Do you have time to discuss your compensation package now?

1157
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,980
Yes, I do. Go ahead.

1158
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,970
Regarding your previous compensation requirements,

1159
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,630
our business and HR departments have no objections.

1160
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,510
As long as you're willing to join us,

1161
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,630
we can offer you a 15% raise

1162
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,760
on top of your proposed salary.
