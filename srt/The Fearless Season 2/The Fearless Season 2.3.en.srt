[Episode 3]

3
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,560
Sir, please carry it upstairs for me.

4
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,039
I really can't carry it.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,430
Besides, the seller promised

6
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,200
it would be delivered to our door.

7
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,350
This is second-hand,

8
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,580
and it's not an official delivery.

9
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,990
Besides, I'm just the driver.

10
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,050
I'm already being kind enough by delivering it downstairs.

11
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,280
If you want me to deliver it upstairs, well...

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,810
Right?

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,070
Alright, alright. How much do you want?

14
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,789
50.

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
30.

16
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,230
40 at the lowest.

17
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,680
30 is the most I can do.

18
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,560
It's pretty heavy. 40.

19
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,350
Luo Yingzi?

20
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,440
What are you doing?

21
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,430
You came just in time. You saved me 30 yuan.

22
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,120
Sir, I don't need your help anymore. Thank you.

23
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,280
Here, help me carry this cabinet upstairs.

24
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,750
Come on.

25
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,700
Wait a minute.

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,430
So, the office you mentioned is your house?

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,670
Time was limited.

28
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,300
I really couldn't find a place to rent.

29
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,440
At home, Xia Shu and I have already tidied everything up.

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,800
Check it out; it's nice.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,150
Mr. Dong said

32
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,329
he was coming for an inspection this afternoon.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,450
You're letting him inspect your house?

34
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,170
Do you think Mr. Dong is that easy to fool?

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,280
Just go up and take a look first.

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,770
If it's really not okay for you,

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,150
we can arrange to meet him at a cafe, okay?

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,710
Let's go.

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,360
You are such...

41
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,840
Come on. One, two, three. There you go.

42
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,120
Hold steady.

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,340
You're not carrying it?

44
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,950
I need to keep an eye on this cabinet.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,260
Who would want this old cabinet?

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,120
You have no idea.

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,190
Right before the Spring Festival, you can see all sorts of people.

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,650
What if someone steals the cabinet?

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
So you're making me carry it all by myself?

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,270
Just do it.

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,140
After you're done, come back down and find me.

52
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,520
Your cabinet is shorter than mine.

53
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,520
I can carry mine. Why can't you carry yours?

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,000
There must be something inside.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,630
Be careful on the stairs.

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,120
Don't bump the cabinet's legs.

57
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,440
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

58
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,000
I could have just paid the man.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,870
Why didn't you come earlier? I spent a lot of time haggling with him.

60
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm wearing a dress.

61
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,630
-And now I have to help you carry the cabinet.
-Qiu Hua, what did you just say?

62
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,490
What?

63
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,050
This is a residential area,

64
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,870
not a place for you to run your business.

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,170
So what?

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
This is our own home.

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,470
We can do whatever we want here.

68
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,710
We can accept you running other businesses,

69
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,960
but you're opening a law firm here.

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,280
What kind of people come to a law firm?

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,200
Yeah, what kind of people come to a law firm?

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,840
Murderers, rapists,

73
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,720
pimps—

74
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,079
all sorts of messed-up people.

75
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,100
How can others feel safe here?

76
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,450
Running a law firm at home—

77
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,440
won't the clients distrust us?

78
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,329
It's fine. Check it out later. It's quite nice inside.

79
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,130
Anyway, let's just get them to come first.

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,590
Right. We can't let them do it.

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,630
If they insist,

82
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,940
let's report them to the police station.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
What's going on?

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,560
You came back at the right time. I was just about to find you.

85
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,680
I just want to ask you something.

86
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,710
This is a residential area.

87
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,590
How can you open a law firm here?

88
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,240
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Xia Shu,

90
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,030
help me move the cabinet.

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,910
I'm not running a law firm here.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,910
Look at that signboard.

93
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,620
It's hanging right there, obviously.

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,120
Gosh.

95
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,620
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

96
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,390
Here's the thing.

97
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,430
I am going to open a law firm,

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,000
but not here.

99
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,740
It's going to be in that office building right in front.

100
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,710
This assistant was just hired.

101
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,160
She's young and knows nothing.

102
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,190
I told her to hang the signboard outside,

103
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,920
and she thought I meant to hang it outside my home.

104
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,950
How could that be?

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,070
It has to be at the door of my law firm, right?

106
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,930
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

107
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,950
I'll take it down right now.

108
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,560
Take it down now.

109
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,950
Okay, okay.

110
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,270
Okay, I will.

111
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,950
What a false alarm.

112
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,890
It must be taken down.

113
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,870
We should get along in peace.

114
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes, you're right.

115
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,260
Thank you for understanding.

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,200
I really didn't know.

118
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,240
I thought hanging it up early would help attract clients.

119
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,490
Are you out of your mind?

120
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,040
This is a residential building.

121
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,970
You hung such a big signboard at the door.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Of course they wanted to kick us out.

123
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,550
Stop making things worse for me, alright?

124
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
Xia Shu, you're not suited for our firm.

125
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,770
Our firm is too small

126
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,410
to afford someone like you.

127
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,750
You should go somewhere else.

128
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,800
Qiu Hua. Qiu Hua.

129
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,750
Well... Qiu Hua.

130
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,250
Didn't she cause us enough trouble?

131
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,150
She's not someone who is legally incompetent.

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,250
Besides, if it weren't for her,

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,750
would Xu Jianshe's case

134
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,920
have ended up like that?

135
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,300
Could Liangcheng Law Firm have kicked the three of us out?

136
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,520
We can barely manage ourselves right now.

137
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,690
We simply don't have the capacity

138
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,180
to take care of a young lady like her.

139
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,720
Xia Shu,

140
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,550
you,

141
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,420
please leave.

142
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,950
I hope you find a new place to work soon.

143
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,510
Luo.

144
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,390
Qiu Hua,

145
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,590
today, this was also my fault.

146
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,720
I didn't remind her.

147
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
Please calm down.

148
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,000
Qiu,

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,530
I know I was wrong.

150
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,790
I really do.

151
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,620
I will definitely make changes in the future.

152
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,360
Some things can be changed,

153
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,500
but some things can never be changed.

154
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,330
Please.

155
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,070
Qiu...

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,190
Xia Shu!

157
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,520
What did I tell you?

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,240
I asked you to get the car.

159
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,940
How's it going?

160
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,430
I had an agreement

161
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,090
with Qiu Hua before

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
that we can only keep you here

163
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,830
if you can get the car back.

164
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,020
Have you gotten it back?

165
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,610
Not yet.

166
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,460
Then what are you waiting for? Go get it.

167
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,320
But...

168
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,350
But what? Go!

169
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,770
Okay, okay.

170
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,430
I'm so pissed.

171
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,680
Luo.

172
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,450
Could you lend me some money?

173
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,770
I don't have money for a taxi.

174
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,370
Where's your money?

175
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,270
Didn't you say last night

176
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,000
that there was 5,000 in your account?

177
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,950
I have a personal credit card.

178
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,460
Today's the payment due date.

179
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,720
As soon as I woke up this morning, the money was deducted.

180
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,200
You can go on foot.

181
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,560
It's too far.

182
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,560
Fine, just leave.

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
I'll give you 10 yuan on WeChat later,

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,950
so you can take the bus.

185
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,070
Okay.

186
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,690
Which bus should I take?

187
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Take whatever you want.

188
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,060
Look it up yourself.

189
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,750
Seriously.

190
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,930
Young people's logic...

191
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,300
Luo Yingzi, stop acting with me.

192
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,180
You're just trying to mediate.

193
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,690
You're being a peacemaker.

194
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,990
Qiu Hua, calm down.

195
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,680
Don't get mad because of Xia Shu.

196
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,159
You know I'm soft-hearted.

197
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,390
When others beg me, I...

198
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,060
How about this?

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,730
How about I hire her as my assistant

200
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,500
with my own money,

201
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,790
so it'll have nothing to do with our law firm? Is that okay?

202
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,090
The problem is, I promised her before

203
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,100
that as long as she gets the car back, I'll keep her.

204
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,060
I can only kick her out if she doesn't get it back.

205
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,560
She's doing it now, right?

206
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,870
So I can't really say anything.

207
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,780
Are we really going to work here?

208
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,380
As long as we work hard,

209
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,050
there'll be bread and milk.

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,840
Everything is hard at the beginning.

211
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,720
See? It's...

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,039
I've been looking at it for a while.

213
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,080
Yeah, isn't this...

214
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,549
a pretty good start?

215
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,880
Forget it.

216
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,250
Let's meet Mr. Dong at a cafe.

217
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,340
Stop pushing.

218
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm getting off here. Excuse me.

219
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,930
Don't go!

220
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,070
My purse!

221
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,410
Don't go!

222
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,560
My purse! My purse!

223
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,630
Stop!

224
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,030
Why are you here again?

225
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,510
Director Zhang said he doesn't know you

226
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,730
and told me not to let you in.

227
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,790
Sir,

228
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,830
could you please make another call for me?

229
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,790
I was just

230
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,360
talking to him here a few days ago.

231
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,150
How could he not know me now?

232
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
No, Miss.

233
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,290
Please don't make this difficult for me, alright?

234
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:49,870
Please leave.

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,030
Stop! Stop!

236
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,700
I told you you're not allowed in. Why are you trying to barge in?

237
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,890
Sir, I'm begging you.

238
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,310
Please contact him again for me.

239
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,750
If I can't see him today,

240
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,130
I don't even know where I'm going to eat.

241
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't you have his number?

242
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,630
Contact him yourself. Just go.

243
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,260
Leave.

244
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,840
I called him, but he didn't answer.

245
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,030
Then what's there to say?

246
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,270
Just go. Leave.

247
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,270
Stay away from the gate. They'll get off work soon.

248
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,150
There'll be many cars coming out.

249
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,830
You can't tell me what to do out here.

250
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,750
Why didn't we hear anything at all,

251
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,360
and you guys just got fired by Liangcheng?

252
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,390
Why?

253
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,250
Mr. Dong,

254
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,300
you've been in business for so long.

255
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,830
Can't you see?

256
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,790
This past year, Ms. Qiu and I

257
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,850
have been progressing

258
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,710
really fast in our work.

259
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,120
Especially with your patent case.

260
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,050
Before us,

261
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,560
had Liangcheng Law Firm ever handled

262
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,910
such a complicated patent case? Right?

263
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,190
I guess it's just the jealousy that comes with success.

264
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,590
That's the only way to see it.

265
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,250
Yes, when they told me about it,

266
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,150
I said patent cases require

267
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,100
much more specialization than other cases.

268
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,790
Your firm...

269
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,300
No, I should say "their firm."

270
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,120
Right?

271
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,000
Right.

272
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,720
I honestly haven't seen anyone else in their firm

273
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,550
who could handle such cases,

274
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,390
except for the two of you.

275
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,520
We really appreciate

276
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,120
your recognition of us.

277
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,600
But Mr Dong,

278
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,510
we didn't have a fallout with Liangcheng Law Firm.

279
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,410
-We weren't fired.
-Yes.

280
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,750
Should I say it?

281
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,570
Go ahead.

282
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,600
Okay.

283
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,430
Actually, Qiu Hua and I

284
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,580
have always wanted to start our own business.

285
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,050
And I'm quite frank.

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,790
One time, I got too excited and accidentally let it slip.

287
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,840
After Fang Lihong found out, she felt very sorry about it.

288
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,010
She tried every possible way to keep us,

289
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,720
even saying she would nominate us both as general partners.

290
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,670
But since I already said it,

291
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,960
if I stayed on as a partner,

292
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,440
wouldn't it seem like

293
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,150
we were threatening them?

294
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,550
So,

295
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,000
we left resolutely.

296
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,550
But before we left,

297
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,840
Fang Lihong kept us talking for a long time.

298
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,720
Ms. Fang is really willing to help younger lawyers.

299
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,040
She really gave us a lot of insightful advice

300
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,550
for our future development.

301
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,000
I must say,

302
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,080
it was incredibly enlightening.

303
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,670
What about you, Qiu Hua?

304
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,450
Did you feel the same way after hearing it?

305
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,550
That's right, it was truly enlightening.

306
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,810
Really eye-opening.

307
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Ms. Fang

308
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,950
also gave us a few suggestions.

309
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
One of the suggestions

310
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,390
was that we should

311
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,320
focus our business

312
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,360
on intellectual property,

313
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,670
making patent services

314
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,840
our Yinghua Law Firm's specialty

315
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,780
and main business.

316
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,640
Qiu Hua and I found it really made sense.

317
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,450
It's like when you go to a doctor.

318
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,150
If they claim they can cure everything,

319
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,440
can they really be a good doctor?

320
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,980
So, we've decided

321
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,080
to specialize in intellectual property going forward.

322
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,390
We've said a lot.

323
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,700
Well, Mr. Dong, you see,

324
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,550
we've been handling

325
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,830
your company's cases for a year now.

326
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
How about we keep doing it?

327
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,450
We can sign another contract,

328
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,760
and you just need to cancel the one

329
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,970
with Liangcheng Law Firm.

330
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,380
I do want to give this business

331
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,210
to you to handle,

332
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
but I have to consider

333
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,350
your firm's current capabilities

334
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,580
and other aspects.

335
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,880
After all, your firm is newly established.

336
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,770
But what does a law firm's strength really depend on?

337
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,520
Isn't it about the lawyers?

338
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,260
We've already been working together for a year.

339
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,430
Both of us have been personally evaluated by you.

340
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,790
It's been a year.

341
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,290
Do you still not trust us?

342
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,500
You really lack confidence

343
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,950
in your ability to judge people.

344
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,690
Yingzi.

345
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,120
Mr. Dong didn't mean it.

346
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,590
What he means is that he cares about

347
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,560
our relationship with Liangcheng Law Firm.

348
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
You're really far-sighted.

349
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,950
But if you no longer entrust the cases to them,

350
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,180
you won't have any ties with Liangcheng Law Firm.

351
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,490
Has there ever been a case

352
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,390
where the client is afraid of their lawyer?

353
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm here.

354
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,390
The car's parked at the usual place.

355
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,800
Hurry up, let's go eat.

356
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,490
So, he gave my car to his new girlfriend to drive?

357
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Honey!

358
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm here.

359
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,600
What took you so long?

360
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,750
My boss is always looking for me.

361
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,200
Just now, he asked me to stay late.

362
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,700
But as soon as I got your call,

363
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
I lost my mind.

364
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,890
I made an excuse and slipped out immediately.

365
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
But let me make it clear first.

366
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,540
If this affects my future,

367
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,570
your parents can't blame me for being useless.

368
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,360
Shameless.

369
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,630
I really don't take you,

370
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,230
a little employee, seriously.

371
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,360
But

372
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,020
if we get married in the future,

373
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,880
I won't be able to stand you being so busy every day.

374
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,840
Fine.

375
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,910
"Nights for a couple are always short, and they got up late.

376
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,330
From then on, the emperor never attended the morning court."

377
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,690
Come on. You call yourself an emperor?

378
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,250
Let's go. What are we going to eat?

379
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,520
How about some grilled skewers?

380
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,360
There's a place next door.

381
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,480
The taste is pretty good.

382
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,440
You must be used to going there with your ex-girlfriend, right?

383
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,550
No.

384
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,590
Your ex-girlfriend is pretty weird.

385
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,290
Isn't she the daughter of a high-ranking official? How could she have such low taste?

386
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,520
Squatting on the ground every day,

387
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,610
eating grilled skewers with a bunch of roughneck guys.

388
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,270
She's not the daughter of a high-ranking official.

389
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,390
Her dad came from

390
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,060
a rural production team.

391
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,850
As soon as he was no longer a poor farmer,

392
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,150
he had a daughter

393
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,470
who acts like an idiot.

394
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,620
Alright, let's go. Let's go to...

395
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,610
Zhang Xiaoguang!

396
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,550
Wait a minute.

397
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,230
Alright. Hurry up and get in the car.

398
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,800
It's alright.

399
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,580
It's alright. It's alright.

400
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,540
She's just a lunatic.

401
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,800
Zhang Xiaoguang, who are you talking about?

402
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,900
I'm a lunatic?

403
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,440
Wasn't it you who chased after me

404
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
relentlessly back then?

405
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,420
Who chased after you?

406
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,390
We have nothing to do with each other now.

407
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,890
Please have some self-respect and stop bothering me.

408
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,390
That's her?

409
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,370
Xiaoguang, your taste wasn't that great back then.

410
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,870
Get in. Let's go.

411
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,960
Zhang Xiaoguang, don't you dare leave!

412
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,630
Why did you hit my car?

413
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,920
Do you know what car this is?

414
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,010
Can you afford to pay if you damage it?

415
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,130
Your car?

416
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,380
Bah!

417
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,850
Didn't you even check whose name is on the vehicle registration?

418
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,820
Zhang Xiaoguang,

419
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,370
we'll settle our accounts later.

420
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,790
But today, give me my car back.

421
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,000
Our accounts have already been settled when we broke up.

422
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,610
You still owe me hundreds of thousands.

423
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,170
This car is part of the debt repayment.

424
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,030
Qian, get in the car. Let's go.

425
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,060
Zhang Xiaoguang,

426
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,960
don't think I don't know

427
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,770
what you did with my dad.

428
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,790
In the Huanghai project,

429
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,600
how many freight cars of goods

430
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,430
did you get approved under my dad's name?

431
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,840
And how much crude oil did you get in the Dadong project?

432
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,860
I won't count them one by one.

433
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,200
Go.

434
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,170
Eat your fill. Bon appétit.

435
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,270
Because when you end up in jail,

436
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
you won't find any restaurants there.

437
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,670
And you,

438
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,630
take care of yourself.

439
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,280
So you'll have the strength to bring him his meals.

440
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,930
What do you want?

441
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,550
Just go.

442
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,870
I'll go to the Discipline Inspection Commission

443
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,830
right after you leave.

444
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,480
Mr. Dong, well,

445
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,270
we've also brought the contract

446
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,960
for the individual case today.

447
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,090
Why don't you take a look?

448
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,980
[Agency Agreement]

449
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,100
You're really well prepared.

450
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Your agency fee is quite high, though.

451
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,680
Is that so?

452
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,849
The contract I signed with Liangcheng Law Firm

453
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,660
was for legal consultancy for an entire year.

454
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,230
And you're asking 600,000 for just one case.

455
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,950
Isn't that a bit too expensive?

456
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,109
Mr. Dong,

457
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,200
let's discuss each case individually.

458
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,550
How about this?

459
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,589
Let's do as you suggested and discuss each case individually—500,000.

460
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,340
Don't get a headache.

461
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,550
I didn't.

462
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,830
Hear me out.

463
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,390
Please, go ahead.

464
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,090
Well,

465
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,040
if we win the first trial

466
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,640
and the other party appeals,

467
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,100
I'll give you an additional 300,000. How does that sound?

468
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,870
Is it necessary?

469
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,880
Yingzi.

470
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,000
We've been working

471
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,100
with Mr. Dong

472
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
for a year now.

473
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,920
Yes.

474
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,640
Besides, his company had a tough time

475
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
last year,

476
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
and this case is going to trial next week.

477
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,570
We're running out of time.

478
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,100
Yes.

479
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,050
I think

480
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,920
our economic interests

481
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,120
can be set aside.

482
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,010
Providing good service to the client

483
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,090
is what really matters.

484
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,550
Yes.

485
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,830
Wait, Mr. Dong.

486
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,480
Is Qiu Hua your spy?

487
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,830
I'm so pissed.

488
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,350
Are you?

489
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,090
Yes.

490
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,290
Now we're talking.

491
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,420
Then... let's sign the contract as you suggested.

492
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,040
Okay.

493
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,030
Change this 600,000 to 500,000.

494
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,500
Alright.

495
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,080
Give me a pen.

496
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,560
Sign here.

497
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,050
Okay.

498
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,470
Here.

499
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,250
Do I need to sign too?

500
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Yes, you need to sign,

501
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,260
so it'll be legally valid.

502
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,450
Yingzi, Yingzi, Yingzi.

503
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
Should I sign above your signature?

504
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,140
Mr. Dong knows. He knows where to sign.

505
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,170
Yes, just sign here.

506
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,700
Okay.

507
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,090
Oh my, Luo Yingzi.

508
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,590
Who...

509
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,840
You're asking Mr. Dong for 500,000 for one case?

510
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,860
You're so greedy.

511
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,510
Mr. Chen Shuo.

512
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,380
Why are you here?

513
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm here for Mr. Dong.

514
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,040
Excuse me, Mr. Dong.

515
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,820
Let me introduce myself.

516
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm a lawyer from Liangcheng Law Firm.

517
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,570
Since this case was signed

518
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,890
with Liangcheng Law Firm

519
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,750
and both Ms. Qiu and Ms. Luo

520
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,460
have left,

521
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,120
our firm

522
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,110
assigned me

523
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,130
to handle your case.

524
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,890
My name is Chen Shuo.

525
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,290
Okay.

526
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,160
Mr. Chen,

527
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,620
how did you know we are here?

528
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,660
I went to find Mr. Dong,

529
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,810
and they told me he was here,

530
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,670
so I came here.

531
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,030
Mr. Chen, you may not know,

532
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,630
but Mr. Dong has already

533
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,820
entrusted this case to us.

534
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,810
But he hasn't signed, has he?

535
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,870
That's because you came.

536
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,820
Also, this case

537
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,440
is a patent dispute.

538
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,490
As far as I know,

539
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,550
after we left,

540
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,250
Liangcheng Law Firm seemed

541
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,010
to lose its advantage in this field.

542
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,660
Before I came, they didn't have any advantage.

543
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,840
But since I came,

544
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,520
the situation has changed.

545
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,920
Mr. Dong,

546
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,340
you may not know,

547
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,050
but I handled the melamine infringement case

548
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,720
for Huisheng last year.

549
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,330
So, give me three days,

550
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,630
and I promise I'll give you

551
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,170
a very solid representation plan.

552
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,410
I know about that case.

553
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,590
So, you were their attorney?

554
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,240
Yes, it was me.

555
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,490
Mr. Dong,

556
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,390
all the materials and evidence for your case

557
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,540
are still in Liangcheng Law Firm.

558
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,490
As for them,

559
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,600
they didn't even take a single piece of paper.

560
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:03,980
Don't you...

561
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,090
Are you sure you can entrust this case

562
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,920
to them?

563
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,310
Besides, they're just a small firm

564
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,880
with very limited risk tolerance.

565
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,830
Ms. Luo, you may say it now.

566
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,850
Don't what?

567
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,760
Don't worry.

568
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,130
Mr. Dong,

569
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,080
actually, when we left Liangcheng Law Firm,

570
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,310
we made backups of all the case files.

571
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,780
Moreover, Mr. Dong,

572
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,190
we've already won two cases for you.

573
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,500
We have a proven track record.

574
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,980
Secondly,

575
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,080
since the trial is approaching,

576
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,510
changing lawyers at this point

577
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,920
carries enormous risks.

578
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,330
Thirdly,

579
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
while we may be a small firm,

580
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,720
there are advantages to that.

581
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,710
We can dedicate our efforts solely to serving you.

582
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,620
That's something

583
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,410
large firms swamped with clients

584
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,650
simply cannot offer.

585
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,470
Mr. Dong, please allow me

586
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,850
to express my perspective.

587
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,500
Okay.

588
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,640
Lawsuits

589
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,180
are like survival in the wild.

590
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,540
Their small firm

591
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,610
fights alone,

592
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,110
while our Liangcheng Law Firm

593
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,730
works as a team.

594
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,640
In such a situation, who do you think

595
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,260
can last until the end?

596
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,170
Let's get back to the aspect of business.

597
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,490
Our Liangcheng Law Firm is a large firm with many people.

598
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,140
If each person contributes just one idea,

599
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,270
how many ideas is that?

600
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,170
What about them? They're a small firm with just two people.

601
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,240
How many ideas can they come up with?

602
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
They can't even brainstorm as a group.

603
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,820
So if you entrust your case to them,

604
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,000
doesn't that pose a risk?

605
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,060
Most importantly,

606
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,830
our firm's system is very stable.

607
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,160
This stability is based on

608
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,080
the experience we've gained from handling thousands of cases.

609
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,650
This experience gives us the confidence

610
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,650
to continue providing

611
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,950
stable and secure service even

612
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,820
when facing difficult situations.

613
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,230
Do you think

614
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,830
the two of them

615
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,530
can do that?

616
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,000
Mr. Dong,

617
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,090
your case is about to go to trial.

618
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
-So...
-Ms. Luo,

619
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,050
Ms. Qiu.

620
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,940
We cannot afford

621
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,280
to lose this case.

622
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,920
We must win.

623
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,470
Yes.

624
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,530
I'm terribly sorry.

625
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,990
I have something to do later.

626
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,310
Mr. Dong,

627
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,830
can you reconsider it?

628
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,800
-Yes.
-Okay.

629
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,660
We're not in a hurry. Well, actually, we are in a bit of a hurry.

630
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,560
Please reconsider it.

631
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,510
Excuse me, Mr. Dong,

632
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,930
I forgot to give you my business card earlier.

633
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,880
Here, my business card.

634
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,630
Chen Shuo?

635
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,450
Yes. Chen Shuo.

636
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,640
Let's keep in touch, okay?

637
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,050
Okay.

638
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,480
Alright.

639
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

640
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,860
Why did you come back?

641
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,390
Chen Shuo.

642
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,330
Unscrupulous Chen.

643
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,360
You still want to destroy me.

644
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,590
What are you really up to?

645
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,600
I'm up to something good.

646
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,640
I want to cooperate with you.

647
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,960
I can take you with me in this lawsuit.

648
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,960
Of course,

649
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,470
if you find my words harsh,

650
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,310
we can put it another way.

651
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,600
You two can take me with you, if that works for you.

652
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,550
Besides, Liangcheng Law Firm already knows

653
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,940
you've been in contact with Mr. Dong.

654
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,200
They sent me here to stop you.

655
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,160
I had no choice.

656
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,920
Do you really want to see us being destroyed?

657
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,380
Are you just waiting to bury me?

658
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,370
You don't have to be so mean.

659
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,020
You don't have to say such venomous words

660
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,750
every time we lose a case

661
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,070
or miss an opportunity.

662
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,750
I'm also a lawyer.

663
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,980
I just joined Liangcheng Law Firm,

664
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,310
and they assigned me this case.

665
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,880
I need to prove myself. What's wrong with that?

666
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,720
If you really are capable,

667
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,380
you should have had Mr. Dong sign the document just now.

668
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,490
There will come a time when you beg me for help.

669
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,480
I hope that day comes.

670
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,500
Just leave now.

671
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,070
I don't want to see you anymore.

672
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,550
You didn't make a deal today.

673
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll go downstairs and pay the bill for the things on the table.

674
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,090
By the way,

675
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,280
your high-pitched voice doesn't sound very pleasant.

676
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,130
Be careful not to fall and die.

677
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,320
Why do I keep running into this ghost?

678
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,080
We acted for so long,

679
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,660
and in the end, we didn't get the case.

680
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,970
I almost strained my throat from pretending a sweet voice.

681
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,330
It's really hard to keep this law firm running just by the two of us.

682
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,720
Haste makes waste.

683
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,920
For now,

684
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,720
just rely on your husband for a few days.

685
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,040
In a marriage,

686
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,670
supporting each other is fundamental.

687
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,430
I don't want to rely on him for even a day.

688
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,850
Then how about this, Qiu Hua?

689
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,640
Our Yinghua Law Firm will always have your back.

690
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,720
As long as

691
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
you don't resign,

692
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,080
you'll always be my partner.

693
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,710
When the firm isn't too busy,

694
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,150
you can go out for interviews anytime.

695
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,660
If you find a better job,

696
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,620
you can leave if you want.

697
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,610
If I go out to find a job,

698
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,610
won't you be sad?

699
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,680
How can I not be sad?

700
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,880
But what's the use of being sad?

701
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,730
You have your reasons.

702
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,150
I respect your choice.

703
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,840
Thank you, Yingzi.

704
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,750
I think

705
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,340
we can't be picky now.

706
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,940
We must take on all kinds of cases, whether big or small.

707
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,400
At worst, I can go to the courthouse tomorrow

708
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,380
and hand out business cards.

709
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,080
Then should I wear a sign around my neck

710
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
that says, "Draft legal documents,

711
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,350
manage divorce cases,

712
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,200
criminal defense consultations,

713
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,400
traffic accident claims,

714
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,890
specializing in various legal services"?

715
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,750
At this time,

716
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,200
you still have the mood to joke?

717
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,000
We always have to smile.

718
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,820
After all, crying can't solve anything.

719
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,800
Actually, from my personal experience,

720
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,550
there's always a way out, you know?

721
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,170
Sometimes,

722
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,020
when you feel like the road ahead is blocked,

723
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,550
suddenly, boom,

724
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,200
it just opens up.

725
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,920
Really?

726
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,030
-Just "boom".
-Miss!

727
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,110
Pay the parking fee, Miss!

728
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,440
Other stores don't charge for parking,

729
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,440
only yours does.

730
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,050
It sounds like Xia Shu's voice.

731
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,910
I'll only park here for a short while.

732
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,100
You still need to pay me 10 yuan.

733
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,030
10 yuan an hour?

734
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,640
What's your legal basis for this?

735
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,590
It really is Xia Shu.

736
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,920
Legal basis? Our boss wants to charge ten yuan an hour.

737
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,140
How could I forget her?

738
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,800
We still have this baby to feed.

739
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,860
Can't you afford 10 yuan?

740
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,810
Fine, I'll pay you when I leave.

741
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,530
Remember to pay me. Don't try to dodge the bill.

742
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,820
She got the car back?

743
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,540
Now you can't say Xia Shu is incapable, right?

744
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,400
She's amazing.

745
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,320
Kinda.

746
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,920
Luo, Qiu!

747
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,070
I got...

748
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,010
the car back!

749
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,880
We saw it.

750
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,240
You were right.

751
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
When I mentioned the Discipline Inspection Commission,

752
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,770
that guy immediately backed down.

753
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,030
I still don't understand

754
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,620
why I liked him back then.

755
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,510
I really want to travel back in time

756
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,960
and slap myself awake.

757
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,830
Do you still feel bad for him?

758
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,800
I do, a little bit.

759
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,290
His current girlfriend was standing right next to him.

760
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,530
Xia Shu can't be a silly girl anymore.

761
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,850
No one will believe that.

762
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
Xia Shu, have you noticed?

763
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,790
As long as you're strong enough,

764
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,060
the whole world will back down for you.

765
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,640
I drove this car here today

766
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,830
just to show you

767
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,310
and prove myself.

768
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,810
I'll need to drive it away later.

769
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,450
What do you mean?

770
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,040
You borrowed this car from that jerk?

771
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,050
Of course not. I took it back myself.

772
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,640
I contacted a car dealership.

773
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,840
Aren't we in need of money?

774
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,920
I made an arrangement with them.

775
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,240
Later, I'll drive the car over and sell it,

776
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
and then we'll have the money.

777
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
How much are you selling it for?

778
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,130
800,000.

779
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,790
Wait, I remember this car is brand new,

780
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,400
and it's been less than two years since you bought it, right?

781
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,500
How much did you buy it for?

782
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,800
1.2 million.

783
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,690
Xia Shu,

784
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,150
I'm speechless.

785
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,920
You bought a 1.2-million car,

786
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,160
drove it for less than two years,

787
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,360
and now you're selling it for 800,000?

788
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,410
Why didn't you sell it to me?

789
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,920
I want to get a higher price too,

790
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,480
but we are in urgent need of money.

791
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,110
I went to several dealerships,

792
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,920
and after comparing the offers,

793
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,660
this one was the highest.

794
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,140
I just thought we should sell it quickly.

795
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,720
Once we have the money, we won't have to worry about it anymore.

796
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,600
Fine.

797
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,740
It's your car. You make the decision.

798
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,920
Alright, I'll head to the dealership then.

799
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,080
Xia Shu.

800
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,290
We have nothing now.

801
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,250
You still want to join us?

802
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,720
How can you have nothing?

803
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,280
We have 800,000 yuan now.

804
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,840
That 800,000 yuan is yours.

805
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,070
It has nothing to do with us.

806
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,830
We need to

807
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,200
earn our money back

808
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,200
by taking on cases for others.

809
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,750
Just now, I was talking to Luo Yingzi

810
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,000
about this.

811
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,400
From now on, we'll handle the cases,

812
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,610
and I'll give you a task.

813
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,030
Sure. What is it?

814
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,230
Get our three business cards printed,

815
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,180
then take them

816
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,160
to the entrance of the courthouse and hand them out

817
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,800
to try to get us more cases.

818
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,740
No problem.

819
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,560
Qiu Hua,

820
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,610
I thought you were kidding just now.

821
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,460
Are you serious? Is it really necessary?

822
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,220
Of course it is.

823
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,170
Every little bit helps.

824
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,350
And besides,

825
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,770
we don't have any cases right now.

826
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,220
We're not in the position to be picky.

827
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,160
Go ahead.

828
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,680
Okay.

829
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,080
I'll make sure the task gets done.

830
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,920
Hello?

831
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,310
This is she.

832
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,160
Okay.

833
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,170
Okay.

834
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,790
Okay, we'll be right there.

835
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,080
Thank you. Bye.

836
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,530
That was the police station.

837
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,900
It's about Xu Jianshe.

838
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,240
They caught him?

839
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:47,850
No.

840
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,930
They said someone saw him recently.

841
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,920
The police are worried about our safety,

842
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,220
so they want us to go over for a talk.

843
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,880
These days, I've been thinking about it.

844
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,030
Xu Jianshe was completely isolated

845
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,680
from the outside world while he was in detention.

846
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,400
He's not stupid.

847
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,680
He knew that

848
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,550
we got his case

849
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,730
sent back for retrial.

850
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,960
Why does he

851
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,430
hate us so much?

852
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,830
He even said he would take revenge on us

853
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,970
when he gets out.

854
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,950
Don't forget,

855
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,450
as soon as he was in prison,

856
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
his family could start visiting him,

857
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,650
and he wouldn't be isolated from the outside anymore.

858
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,070
Maybe someone

859
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,730
said something to him.

860
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,180
But who could it be?

861
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,510
Ma Lili is his ex-wife.

862
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,560
Technically, she doesn't have the right to visit him.

863
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,170
So, do you think Ma Lili might have done something,

864
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,230
using Xu Jianshe's relatives

865
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,000
to pull some strings

866
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,350
and meet with him?

867
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,480
You really reminded me.

868
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,180
Now that Xu Jianshe has escaped,

869
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,680
could Ma Lili be in danger?

870
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,640
Where could Xu Jianshe be hiding?

871
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,150
When he was in prison,

872
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,220
he'd believe anything Ma Lili said.

873
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,440
Now that he's out,

874
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,310
if he knows the truth,

875
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,510
Ma Lili...

876
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,370
Officer Wang,

877
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,270
because we represented Xu Jianshe before,

878
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,060
we're familiar with his personality.

879
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,610
Xu Jianshe

880
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,970
is indeed prone to violence,

881
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,310
and he's very simple-minded.

882
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,820
His escape this time

883
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,920
poses a great danger to society.

884
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,710
Plus, he...

885
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,380
trusts very few people.

886
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,230
So we think it's very likely

887
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,970
he'll go to his ex-wife, Ma Lili.

888
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,580
We've already talked to Ma Lili.

889
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,840
She said she hasn't seen Xu Jianshe.

890
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,720
We've been secretly monitoring for two days

891
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,630
and found that there is indeed no contact between them.

892
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,600
Just yesterday, someone who knows Xu Jianshe

893
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,920
saw him on the street

894
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,990
and said hello to him.

895
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,880
But Xu Jianshe ignored him

896
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,360
and left in a hurry.

897
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,090
So now we can confirm

898
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,710
that Xu Jianshe is in Jingbei.

899
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,770
And his goal is revenge.

900
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,540
Didn't I call you earlier?

901
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,590
You two must be careful.

902
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,670
This is not a joke.

903
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,370
We think Xu Jianshe

904
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,750
has nowhere else to go.

905
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,310
If he has sneaked into the city,

906
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,480
he's most likely seeking refuge with Ma Lili.

907
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
But he doesn't know that

908
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,820
Ma Lili played a role in his imprisonment.

909
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
He's been kept in the dark.

910
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,520
If he finds out the truth this time,

911
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,400
I think Ma Lili will be in danger.

912
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,550
We know the situation between them quite well.

913
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,750
Can we

914
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,060
go talk to Ma Lili

915
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,470
and analyze the pros and cons for her?

916
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,070
This would also help with capturing Xu Jianshe.

917
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,280
Ma Lili

918
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,450
is not a suspect.

919
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,770
If you want to find her,

920
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,880
it's none of my business.

921
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,230
But there's one thing I should tell you:

922
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,070
Don't ruin the police's plan.

923
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,090
Don't worry.

924
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,680
From what we know about Ma Lili,

925
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,550
she's the least likely person

926
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,050
to want Xu Jianshe to escape.

927
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,960
We might be able to convince Ma Lili

928
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
to tell us Xu Jianshe's whereabouts.

929
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,410
I also need to consult with my superior about it.

930
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,550
Let me say it one last time:

931
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,110
Stay alert and be careful.

932
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,980
My phone is on 24/7.

933
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,390
Call me immediately if anything happens.

934
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,800
Rest assured, Officer.

935
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,510
You shouldn't call me "Officer."

936
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,870
Chen Shuo and I were classmates.

937
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,470
He was your classmate?

938
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,480
We went to the same college.

939
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,180
It's his honor.

940
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,800
Why didn't you pull him into your police force

941
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,910
and keep a close eye on him?

942
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,750
Why?

943
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,910
You don't know why?

944
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,640
We're leaving.

945
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,190
Bye.

946
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,180
Be careful.

947
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay.

948
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,840
[Jingbei Construction Cable Co., LTD]

949
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,680
Hello, we would like to meet with Ms. Ma Lili.

950
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,770
Do you have an appointment with Ms. Ma?

951
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,320
No.

952
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,700
But you can tell her

953
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,810
that Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu are here to see her.

954
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,430
Okay.

955
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,950
Ms. Ma, two lawyers are here to see you.

956
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,280
This company is quite large.

957
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,300
It seems Xu Jianshe has quite a bit of hidden assets.

958
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,460
Looks like she's raked in quite a bit of money.

959
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,550
Okay.

960
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,620
Please come with me.

961
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,170
Okay.

962
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,730
Ms. Ma, they're here.

963
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,730
What brings you two big-time lawyers here?

964
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,610
What?

965
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,630
Are you here to pay back the lawyer fees

966
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,380
you ripped me off for?

967
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,750
Ma Lili, if you're going to talk like that,

968
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,680
we'll leave right now.

969
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,360
And we'll discuss it another way.

970
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,220
Forget it.

971
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,470
It's not much money. I don't care.

972
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,370
Go ahead. Why are you here?

973
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160
Xu Jianshe escaped.

974
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,750
Do you know about it?

975
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,120
Yeah.

976
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,350
The police have already contacted me.

977
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,240
Xu Jianshe is really lucky.

978
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,460
He had a car accident,

979
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,290
and the car flipped, but he managed to escape.

980
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,440
And nothing happened to him.

981
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,400
Don't you know

982
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,550
what Xu Jianshe's escape means to you?

983
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,360
What does it mean?

984
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
If he really finds you,

985
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,900
what good will it do for you?

986
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,320
For your own safety,

987
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,150
you should cooperate with the police and turn him in.

988
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,480
Are you saying

989
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,090
I've been harboring Xu Jianshe?

990
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,650
Harboring a fugitive is a felony.

991
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,440
Don't slander me here.

992
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,550
We're just kindly reminding you.

993
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,400
Now that he's escaped,

994
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,510
sooner or later,

995
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,900
he'll find out why he was sentenced to life.

996
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,850
Aren't you worried?

997
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,720
I've never done anything that would make me feel guilty.

998
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,950
I'm not afraid of bad things coming my way.

999
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,920
Not to mention that Xu Jianshe is not here.

1000
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,920
Even if he were here,

1001
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,950
I wouldn't be afraid of him finding out.

1002
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,810
Ma Lili,

1003
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,440
you think you can control him.

1004
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,290
But have you forgotten?

1005
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,920
He is prone to violence and is simple-minded.

1006
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,920
If he finds out that someone deceived him,

1007
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,360
we really can't imagine

1008
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,660
what he might do.

1009
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,040
We're really here

1010
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,350
for your safety today.

1011
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,429
Please choose carefully.

1012
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,949
Did I pay you?

1013
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,330
No, right?

1014
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,480
Then why are you two worrying about me?

1015
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,290
I'm busy. Please leave.

1016
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,820
Could it be that Xu Jianshe

1017
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,170
has another hiding place?

1018
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,800
Maybe he didn't go to Ma Lili.

1019
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,880
Impossible.

1020
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,230
He only trusts Ma Lili.

1021
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,400
Even if he's not hiding here,

1022
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,650
they must be in touch.

1023
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,159
But why is Ma Lili covering for him?

1024
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
What's in it for her?

1025
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,719
This doesn't seem like her character.

1026
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,920
I also find it strange.

1027
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,429
What's wrong?

1028
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,739
Could Ma Lili want to use Xu Jianshe

1029
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,810
to get rid of us?

1030
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,300
Just for that 300,000?

1031
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,929
That doesn't seem very likely.

1032
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,300
Well...

1033
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,920
Let's talk to Ms. Ma about it later.

1034
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Look at that man.

1035
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,800
Mr. He!

1036
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,800
Mr. He, wait a minute.

1037
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
The one in grey suit.

1038
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,110
Please sign here.

1039
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,880
Who is it?

1040
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,820
That's He.

1041
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,320
How dare you take my car?

1042
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,440
Go back by yourself!

1043
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,150
Are you

1044
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,730
the defendant's lawyer?

1045
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,130
I'm He Ming from Fangzheng Law Firm.

1046
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,960
What He?

1047
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,400
He's the apprentice of Xu Jianshe's defense lawyer who took over after us.

1048
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,920
He Ming?

1049
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:15,960
Right?

1050
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,630
Hello, may I ask

1051
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,690
if the person just now was He Ming, Mr. He?

1052
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,600
Mr. He?

1053
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,740
Mr. He is now our Vice President.

1054
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,170
Are you looking for him?

1055
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,880
No, no. Thank you.

1056
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,600
You're welcome.

1057
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,790
Why has the humble Lawyer He

1058
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,080
become President He now?

1059
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,490
Let's not worry about him for now.

1060
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,850
We came here to see Ma Lili.

1061
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,720
I just noticed that Ma Lili

1062
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,630
was keeping tight-lipped.

1063
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,840
She's definitely hiding something.

1064
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,450
We need to keep a close watch on her.

1065
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,890
Did you hear me?

1066
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,630
I did. It's so strange.

1067
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,480
Is it this car?

1068
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,400
Are you sure you got the right license plate number?

1069
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,590
I'm sure it's this car.

1070
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,440
Even if we can track Ma Lili,

1071
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,790
will that lead us to Xu Jianshe?

1072
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,370
Even if we can't find Xu Jianshe,

1073
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,990
we might find something else.

1074
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,950
Ma Lili is bold,

1075
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,000
but she set Xu Jianshe up before.

1076
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,150
Why is she so confident

1077
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,480
that he won't hurt her?

1078
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,200
You're right.

1079
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,180
No matter how confident a woman is,

1080
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,290
she can never bet on her husband's character.

1081
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,800
Why are you laughing?

1082
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,890
I think you're right.

1083
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,800
Ma Lili is out.

1084
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,590
Why is she holding a man's arm?

1085
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,180
Look.

1086
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,400
He Ming?

1087
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,650
He Ming and Ma Lili got together?

1088
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,480
Is this something we can see?

1089
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,750
Why did He Ming and Ma Lili get together?

1090
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,060
I'll take the photos.

1091
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,000
Follow them.

1092
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,900
Okay. I'll follow them.

1093
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,960
Okay, I'll take the photos.

1094
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,770
I never did it even when I got divorced.

1095
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,950
Don't follow them too closely.

1096
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,970
I'm not. It's a normal distance.

1097
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,400
I don't know

1098
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,030
if this case will be easy to handle.

1099
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,930
Alright, alright. Stop talking to me about work.

1100
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,190
You've been talking about it all the way.

1101
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,340
It's really funny.

1102
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,010
We didn't find

1103
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,710
Xu Jianshe,

1104
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,250
but we bumped into an office romance.

1105
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
A detective drama turned into a romance drama.

1106
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,780
How could Ma Lili, such a money-hungry woman,

1107
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,030
fall for this poor guy,

1108
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,540
He Ming?

1109
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,910
She even made him the Vice President.

1110
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,850
What for?

1111
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,290
He helped Ma Lili send the messages

1112
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,280
and transfer Xu Jianshe's property.

1113
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,280
He must have some dirt

1114
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,190
on Ma Lili.

1115
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,710
Dirt?

1116
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,120
But Ma Lili isn't someone easy to deal with, right?

1117
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,400
Would she really just let him blackmail her?

1118
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,110
You've worked hard this time.

1119
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,820
You've been running around dealing with

1120
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,960
our company's mess.

1121
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,030
It was nothing.

1122
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,800
Lili,

1123
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,030
I'm not an ordinary lawyer anymore.

1124
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,710
I'm your vice president, your man.

1125
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,060
Isn't it my responsibility to work hard for you?

1126
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,880
Now, in Shandong and Hebei,

1127
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,110
there are still some bad debts,

1128
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,490
tough ones to crack.

1129
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,550
Isn't that what's keeping you up at night?

1130
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,330
Don't worry. Once I get through these few days,

1131
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,550
I'll take care of it properly

1132
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,120
and let you have a good sleep.

1133
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,640
Whether it's taken care of properly or not doesn't matter.

1134
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,280
What matters is that you must stay home with me.

1135
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,640
Qiu Hua.

1136
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,480
I just remembered.

1137
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,480
What did you remember?

1138
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,590
The reason Ma Lili

1139
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,800
is harboring

1140
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,280
Xu Jianshe.

1141
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,460
You mean...

1142
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,670
She's using him as a knife to...

1143
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,690
[I'll be waiting for you outside the restaurant. Don't tell Ma Lili. It's something important. You must come.]

1144
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,690
[Qiu Hua]

1145
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,750
What is it?

1146
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,750
Nothing, just work stuff.

1147
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,930
I have a dinner gathering later.

1148
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,830
I'm going to socialise.

1149
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,080
You go home first.

1150
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,800
It's okay. Just go. Don't worry about me.

1151
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,700
Don't drink too much.

1152
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,000
It's them, right?

1153
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,600
They're out.

1154
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,230
Is the designated driver here?

1155
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,760
Lie low.

1156
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,540
Yes.

1157
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,070
Okay, just go.

1158
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm leaving.

1159
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,260
She left.

1160
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,780
They kissed.

1161
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,230
Mr. He.

1162
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,540
This way.

1163
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,670
Senior, what are you doing?

1164
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,190
Are you following me?

1165
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,800
We're saving your life.

1166
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,730
Xu Jianshe escaped during detention.

1167
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,890
Do you know about it?

1168
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,080
Let's talk in the car.

1169
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,480
What is it?

1170
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,440
Mr. He,

1171
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,520
there's no need for games between us.

1172
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,240
How did you become the vice president of this company?

1173
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,050
Who told you that?

1174
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,930
I'm still a lawyer.

1175
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,530
I'm just in charge of their company's legal affairs.

1176
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,050
Mr. He Ming,

1177
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,780
it's clear to us what the relationship is

1178
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,440
between you and Ma Lili.

1179
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
But don't worry.

1180
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,700
We're not interested

1181
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,040
in your personal life.

1182
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,440
Today,

1183
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,710
we're here for Xu Jianshe,

1184
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,390
and also for your safety.

1185
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,500
We hope you don't waste our kindness.

1186
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,810
Ms. Luo, sorry,

1187
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,590
but I don't understand what you're talking about.

1188
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,890
What? Do I need to speak in English?

1189
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,290
He, listen to me.

1190
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,120
You know exactly how Xu Jianshe

1191
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,320
was sentenced to life imprisonment.

1192
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,750
And you know even better what role Ma Lili

1193
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,660
played in that.

1194
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,250
Now that Xu Jianshe has escaped,

1195
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,740
and the police said he's already in this city,

1196
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,470
where do you think he's hiding?

1197
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,790
Logically, Ma Lili would be the last person

1198
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,180
who wants Xu Jianshe to escape.

1199
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,340
We went to see her today.

1200
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,550
We thought that once we explained things to her,

1201
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,220
she would cooperate with the police.

1202
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,890
But she denied it.

1203
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,040
Do you think she has a motive to cover for Xu Jianshe?

1204
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,400
If she does,

1205
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,170
who does she want to use Xu Jianshe

1206
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,550
to get rid of?

1207
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,670
Senior,

1208
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,210
I really don't understand what you're talking about.

1209
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,120
Yes.

1210
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,890
Xu Jianshe and Ma Lili used to be a couple.

1211
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,040
It's normal for them to still have ties.

1212
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,400
But even if I got together with Ma Lili,

1213
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
it's all legal and reasonable.

1214
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,360
It shouldn't be a problem for Xu Jianshe, right?

1215
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,390
He,

1216
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,240
if you think

1217
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,350
Ma Lili is sincerely with you,

1218
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,710
and if you dare say she's with you

1219
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,480
not because you have some dirt on her,

1220
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,760
then just pretend I never said it.

1221
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,080
Anyway, I've told you about it.

1222
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,680
How to handle it is up to you.

1223
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,360
Well then, thank you, Senior.

1224
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,530
I have something to do. I have to go.

1225
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,510
He slammed my door?

1226
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:03,850
Brat.

1227
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,110
We should go find Officer Wang now

1228
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,700
and give him the clues.

1229
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,190
Following this line,

1230
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,670
they'll definitely catch Xu Jianshe.

1231
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,580
This is just our deduction.

1232
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:15,980
There's no evidence.

1233
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,910
It is.

1234
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,460
But I think it must be true.

1235
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,610
Where else do you think Xu Jianshe

1236
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,920
could escape to?

1237
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,240
Where else could he be hiding

1238
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,530
except at Ma Lili's place?

1239
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,500
Yingzi.

1240
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,470
Since all of this is just our deduction,

1241
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,720
and we don't have any evidence

1242
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,010
of He Ming blackmailing Ma Lili,

1243
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,470
let's not tell the police for now.

1244
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,850
I'll try to talk to him alone once more.

1245
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,620
Alright.

1246
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,400
But let me tell you in advance,

1247
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,610
you definitely won't get any good results.

1248
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,250
[Xu Jianshe]
