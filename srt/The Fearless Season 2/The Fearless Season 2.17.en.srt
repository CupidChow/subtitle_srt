00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,860
Mr. Xu, what's up?

4
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:48,900
Ms. Luo,

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,680
are you at Yinghua Law Firm?

6
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,370
Yeah, I'm working overtime.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm reviewing the debt claims of Dingxin and Wanhe.

8
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,100
Have you eaten?

9
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,120
How late are you planning to stay?

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,340
Well, I can't say for sure how late I'll be working.

11
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,480
I've prepared some food.

12
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,890
Do you need something?

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,230
How about a cup of coffee to refresh yourself?

14
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,580
Coffee?

15
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,390
Where would I even get coffee at this hour?

16
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,430
Who is it?

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,750
Delivery.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
Is that Mr. Xu?

19
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,890
It‘s really you.

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,829
Your delivery is here.

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
You even brought coffee.

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,090
Please come in.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
I asked my assistant

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,210
to prepare the latest materials

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,660
on Dingxin and Wanhe's debt claims

26
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,670
for you as a supplement.

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,750
-Thank you.
-I've never been here;

28
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,380
so I thought I'd drop by and take a look.

29
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,940
It's pretty shabby here.

30
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,950
We just moved in.

31
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,250
Look, there are still a bunch of cardboard boxes over there,

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
but it'll definitely get renovated later.

33
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,960
Is this what you prepared to eat?

34
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,550
I'll just grab a quick bite.

35
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,220
By the way, Mr. Xu, have you eaten?

36
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,290
I haven't either.

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,980
Let me cook you a bowl of noodles.

38
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,670
Thank you.

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,380
Which one is your office?

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,070
That one.

41
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,350
How many people are there in your firm?

42
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Three.

43
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,240
Our case is huge;

44
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,910
aren't you planning to hire more people?

45
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,329
You know that

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,190
one person on our team

47
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,870
can handle the work of ten.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,030
The circuit tripped.

49
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,560
This building is too old.

50
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,900
The wiring is outdated and keeps failing.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,520
Mr. Xu, please wait a moment.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,910
I'll go check the circuit breaker.

53
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,680
Let me go.

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
You go? Do you know where the breaker is?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,750
I know.

56
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,190
The power is too high, so it's prone to short circuits.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,320
How did you know where the circuit breaker is?

58
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,320
The first office of Zhuoyue Law Firm

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,630
was quite similar to yours,

60
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,380
actually not as nice as yours.

61
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,600
I didn't even call it Zhuoyue Law Firm,

62
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,560
I called it the Pavilion.

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,430
Pavilion? Why?

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
When Zhuoyue Law Firm was just established,

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,610
it was right after my second time out of detention.

66
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,610
Because I had been detained,

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,060
case sources were scarce.

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,800
Taking on pro bono cases doesn't make money

69
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,010
and it's easy to offend people.

70
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,720
Anyway,

71
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,070
we were dirt poor,

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,350
stretching a pack of instant noodles into two meals.

73
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,120
That winter,

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,510
we won a fraud case

75
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,890
for a group of deaf-mute people,

76
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,290
and as a result, the opposing side trashed our law firm.

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,600
They cut the electrical wires,

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,550
and in the dead of winter,

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,110
we were left in the dark,

80
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,790
with drafts coming in from all sides.

81
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,100
It was a miracle they didn't tear the roof off.

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,640
That's why I call it the Pavilion.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,070
Compared to that,

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,780
at least we've got what you could call a "tent."

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,900
Mr. Xu,

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
you know how we always complain about

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,710
how tough our work is?

88
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,060
But hearing your story

89
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,030
really makes us seem overly dramatic.

90
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,300
What I mean is,

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,430
no matter how simple or fancy your law firm is,

92
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,530
whether it's packed or not,

93
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,340
it doesn't change your abilities

94
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,200
nor

95
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,510
how I see you all.

96
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,690
But I did want to replace you last time.

97
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,930
It was you who wanted to replace us?

98
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,980
We all thought it was the partners' decision.

99
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,450
It was my decision.

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,350
I believe in your abilities,

101
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,020
and Madam Mei believes too.

102
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,990
But your firm

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,670
can't vouch for Zhuoyue Law Firm,

104
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,450
and you don't have the qualifications of administrator.

105
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,600
You're also not very familiar with bankruptcy projects,

106
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,180
so you're not the best choice.

107
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,940
So, the reason you decided to choose us in the end

108
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,800
was because we managed to uncover

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,920
Wanhe's hidden assets?

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,270
Is this the only bowl?

111
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,540
What about yours?

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,700
I have bread

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
and the coffee you brought.

114
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,740
Do you know?

115
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,100
This is exactly what makes you valuable.

116
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,270
Without you,

117
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,650
I wouldn't have been able to secure the deal with Dingxin.

118
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,170
Mr. Xu, thank you for your honesty.

119
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,750
Actually, I've been looking into

120
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,820
bankruptcy reorganization cases recently.

121
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,190
Have you heard of a case

122
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
called the Zhucheng Case?

123
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,450
That case was handled by me.

124
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,680
At that time, Zhuoyue Law Firm

125
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,560
had no staff, no money, and no cases.

126
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,400
We even hired disabled people.

127
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,690
Luckily, Madam Mei helped us secure

128
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
a commercial case.

129
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,670
But Ms. Luo,

130
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,790
how did you know about this case?

131
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,250
Apart from the court and Liangcheng Law Firm,

132
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,320
the case files aren't accessible.

133
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,420
Actually, you don't know that

134
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,480
we were fired by Liangcheng Law Firm,

135
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,730
so I have a bit of a vendetta against it.

136
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,510
The reason I fought so hard for the Wanhe case

137
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,750
is also related to the Liangcheng Law Firm.

138
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,890
But here's a secret I'll share with you:

139
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,690
I have an insider at Liangcheng Law Firm.

140
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,040
So, it was incredibly satisfying for me

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,620
to sabotage their bid.

142
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,490
So Liangcheng Law Firm should be regretting it now.

143
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,200
It's their loss

144
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,350
to fire you.

145
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,490
Mr. Xu,

146
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,550
did Zhuoyue Law Firm's reputation

147
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,190
take off

148
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,800
after the Zhucheng case?

149
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,380
Not exactly.

150
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,390
Later, the Zhucheng Case was handed over to Tao Zheng and his team.

151
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,830
We did make some money.

152
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,630
At least we can afford the rent,

153
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,830
and finally stop using duct tape on the windows.

154
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,590
Well, if you put it that way,

155
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,750
the Zhucheng Case still holds reference value for us,

156
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,310
and you have experience too.

157
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,500
More than experience,

158
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,430
I believe in you

159
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,060
and Ms. Qiu.

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,730
Thank you.

161
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,820
You all are much stronger now

162
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,120
than I was back then.

163
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,000
I hope we can have a pleasant collaboration.

164
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,700
Absolutely, it will definitely be a pleasant collaboration.

165
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Cheers.

166
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,240
You're back.

167
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,059
Go wash your hands and eat.

168
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,960
You eat. I'm not hungry.

169
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,480
What's wrong? Did you eat outside?

170
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,380
I just have no appetite.

171
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,630
Then keep me company and eat a little.

172
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,420
Why do you have no appetite?

173
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,320
I don't know, maybe

174
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,480
I've just been too tired lately.

175
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,630
I don't feel like eating.

176
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,080
No appetite recently?

177
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,460
Do you feel like

178
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,510
throwing up at all?

179
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,540
Occasionally, what's wrong?

180
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,470
Well,

181
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,750
does that mean I'm going to

182
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,580
be a dad?

183
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,040
What are you thinking about?

184
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm still on my period

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,170
and having cramps.

186
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,820
Don't jump to conclusions.

187
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,630
Then you just have a poor appetite.

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
Have some yogurt

189
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,500
to whet your appetite.

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,860
I can't help but laugh at your absent-mindedness.

191
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,360
I just told you I'm on my period,

192
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,750
and you fetch me an ice-cold yogurt from the fridge.

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,880
I forgot; let me warm it up for you.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Just leave it there; I'll drink it when it's warmer.

195
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,910
Alright, I'll leave it here.

196
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,350
You can drink it when it's warm.

197
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,000
But you still need to eat something.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
Take care of yourself.

199
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,170
After all, we're going to have a baby.

200
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,960
Quanquan,

201
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,600
I might not be ready to have a child yet.

202
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,840
You know that

203
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,550
my law firm has just been established,

204
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,440
and there's so much to do.

205
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,790
When we got married,

206
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,910
we didn't go back to our hometown for the wedding.

207
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,320
My mom and dad

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,150
still feel like they've lost face

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,290
in front of relatives and friends.

210
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,500
Now that Mom has retired,

211
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,690
she wants us to have a child sooner

212
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,080
so she has the energy

213
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,360
to devote herself to taking care of our baby.

214
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,180
This way, she won't feel so empty inside.

215
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,570
She'll have something to focus on;

216
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,420
isn't that good?

217
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,880
Quanquan,

218
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,750
I really can't

219
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,450
consider having a child right now.

220
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,610
You know, if I were to have a baby,

221
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
I wouldn't be able to do anything else for at least three years.

222
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
The focus of my life and our family

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,390
would have to shift entirely to the child.

224
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,720
I can't afford that kind of sacrifice at the moment.

225
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,150
Even if you weren't doing anything right now,

226
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,200
we'd still be fine, wouldn't we?

227
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,030
And Mom said that

228
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
women with too much career ambition

229
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,520
have a hard time.

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,190
Besides, my job is stable now,

231
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,040
and we can still rely on our families;

232
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,530
isn't that great?

233
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,340
But I can't rely on the family, on you,

234
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,920
on your dad, on your mom forever.

235
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,160
Why not?

236
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,520
We are a family.

237
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,300
You're my wife.

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,790
You're the daughter-in-law of my parents.

239
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,390
Quanquan,

240
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,960
our values don't align

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,270
on this issue.

242
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,280
Yes, I am the daughter-in-law of your parents,

243
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,150
but I am also an independent person.

244
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,410
I could never rely on others for my entire life.

245
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,750
I can only rely on myself.

246
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,300
I can't let you

247
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,610
or your family support me.

248
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,760
Let's discuss the issue of having a child in a few years.

249
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,780
I'm tired; I'm going to take a shower.

250
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,670
When you're done eating, just leave the plates and bowls

251
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,870
in the sink.

252
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll wash them after resting a while.

253
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,970
By the way,

254
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,200
I also skimmed through the administrator's work records

255
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
of the Zhucheng Case that Chen Shuo brought over.

256
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,080
Didn't Madam Mei and her husband

257
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,430
handle it at the beginning?

258
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,990
Later, after something happened to them,

259
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,190
most of the partners, led by Lawyer Tao Zheng,

260
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,460
got involved.

261
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,390
There's no problem,

262
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,390
but the only thing that seems a bit odd

263
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,720
is why Fang Lihong didn't participate.

264
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,190
I noticed that too.

265
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
When something happened to Madam Mei and her husband,

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Liangcheng Law Firm

267
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,640
must have been in complete chaos.

268
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,960
She was Madam Mei's disciple

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,840
and the only remaining founding partner at the firm.

270
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,630
She was busy handling Madam Mei's case,

271
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
so it makes sense that

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
she didn't participate.

273
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,370
What I find strange is that

274
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,050
Han didn't get involved.

275
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,560
Not strange at all.

276
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,280
Lift your feet.

277
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,600
Few people at Liangcheng Law Firm

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,690
think highly of Han,

279
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,360
so it's normal that he didn't get involved.

280
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,460
There's another thing

281
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,940
that I find quite strange as well.

282
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,960
Xu Zhuo is also in this team,

283
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,370
and the administrator fees of Zhucheng are over ten million.

284
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,510
Logically speaking,

285
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,600
since Madam Mei and her husband

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,840
are the founding partners of Liangcheng Law Firm,

287
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,110
such a lucrative job

288
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,960
should have been given to their own people.

289
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,810
How could they let such a lucrative opportunity go to an outsider?

290
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,200
Madam Mei always said that

291
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,730
she particularly recognized Mr. Xu.

292
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,450
Perhaps she just wanted to nurture the younger generation.

293
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,880
But I think

294
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,860
if someone were to frame Madam Mei and her husband

295
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,630
because of the huge interests

296
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,600
behind the Zhucheng Case,

297
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,940
that person should still be from within the Liangcheng Law Firm.

298
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,270
Who do you think

299
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,510
could have the heart to do such a thing?

300
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,960
I have no idea.

301
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,540
How about we go ask Madam Mei?

302
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,070
Okay.

303
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,440
Madam Mei,

304
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,000
you mean

305
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,870
back when you were handling the Zhucheng Case,

306
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,820
you also took on

307
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,110
the Wei Cheng rape case at the same time?

308
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,760
And later, you got into trouble because of the rape case,

309
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,790
so the Zhucheng Case was handed over to

310
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,360
Tao Zheng, right?

311
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,470
To be precise, after we ran into trouble,

312
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,910
the Liangcheng Law Firm

313
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,250
was assigned by the court to handle the Zhucheng Case.

314
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,220
Tao Zheng was the lead attorney,

315
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,650
but Fang Lihong, as the head of the firm,

316
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,830
was also involved in it.

317
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
How did you know about the Zhucheng Case?

318
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,200
Why do you care about this again?

319
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,690
I never said I wasn't going to investigate.

320
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,480
I just said I'd take a different approach.

321
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,210
Fine, I can't convince you.

322
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,710
After you called me today,

323
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,440
I tried really hard to recall the details,

324
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,030
but no matter how much I think about it,

325
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,160
I still don't see anything suspicious

326
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,660
about the Zhucheng Case.

327
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,670
Madam Mei,

328
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,030
could you tell us

329
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,980
about the situation back then?

330
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,200
Zhucheng was a large privately-owned casting enterprise

331
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,050
specializing in pipe production.

332
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,600
Due to poor management, it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

333
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,320
Yu and I were appointed by the court

334
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,720
as the bankruptcy administrators for Zhucheng.

335
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,670
We successfully drafted

336
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,340
a bankruptcy reorganization plan,

337
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,420
which was approved by the court.

338
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,290
However, the challenging part was that

339
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,320
our plan had to be passed

340
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,800
by the creditors' meeting.

341
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,000
I remember we held

342
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,390
three creditors' meetings for this case.

343
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,960
Before the third meeting,

344
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,320
Yu and I were forced to step down

345
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,670
due to the rape case allegations.

346
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,750
Later, the Liangcheng Law Firm took over

347
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,480
and still used our plan,

348
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,740
successfully achieving the bankruptcy reorganization.

349
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,460
That's the whole story.

350
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,690
The one who benefited will be the prime suspect.

351
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
In this case,

352
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,150
the biggest beneficiary was the Liangcheng Law Firm,

353
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,030
so they did have a motive

354
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,510
to frame you.

355
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,910
I've thought about it,

356
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,390
but then I felt like I might be overthinking it.

357
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,790
The Zhucheng Case was the biggest case

358
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,720
Liangcheng Law Firm took on at the time,

359
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,390
and there was no room for any mistakes.

360
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,840
When we got into trouble because of the rape case,

361
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,360
Liangcheng Law Firm had to take over.

362
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,610
Actually, the firm didn't treat us unfairly.

363
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
Fang Lihong insisted that

364
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,190
since we had done the groundwork,

365
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,550
we still received nearly 30%

366
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,030
of the administrator fees

367
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,680
in the end.

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,390
Maybe they did that

369
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,200
just to ease their own conscience.

370
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,550
Madam Mei, is it possible that

371
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,390
Liangcheng Law Firm, or someone from the firm,

372
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,120
framed you

373
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
to take the Zhucheng Case

374
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,010
away from you?

375
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,840
An ordinary lawyer

376
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,930
wouldn't be able to take the case

377
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,630
even if he brought us down—

378
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,930
unless he was a partner.

379
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,600
But all the partners at Liangcheng Law Firm

380
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,200
were former students of mine and Yu.

381
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,050
The students framed the teachers,

382
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,030
and went all out to ruin them...

383
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,790
What do you think?

384
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,220
I have another question.

385
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,849
Xu Zhuo was also part of the administrator team at the time,

386
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,550
right?

387
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,430
Yes.

388
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,030
But Xu Zhuo

389
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,099
wasn't a lawyer at the Liangcheng Law Firm back then.

390
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,829
There were over 100 lawyers in Liangcheng Law Firm.

391
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,710
Why didn't you use someone from your own firm

392
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,310
and instead bring in Xu Zhuo?

393
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,260
He was detained twice.

394
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,210
You know that, right?

395
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,950
Yes.

396
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,280
And it seems like he had a really tough time

397
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,640
when he was starting out—

398
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,670
much worse than the situation Qiu Hua and I are in now.

399
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,180
When we were handling this case,

400
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,530
he had just been released from detention for the second time.

401
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,370
Then he established Zhuoyue Law Firm.

402
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,710
Because of his criminal record,

403
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,730
it was hard for him to get cases.

404
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,950
We admired him,

405
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,130
and wanted to give him a hand,

406
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,450
so we brought him onto the administrator team.

407
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,350
When dealing with this case,

408
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,600
Xu Zhuo actually contributed a lot.

409
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,980
That means

410
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,130
the Zhucheng Case was what established Zhuoyue Law Firm,

411
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,520
and Xu Zhuo's first big break

412
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,600
came from this case, right?

413
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
You could say that,

414
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,160
but he didn't gain much

415
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,730
from this case.

416
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,750
After we ran into trouble,

417
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,260
the others at Liangcheng Law Firm weren't particularly close to him,

418
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,480
so when it came to the final distribution,

419
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,210
he didn't get a larger share.

420
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,790
Fang Lihong, Tao Zheng,

421
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,790
Fan Yiqing, Zhang Zhi.

422
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,750
Why didn't Han

423
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,200
get involved in the Zhucheng Case back then?

424
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,070
If he had been involved,

425
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,350
he'd be my first suspect.

426
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,030
"If I can't have it,

427
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,370
neither can you"—

428
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,720
that totally fits Han's personality.

429
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,820
Maybe he did it.

430
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,830
No, it doesn't fit him.

431
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,830
"If I went through all that strenghth to ruin you

432
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,860
and take the benefits,

433
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,790
I'd definitely

434
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,730
want a piece of the pie."—

435
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,350
that's more like Han.

436
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,250
Yes.

437
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
You've worked with him longer,

438
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,410
so you know him better.

439
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,810
But why did you keep bringing up Xu Zhuo

440
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,950
back at Madam Mei's place?

441
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,050
What do you mean?

442
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,280
Nothing.

443
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,170
I was just checking the facts.

444
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,750
Okay.

445
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,960
Don't tell Xu Zhuo

446
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,580
about the Zhucheng Case for now.

447
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
Why not?

448
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,590
He was involved back then.

449
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,940
We've just joined his team.

450
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,380
I know he appreciates you,

451
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,680
but trust hasn't been fully established yet.

452
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,440
What if he knows something about

453
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,620
what happened back then?

454
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,860
Who knows which side he was really on?

455
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,660
He must've been on Madam Mei's side.

456
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,550
Back then, Madam Mei and her husband

457
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,240
didn't even use their own people

458
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,690
but they chose him, an outsider.

459
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,790
He was the biggest beneficiary.

460
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,960
He had to be on Madam Mei's side.

461
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,480
Not necessarily.

462
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,380
It's been so many years,

463
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,510
and Xu Zhuo hasn't developed a closer relationship

464
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,920
with Madam Mei.

465
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,350
Besides, when Madam Mei

466
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,720
wanted to uncover the truth this time,

467
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,880
she didn't reach out to Xu Zhuo.

468
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,790
There must be some reason

469
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,200
that we don't know about.

470
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,350
If we bring it up

471
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,920
before we fully understand the situation,

472
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
wouldn't Xu Zhuo think

473
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,600
we're investigating him?

474
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,720
I don't think Xu Zhuo would take it that way.

475
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,810
I still think it's better to be cautious.

476
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,880
A little impatience can ruin a big plan.

477
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,550
Let's wait until we've made progress on the case before saying anything.

478
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,070
You can drop me off up ahead.

479
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,270
What are you going to do?

480
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,950
Quanquan's sinusitis is acting up again.

481
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,350
I've been telling him to go to the hospital, but he won't listen.

482
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,230
I'm going to the pharmacy to get him some medicine.

483
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,130
Doesn't he have his own phone?

484
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,300
Why do you have to go buy it for him?

485
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,430
Can't he just order it online?

486
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,990
There's a difference between what I buy and what he buys.

487
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,010
Ugh, you're so cloying.

488
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay, I'll find a place to stop for you.

489
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,990
Stop talking.

490
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,030
Thank you.

491
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:46,800
Bye bye.

492
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,290
Bye bye.

493
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,500
Take care.

494
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,070
Okay.

495
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,140
[Unscrupulous Chen]

496
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,260
Righteous Luo.

497
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,510
Unscrupulous Chen.

498
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,780
Yes, what's up?

499
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,760
Let's meet at the usual spot.

500
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,540
You want to meet me?

501
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,200
If you're willing to admit

502
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,700
it's a date, then I'll go.

503
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,240
Cut the nonsense. Are you coming or not?

504
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,460
Yes.

505
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

506
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,710
Okay, bye bye.

507
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,610
Fang Rui, I'm going out.

508
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,030
Are you going on a date with Ms. Luo?

509
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,150
None of your business.

510
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,270
Mentor,

511
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,160
honestly, I think you and Ms. Luo are a great match.

512
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
She said she's a famous lady,

513
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,880
and I'm a notorious hooligan.

514
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,570
How does that match?

515
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,720
That's exactly why it's a match.

516
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,010
You're right.

517
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,410
Black and white, good and bad, ladies and hooligans—

518
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,070
that's how the world balances out.

519
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,430
Stop focusing on me all the time.

520
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,480
Learn from Yuguo.

521
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,310
Look at him—he went after what he likes.

522
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,030
You've changed your style.

523
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,640
You're dressed up nicely.

524
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,900
Well, I'm the boss now.

525
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,830
A famous lady keeps dating a famous hooligan?

526
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,750
What do you mean?

527
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,640
Do you like me?

528
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,630
Cut the crap.

529
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,440
Let me ask you,

530
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,160
you specifically brought up the Zhucheng Case.

531
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,000
How did you get involved in this?

532
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,070
I heard you're looking into Madam Mei's case.

533
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,530
If someone framed Mei Daliang,

534
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,160
that person must still be at Liangcheng Law Firm.

535
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,390
And the root of it

536
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,220
definitely has nothing to do with the rape case.

537
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,250
Based on my analysis, it's all about the Zhucheng Case.

538
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,620
Chen Shuo, let me remind you kindly.

539
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,650
The three of us lost our jobs

540
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,750
because of this.

541
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,210
Aren't you afraid of getting dragged into it?

542
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,240
If the three of you can start your own businesses,

543
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
do you really think I can't?

544
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,760
Can the three of us be like you?

545
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,790
Don't you even know

546
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,200
how you made all that money?

547
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,790
You're always pushing the boundaries of the law.

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,720
The Zhucheng Case is complicated.

549
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,450
Aren't you afraid someone might catch you slipping

550
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,720
and take you down

551
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,930
like they did to Madam Mei back then?

552
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,950
Don't worry.

553
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,830
I'm meticulous.

554
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
To investigate this case,

555
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,900
I've reviewed all the cases

556
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,240
handled by the partners from two years

557
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,200
before and after the rape case.

558
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,890
They probably have no idea what I'm looking into.

559
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,700
You reviewed all the cases from two whole years?

560
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,070
And why

561
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,550
are you being this meticulous?

562
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,170
For you.

563
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,980
I'm doing this for you.

564
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,770
Stop talking nonsense.

565
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,980
Let me tell you,

566
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,960
I came here specifically today just to tell you—

567
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,110
stay out of this.

568
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,880
Mind your own business.

569
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,860
Okay. Stop dawdling. Got it.

570
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,440
I heard you officially started working at the Zhuoyue Law Firm?

571
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,170
We've officially joined Xu Zhuo's team now.

572
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,400
We're handling

573
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,590
the biggest creditor of Wanhe—Dingxin—alongside him.

574
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,850
The moment we stepped in,

575
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,680
we crushed Liangcheng Law Firm's dream of

576
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,030
becoming the bankruptcy administrator.

577
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,670
We...

578
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,890
Who exactly do you mean by "we"?

579
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,090
Our firm and Mr. Xu's team.

580
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,440
Come on, what's so great about Xu Zhuo?

581
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,070
He just loves showing off;

582
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,550
he's always on TV,

583
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,440
or making videos to post online,

584
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,440
like he's afraid people won't know who he is.

585
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,440
Our firm is newly established,

586
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,240
and working with a team like Mr. Xu's

587
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,520
is a great learning opportunity.

588
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,750
Plus,

589
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,400
this case is going to

590
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,140
make us a pretty nice chunk of money.

591
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,790
How does him being on TV and making videos bother you?

592
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,160
Why don't you talk about

593
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,830
how he's been helping disadvantaged groups consistently for over a decade?

594
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,890
Just that alone

595
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,440
puts him miles ahead of a lot of people.

596
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,190
By "a lot of people," you mean me, don't you?

597
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,590
I never said that.

598
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,170
Wait, Luo Yingzi,

599
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,240
do you know Xu Zhuo?

600
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
You just mentioned pushing the boundaries of the law—

601
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,880
well, let me tell you,

602
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,150
Xu Zhuo

603
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,620
is an expert at that.

604
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,700
You probably don't know this,

605
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,790
but back in the day,

606
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,960
he hired disabled individuals

607
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,110
to issue fake invoices for tax evasion.

608
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,070
He registered several companies,

609
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,270
with all the legal person and financial officers

610
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,500
being disabled people.

611
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,000
But the salaries he paid them

612
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,830
and the social security contributions he made didn't match up at all.

613
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,470
In the end, those disabled employees

614
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,750
sued him for unpaid wages.

615
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,310
You told me you could learn from him;

616
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,140
so what exactly have you learned?

617
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,610
Who's exactly the one pushing the boundaries of the law?

618
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,850
It takes a long process

619
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,760
to build a sound legal system.

620
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,750
Back then, the laws

621
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,560
had plenty of gray areas.

622
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,480
Besides,

623
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,310
do you have any idea how hard it was

624
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,640
to start Zhuoyue Law Firm in those early days?

625
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,260
Do you know?

626
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,790
I don't. As long as you do, that's all that matters.

627
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,590
You've only known him for a few days.

628
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,240
What do you even know about him?

629
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,290
Go on, enlighten me.

630
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,480
Of course I know.

631
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,880
Our firm just established,

632
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,100
and we've already run into all sorts of challenges.

633
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,490
Getting the chance to work with Xu Zhuo

634
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,800
is already a huge stroke of luck.

635
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,000
Without him, we'd probably still be struggling to make ends meet.

636
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,720
Okay.

637
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,680
Luo Yingzi, I've noticed that

638
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,510
ever since you started contacting with Xu Zhuo,

639
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,510
everything about you

640
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,920
has changed—

641
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,830
your way of speaking,

642
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,800
your whole vibe—

643
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,350
honestly, it's not like

644
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:50,920
the Luo Yingzi I used to know.

645
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
You asked me to come today.

646
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,030
Since we've cleared everything up

647
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,030
between us,

648
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,940
I'm telling you now, I'm leaving.

649
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,270
What's going on?

650
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
Are you okay?

651
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,420
I'm trying to talk to you nicely here,

652
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,610
and you're acting all sarcastic.

653
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,350
Mr. Liu, happy cooperation.

654
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,920
Happy cooperation.

655
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,260
As for the remaining 30%,

656
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,310
it'll be paid in full once the payment for the goods comes through on your end.

657
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,920
You and I...

658
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,070
If you break the contract,

659
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,960
it's all laid out clearly in the agreement.

660
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,550
See, everything was going great,

661
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,450
but then you had to go and say something that just killed the mood.

662
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,420
No problem.

663
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,510
Alright, it's settled. I'll treat.

664
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,280
Let's go have a drink.

665
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,650
Don't, brother. You're not local.

666
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,160
Since this is my turf,

667
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,540
let me treat, okay?

668
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,510
-Let me treat.
-Don't try to steal my turn to treat.

669
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,200
Let's go.

670
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,830
Shall we go?

671
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,500
Yes.

672
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,170
Good thing you called me out,

673
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,500
tutoring kids every day is exhausting.

674
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,000
Eat up, or the food will get overcooked.

675
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,630
Xue,

676
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,150
am I really worse than Xu Zhuo?

677
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
He did a bit of charity work,

678
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,750
and it left Luo Yingzi completely smitten.

679
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,050
It's too strange.

680
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,070
You're way worse.

681
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,340
He's gentle, caring, understands women;

682
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,210
how else could he have gotten married three times?

683
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,620
Who wouldn't fall for that?

684
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,560
Who's falling for that?

685
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,670
What's there to be falling for that?

686
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,750
He has been divorced three times.

687
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,640
Statistically speaking,

688
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,110
tell me, what kind of good man is he?

689
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,300
Three divorces isn't that bad,

690
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,560
I've got a buddy who's been divorced five times.

691
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,630
Do you want to compete with this?

692
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,520
Luo Yingzi was divorced too.

693
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,770
Are you done?

694
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,560
I'm treating you to a meal, and you're just here to pick on me.

695
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,880
You're treating me to food,

696
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,200
and you're only ordering a couple of cheap dishes?

697
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,600
How can I not pick on you?

698
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,640
You can order whatever you want,

699
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,820
just say something I wanna hear.

700
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,300
I'm not ordering anymore.

701
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,480
Did Luo Yingzi tell you

702
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,710
she likes Xu Zhuo?

703
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,330
No.

704
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,390
Then what are you complaining about?

705
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,200
She didn't say she likes me.

706
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
She just treats me as her friend.

707
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,290
I'm a man,

708
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,600
why would I go out of my way

709
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,040
just to be this girl's buddy?

710
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,200
Why are you so stubborn?

711
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,440
Going from buddies to lovers

712
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,680
and finally ending up together

713
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,380
is a long process.

714
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,040
Your sister-in-law and I were like this.

715
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,410
You've gotta let the girls

716
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,760
drop their guard completely

717
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,990
before you can make a move.

718
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,150
I just feel like Luo Yingzi...

719
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,770
Anyway, whenever she teams up with Xu Zhuo

720
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,360
and praises him, it just doesn't sit right with me,

721
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,310
and makes me uncomfortable.

722
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,240
She can admire anyone;

723
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,140
why she admires someone so fake and put on a front?

724
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,000
Don't worry.

725
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,780
Someone will definitely help you teach Luo Yingzi a lesson.

726
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,540
Who?

727
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,430
The one who puts on a front.

728
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,120
You don't get it, do you?

729
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,220
Xu Zhuo is not a good man.

730
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,370
Acting all high and mighty every day.

731
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,190
The stuff he's done

732
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,820
might not get him a sentence,

733
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,000
but it's still illegal, right?

734
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,670
He's a lawyer.

735
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,680
A lawyer

736
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,480
who's always working on the edge of the law to make money

737
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,740
and then showing off how miserable he is.

738
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,600
Wait.

739
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,760
Let me tell you,

740
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,880
in today's society,

741
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,760
the ones who are elevated to high status

742
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,950
are often the ones who end up falling the hardest.

743
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,640
Just wait and see.

744
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,030
Well said.

745
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,830
Something will happen to him sooner or later,

746
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,720
-right?
-Well said.

747
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,770
But

748
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,410
it's not really a bad thing.

749
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,200
Luo Yingzi is too idealistic.

750
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,560
Someone like Xu Zhuo really

751
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,320
needs to step in and teach her a lesson.

752
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,430
She needs to be taught a lesson.

753
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,960
She deserves it.

754
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,500
A good sword remains always sharp.

755
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,020
A good sword remains always sharp.

756
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,290
I believe you. Come on.

757
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,190
Just say what you need to say, but no swearing.

758
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,290
Hello.

759
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,150
What?

760
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,530
Okay.

761
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,120
Okay, I'll get it.

762
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,270
I'm leaving.

763
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,640
Are you leaving?

764
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,230
Let me tell you,

765
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,590
the trial notice for the Mingshan case

766
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,130
I'm handling is about to be sent out.

767
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,790
When I walk out of here today,

768
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,350
I'm still poor.

769
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,510
But when I come back,

770
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,320
I'll be rich.

771
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,160
One case makes me financially free right away.

772
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,050
Awesome.

773
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,400
Chen Shuo,

774
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,790
you should think the thing I just said over carefully.

775
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,850
The ones who are elevated to high status are often the ones who end up falling the hardest.

776
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,070
Be careful.

777
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,970
Okay.

778
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,550
Get a designated driver.

779
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,960
You drunk.

780
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,800
Okay, you'll pay the bill.

781
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,660
Look at how impressive Ms. Xia is.

782
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,370
She's got such a commanding presence.

783
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,050
I haven't seen a woman

784
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,810
like her

785
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,120
for so many years.

786
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
She's impressive, right?

787
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,310
A heroine.

788
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,090
A heroine.

789
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,710
She's bold. I'll toast to you.

790
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,240
I must drink liquor.

791
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,170
Applause!

792
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,440
She's impressive.

793
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,750
Applause.

794
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,420
A heroine.

795
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,960
Brothers,

796
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,630
you all can back me up on this.

797
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,110
Mr. Liu has already paid Mr.  Hao

798
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,480
4.2 million yuan.

799
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,350
The agency fee should be 840,000 yuan.

800
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,200
And don't forget the travel expenses—

801
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,070
it wasn't easy for me to gett here.

802
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,550
Totally, it's 1,300...

803
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,370
Fine.

804
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,750
Why the rush? Let's go back and calculate.

805
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Look. Okay.

806
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,240
You're not too drunk, are you?

807
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,790
Yes.

808
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,640
Awesome, right?

809
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,000
My sister's law firm has these three elites.

810
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,640
They're all amazing.

811
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
Good looks and sharp skills.

812
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,550
You're in for a challenge going forward.

813
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,920
Mr. Hao,

814
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,980
you didn't pay Ms. Xia enough.

815
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,800
Ms. Xia, how about this?

816
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,150
Come work for me,

817
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,400
and you can name your price.

818
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,310
You're poaching her right here?

819
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,890
Mr. Liu,

820
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,240
now that you've said that,

821
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,110
I have to toast you.

822
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,500
Bottoms up.

823
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,440
You're good at drinking.

824
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,350
The atmosphere is in place.

825
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,400
The atmosphere is in place. Sit down.

826
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,170
Mr. Liu, you really have an eye for talent.

827
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,920
Indeed.

828
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,860
But I'm indeed a talent.

829
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,640
Of course.

830
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,120
Once I'm done with Mr. Hao's business

831
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,260
and make the money I need to,

832
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,540
I'll come represent you.

833
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,320
I'll wait for you on behalf of our company.

834
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,030
Deal!

835
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,550
Deal!

836
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,770
She has got another business opportunity.

837
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,260
Brother, let's drink.

838
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,510
Come on. Let's drink.

839
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,240
Let's drink.

840
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,960
Come on.

841
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,030
You know why...

842
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,680
I didn't expect that...

843
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,070
Today...

844
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,770
Mr. Hao.

845
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,790
I'll toast you after I finish this.

846
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,480
I've paid you. Where are you going?

847
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,800
Brother, let's drink this first.

848
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,630
Come on.

849
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,510
Okay.

850
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,070
Luo, don't worry.

851
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,210
I'm heading back to Jingbei tomorrow.

852
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,950
I've got all the money back.

853
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,810
I'm drinking with them.

854
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,670
Don't drink too much. Mix it with some water if you need to.

855
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,960
I've told you before, keep your guard up when you're out there.

856
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,610
Don't force yourself with those men.

857
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,000
I know.

858
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,850
Luo, let me ask you,

859
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
are you convinced

860
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,870
when I get the money back this time?

861
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,240
Yes, I am.

862
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,440
Not just me, even Qiu's convinced.

863
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,760
Really?

864
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,310
Don't lie to me.

865
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,840
Don't treat me like a child.

866
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,070
Wait, why would I lie to you?

867
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,190
This is collecting the debt.

868
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,430
We're already in awe of you;

869
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,570
just waiting for you to come back so we can celebrate.

870
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,980
You're in for a big surprise.

871
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,200
I'll wait for your surprise.

872
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,540
Alright.

873
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm hanging up, Luo.

874
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,270
I'm going in.

875
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,090
Bye bye.

876
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,030
Ms. Xia, you're so impressive;

877
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
why are you crying?

878
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,530
Mr. Hao.

879
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,920
You promised inside that

880
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,640
you'd reimburse my travel expenses.

881
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,670
Let me go over the details for you.

882
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,630
The most expensive one is the car rental fee,

883
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,280
then the accommodation and train tickets.

884
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,840
When I was eating ramen on the side of the road,

885
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,480
I even asked the vendor for a receipt.

886
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,949
I've taken pictures of everything.

887
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
Let me show you.

888
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,940
Wait, you don't need to be so serious.

889
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,540
Why not?

890
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,110
Let me make it clear.

891
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,120
The money doesn't include

892
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,790
the costs for Mr. Zhou bringing people to protect me.

893
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,440
The law firm will need to pay

894
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,770
that favor back.

895
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,550
Mr. Hao,

896
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,580
when will you transfer the money to me?

897
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,760
You're impressive.

898
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,250
You've got everything clear and straight.

899
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,440
Of course.

900
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,639
Ms. Xia,

901
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,480
I heard from Zhang Lan that

902
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,240
you were abroad before.

903
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,540
When did you come back?

904
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,030
It's been three years.

905
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,510
I heard

906
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,250
something happened to your dad.

907
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,270
Yes.

908
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,440
I really admire you.

909
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,510
It's true.

910
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,100
You're such a young girl,

911
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,550
pretty,

912
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,800
and looking all fragile,

913
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,230
yet you dared to crawl under someone's car

914
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,950
and take down

915
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,730
those rough guys in no time.

916
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,710
It's all for you, Mr. Hao.

917
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,840
It's all for getting salary from you.

918
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,460
The total is 843,250 yuan.

919
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,850
840,000 yuan is the fee,

920
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,960
♫Clouds♫

921
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,110
and 3,250 yuan is for travel expenses,

922
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,050
mostly the car rental, right?

923
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,710
♫Why are your eyes squinting?♫

924
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,020
Good memory, Mr. Hao.

925
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,270
I've worked so hard to help you collect this debt;

926
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,110
you better treat me right.

927
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,440
♫Awaiting a breeze♫

928
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,440
Of course.

929
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,690
Out of all the lawyers I've met,

930
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,300
I think you are the best.

931
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,190
♫To wake her up♫

932
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,930
I admire you the most.

933
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,690
And I understand you.

934
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,210
I feel like we're pretty alike.

935
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,610
♫The sun on my shoulders♫

936
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,610
♫And the weight of the rain♫

937
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,030
When I was abroad,

938
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,440
♫She never mentioned it♫

939
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,070
I was just drifting through each day.

940
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,070
When my dad died,

941
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,480
I felt like

942
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,280
I was kicked down from the sky straight into the mud.

943
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,110
♫Clouds♫

944
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,350
And now, I have no choice but to come back and clean up

945
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:48,750
♫Floating aimlessly, leaving no trace♫

946
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,880
the mess he left behind.

947
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,460
♫Between the sunshine and rain♫

948
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
We're nothing alike.

949
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
The "mess" you're talking about

950
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,500
♫She comes and goes without a word♫

951
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,460
is a billion-yuan business.

952
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,000
If you recover this debt,

953
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,630
♫The tranquility I’ve grown used to♫

954
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,440
it's a business,

955
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,720
a livelihood,

956
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,830
♫Is the invisible cloud♫

957
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,050
and many people's livelihoods—

958
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,370
enough to support many people.

959
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,910
♫Giving me shade♫

960
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,640
What about you?

961
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,250
What did you take over?

962
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:21,720
♫That piece of pure, soft cloud♫

963
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,510
What I took over is a mess.

964
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,060
♫Supporting the wind and rain♫

965
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,860
♫The tales of sun and rain♫

966
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,340
♫Going back and forth in the darkness♫

967
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,950
But I've accepted it.

968
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,360
♫Silently weaving through♫

969
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,900
Something happened to my dad.

970
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,860
♫A glimmer of light can make it break through♫

971
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,510
I can't count on my mom.

972
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,860
♫That piece of reassuring, heavy cloud♫

973
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,840
But it's okay. I'm fine.

974
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,850
If I can go through the wheel for the first time,

975
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,880
♫Will accept it♫

976
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,660
I can do it twice.

977
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,610
♫The bitterness and mistakes of the world♫

978
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,990
I'm happy

979
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,510
that I can earn money on my own.

980
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:59,700
♫She understands all my clumsiness and persistence♫

981
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,650
♫In our sky♫

982
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,130
♫She will always wait for me♫

983
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,800
Thank you.

984
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,740
Your company is here?

985
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,810
Which floor?

986
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,300
Top floor.

987
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,000
Here, Boss.

988
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,150
Thank you.

989
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,150
Let me help you bring your luggage upstairs.

990
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
It's okay. Give it to me.

991
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,880
Just drop it off here, I'm leaving.

992
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,030
Ms. Xia,

993
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,350
thank you.

994
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,400
Thank you for your hard work these days.

995
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,790
It's okay.

996
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,530
Remember to transfer the money to me.

997
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,600
Luo, I just got back to the office.

998
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,290
You're both not here?

999
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
You're both at work?

1000
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,720
You're back already?

1001
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,390
I came to Mr. Zhou's place;

1002
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,330
I have something to take care of.

1003
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,970
Alright, you go home first.

1004
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,850
I've left some food in the fridge for you.

1005
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,980
What about Qiu?

1006
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,780
Are we still having dinner together tonight?

1007
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,190
Luo, you promised yesterday that

1008
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,530
you'd throw me a celebration dinner.

1009
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,590
How about I book a restaurant first?

1010
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,420
Qiu Hua went to meet with the representative.

1011
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,810
How about this: once we're done with work in a couple of days,

1012
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
we'll celebrate for you.

1013
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,770
Okay.

1014
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,020
Luo,

1015
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,970
let me report my work to you again.

1016
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,270
The case with Hao Lei that our firm took on

1017
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,600
can earn us over 800,000 yuan, 840,000 yuan to be exact.

1018
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,810
I knew you could do it.

1019
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,420
Has the money been received?

1020
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,560
It doesn't count before it's paid.

1021
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,030
I haven't received the money yet,

1022
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,350
but we've made the contract.

1023
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,100
I'll follow up in a couple of days.

1024
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,030
Okay, follow up on payment.

1025
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I can't talk to you right now.

1026
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,280
Mr. Zhou will be here soon. Bye bye.

1027
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,110
Okay. Go back to work.

1028
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,070
Sister.

1029
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,840
Mr. Zhou.

1030
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,900
What's the matter again?

1031
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,620
I'm here

1032
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,770
not to trouble you today;

1033
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,070
I'm here to thank you.

1034
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,070
If you pull something like this again, I'm gonna be upset.

1035
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,880
You've done me such a huge favor, and I can't just let it go.

1036
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,480
If I don't repay you,

1037
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,110
I won't even know how to face you next time.

1038
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm here today

1039
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,950
to offer you a hand.

1040
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,440
Let's sit down and talk.

1041
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,320
Sit down.

1042
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,800
Mr. Zhou,

1043
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,810
your business

1044
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,850
has stayed safe

1045
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,090
because you know

1046
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,810
where the legal lines are, right?

1047
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,950
But the legal system

1048
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,390
is constantly evolving and improving.

1049
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,470
Being safe today

1050
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,510
and yesterday

1051
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,670
doesn't mean

1052
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,980
you'll stay safe forever.

1053
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,540
I know there are a lot of things

1054
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,510
you don't want others to find out about.

1055
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,110
I don't want to know either.

1056
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,800
Yes.

1057
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,570
After all, I used to

1058
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,600
want to keep my distance from you

1059
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,260
to some extent.

1060
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,510
No.

1061
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,150
But now, you've done me

1062
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,590
two huge favors.

1063
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,390
If I were to distance myself from you now,

1064
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,760
that would be my fault.

1065
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,160
Since we're being straight with each other,

1066
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,320
whatever you say, I'm listening.

1067
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,970
That's why I'm here today.

1068
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,560
I'm currently handling a case

1069
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,190
for an economic chain store.

1070
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,230
This chain

1071
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,150
has around 40-50 stores

1072
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,590
in Jingbei and several major cities,

1073
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,710
and its assets are really solid.

1074
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,780
But due to its rapid expansion,

1075
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,230
the cash flow broke down.

1076
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,510
To pay off the debts,

1077
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,980
they're forced to sell at a low price.

1078
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,810
Mr. Zhou, have you ever thought about changing industries?

1079
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,510
If you are considering it,

1080
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,600
I think this could be a really good opportunity.
