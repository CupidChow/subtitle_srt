00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,880
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,039
Even if he wants to go back to his hometown

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,680
to develop his career,

5
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,550
he'll still need your help, right?

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,710
Of course.

7
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,740
But Dad,

8
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,300
you're almost 60 years old.

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,590
And you're about to retire.

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,150
You've worked in the county for most of your life.

11
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,280
There are people who support you,

12
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,680
but there must also be those who disagree with you

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,950
or secretly envy you.

14
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,560
When you retire,

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
they might direct their revenge

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,500
at Quanquan.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,760
If Quanquan doesn't handle it well,

18
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,870
it could bring trouble to you.

19
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,100
Quanquan and I have already discussed it.

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,960
We will rely on our own abilities

21
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,380
to make our way in Jingbei.

22
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,630
Even if he spends his whole life as just a clerk

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,710
and never gets promoted to section chief,

24
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,060
I won't despise him.

25
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,960
As long as he doesn't abandon me,

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll always be with him.

27
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,360
He really doesn't have to

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,870
go back to his hometown

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,060
to be by your side

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,640
and live off your support and protection.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,590
Actually, I've thought about this too.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,850
That's why I agreed to let Quanquan stay in Jingbei back then.

33
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,329
That's all I wanted to say today.

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,710
I can rest assured with you two now.

35
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,910
Qiu Hua,

36
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,800
Quanquan was lucky

37
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,130
to marry you,

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,220
and it's also a blessing for our family.

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,990
Dad, don't say that.

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,410
Dad, I brought these from downstairs.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,360
They're definitely not as good as what you eat at home.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Please make do with it.

43
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,230
This is the best.

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,900
Ever since I've gained a bit of weight,

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,020
I started controlling my diet

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,160
and stopped eating junk food.

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,140
I've been keeping my meals simple.

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,410
You know what?

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,270
Now, I go straight home after work.

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,080
A bowl of porridge and a bite of side dishes

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,910
make me feel

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,079
so comfortable.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,329
-Dad, here's the spoon.
-But Quanquan,

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
there are only three of us today.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,020
You ordered too much. It's a waste.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,240
Alright, Dad. I won't do it next time.

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,820
Look at Dad.

58
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,560
He has great self-control.

59
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,310
Dad,

60
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,829
are we going there tomorrow?

61
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,680
I made an appointment with his secretary for tomorrow.

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,800
But his secretary said

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,990
his meeting may not end at a fixed time,

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,079
so we should go early and wait there.

65
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,150
Where are we going?

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
You don't know.

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,120
One of Dad's former colleagues

68
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,800
has transferred to Jingbei.

69
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
Now he's a deputy department director-level official, right?

70
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,250
Dad said we're meeting him tomorrow.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,190
For what?

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,880
Nothing.

73
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,410
He just wants to introduce me to him.

74
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,900
Dad, are you going to see him for Quanquan?

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,870
I'm not in Jingbei.

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,310
It's fine to introduce him

77
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,370
to some leaders.

78
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,750
Did you bring it up?

79
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,250
We don't have connections or background in Jingbei.

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
And since Dad is here for the meeting,

81
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,970
I just casually brought it up.

82
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,310
The more people we know,

83
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,480
the smoother the road ahead,

84
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,390
right, Dad?

85
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,800
Yes.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,230
Let's not force it.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
Dad,

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,450
although he used to be your colleague,

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,840
times have changed.

90
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,840
He's now a deputy department director.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,630
Maybe he's afraid that

92
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,680
old colleagues or acquaintances coming to him

93
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,210
for favors might put him in a difficult position.

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,700
Besides,

95
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,710
even if you go to him,

96
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,560
will he really help you?

97
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,870
Not to mention that you're no longer colleagues.

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,390
Quanquan's matter has nothing to do with him.

99
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,800
You can't expect him

100
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,720
to promote him

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,230
just because you had a chat, right?

102
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,680
Well, this is how I see it.

103
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,700
I think

104
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,450
it's always better to know more people than to know fewer.

105
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,970
What do you think?

106
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,120
Dad,

107
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,830
is it appropriate?

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
Since you've decided to stay in Jingbei,

109
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,130
we want to help you when we can.

110
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,530
As for the rest,

111
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,430
it depends on his abilities.

112
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,950
I will work hard, Dad.

113
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,840
The love of parents for their children is universal.

114
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,580
A county party secretary, who's about to retire,

115
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,600
traveled all the way

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,900
to his former colleague's office to wait for a meeting.

117
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,920
You should understand his dad's good intentions.

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,390
Because his dad

119
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,659
has been in the political world for most of his life.

120
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,360
If he could really see that person,

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,830
he'd know better than anyone

122
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,280
whether he could actually help his son.

123
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
But on the other hand,

124
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,030
if someone could really get promoted this way,

125
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,140
they definitely wouldn't be able to hold onto the position anyway.

126
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes.

127
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,800
When one's abilities don't match their position, it will surely bring disaster.

128
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,600
Quanquan's abilities

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,560
are probably limited to being an ordinary clerk,

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,560
working his way up by seniority.

131
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,720
At most, he might become a section chief or division chief.

132
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,940
But if he were to be promoted

133
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,770
through someone's favor,

134
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,190
who knows what might happen.

135
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,200
Thank you.

136
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,850
Thank you.

137
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,350
Mr. Xu.

138
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,409
You're here.

139
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,770
Come in, please.

140
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,990
Okay, thank you.

141
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,120
Have a seat.

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,290
Liangcheng Law Firm has already prepared the seal and opened the account,

143
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,390
starting the administrator's work.

144
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,950
I guess the court will soon

145
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,630
receive their work plan.

146
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,510
As the largest creditor of Wanhe,

147
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,950
we must also start following up immediately.

148
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,200
First, we need to supervise the administrator's work,

149
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,250
and second, we need to organize the creditor claims

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
and protect Dingxin's interests.

151
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,510
Yingzi, Ms. Qiu,

152
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,650
as you said,

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,610
at this stage,

154
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,080
we don't need to do much work.

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,450
Two people are enough.

156
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,250
Can you go over there?

157
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,690
We should probably also sort out the debt transactions

158
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
between Dingxin and Wanhe, right?

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,130
Of course. What I've said already includes that.

160
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,160
Actually, you don't need to keep an eye

161
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,630
on the administrator's office all the time.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,770
It might make us seem distrustful of Liangcheng Law Firm.

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,390
You can spend half your time there

164
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,700
and half your time at Dingxin,

165
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,560
assisting the finance and audit teams

166
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,240
to clear up the past accounts. Is that alright?

167
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,830
Okay, no problem.

168
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,720
I've already told you

169
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,430
that you'll see

170
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,560
the strength of me and Qiu Hua.

171
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,250
I've seen it.

172
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,510
Our firm recently took on two new cases,

173
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,390
and we're short on staff.

174
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,720
This work

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,190
will mainly be handled by the three of us—

176
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,640
mainly you two, with me in a supporting role.

177
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,500
Are you doing it personally?

178
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,720
It's an honor for me to work

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,570
with two young

180
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,670
and outstanding lawyers.

181
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,510
Thank you.

182
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,210
The management team of Liangcheng Law Firm

183
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,290
will be having a meeting at Wanhe Group today.

184
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,100
I've been notified.

185
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,270
I'll grab my stuff

186
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,700
and then we can head over together.

187
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,570
Okay.

188
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,970
Apologies for being late.

189
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,210
Now that everyone's here, let's start the meeting.

190
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,919
[Wanhe Group First Administrator Team Meeting]

191
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,549
[Wanhe Group]

192
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Today is the first meeting of our administrator team

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,870
after entering Wanhe.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
Let's go home. It's 8 o'clock.

195
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,110
It's 8 o'clock?

196
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,010
Really.

197
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,020
I didn't even notice.

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,250
Of course.

199
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,570
You're so motivated in your work now.

200
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
Qiu Hua, you're being naughty now.

201
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,850
You're making fun of me.

202
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,840
Wait for me.

203
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,650
I just have one last one to finish up.

204
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay.

205
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,270
Thank you for your hard work. Go home and have a rest now.

206
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,450
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,620
Alright.

208
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
You're still here?

209
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,430
Mr. Xu.

210
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,260
You're so diligent.

211
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,640
Didn't we go to Wanhe this morning?

212
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,240
We only started after we got back in the afternoon.

213
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,360
By the way, Mr. Xu,

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,630
this afternoon,

215
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,850
I called Mr. Liu

216
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
to ask for his opinion on the scope

217
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,440
and focus of the preliminary work.

218
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,160
What he's most worried about right now

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,770
is being taken advantage of by Wanhe,

220
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,080
and that large debts won't be recognized or realized.

221
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,320
So, he wants us to focus

222
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
on the few large contracts that Dingxin and Wanhe

223
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,960
haven't fully performed,

224
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,550
and we should direct our main efforts at monitoring the administrator,

225
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,100
not wasting time on small amounts.

226
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,400
But I think,

227
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,200
since the creditor's claims are being consolidated and declared together,

228
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,750
every claim should be backed

229
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,150
with solid evidence.

230
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,290
If there's a minor mistake

231
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,650
in the declaration documents

232
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,950
and it gets caught,

233
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,630
we not only won't be able to explain ourselves,

234
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,560
but it will also be detrimental to the realization of our rights.

235
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,580
What do you think?

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,290
I think the core issue

237
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,220
is not about the amount

238
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,390
of money,

239
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,010
but whether our evidence

240
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,200
is solid enough.

241
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,290
The administrator is neutral

242
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,630
and won't target large creditors specifically.

243
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,920
On the contrary, if our evidence

244
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,180
isn't solid enough,

245
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,630
we won't have a solid basis

246
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,240
when we assert our rights later.

247
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,250
So we need to go over

248
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,310
all the transactions.

249
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,080
Mr. Xu, you're absolutely right.

250
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,960
Now we understand it much better.

251
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,810
Right, Qiu Hua?

252
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,090
Rome wasn't built in a day.

253
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,430
You should go home and get some rest.

254
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
What about you? You're off work now too, aren't you?

255
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
This law firm is just like my home.

256
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,000
In the evening, I like to write and read

257
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,890
in my office.

258
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,690
Alright, go home and rest now.

259
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,990
-Okay, Mr. Xu.
-Bye.

260
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,640
Let's go.

261
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,080
Thanks.

262
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,410
Drive carefully.

263
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,990
Qiu Hua.

264
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,580
I want to ask you something.

265
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,390
You...

266
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,570
Are you sleepy?

267
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,300
No. Why?

268
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,670
Then...

269
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,890
how about we go have a drink?

270
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,800
Look at Mr. Xu.

271
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,710
He finds something to do

272
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,910
when he has nothing to do at night,

273
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,960
like reading and writing.

274
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,870
We're just ordinary folks.

275
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,340
Let's find something to do too.

276
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,790
Let's go for a drink.

277
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm not going. you go ahead.

278
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,280
Quanquan is waiting for me at home.

279
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,320
Are you implying that I have no one at my home?

280
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,090
Alright, go ahead. See you tomorrow.

281
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,290
Drive carefully.

282
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,590
Say hello to your husband for me.

283
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,940
Bye.

284
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,970
The night is long.

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,050
I don't want to sleep.

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There's no one at home. I'm alone.

287
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,230
Let's go.

288
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:03,680

Mr. Xu.

299
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,840
I have nothing to do at home.

300
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,870

The defendant, Minghai Steel Group Co., Ltd.,

349
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,450
shall pay the plaintiff, Mingshan Mining Group Co., Ltd.,

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,970
the amount of 56.84 million yuan for ore

and 17 million yuan in late payment penalties

352

If dissatisfied with this judgment,

357
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,920
an appeal can be submitted to this court within 15 days

358
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,960
from the date of receipt of the judgment

359
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,860
to appeal to the Jingbei City Intermediate People's Court.

360
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,950
Mr. Chen,

361
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,780
not only have you saved our family,

362
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,600
but also our Mingshan Group

363
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,790
and all its

364
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,350
employees.

365
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I must set up a memorial for you

366
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,960
and place it at home to honor you.

367
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,110
No, no, no, setting up a memorial tablet for me

368
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,880
would be a curse, Mr. Sun.

369
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,000
Mr. Sun.

370
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,800
The reason we won this time

371
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,160
was actually due to the solid work

372
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,720
we did in the early stages.

373
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,130
Yes.

374
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,470
We carefully organized

375
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,920
every payment,

376
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,830
every invoice in their contracts,

377
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,590
and even every shipping order,

378
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,510
making sure everything was clear and precise.

379
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,070
Yes, take care.

380
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,720
You too.

381
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,510
Okay.

382
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,000
So, it was almost impossible for us to lose this lawsuit.

383
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,470
However,

384
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
the work that follows is also very challenging.

385
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,240
What do you mean?

386
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,790
Mr. Han.

387
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,950
Mr. Sun, here's the thing.

388
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,100
First,

389
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,290
aside from the lawyer and two accountants,

390
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,070
they didn't even send a representative with authorization.

391
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,020
Clearly, they didn't take the first trial seriously.

392
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,750
If they appeal,

393
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,260
the second trial will definitely be more difficult.

394
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,760
So we need to work even harder,

395
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,740
considering all possibilities,

396
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,840
and prepare thoroughly. Right?

397
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,490
Second,

398
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,120
we need to prepare for what comes

399
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,100
after the substantive trial.

400
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,200
Winning the lawsuit was hard,

401
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,980
but securing the results after winning is even harder.

402
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,590
Besides the seized assets,

403
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,750
we must hurry to investigate

404
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,990
their asset situation

405
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,400
to prepare for future enforcement.

406
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,220
Yes.

407
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,160
If this judgment

408
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,820
becomes a debt certificate,

409
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,480
it won't solve Mingshan's crisis.

410
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,420
Well said.

411
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,670
Alright, I'll listen to you.

412
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll listen to you.

413
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,880
Mr. Sun.

414
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,030
As long as you listen to us,

415
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,680
everything will be fine.

416
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:26,960
Okay.

417
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,920
Let's keep in touch, alright?

418
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,550
Okay.

419
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,720
I'll leave you to your work.

420
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,550
I'm leaving.

421
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,550
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

422
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
I'll treat you to a meal.

423
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,400
-I'm leaving.
-Thank you.

424
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,960
Take care.

425
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,720
-Bye.
-Okay.

426
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,350
Just invite Mr. Chen.

427
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:37,920
No, no, no.

428
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,750
You should come together.

429
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,440
Mr. Han.

430
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,870
That was a good reaction.

431
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,510
Your organizational skills, sense of order, and logic

432
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,380
are impressive.

433
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,600
Just wait to collect the money.

434
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,350
Mr. Chen,

435
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,960
are you preparing for the second trial?

436
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,190
Yes.

437
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,650
I think,

438
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,750
compared to preparing for the second trial,

439
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,310
we need to be careful of them trying to deceive us.

440
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,490
Deceive us?

441
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,750
Isn't it obvious?

442
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,960
You see, the opposing lawyer basically

443
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,410
said nothing in court.

444
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
As long as we present the evidence,

445
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,920
they'll know that even if this case

446
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,260
goes to the United Nations, we'll win.

447
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,960
So, I think we need to be cautious of them

448
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,490
pulling tricks behind our backs,

449
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,300
and prepare in advance.

450
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,750
It's true what they say: "With age comes wisdom," Mr. Han.

451
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,350
But you forgot,

452
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
in our contract with them,

453
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,750
there's a clause

454
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,920
specifically to prevent them from doing this, right?

455
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,850
Think about that time I lowered the commission by 10%.

456
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,450
That clause!

457
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,110
You've been prepared for this, haven't you?

458
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,020
You're the real expert here.

459
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,510
I learned from you.

460
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,720
Alright then.

461
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,110
-As long as you know what to do.
-Okay.

462
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,200
I'll get back to work.

463
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,910
Don't worry, Mr. Han.

464
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,400
Okay.

465
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,110
See you at the firm.

466
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,750
Bye.

467
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,790
Mentor.

468
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,110
You're amazing.

469
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,160
What do you mean?

470
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,550
Are you saying I'm good at making money?

471
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,720
This lawsuit was handled really impressively.

472
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,330
It was because of money.

473
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,810
Get in the car, and let's do some calculations.

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,890
Okay.

475
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,630
8% of 56.84 million,

476
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,590
plus 50%

477
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,510
of the 17 million late fee,

478
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,240
minus 20% to be handed over,

479
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,960
and 20% for Han.

480
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,750
It's 8.35 million.

481
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,030
8.35 million, then after tax,

482
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,860
minus the costs from the earlier stages,

483
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,400
it's still a pretty good amount. It's several million.

484
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,910
This case made me

485
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,950
several million just like that. Not bad.

486
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,030
And there's your 10% in it.

487
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,350
I can't accept it, Mentor.

488
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,500
I didn't do anything.

489
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,520
I just typed for you,

490
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,220
and you didn't even use it.

491
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Besides, you've already given me a lot of money

492
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,680
for the first few cases.

493
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,510
I've been eating meat.

494
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,060
Shouldn't I let my disciple have some soup?

495
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,920
Mentor,

496
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,750
actually, since I came to Liangcheng Law Firm,

497
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,110
I've known that everyone looks down on me.

498
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,260
It might be because of my aunt.

499
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,550
I just want to say,

500
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,850
working with you has been the happiest time

501
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,750
in my two years since graduating.

502
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,510
Really.

503
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,040
Could you stop looking at me so intensely?

504
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
We're both men.

505
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,590
You're looking at me so intensely,

506
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,990
and it's giving me goosebumps.

507
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,330
Got it.

508
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,030
You go up first. I need to go out.

509
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,500
Okay.

510
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,510
Go and find Ms. Luo.

511
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,570
None of your business.

512
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,470
-Bye.
-Riches that don't return to one's hometown

513
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,740
are like fine clothes worn at night.

514
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,790
Righteous Luo.

515
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,920
[Unscrupulous Chen]

516
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,870
Unscrupulous Chen?

517
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,310
I almost forgot

518
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,790
that there's this guy in this world.

519
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Hello, Unscrupulous Chen.

520
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,550
Righteous Luo.

521
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,880
Does a righteous person need to eat?

522
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,360
What do you mean?

523
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,200
It means I'll treat you to a meal.

524
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,160
You pick the restaurant

525
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,010
and the dishes, alright?

526
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,030
Did you rob a bank?

527
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,370
Pretty much.

528
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,830
Anyway, I made over 8 million

529
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,480
from one case.

530
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,300
What?

531
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,830
What kind of case makes 8 million?

532
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,030
What kind of client is that?

533
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,590
Let's talk in person.

534
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,440
Are you going or not?

535
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,230
Yes. Why not?

536
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,230
Who wouldn't eat for free?

537
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,770
Qiu Hua, let's go.

538
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,770
Where? What are we eating? What time?

539
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,310
I'm kind of busy right now.

540
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,920
I don't know when I'll be done.

541
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,920
How about this? I'll let you know when I'm almost finished,

542
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,370
and then you can come and pick me up at Zhuoyue Law Firm.

543
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,540
Zhuoyue Law Firm?

544
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,680
Luo Yingzi, are you serious?

545
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,160
Are you really working at Xu's Law Firm?

546
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,500
What? Chen Shuo, are you serious?

547
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,000
He has a name.

548
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,290
Can you show some respect?

549
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,250
I don't want to talk about him.

550
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,340
What do you want to eat? I'll decide.

551
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,270
See you later.

552
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,720
This is something quite pleasant,

553
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,160
but she brought up Xu Zhuo. So frustrating.

554
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,470
Is there fairness in this world?

555
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,430
Just because someone can make big money, does that mean there's no fairness anymore?

556
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,070
But we're the ones who are exhausted,

557
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,510
with sore backs and aching legs,

558
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,070
working 12 to 13 hours a day.

559
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,660
What did he do that he can earn 8 million from a single case?

560
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,320
That's his ability.

561
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,200
As for our project with Mr. Xu,

562
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
our agent fees will be

563
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,940
at most 10 million.

564
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,500
The amount we each get will be less than half of what Chen Shuo earned.

565
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,560
This shows that Chen Shuo is more capable than Xu Zhuo.

566
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,520
I don't like what you said.

567
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's not even talk about Mr. Xu.

568
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,830
Just look at us.

569
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,270
How are we worse than Chen Shuo?

570
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,680
So what if he made money?

571
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,360
He even called me specifically to show off to me.

572
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,560
It's so annoying.

573
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,150
If it's so annoying, then don't go and eat with him.

574
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,270
Well, it's annoying,

575
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,320
but I'm still going.

576
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,400
Not only am I going to eat,

577
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,830
but I'm also going to make sure I spend a million of his.

578
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,770
I'll make him suffer.

579
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,770
I'm suffering.

580
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,720
Mr. Chen, you're here.

581
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,460
Please come in.

582
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,010
Okay.

583
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,030
Mr. Chen.

584
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,920
Look.

585
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,260
This table has the best view.

586
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,810
That one?

587
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
The lighting will look even better in the evening.

588
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,980
The view is quite expansive.

589
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,050
I'll go with this one.

590
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,110
Okay.

591
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,160
Allen,

592
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,510
bring the menu for Mr. Chen to take a look at.

593
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,190
You have blood swallow's nest?

594
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,970
Yes.

595
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,940
As long as you have blood swallow's nest.

596
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,270
The dishes are fine.

597
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,460
If you want to book this table,

598
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,550
you'll need to pay a 1,000 yuan deposit.

599
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,200
Do I need to pay now?

600
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,100
Scan the code?

601
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,560
Okay.

602
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,300
Okay.

603
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,850
Okay.

604
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,630
1000.

605
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,640
I've transferred it.

606
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,440
Check it.

607
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,940
See you at 7 p.m.

608
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,320
Okay, take care, Mr. Chen.

609
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,540
Okay, thank you. Bye.

610
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:17,910
See you.

612
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,960
Mr. Chen.

613
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,680
Ms. Qiu?

614
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
Are you waiting for Luo Yingzi?

615
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,710
Good luck.

616
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,350
Thank you.

617
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,160
Thank you.

618
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,480
Have you dressed enough?

619
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,340
Yes.

620
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,460
Mr. Chen.

621
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,090
Why are you here?

622
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,230
I'm waiting for Luo Yingzi.

623
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,030
I forgot it.

624
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,020
I'll have to cancel today.

625
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,160
We have an appointment with Mr. Liu from Dingxin for dinner.

626
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,270
Didn't we already agree?

627
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,040
Yes, I...

628
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,150
If you've already made an appointment,

629
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,110
I'll go on my own.

630
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,930
It's fine, Mr. Xu. I'll go with you.

631
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,880
Well, Chen Shuo, I...

632
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,550
Let's do it next time.

633
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,480
Mr. Chen, I'll treat you to a meal another day.

634
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,030
Let's go.

635
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,520
Okay.

636
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm leaving now. Let's do it next time.

637
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,350
Mr. Xu,

638
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,970
I'll drive behind you.

639
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,510
It's fine. You can just take my car.

640
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,200
Take my car.

641
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,330

Morning, Mentor.

672
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,690
How was it yesterday?

673
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,440
Not great.

674
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,440
You didn't win her over.

675
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,680
If you had, you wouldn't be so down.

676
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,310
Why?

677
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,410
You showed off

678
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,470
when you made a bit of money.

679
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,680
You're really something.

680
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,080
You call over 8 million "a bit of money."

681
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,630
So you must have seen a lot of money before.

682
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,740
I didn't mean that.

683
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,960
Compared to love, isn't it a bit of money?

684
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,990
Don't worry.

685
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,080
You'll win Ms. Luo over sooner or later.

686
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,350
I hope you're right.

687
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,610
Of course it is.

688
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,830
If Ms. Luo doesn't fancy you,

689
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,000
she must be blind.

690
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,970
I'm starting to suspect that she has poor eyesight.

691
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,280
It's just a matter of time.

692
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,840
Don't get discouraged, Mentor.

693
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,880
Be patient.

694
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,150
Be patient.

695
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,600
I've been chasing her for so long.

696
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,200
Here!

697
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,130
Senior.

698
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,240
Have you been waiting long?

699
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,960
No.

700
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,590
You look really handsome.

701
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,580
A three-piece coat set. Impressive.

702
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,790
You are not a good friend.

703
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,440
After the alumni meeting last time,

704
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
you didn't contact me.

705
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,420
Senior,

706
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,700
you didn't leave us your contact either.

707
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,230
You didn't friend me on WeChat.

708
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
How was I supposed to contact you?

709
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,720
Are you blaming me?

710
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,440
No, no, no.

711
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,920
Senior, I'm not.

712
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,440
You're blaming me.

713
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,720
No, no, no. Really.

714
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,480
We drank together last time

715
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,510
and got a bit dizzy.

716
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,280
We didn't think of friending each other

717
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,510
on WeChat. Come on, let's do it now.

718
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,240
Yes, yes, yes, let's do it now.

719
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,200
You scan my code.

720
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,460
I'll scan yours.

721
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,680
Okay.

722
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,870
Okay.

723
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,720
Xu Feng.

724
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,560
What?

725
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,600
Xu Feng.

726
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,850
Of course I know your surname is Xu.

727
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,310
Are you kidding me?

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,510
Last time, I forgot to ask which firm you work at.

729
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,380
Zhuoyue Law Firm.

730
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,720
Zhuoyue?

731
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,310
That founder...

732
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,270
the lawyer's name

733
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,810
is Xu… Xu what?

734
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,310
Mr. Xu Zhuo.

735
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,560
Right, right, Mr. Xu Zhuo. Zhuoyue Law Firm.

736
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,030
Yes.

737
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,790
That's a big firm. You've got a bright future ahead of you.

738
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,360
Me? What future?

739
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,020
I can tell just by the way you dress.

740
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,310
I heard your firm

741
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,700
recently took on a big case.

742
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,320
Don't mention it.

743
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
We did,

744
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,920
representing Dingxin Group.

745
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,890
But it has nothing to do with us.

746
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,810
Mr. Xu didn't even let us get a piece of the cake,

747
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,940
let alone a sip of soup.

748
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,720
He brought in two lawyers from outside to join the team,

749
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,490
and they're handling most of the work.

750
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,280
Weird.

751
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,470
Isn't there an old saying that resources shouldn't be given to outsiders?

752
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
Why didn't he give such a good case to his own people

753
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,950
but to outsiders?

754
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,440
Why?

755
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,870
Two women.

756
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,190
Forget about keeping the resources to ourselves;

757
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,600
he's just giving them away. 40%.

758
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,610
Why?

759
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,720
Is he crazy? 40%?

760
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,980
That's a huge profit.

761
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,100
I've been working at this firm

762
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,960
for three years,

763
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,440
and still stuck in the open office area.

764
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,790
I can't even get a private office.

765
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,510
As soon as these two came,

766
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,750
they were directly assigned an office,

767
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,570
and no one from outside can get in.

768
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,680
Mr. Xu Zhuo's reputation is well-known.

769
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,770
He has divorced 3 times.

770
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,210
Now, for no reason, he gave those two female lawyers

771
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,640
their own office

772
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,070
and promised them a 40% commission.

773
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
Do you get it?

774
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,240
I didn't say that.

775
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,000
I said it. I, your senior, said it.

776
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,580
Come on.

777
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,730
Put the invoice under this name.

778
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,750
No, no, no, let me pay.

779
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,250
What are you doing? I've paid, Brother.

780
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,390
Isn't it a bit ridiculous?

781
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,830
When a senior treats you to a meal,

782
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,380
you don't need to be so polite.

783
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,820
You've got a beer belly now.

784
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,930
You're too young for that.

785
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,760
This is called "overtime fat."

786
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,840
Working for Mr. Xu is too tough.

787
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,090
We're always working overtime.

788
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,480
That's not an excuse.

789
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,600
You've got to exercise a bit.

790
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,470
Lately, I've gotten into archery.

791
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,720
It's pretty cool.

792
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Let's do it together sometime.

793
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,510
I've heard of archery.

794
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,880
But it's very expensive.

795
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,830
I have a card. You can use my card.

796
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,530
Let's exercise together.

797
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,240
Okay.

798
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm leaving now.

799
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:16,960
Okay.

800
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,400
I'm heading back to the firm.

801
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,000
Okay.

802
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,240
Let's keep in touch.

803
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Okay.

804
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,480
I'm leaving.

805
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,590
-You've been drinking. You should call a designated driver.
-Okay.

806
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,310
No problem.

807
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm leaving.

808
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,070
Hello, Sir, here's your receipt.

809
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,070
Okay, thank you.

810
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,550
Your name card.

811
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,950
40%?

812
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,760
And a private office?

813
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,670
He divorced three times.

814
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,080
It's not easy to handle.

815
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Xue, come out and hang with me.

816
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,620
See you at the cafe.

817
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,030
Be generous in the future.

818
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,440
Don't always take the girls to fancy restaurants

819
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,060
and treat me to coffee.

820
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,840
Don't pull a long face. Smile.

821
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,910
How did I become like this?

822
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,480
From childhood until now, besides myself,

823
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,630
who have I been in love with?

824
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,030
Besides,

825
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,850
compared to the girls I've dated before,

826
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,060
Luo Yingzi is nothing.

827
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,630
Yes.

828
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,530
My other girlfriends

829
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,070
were so young and beautiful.

830
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,880
That's right.

831
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,610
Then why are you like this?

832
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,870
I don't know. I just can't describe the feeling.

833
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,020
What feeling?

834
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,739
I feel empty here.

835
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,969
You feel empty here?

836
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,840
Just block it off from this side.

837
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,320
Alright, Brother.

838
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,880
Can you stop teasing me?

839
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,440
What should I say?

840
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,800
Now, Luo Yingzi is commuting with that Mr. Xu

841
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
every day.

842
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,290
How do you feel when the girl you like

843
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,920
is spending time with someone like him

844
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,040
all the time?

845
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,070
It bothers me, of course.

846
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,670
It's strange.

847
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,090
Why do good girls always end up with pigs?

848
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,630
Are you showing off that you're a lawyer who's good with words

849
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,110
and accurate in descriptions?

850
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,630
I said she's a good girl.

851
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,860
I didn't say she's a pig.

852
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,030
I've done so much for her.

853
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
Why can't Luo Yingzi see it?

854
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,070
Doesn't she realize I exist?

855
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,060
Chen Shuo,

856
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,660
Let me give you a few words.

857
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,270
Go ahead.

858
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,070
You deserve it.

859
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,350
You've dated too many girls in the past.

860
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,310
This is karma.

861
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
The more you're like this,

862
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,420
the less likely you are to win Luo Yingzi over.

863
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,320
Karma?

864
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,830
That makes sense.

865
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,120
That makes sense, Bro.

866
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,150
Accept your fate.

867
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,000
Listen.

868
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,070
Are you busy?

869
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,180
I'm back.

870
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,110
You had a long lunch break today.

871
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,910
I had a lunch appointment.

872
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,070
Well...

873
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,630
you know Chen Shuo, right?

874
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,550
Our old alumnus,

875
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,670
the one from Liangcheng Law Firm?

876
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,870
Yes.

877
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,920
Let me tell you.

878
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,650
At the last alumni gathering,

879
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,940
I stood up to say hello to him,

880
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,250
but he ignored me.

881
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,960
I don't know where he got my number from,

882
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,720
but he insisted on having a meal with me.

883
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,070
Why did he want to see you?

884
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,210
Nothing.

885
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,730
He just asked a lot about Mr. Xu

886
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,320
and the two new female lawyers here.

887
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
Does one of those two female lawyers

888
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,440
have something to do with him?

889
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,940
If so,

890
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,920
it must be Ms. Luo.

891
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,040
Didn't

892
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,700
Qiu already get married?

893
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,890
But even if Ms. Luo has something to do with him,

894
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,360
what did he want to ask you about?

895
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,530
How would I know?

896
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,970
He asked a lot of questions.

897
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,300
I get it now.

898
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
The meal,

899
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,440
from start to finish,

900
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,810
was just him asking about Mr. Xu

901
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,590
and those two female lawyers.

902
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,750
I guess

903
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,270
he's interested in one of them,

904
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,600
but he's worried

905
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,890
that Mr. Xu might be interested in her too.

906
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,400
Okay, then take another look at the documents.

907
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,110
We'll meet with Mr. Liu in a couple of days.

908
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,070
Alright, Mr. Xu.

909
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,510
I'll go back to work now.

910
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,720
Mr. Xu, I went out for lunch.

911
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,490
Mr. Xu.

912
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,840
Do you think Ms. Luo

913
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,590
might be interested in our...

914
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,360
It's uncertain who is interested in whom.

915
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,510
He's been

916
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,280
through three wives.

917
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,870
By the way, now that you mention it,

918
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,440
I remember one time I forgot my keys after work and came back to get them.

919
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,330
It was past 10 p.m.,

920
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,550
and I saw our boss making a bowl of instant noodles

921
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,380
for Ms. Luo.

922
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,030
Relax. Come on.

923
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,230
Let your whole body loosen up.

924
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,880
Your feet should be shoulder-width apart.

925
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,430
Then pick an arrow

926
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,110
and insert it here.

927
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:53,840
Like this?

928
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,800
Yes. And there's a groove here.

929
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,660
Pull it over.

930
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,130
Gently, slowly.

931
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,680
Use the web of your hand to find your jaw.

932
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,260
Did I go off target?

933
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,760
My first time was even worse.

934
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,800
So we were talking about

935
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,880
how Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu

936
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,030
share an office, right?

937
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,490
No.

938
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,920
Doesn't Mr. Xu

939
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,170
have his own office?

940
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,630
I often see Ms. Luo coming out of Mr. Xu's office.

941
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,210
They frequently stay late,

942
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,770
working until after 10 p.m.

943
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,350
One time, it was even after 11.

944
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,090
They're just working late in the office, right?

945
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,320
Probably talking about work,

946
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,550
nothing more.

947
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,030
One of my colleagues even saw them

948
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,860
eating instant noodles together.

949
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,510
Just eating instant noodles?

950
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,190
Your Mr. Xu is so petty,

951
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,150
isn't he?

952
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,800
With such a heavy workload of overtime,

953
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,000
couldn't he order something better

954
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
than instant noodles to her?

955
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,280
What they were eating isn't important.

956
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,280
What matters is that they were in the same room together,

957
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,790
a man and a woman alone.

958
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,670
You can imagine it, Senior.

959
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,430
No, no, no.

960
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,710
Xu, let's not imagine it.

961
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,800
Are you saying that when a man and a woman

962
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,160
are alone in the same room, something must happen?

963
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,070
Yes.

964
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,070
Your Mr. Xu has been through three divorces

965
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,550
and might be interested in Ms. Luo.

966
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,760
But Ms. Luo wouldn't be interested in him.

967
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,060
She's very pure.

968
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,760
Right, right. Ms. Luo is very pure.

969
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,960
But Senior, are you nervous?

970
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,100
See? You missed the target.

971
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,400
Why should I be nervous?

972
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,230
I'm not nervous.

973
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,800
No?

974
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,770
Aren't we just gossiping?

975
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,710
What's there to be nervous about?

976
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,320
Let's continue shooting arrows.

977
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,280
Xu Zhuo.

978
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,480
So you're saying

979
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,690
that Chen Shuo is interested in Ms. Luo?

980
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,800
But I feel like

981
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,590
Ms. Luo likes our boss now.

982
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,790
No way.

983
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,880
Our Teacher Xu is so composed.

984
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
She's always rushing around.

985
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,500
They don't match at all.

986
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,230
Let me tell you.

987
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,150
I think Mr. Xu is interested in her.

988
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,960
Why?

989
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,660
The other night, I came back to get something,

990
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,120
and I saw Mr. Xu making her a bowl of instant noodles himself.

991
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,150
You didn't see it?

992
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,030
Where could I see it?

993
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,670
It was too late.

994
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,470
I only saw it because I came back to grab something.

995
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,780
They came out.

996
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,890
Let's talk later.

997
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,830
Talk later.

998
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,940
My makeup isn't smudged.

999
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,030
Why were they staring at me?

1000
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,900
It was so weird.

1001
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,070
I...

1002
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,360
have noticed you've been around our firm a lot lately.

1003
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,000
What are you up to?

1004
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,280
I just want to remind you.

1005
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,150
This is not your firm.

1006
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,400
Why do you always come over here?

1007
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,110
I work here and get paid.

1008
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,400
Isn't this my workplace?

1009
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm asking you.

1010
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,150
Why are you always around here?

1011
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,480
I'm waiting for my junior.

1012
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,750
We're having dinner tonight.

1013
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Alright, then keep waiting. I'm leaving.

1014
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,360
Wait.

1015
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,020
Didn't you stand me up last time

1016
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,170
and promise to have a meal with me when you're free?

1017
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,170
How about tomorrow?

1018
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,440
Tomorrow?

1019
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,960
It depends. I'm leaving.

1020
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,510
What's wrong?

1021
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
My junior said

1022
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,560
there have been some rumors in the office.

1023
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,620
In Zhuoyue Law Firm?

1024
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,410
What rumors?

1025
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,630
It's about you.

1026
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,150
He said your relationship with that Xu Zhuo

1027
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,280
is not quite normal.

1028
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,370
What?

1029
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,150
What do you mean?

1030
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,230
I just heard it.

1031
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,590
I'm just trying to remind you out of goodwill.

1032
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,150
You call this reminding out of goodwill?

1033
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,960
I think you just want to

1034
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,360
cause trouble for me.

1035
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,120
What does it matter to me

1036
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,440
what others are saying?

1037
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,580
Does it have anything to do with you?

1038
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,290
You're here every day, wandering around,

1039
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,140
asking all kinds of questions,

1040
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,420
and not doing anything serious.

1041
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,630
Let me tell you,

1042
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,140
you're not allowed to talk nonsense anymore.

1043
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,630
If you say another word, I...

1044
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,150
The rumor is about the two of you.

1045
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:51,960
Do you think it has anything to do with you?

1046
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,840
Still talking?

1047
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,690
I'm just reminding you out of good intentions.
