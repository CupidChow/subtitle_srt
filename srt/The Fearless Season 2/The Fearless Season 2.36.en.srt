What's that saying again?

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,640
Okay, have you made an appointment?

190
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,390
Yes, the client should be here soon.

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,550
Ms. Li,

192
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,000
although our firm has been established for less than a year,

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,730
we have already taken on many big cases.

194
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,200
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

195
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,270
Ms. Li has arrived.

196
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,840
These two are the founding partners of our firm.

197
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,490
This is Ms. Luo, and this is Ms. Qiu.

198
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,550
Hello.

199
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,640
Hello.

200
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,080
Ms. Li,

201
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,360
let's sit inside.

202
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,670
I understand your situation

203
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,510
roughly from what Zhang Lan told me,

204
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
but could you please

205
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,310
explain the details to us?

206
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,100
[Defendant Li Yuan]

207
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,990
Thank you.

208
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,330
My case is a bit complicated.

209
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,550
It's related to family and marriage.

210
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,670
Ms. Li,

211
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,080
as you can see,

212
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,510
the lawyers in our firm

213
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,630
are all women.

214
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,240
So we'll understand whatever you say.

215
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,680
You can speak freely.

216
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,670
We will also protect your privacy.

217
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,510
If you have any concerns,

218
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,560
we can proceed without taking notes.

219
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,580
Thank you.

220
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,320
My husband's name is Yuan Gang.

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,360
He had an accident during a dive,

222
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,380
and now he's brain-dead.

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,720
From when we first met to when we started dating,

224
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,390
and then got married,

225
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,120
our relationship has always been good.

226
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,210
Sometimes I feel we're quite similar.

227
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,760
Really.

228
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,670
So we decided

229
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,650
not to have children

230
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,390
and just

231
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,000
live our own life, just the two of us.

232
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,080
We both really love extreme sports,

233
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,350
especially technical diving.

234
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,080
We've been to

235
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,320
Palau, Manado, Anilao.

236
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,630
We even planned that,

237
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,870
if we had the chance,

238
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,510
we'd try cave diving in the future.

239
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,960
Yuan Gang and I aren't just a couple.

240
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,360
We're also dive buddies who trust each other completely.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
Technical diving,

242
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,750
after all, is an extreme sport,

243
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,640
and it's full of danger.

244
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
When you're underwater,

245
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,080
even a small incident

246
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,280
can cause panic,

247
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,700
and panic usually leads to death.

248
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,840
Underwater,

249
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,110
we put each other's lives

250
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,630
completely in each other's hands.

251
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,150
This trip to the Philippines

252
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,390
was supposed to be a regular vacation.

253
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,320
But the night before I left,

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,430
the company suddenly called with something urgent,

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,630
so I let Yuan Gang go ahead first.

256
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,630
During those two days while waiting for me,

257
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,920
he had an accident.

258
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,080
This time, a group of five people went down together.

259
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,630
Then during the ascent,

260
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,120
they encountered turbulent currents

261
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,920
which scattered them apart.

262
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,910
By the time they found Yuan Gang,

263
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,250
he was already unconscious.

264
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,030
At that time, I

265
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,670
I... I...

266
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,030
immediately

267
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,750
rushed to the hospital,

268
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,080
and the doctor told me

269
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,270
he was brain dead

270
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,190
and wouldn't wake up.

271
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,560
It's been six months since it happened.

272
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,320
Is he in a hospital abroad now?

273
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,500
We treated him abroad for a while,

274
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,080
but soon the foreign doctors

275
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,200
gave up,

276
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,860
saying he wouldn't recover.

277
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,150
Their views on life and death

278
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,570
are different from ours.

279
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,910
They think pointless treatments

280
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,360
are meaningless.

281
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,760
They asked me to sign and give up,

282
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,270
but I couldn't accept it.

283
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,670
I had to bring Yuan Gang back.

284
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,610
I went through a lot of trouble to bring Yuan Gang back.

285
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,380
Now he's lying in our hospital.

286
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,380
So,

287
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,910
how did the doctors here

288
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,650
diagnose him?

289
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
What did they say?

290
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Take a look at this.

291
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,000
The diagnosis from the doctors here is the same as the ones abroad.

292
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,460
Ms. Li, you came here because...

293
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,829
I've been sued by Yuan Gang's mother.

294
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,200
She's trying to take guardianship of Yuan Gang.

295
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,180
She's suing you now

296
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,440
to revoke your guardianship.

297
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,520
Why?

298
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,310
Probably because

299
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,220
I'm discussing with the doctors

300
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,890
about stopping Yuan Gang's treatment.

301
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,620
He's never going to wake up.

302
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,540
He's only being kept alive by a respirator now,

303
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,180
allowing his body to remain in this world.

304
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
We've been together for 12 years,

305
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,110
five years of a relationship

306
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,640
and seven years of marriage.

307
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,590
I know him too well.

308
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,580
I know this isn't what he would want.

309
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,160
He wouldn't want to

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,230
live in this world like this.

311
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,360
The doctors are now advising me to let go,

312
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,840
and I've agreed.

313
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,730
But my mother-in-law doesn't agree.

314
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,790
So she's suing me now,

315
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,620
hoping to regain Yuan Gang's guardianship.

316
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,160
She wants Yuan Gang to stay

317
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
in this world just like he is now.

318
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm going to the restroom.

319
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,050
Please continue.

320
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,260
Ms. Luo...

321
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,900
It's alright.

322
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,720
Well, Ms. Luo's family previously

323
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,400
experienced a similar situation.

324
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,400
So she might...

325
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,150
Doctor,

326
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,690
is there

327
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,950
any possibility to save my mother?

328
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,940
As I mentioned earlier,

329
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,940
if you insist,

330
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,590
we will do our utmost

331
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,940
to provide treatment for your mother.

332
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,830
Given her current condition,

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,730
a tracheostomy is necessary,

334
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,710
but it may not be effective.

335
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,400
This decision

336
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,910
requires careful consideration from both of you.

337
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,520
I love him.

338
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,310
I know he wouldn't want to

339
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,230
live like this.

340
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,330
But it's only been half a year, right?

341
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,640
His brain waves

342
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,480
have long since flatlined.

343
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,940
There's no activity at all.

344
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,350
From a modern medical perspective,

345
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,170
he died six months ago.

346
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,070
So, how many children does his mother have?

347
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,510
Yuan Gang is her only child.

348
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,920
Then I understand why

349
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,550
his mother doesn't agree.

350
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,500
Actually, I understand why my mother-in-law is doing this.

351
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,810
Yuan Gang's father passed away early.

352
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,610
Now Yuan Gang is about to go too.

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,750
I can fully understand

354
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,810
her feelings of losing her son.

355
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,670
But no matter what,

356
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
I can't let Yuan Gang

357
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
continue living like this.

358
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,830
Is it possible to wait a bit longer,

359
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,180
like a year or two?

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,110
You don't know Yuan Gang.

361
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,880
You don't know

362
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
how vain he is.

363
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,480
He cares a lot about his appearance.

364
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,680
He's been working out for years

365
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,900
just to maintain his muscles.

366
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,510
He's been on a light diet for years, very disciplined.

367
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,500
It's only been half a year,

368
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,270
but his body has already changed.

369
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,400
The doctor told me

370
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,110
that if another year passes,

371
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,000
his body will change completely.

372
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,000
He'll turn from a man

373
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,680
into a corpse with loose skin, a bloated belly,

374
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
and thin legs.

375
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,480
We made a promise to each other

376
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,550
that if one day we encounter this situation,

377
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,270
one of us must take responsibility for the other.

378
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,310
I can't watch the person I love

379
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,440
become like this.

380
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,090
I believe Yuan Gang wouldn't want this either.

381
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,670
Ms. Li, is money involved with you

382
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,300
and your mother-in-law?

383
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,020
I've already given up my inheritance rights to Yuan Gang's property.

384
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,180
I told my mother-in-law

385
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,470
that I would take care of her in her old age.

386
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,640
But no matter what I promise,

387
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,750
she won't accept it.

388
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,230
She only wants Yuan Gang to live,

389
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,820
even without dignity,

390
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,680
even living like he is now.

391
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,250
Actually, I'd like to ask you all,

392
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,940
as we're all women,

393
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,780
do you agree

394
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,560
with how I'm handling this situation with Yuan Gang?

395
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,970
[Yinghua Law Firm]

396
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,850
Ms. Li,

397
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,300
please review this agreement carefully when you go back.

398
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,510
If there's no problem, just sign it

399
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,440
and send us a copy.

400
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,570
Alright, no need to see me out.

401
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,580
Goodbye.

402
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,920
Ms. Li has left.

403
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,450
Don't you think

404
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,660
she's making this decision a bit too hastily?

405
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,120
After all, it's only been half a year since Yuan Gang was unconscious.

406
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,870
I think anyone who's

407
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,240
been through something similar

408
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,870
would understand.

409
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,090
The living ones bear the heaviest burden

410
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,860
when sending off the one they love most.

411
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,780
Does she truly love Yuan Gang?

412
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,260
I believe she does.

413
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,200
But let's be honest,

414
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,270
this has nothing to do

415
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,480
with love anymore.

416
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,230
Yuan Gang is already brain-dead.

417
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,720
I think the best choice for her

418
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,350
is to let him go.

419
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,440
This way, it's better for both the people around him

420
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,160
and for

421
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,440
himself.

422
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,270
It's almost four o'clock.

423
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,510
Today has been a bit heavy.

424
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,550
Let's call it a day

425
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,530
and go home.

426
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,910
Perfect, I have a date.

427
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,370
Like no one else has a date.

428
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,480
I don't.

429
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,150
Well, I won't be able to give you a ride today.

430
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,580
Chen Shuo asked me to dinner.

431
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,070
You both go on your dates.

432
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,150
I'll stay here and work.

433
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,240
I'm off.

434
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,550
Mr. Chen, you're finally here.

435
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,220
Hello, Lisa.

436
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,550
Please, come in.

437
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,030
Lisa?

438
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,960
Looks like you're a regular here.

439
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,930
Everyone knows you.

440
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,300
How could I not be?

441
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,270
You have no idea

442
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,830
how many times I've saved you a seat here,

443
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,060
and ended up alone every time.

444
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,650
I've paid nearly 5,000 yuan in deposits alone.

445
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,370
Why are you talking about money?

446
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,790
Are you expecting me to reimburse you?

447
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,230
No way.

448
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,160
No need.

449
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,750
How is it?

450
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,450
It looks great.

451
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,040
So spacious.

452
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,650
Mr. Chen,

453
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,420
here's the menu.

454
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,200
Okay, one more for the lady.

455
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,310
Okay, thank you.

456
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Seize the opportunity.

457
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,410
You can really let me splurge today.

458
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,750
Alright, fancy menu.

459
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,510
This took some thought.

460
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,300
What should I order?

461
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Two red cubilose and two sea cucumbers with millet.

462
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,640
Okay.

463
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,010
No, no, no.

464
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,110
I was just messing with him.

465
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
We don't want any of these.

466
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,900
Um, do you have any home-style dishes?

467
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm sorry, miss.

468
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,240
We don't have home-style dishes.

469
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,440
She's just kidding with you.

470
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,960
I'm not.

471
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,180
It's okay. Let me order.

472
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,310
Two red cubilose,

473
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,320
fish maw and yellow croaker soup,

474
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,040
braised Hangzhou cabbage,

475
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,960
and crab roe tofu.

476
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,430
Alright.

477
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,870
Thank you.

478
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,430
Thank you, Lisa.

479
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,430
What do you mean?

480
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,310
We're not even married yet.

481
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,320
You're saving me money?

482
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,880
That's not like you.

483
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,270
Then you...

484
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,030
Do you still want it or not?

485
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,860
Yes, yes, yes.

486
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,190
A toast to what?

487
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
How would I know?

488
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,390
Just having a drink.

489
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,360
To the two-year anniversary of our car crash.

490
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,270
To me meeting you.

491
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,640
To our beautiful future life together.

492
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,640
Can we discuss something?

493
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,160
We're together now.

494
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,820
Let's live together.

495
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,510
Why? Are you nervous?

496
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,790
It's okay if you don't want to live at my place.

497
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,020
We can go to your old house.

498
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,880
No, no, no, don't frown.

499
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,940
Listen to me,

500
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,760
when the bank took your house before,

501
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
leaving you homeless, it was quite pitiful,

502
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,820
but that wasn't my intention at all.

503
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,590
I spent 6 million more than the market price

504
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,920
to buy it back. Why?

505
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,000
Just so you'd have a home.

506
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
To give the house back to you.

507
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,910
Are you touched?

508
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,120
Alright.

509
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,510
So I'll move into that house,

510
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,640
and every day

511
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,910
I'll see Liu Ming's phantom.

512
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,430
Three of us living happily together.

513
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,180
Such a mood killer.

514
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,650
Why bring him up?

515
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,160
I've told you before,

516
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,620
don't mention that house to me again.

517
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,070
I will never,

518
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,420
ever set foot in that house again.

519
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,880
Chen Shuo,

520
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,320
are you really that stupid?

521
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,680
Can't you just sell that house

522
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,990
and buy a new one?

523
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,270
And put it in your name?

524
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,880
Now I'm truly touched.

525
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,050
Alright then, I'll sell it and buy you a new one.

526
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,510
But what you just said...

527
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,070
Xue said that too.

528
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,950
What did he say?

529
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,160
Three people living in a

530
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,270
familiar space,

531
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,630
and I can't avoid

532
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,960
seeing a man every day.

533
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,110
See?

534
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,670
Xue's so considerate and on point when he speaks.

535
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,690
You should learn from him, okay?

536
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,360
Alright.

537
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,310
I'm going to the restroom.

538
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,640
Looks like you really

539
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,720
know this place well.

540
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,380
This is what we call being in sync, okay?

541
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,480
Anyway, I don't know Lisa.

542
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,720
How did it turn into a candlelit dinner

543
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,270
when I come back?

544
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,510
Just now we had fish maw and red cubilose.

545
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,140
It's too extravagant, lacking romance.

546
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,130
A piece of cake,

547
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,070
a few roses,

548
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,400
and a couple candles make it romantic?

549
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,320
Not bad, right?

550
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,070
Don't tell me

551
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,920
there's something

552
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,750
hidden in this cake.

553
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,030
I don't want to see anything.

554
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,420
There's a ring inside.

555
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,120
Really?

556
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,940
You're too violent.

557
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,990
Good thing there's nothing in it,

558
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,020
otherwise it would be so tacky.

559
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,720
It tastes pretty good though.

560
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,240
If there really was something in here,

561
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,160
you'd think it's really tacky and stupid, right?

562
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,190
Yeah, extremely stupid.

563
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,690
Uncreative and very tacky.

564
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,810
It doesn't match your image

565
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,380
of being smart and tasteful.

566
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,730
Am I tasteful?

567
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,920
Yeah.

568
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,350
You've become much more tasteful

569
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,160
since you met me.

570
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,260
♫Clouds♫

571
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,600
Luo Yingzi.

572
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,390
Marry me.

573
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,070

♫Between the sunshine and rain♫

576
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,240
Are you serious?

577
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,780
Yes.

578
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,260
I'm very serious.

579
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,000
Before I met you,

580
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
I never thought about getting married.

581
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,780
♫She comes and goes without a word♫

582
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,160
I thought being alone was fine,

583
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,550
living this life

584
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,790
without loving anyone too much

585
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,760
or being loved too much.

586
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,920
♫The tranquility I've grown used to♫

587
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,340
But after meeting you,

588
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,270
my thoughts have changed.

589
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,250
♫Is the invisible cloud♫

590
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,750

♫Giving me shade♫

592
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,880
I want to marry you.

593
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,880
I want to

594
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
make you my wife

595
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,960
and be your husband.

596
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:15,050
♫That piece of pure, soft cloud♫

597
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,230

00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,390
♫Will accept it♫

604
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,850

Stop looking.

608
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
It's bright, big, and suits you perfectly.

609
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,450
♫In our sky♫

610
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,320
I knew you would marry me.

611
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,110
♫She will always wait for me♫

612
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,130
So confident?

613
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,530
Extremely confident.

614
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,320
Do you like it?

615
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,310
It matches you, doesn't it?

616
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,590
Of course.

617
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,040
How could anything you give not match me?

618
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,400
How's it going

619
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,810
with the Dingxin‘s case

620
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,900
againt Xu Zhuo that you're handling?

621
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,270
Is Xu Zhuo particularly difficult to deal with?

622
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,750
Yeah, he's tough to deal with.

623
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,250
But it depends on who's handling him.

624
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,290
Don't worry, I'll make sure he can't cause trouble for long.

625
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,610
Let's talk about your law firm then.

626
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,340
It's open for business now,

627
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
and you won't even let me visit.

628
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,880
Being all mysterious about it.

629
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,310
So, how many receptionists did you hire?

630
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,860
Let me tell you this,

631
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,110
anyone younger than me

632
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,270
is not allowed.

633
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,070
Also, in the field of entrepreneurship,

634
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,590
I'm a senior compared to you.

635
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,830
Let me visit early,

636
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,920
and I can give you some advice.

637
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,780
Alright, alright.

638
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,790
Once everything's set up,

639
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,510
I'll invite you, my senior, to come and give guidance, okay?

640
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,590
I've been exhausted lately,

641
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,720
representing Mingshan

642
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,070
negotiating with Minghai,

643
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,480
and dealing with

644
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,030
other cases too.

645
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,200
Xue can't help much.

646
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,790
He just keeps saying

647
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,990
he's too old.

648
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,770
If I ask him to do more work,

649
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,720
wouldn't that be bullying a senior?

650
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,830
And then there's Fang Rui.

651
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,060
Son of a wealthy family, like a hothouse flower.

652
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,830
Can't count on him for anything.

653
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,270
I've been handling everything myself.

654
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,510
I've never worried this much in my life.

655
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,930
It's really not easy.

656
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,620
But on the other hand,

657
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,350
our Tongqian Law Firm

658
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,880
got so many cases right from the start.

659
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,830
That's a good sign, right?

660
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,660
Wait a minute.

661
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,720
What's your law firm called?

662
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,920
Tongqian.

663
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,880
"Tong" for same, and "Qian" for sky.

664
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,770
Same sky, same belief.

665
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,550
Why doesn't that sound like

666
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,220
something you'd say?

667
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,420
Do you even have beliefs?

668
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,920
I get it now.

669
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,790
'Same sky, same belief', huh?

670
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,930
I don't believe you.

671
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,400
Is your law firm named after the copper coin?

672
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,150
Tongqian'er (copper coin)?

673
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,469
Yes, Tongqian'er (copper coin).

674
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,400
Righteous Luo knows me best.

675
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,800
I knew it.

676
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,710
You can't expect pearls from a pig's mouth.

677
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,650
But copper coin is pretty good too.

678
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,810
Round on the outside, square on the inside.

679
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,630
It's quite like you.

680
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,360
Like me?

681
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,790
How about you guys?

682
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,330
Haven't moved to the 17th floor.

683
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,800
Are you feeling a bit frustrated about it?

684
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,870
A little, yeah.

685
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,360
But our law firm took on a case today.

686
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,139
It's quite special.

687
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,300
A case about guardianship of a brain-dead patient.

688
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,650
It was introduced by Xia Shu.

689
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,870
A guardianship case for a brain-dead patient?

690
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,150
Tell me more details.

691
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:47,770
What kind of case is it?

692
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,030
Well, my client's

693
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,320
husband was diving once

694
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,020
and drowned.

695
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,360
He became brain-dead

696
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,550
and could only rely on a respirator

697
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,670
to maintain his vital signs.

698
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,480
Doctors and experts from both China and abroad

699
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,710
have all examined him.

700
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,710
They all basically suggested the same thing:

701
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,480
To give up treatment.

702
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,370
There's no point in continuing.

703
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,320
So my client

704
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
took the doctors' advice.

705
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,360
She felt that her husband was suffering too much.

706
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,770
But just then,

707
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,300
her mother-in-law showed up and objected.

708
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,900
She wants to take back the guardianship of her son.

709
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,590
Don't take this case, Yingzi.

710
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,320
Don't take it?

711
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,650
What do you mean?

712
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,800
It's nothing.

713
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,190
I just don't want you to take this case.

714
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,590
Wait,

715
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,510
if you don't want me to take it,

716
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,400
you should at least give me a reason.

717
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,320
It's so sudden.

718
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,320
Is your client's name Li Yuan?

719
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:37,940
Yes.

720
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,190
Her husband is Yuan Gang.

721
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,150
You've been investigating me?

722
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,030
Who's investigating you?

723
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,800
I don't have time for that.

724
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,500
I represent her mother-in-law

725
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,440
who is named Cui Weizhen.

726
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
She wants to sue her daughter-in-law, Li Yuan.

727
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,410
Got it?

728
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,480
So?

729
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,460
So don't take it.

730
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,960
We've been

731
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,800
on opposite sides in court before.

732
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,280
We'll keep running into

733
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,410
each other in the future.

734
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Just because we're getting married,

735
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,000
we can't be opponents anymore?

736
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,480
Do we have to avoid each other in the future?

737
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,110
If you're going to be this unprofessional,

738
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
if being in a relationship or getting married means this,

739
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
then you'd better take this ring back.

740
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,360
I really don't dare to accept it.

741
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,030
No, no.

742
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,360
I, I'm not being unprofessional.

743
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,890
We can be opponents in other cases,

744
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,280
but this case

745
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,350
is special.

746
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,630
It's not suitable for us to be on opposite sides.

747
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Well, Mr. Chen,

748
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,190
let me ask you,

749
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,150
what kind of cases do you think are suitable for us

750
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,070
to be opponents?

751
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,140
The ones where we don't hurt each other.

752
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,030
Wait.

753
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,630
Chen Shuo, I don't find

754
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,030
your argument convincing at all.

755
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,510
How about this?

756
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,070
if you really think this could

757
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,110
hurt our relationship,

758
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,280
why don't you go talk to your client?

759
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,510
Tell them your wife doesn't agree,

760
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,110
and terminate the agency agreement.

761
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,320
No, I must represent this case.

762
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,630
That's ridiculous.

763
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,690
Then I must represent this case too.

764
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,360
Unless you tell me the reason,

765
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
so I can think about it.

766
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,070
Otherwise, how can I back out?

767
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,230
Why do you insist on knowing the reason?

768
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,800
Well, you'd rather take this case,

769
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
even if it could hurt our relationship.

770
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,150
Isn't that right? Is that what you mean?

771
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,710
You're starting to emotionally blackmail me now.

772
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,630
Morally blackmailing me.

773
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,860
You're trying to emotionally manipulate me, aren't you?

774
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,590
Is our relationship really that fragile?

775
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,930
Just taking a case

776
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,600
and it has to fall apart, is it?

777
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,210
No.

778
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,880
Please, I'm begging you, okay?

779
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,760
Don't take it.

780
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,400
You see,

781
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,110
I'm so happy after proposing today.

782
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,550
Just do it for me, okay?

783
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,100
Don't take it.

784
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,510
Chen Shuo, I've told you,

785
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,260
if you really don't want me to take it,

786
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,160
you must tell me the reason.

787
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,030
Otherwise,

788
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,470
I'm really going to take this case.

789
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,710
Xue is really annoying.

790
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,000
He says we're like hedgehogs,

791
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,070
if we get too close, we'll prick

792
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,360
and hurt each other.

793
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,840
Why is Xue meddling in our affairs?

794
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,710
He's just a turtle keeper.

795
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,190
Why are you listening to him?

796
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,890
Fine, fine. Take it.

797
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,290
Take it.

798
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,670
How could a turtle keeper know about hedgehogs?

799
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,200
Don't listen to him anymore.

Mom.

What are you doing?

826
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,280
You've been in a daze for a while.

827
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,630
You seem so absent-minded.

828
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,510
What's wrong? Did you have a fight with Chen Shuo?

829
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,360
He proposed.

830
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,070
That's great news!

831
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,700
Did you say yes?

832
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,320
I did.

833
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,650
Then why aren't you happy?

834
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,440
You won't believe the coincidence.

835
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,540
About Li Yuan's case,

836
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,310
Chen Shuo is opposing me on it.

837
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,760
So you're saying

838
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
he represents Yuan Gang's mother?

839
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,910
It's fine that he represents her.

840
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,790
Right?

841
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,670
But

842
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,630
why won't he let me represent Li Yuan?

843
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,370
It's just strange.

844
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,240
I asked him why, but he wouldn't tell me.

845
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,660
We're not even married yet,

846
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,420
and he's already meddling in my affairs.

847
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,290
How can I marry him like this?

848
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,710
Chen Shuo is not supposed to be such a person.

849
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
Could there be something behind it?

850
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,510
I don't know what his problem is

851
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,440
or what he's hiding.

852
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
He could just tell me.

853
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,160
I've asked him many times, but he just wouldn't tell me why.

854
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,190
I told him I never interfered with his cases,

855
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,510
so why is he interfering with mine?

856
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,510
Does this mean for every case I represent in the future,

857
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,510
if he doesn't approve,

858
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,660
I can't take it?

859
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,440
How am I supposed to do my job?

860
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,570
You two have come a long way to be together.

861
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,800
Don't let these work issues get in the way

862
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,710
of your relationship.

863
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,670
It's not worth it.

864
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,740
So what do you think I should do?

865
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,340
Should I just agree with him

866
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,230
and not take the case?

867
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,210
But that's not me.

868
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,630
Why should I back down?

869
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,170
Yingzi,

870
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,360
let's put Chen Shuo aside.

871
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,110
I just want to ask you,

872
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,980
why do you insist on taking this case?

873
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,060
Is it because of your mom?

874
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,790
That's part of it,

875
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,200
but not the whole reason.

876
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,960
Back then, the doctor told my dad and me

877
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,780
to make the decision

878
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,970
whether to end my mom's treatment.

879
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,340
But in the end,

880
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,760
it was my dad who made the decision.

881
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,800
He was the one who signed.

882
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,110
So I've always felt uneasy

883
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,070
about this.

884
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,340
I think

885
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,330
you might be letting your emotions

886
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,870
influence you too much in this case.

887
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,150
There is indeed an emotional factor,

888
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,360
but

889
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,690
that's another story, right?

890
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,000
Like I said,

891
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,060
am I not a professional lawyer?

892
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,530
No matter how much

893
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,070
my personal factors are involved,

894
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,710
I wouldn't let emotions cloud my judgment

895
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,820
in taking this case.

896
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,520
Forget it.

897
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,310
To be honest,

898
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,710
leaving Chen Shuo out of this,

899
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,550
I don't quite agree with how Li Yuan

900
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,460
is handling this situation.

901
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,000
After all, her husband's been

902
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,320
in a coma for only half a year,

903
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,550
and she's giving up on his treatment

904
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,530
and let him go.

905
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,400
But what if he just doesn't wake up?
