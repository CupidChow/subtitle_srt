00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,640
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,690
We demand

4
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
that this recording be played in court.

5
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,770
Your Honor, please grant permission.

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,750
Granted.

7
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,090
What recording?

8
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,930
Did you have any other private contact with Chen Shuo?

9
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,229
No, I didn't.

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,009
I don't know anything about any recording.

11
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,810
Who recorded it? When was it recorded?

12
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,610
I have no idea.

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,270
Come on, take a look.

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,220
We made significant compromises

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,150
to reach this agreement with Minghai Group.

16
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,410
So, that means

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,010
we won the case for you.

18
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,400
According to the court's ruling,

19
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,640
Minghai Group was supposed to pay you 50 million

20
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,720
plus 17 million in liquidated damages.

21
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,340
But you gave up those claims

22
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,010
during the settlement.

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,920
What else can I do but not give up?

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,650
Yes, you won the case for us,

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,200
Based on our agreement,

26
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,810
we still have to pay you over 10 million.

27
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,690
Tell me, how are we supposed to execute this agreement?

28
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,540
Trying to fool me?

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,829
That person hasn't been born yet.

30
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,000
My partner is involved in a criminal case.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,250
How can I not be worried?

32
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,810
If you're worried, go to Chen Shuo.

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,970
Let him appreciate your kindness.

34
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,000
Why are you calling me?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
I called you

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,440
because you are Chen Shuo's agent lawyer.

37
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,400
Aren't you?

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,200
Who else should I look for?

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,440
I have something to discuss with you.

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760
It's up to you whether you come or not.

41
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,290
♫Only a dozen people♫

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,960
♫And about seven to eight guns♫

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,890
♫Chased by the Imperial Army♫

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,130
Director Han.

45
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,930
It's so late. Is something wrong?

46
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,690
Love is truly great.

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,440
For Chen Shuo,

48
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,320
you're willing to do anything.

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
Chen Shuo is my client.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm his lawyer now.

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,850
Of course I have to take responsibility for him.

52
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,480
Tell me, what's this about?

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,410
Look at you.

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,250
I've always said you need to work on that temper of yours,

55
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,320
but you never listen.

56
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,720
Here, listen to this.

57
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,660
What else can I do but not give up?

58
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,250
Yes, you won the case for us,

59
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,820
Based on our agreement,

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,480
we still have to pay you over 10 million.

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,060
How do you expect us to fulfill this agreement?

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,410
With this recording,

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,930
the judge will understand immediately.

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,440
The reason Chen Shuo changed the joint account

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
into an exclusive account

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,370
was because Mingshan intended to deceive him from the beginning.

67
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,920
The reason he tampered with it

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,160
was purely a desperate measure for self-protection.

69
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,920
When was this recorded?

70
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,130
I knew it when Chen Shuo was put in the detention center.

71
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,450
If we didn't get him in there,

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Xu Zhuo definitely wouldn't have let it go.

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,450
He certainly won't let it go.

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,400
But I didn't expect

75
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,040
that you, Director Han, at this moment,

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,159
would actually stand on Chen Shuo's side.

77
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,240
What kind of talk is that?

78
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,560
I've always stood on the side of justice.

79
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,890
I'm a good lawyer who acts bravely for a just cause.

80
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,970
Alright, stop right there.

81
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,330
I was just starting to feel moved,

82
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,770
but this must be the worst misrepresentation of justice ever.

83
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,600
However, I still want to express my respect for you.

84
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,460
This respect may have come a bit late,

85
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,570
but I accept it.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
Thank you, Mentor.

87
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,900
The older, the wiser.

88
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,150
I'll take this.

89
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,810
Today, in this criminal court,

90
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,190
as a lawyer,

91
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,659
I am filled with sadness.

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,990
This case is undoubtedly a simple contract dispute,

93
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
yet the other party disregards good faith,

94
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,290
trampling on the contract first,

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,650
and then using criminal means for retaliation.

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,450
They not only wanted to betray the lawyer

97
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,040
who had fought for them after securing the owed money,

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,090
but also sought to imprison the person who had helped them

99
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,530
overcome difficulties while bearing the risk.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,650
There is no worse act of betrayal and ingratitude

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,680
than this.

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,010
We acknowledge

103
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,220
that the defendant's actions are not beyond reproach,

104
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,480
but he was also defending

105
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,850
his own legitimate interests.

106
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,330
Here, we would like to specifically add that

107
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,360
according to Article 8 of the agreement,

108
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,960
Mingshan Group, without the consent of Chen Shuo,

109
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,500
privately reached a settlement agreement with the other party,

110
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,500
considering Chen Shuo to have fulfilled all agreed obligations.

111
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,480
Mingshan Group should, according to the contract,

112
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,720
pay all the legal fees.

113
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,120
According to the terms of the contract,

114
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,280
the agency fee our client received

115
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,110
shouldn't be just 5.6 million yuan.

116
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,060
As for the remaining portion,

117
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,159
we will fight for it in another court.

118
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,180
Thank you.

119
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,890
Well said. Good.

120
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,210
All rise.

121
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,980
During the performance of the entrusted agency agreement in the case,

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,230
both parties did not settle the expenses incurred

123
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,330
from the agency matters.

124
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,330
The private prosecutor, Mingshan Mining Group Co., Ltd.,

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,680
cannot determine the amount allegedly misappropriated by Chen Shuo.

126
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,360
Therefore, the charges cannot be established.

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,110
The private prosecutor has not filed an incidental civil action,

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
so their dispute should be handled in a separate case.

129
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,760
Pursuant to Article 195, Item 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,770
of the People's Republic of China,

131
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,010
the court hereby rules as follows:

132
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,530
The defendant, Chen Shuo,

133
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,070
is not guilty.

134
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,040
Mr. Xue.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,650
How do you feel about winning this case?

136
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,620
-Victory is inevitable.
-What are you looking at?

137
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,300
I like you.

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,160
I know about this.

139
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,680
I like your decisiveness. I like your professionalism.

140
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,970
Excuse me.

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Ms. Luo,

142
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,410
we've been seeing a lot of

143
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,920
cases like this where economic disputes

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,390
are treated as criminal cases.

145
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,160
Do you have anything else to say about this case?

146
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,870
We will sue Mingshan Group

147
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,850
to claim all agency fees

148
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,680
owed to our client as stipulated in the agreement.

149
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,220
We cannot tolerate

150
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,970
this breach of trust and betrayal,

151
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,210
nor can we tolerate

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,710
the use of criminal means to attack business partners

153
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,490
and trample on the legal bottom line.

154
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,380
Thank you.

155
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:27,890
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

156
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,890
Go back and prepare the documents.

157
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,800
They're about to appeal.

158
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,330
Mr. Sun.

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,490
Mr. Xu.

160
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,289
The academic community believes

161
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,890
this case is a contract dispute.

162
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,770
Wait, wait, wait.

163
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,370
Why does it need to be elevated

164
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,320
to the level of a criminal offense?

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,130
Let's hear what he has to say.

166
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,010
Are you intentionally trying to undermine your colleagues?

167
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,169
We maintain that

168
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,320
Chen Shuo's actions

169
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,800
constitute embezzlement,

170
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,220
with the intention of illegal possession,

171
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,080
by privately disposing of the client's execution funds.

172
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
This has already violated the professional ethics of a lawyer...

173
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
Look at his composure.

174
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,530
And the most basic professional ethics.

175
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,680
We really need to teach him a lesson.

176
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,930
We will report his behavior

177
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,080
to the relevant authorities.

178
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,160
Let me interject something.

180
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,160
You just said,

181
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,640
that Mr. Xu was undermining his colleagues, right?

182
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
To put it bluntly,

183
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,480
he was trying to undermine me

184
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,430
In this case, right?

185
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,190
But as the party involved,

186
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,770
I don't agree with this view.

187
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,610
Mr. Xu is a pioneer in law,

188
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,890
And he and I just have

189
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,040
different understandings and perceptions of the law.

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
In court, we are opponents,

191
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,620
Outside the court,

192
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,710
he's my senior.

193
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,090
I also admire him very much.

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,690
Come on, take a photo of us.

195
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,800
Thank you, thank you. Come on.

196
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,960
They seem to have a good relationship.

197
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,320
How does it feel to lose the case?

198
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,890
Don't forget you used to be my defeated opponent.

199
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
Even if I lost this time,

200
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,890
it's not a loss to you.

201
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
Still talking tough.

202
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
You lost this case,

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
you won't get the legal fees.

204
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,930
If they can betray me,

205
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,280
they'll definitely betray you too.

206
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,630
Don't worry, Mingshan will appeal.

207
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,490
Even if I don't receive any fees,

208
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,080
I'll still get that money back.

209
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,040
We'll see about that.

210
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,560
Don't be upset about losing the case.

211
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,410
I'll find a chance to sit in on your class, okay?

212
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,840
Goodbye, Mr. Xu. Bye-bye.

213
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,680
Can't I deal with him?

214
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,750
Let's go.

215
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,690
We're at the courthouse entrance, mind your image.

216
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,460
I need to assert my territorial sovereignty.

217
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,290
Let me remind you,

218
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
don't get carried away just because you won a case.

219
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,080
Be careful, Xu Zhuo might instigate Mingshan to appeal.

220
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,320
They might really get you locked up again.

221
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,490
Am I afraid of him?

222
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,840
Who's my girlfriend?

223
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,800
My girlfriend is Luo Yingzi, the great lawyer.

224
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,740
For her boyfriend,

225
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,160
how could she possibly lose a case, right?

226
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,130
Alright, let's go eat.

227
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
Everyone's watching.

228
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,130
Let them watch.

229
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,030
Who cares about them?

230
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,290
Let's hug for three more seconds.

231
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,920
One, two, three. That's enough.

232
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,610
Come on.

233
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,010
Qiu finally has a smile on her face.

234
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,830
What did I say back then?

235
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,490
I said this guy Xu Zhuo,

236
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,680
the higher he climbs, the harder he falls.

237
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,770
Right?

238
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,680
It's not that there's no retribution, it's just not time yet.

239
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,040
He deserves it.

240
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,620
He totally deserves it.

241
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,130
Let me tell you, I'm determined.

242
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,290
I'll send him in for the third time.

243
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,120
Send him in.

244
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,290
Given what's happened recently,

245
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,660
I've been thinking.

246
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,590
I want to start my own law firm.

247
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,680
And I sincerely invite you to

248
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,560
leave the firm and go independent with me.

249
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,160
What do you say?

250
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,320
Be our own bosses.

251
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,550
We'll make more money on our own.

252
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,320
You're kidding me.

253
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,130
I'm serious.

254
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,090
Stop messing around.

255
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,490
No, no.

256
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,730
Why not?

257
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,040
It's not appropriate.

258
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,080
What's not appropriate?

259
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,920
I still think...

260
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
You should work with Luo Yingzi.

261
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,400
You should go to her firm.

262
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
Think about it.

263
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,080
Husband and wife working together.

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,030
A family business.

265
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,020
That would be great.

266
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,910
Why do you always keeping me with you?

267
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,040
I have to keep you with me.

268
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,730
If we work together,

269
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,730
if something happens to me in the future,

270
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,920
you can help cover for me.

271
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
You're really something.

272
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,260
I knew you had no good intentions.

273
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,940
If I join their firm,

274
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,490
if something goes wrong in the future,

275
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,160
she would be held jointly liable.

276
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,490
She's my beloved.

277
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,650
How could I bear that?

278
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,940
So I'm the one to take the blame?

279
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,130
I'm kidding.

280
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,010
She and I are both like hedgehogs.

281
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,370
If we're too close, we'll hurt each other.

282
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,920
Come on, come out and work with me.

283
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,650
Okay?

284
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,290
Let me be honest with you.

285
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,650
I just feel that

286
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,720
running our own business is too much pressure.

287
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,010
Who doesn't have pressure?

288
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,440
Where is there no pressure?

289
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't you have pressure at Dazheng Law Firm?

290
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,730
I'm asking you.

291
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,500
You know about my work at Dazheng Law Firm.

292
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,010
I don't have any pressure there.

293
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,190
I go to work every day,

294
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,250
make some tea, browse the internet,

295
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,320
and take care of my turtle.

296
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,770
There's no pressure at home either.

297
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,330
My wife has a stable job.

298
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,640
The kid is doing well in school.

299
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,250
If you have any cases, introduce some to me.

300
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,290
I can still get a share of the profits.

301
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,520
Isn’t this nice?

302
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
Well, bro, how old are you?

303
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,530
You've given up?

304
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Are you ready to retire?

305
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,980
People need to keep pushing themselves.

306
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,490
Come out and hustle with your little brother.

307
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,110
Okay?

308
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,650
So, here's the deal.

309
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,800
I'll be the one to handle all the heavy, tiring,

310
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,770
dirty, and urgent tasks, alright?

311
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,290
You'll be my anchor.

312
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,560
In the firm, you'll be responsible for things like

313
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,530
legal consultations,

314
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,730
right? Get a potted plant,

315
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,800
scroll through your phone when you're free.

316
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,680
How relaxing is that?

317
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,010
Being your own boss, you'll make more money.

318
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,120
You'll be very happy.

319
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,910
Okay?

320
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,490
Well, if you put it that way...

321
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,410
I'm... I'm actually getting tempted.

322
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,200
You must be tempted.

323
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,230
Let's do it, come on.

324
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,860
No, no, no. Let me think about it.

325
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,690
That's fine.

326
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,520
Come on.

327
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,870
Alright.

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
There's one more thing.

329
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,610
If we open a law firm together, shouldn't we...

330
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,290
Split the profits.

331
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,750
Come on, who doesn't care about that?

332
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,370
We'll discuss each matter separately, okay?

333
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,530
No, we should have a contract or something, right?

334
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,530
If you say we should sign, then let's sign.

335
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,770
Alright, alright, alright.

336
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,730
I... I believe you.

337
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,540
Why do I feel like I've fallen into another trap?

338
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,330
-But there's one more thing.
-Tell me.

339
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,950
The two of us are too few to establish a law firm.

340
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,630
We're not fit to be running around outside anymore.

341
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,130
We need someone to run errands.

342
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,890
Come here.

343
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,660
Mentor.

344
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,770
The errand runner is here.

345
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,400
Mr. Xue.

346
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,140
Fang Rui.

347
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,780
I passed the bar exam.

348
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,650
What's your score?

349
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,440
429 points.

350
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,290
Not bad.

351
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,840
He barely passed with 360 points back then.

352
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,560
You're better than him.

353
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
Don't listen to his nonsense.

354
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,540
I was a special talent student.

355
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,680
Mentor,

356
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,800
I want you to continue being my supervising lawyer.

357
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,890
I want to learn from you.

358
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,840
Sure, sure.

359
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,490
I was just about to discuss this with Xue.

360
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,650
We were thinking of starting a law firm together.

361
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,670
You can join us later.

362
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,190
Sure, no problem.

363
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,540
As long as you take me along.

364
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,320
Think of a name.

365
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,770
Right, think of a name.

366
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,410
For the name, let's take a character from your name

367
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,960
and one from Mr. Xue's name.

368
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
What would that be?

369
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,190
Shuofeng? Fengshuo?

370
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,340
That sounds terrible.

371
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,910
Fengsuo doesn't work, Shuofeng...

372
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,710
Sufeng.

373
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,010
Sufeng doesn't work either.

374
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,410
Why don't you just keep your mouth shut?

375
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,490
Professional ethics.

376
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
Not good, think again.

377
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,560
Actually, I’ve come up with a name.

378
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,320
It's a bit straightforward.

379
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,560
But it's quite good.

380
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,250
What is it?

381
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,060
"Copper Coin Law Firm."

382
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,800
Round on the outside, square on the inside.

383
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,030
What a great name, right?

384
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,010
It shines with the light of value.

385
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,650
Before anyone even joins,

386
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,530
people will know our firm is full of money-grabbers.

387
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,340
You're all talk.

388
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,200
Always going on about money-grabbers, money-grabbers.

389
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,840
All you do is lose money in business.

390
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,650
I think it works.

391
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,740
How about we change two characters?

392
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,320
"Tong" for same, "Qian" from sky.

393
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,410
Under the same blue sky.

394
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,840
With the same belief in our hearts.

395
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,760
I think this works, it has meaning.

396
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
Better than yours.

397
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,200
Tongqian.

398
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,320
Under the same sky.

399
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,250
All thinking about money.

400
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,040
Let's go with Tongqian Law Firm then.

401
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,400
Under the same sky,

402
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,790
we're all thinking about money.

403
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,880
Money will come.

404
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
Come on, Tongqian Law Firm is established.

405
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,990
-Come on. To Tongqian Law Firm.
-Your cup is empty, right?

406
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,010
More, more!

407
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,890
Tongqian Law Firm.

408
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,730
Bottom up.

409
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:50,840
It's about time.

410
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,200
Yes, they should be here.

411
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,840
They're here.

412
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,050
Slow down, slow down.

413
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,130
Mr. Sun.

414
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,320
Honored guests.

415
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,960
My apologies for not greeting you from afar.

416
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,770
No need for such formalities.

417
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,890
Hello, hello, hello.

418
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,690
Mr. Xue.

419
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,200
Mr. Sun.

420
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,400
Please, please come in.

421
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,800
Liu.

422
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,890
Take their cars to the garage.

423
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,370
Alright.

424
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,040
Hurry, hurry.

425
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,440
-Please come in.
-Okay.

426
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,290
Come, come, come.

427
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,390
Let me, let me.

428
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,060
I've prepared tea for you all.

429
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,160
It's the finest tea I have.

430
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,580
Have a taste.

431
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,140
Take some with you when you leave later.

432
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,840
Mr. Sun.

433
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
Let's not rush to drink tea.

434
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,010
I'll get straight to the point, okay?

435
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,320
After the court session that day,

436
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,010
Xu Zhuo's intention was...

437
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,250
Here.

438
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,770
Thank you.

439
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,560
What is it?

440
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,220
Mingshan Group

441
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,950
still intends to file a lawsuit against me?

442
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,130
That can't be.

443
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,350
Don't listen to this Xu Zhuo.

444
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,410
He's talking nonsense.

445
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,110
That's just his own opinion.

446
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,890
Our Mingshan Group

447
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,770
will absolutely not sue you again.

448
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,300
Is it really his own idea?

449
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,490
Mr. Chen.

450
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,270
Please consider my situation.

451
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,300
Minghai has owed this money for so long.

452
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,020
I'm really at the end of my rope.

453
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,020
As for our matters,

454
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,530
I was wrong.

455
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,040
I shouldn’t have been thinking about refusing to pay you that legal fee.

456
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,940
But I was forced into it.

457
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,250
Now that you've sued me,

458
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,730
I know I was wrong.

459
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
I, I'm trying hard to make amends.

460
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,520
Mr. Sun.

461
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,700
I came here today to tell you one thing.

462
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,730
We've withdrawn the lawsuit.

463
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,800
Withdrawn?

464
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,530
Withdrawn.

465
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,900
Before coming here with Mr. Chen,

466
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,210
we had already applied to the court to withdraw the lawsuit.

467
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,540
I expect in the next two or three days,

468
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,579
the court will notify you.

469
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,370
I don't know what to say.

470
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,320
Mr. Chen, you...

471
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,210
You're really too generous.

472
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,560
I... I'm ashamed.

473
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,640
Please don't say that, Mr. Sun.

474
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,490
As the old saying goes,

475
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,040
it takes two to tango, though.

476
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,210
I have my own issues too.

477
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,210
Before, I was too rigid.

478
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,950
Stubborn.

479
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,220
I didn't realistically consider

480
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,050
the situation of your Mingshan Group.

481
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,880
Now I see

482
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,070
you really want to save the company first.

483
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,050
It's not that you don't want to pay back the money.

484
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,460
Yes.

485
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,250
So,

486
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,130
let’s turn the page on our past.

487
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,730
Okay?

488
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
No, no.

489
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,690
If you just let it go like this,

490
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,490
wouldn't I become

491
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,050
someone with a face so thick that even three axe blows couldn't cut through it?

492
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,080
Your agency fee,

493
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,020
according to our contract,

494
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,490
should be over 8 million.

495
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,320
You've already taken 5.6 million.

496
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,530
Don't worry about the rest,

497
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,350
I'll have the accountant transfer it to you as soon as possible.

498
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,010
No, no.

499
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,630
Since you just said I'm generous,

500
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,170
I'll be truly generous to the end.

501
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,210
But I have a small favor to ask.

502
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,690
I did indeed take 5.6 million before,

503
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,880
but out of this,

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,080
the portion for Liangcheng Law Firm

505
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,690
and the part for Han Zhitong

506
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,530
have already been returned to you.

507
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,210
So I was wondering if it's possible

508
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,800
for you to return Han Zhitong's portion

509
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,290
back to him again.

510
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,040
Is that okay?

511
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
That's no problem at all.

512
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,930
I thank you on his behalf.

513
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,640
Please don't be so polite.

514
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,400
Mr. Sun,

515
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,690
there's one more thing.

516
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,790
Chen Shuo and I

517
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,490
are doing our own business.

518
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,040
We've established our own law firm.

519
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,050
In the future, if you think we're still capable,

520
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
if you have any legal issues,

521
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,400
feel free to contact us anytime.

522
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,800
Let's not wait until later.

523
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,400
Let's do it now.

524
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
To be honest with you,

525
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,170
we're still in negotiations with Minghai Group.

526
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,080
Although the result of the first trial

527
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,250
was very positive,

528
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,320
Minghai is just too stingy.

529
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,860
Our legal team isn't very effective either.

530
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,810
so I'm thinking of changing them.

531
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,010
Here's what we'll do.

532
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,040
I'll draft a contract as soon as possible.

533
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,020
we'll sign it,

534
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,530
and from now on, all our company's legal affairs

535
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,530
will be handled by you.

536
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,230
How does that sound?

537
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,400
It's settled then.

538
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,080
Great!

539
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,800
-Alright?
-Great.

540
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,880
Have a try.

541
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,080
Who's looking for me?

542
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,840
Senior, long time no see.

543
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,880
Luo Yingzi.

544
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,910
Beautiful lady, you're getting more and more gorgeous.

545
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,840
Have a seat, have a seat.

546
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,320
I heard you recently helped a death row inmate

547
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,730
get his case sent back for retrial.

548
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,530
That's impressive.

549
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,340
Please don't tease me.

550
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,490
Here's my new business card.

551
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,930
I'm no longer with Liangcheng Law Firm.

552
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,930
I'm working for myself now.

553
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,800
I always knew you had it in you.

554
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,320
CEO Luo.

555
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,560
No, no, no.

556
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Well, Yingzi, just tell me,

557
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,480
what brings you here?

558
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,690
I'll get straight to the point, senior.

559
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,360
Did you once handle a case

560
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,930
involving a medical malpractice dispute?

561
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,840
The client's name was Yang Cuili.

562
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,600
Yes, there was one.

563
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,600
It was a minor case, wrapped up quickly.

564
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,360
Why do you ask?

565
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,210
So, did Yang Cuili,

566
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,000
trust you quite a bit?

567
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,960
I'd say she trusted me a lot.

568
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,970
Back then,

569
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,730
she was in a tight financial situation.

570
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,010
She didn't have a proper job either.

571
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,530
So she definitely couldn't afford a lawyer.

572
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,560
I took her case as legal aid.

573
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,950
At first, she thought

574
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,020
a free lawyer wouldn't care much about the case.

575
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,360
But to her surprise, I won the case.

576
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,380
And not only that,

577
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,040
I helped her get over 60,000 yuan in compensation.

578
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,930
So, from that perspective, she must have trusted me a lot.

579
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,600
Do you know

580
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,530
the matter between her and Madam Mei?

581
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,080
What about Madam Mei?

582
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,880
Madam Mei once represented a rape case.

583
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,490
Because of this rape case,

584
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,530
she lost her qualification as a lawyer.

585
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,730
You know about this, don't you?

586
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,920
The victim in this rape case was Yang Cuili.

587
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,970
It was her?

588
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,640
That case back then,

589
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,360
she recanted her testimony in court.

590
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,880
Yes.

591
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,560
You also know Madam Mei.

592
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,330
She would never bribe or threaten witnesses

593
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,710
to change their testimony.

594
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,730
So back then,

595
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,210
Yang Cuili suddenly changed her testimony.

596
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,320
Someone must have framed Madam Mei and her husband,

597
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,060
using Yang Cuili as a pawn.

598
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,250
So on my end, I...

599
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,170
So you want to find her and ask her to tell the truth?

600
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,800
Madam Mei doesn't want me to find her,

601
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,630
because she doesn't want to reopen the case.

602
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,250
She just wants to know

603
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,080
who framed her back then.

604
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,290
However,

605
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,900
I did try to find Yang Cuili on my own,

606
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
but she didn't say anything.

607
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,770
So at this point,

608
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,670
I only have speculations, no evidence.

609
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,810
I see, Yingzi.

610
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
As for Yang Cuili,

611
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,890
her life wasn't going very well.

612
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,770
When I was her agent,

613
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,220
she didn't even have a formal job.

614
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,090
But last year she gave me a

615
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,450
New Year's call.

616
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,090
She told me she had found a job

617
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,500
and had a child.

618
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,850
Her life has stabilized.

619
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,790
If we approach her about this matter now,

620
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,120
wouldn't it be a bit...

621
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,640
We won't alarm anyone.

622
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Can we just talk to her privately?

623
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,320
Madam Mei has clearly expressed to me

624
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,250
that this matter happened a long time ago.

625
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,690
She doesn't want to reopen the case.

626
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,830
So I think

627
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,570
whatever Yang Cuili says,

628
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,840
it won't affect her future life

629
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,290
in any way.

630
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,250
Senior,

631
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,970
I think this is a burden

632
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,980
on Madam Mei's mind.

633
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,530
And since I'm her student,

634
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,290
I want to help her uncover the truth.

635
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,120
Alright.

636
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,840
I'll find a way to arrange a meeting with her for you.

637
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,800
Ms. Yang.

638
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,400
I apologize for suddenly visiting you that day.

639
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,810
It was indeed too presumptuous of me.

640
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
I want to say sorry to you

641
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,990
for my behavior,

642
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,800
and hope you can accept my apology.

643
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,080
If you're still concerned about that incident from back then,

644
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,200
I have nothing more to say.

645
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,690
Yang,

646
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,730
Madam Mei is also my teacher.

647
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,110
If she is truly innocent,

648
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,690
even from a bystander's perspective,

649
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,290
I hope you can say something.

650
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,120
Ms. Yang.

651
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,690
Although I'm here about Madam Mei's matter,

652
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,490
Madam Mei has been telling me

653
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,250
that she's against my investigation of this matter.

654
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,040
She says that after so many years,

655
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,250
you must have your own new life now.

656
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,770
She doesn't want me to

657
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,700
bring you a second round of hurt.

658
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,050
Since she said so,

659
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,000
why are you still here?

660
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,250
First, Madam Mei's husband back then

661
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,930
did indeed lose his life because of this incident.

662
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,320
And Madam Mei also lost

663
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,120
her lawyer's license because of this.

664
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,290
Moreover, after so many years,

665
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,970
this matter has been tormenting not only her,

666
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,040
but I believe, as a fellow woman,

667
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,770
it has been tormenting you as well.

668
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,530
You are a kind and courageous woman.

669
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,770
Otherwise, ten years ago,

670
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,210
you wouldn't have risked your reputation

671
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,490
to tell Madam Mei the truth.

672
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,840
I've already told you

673
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,170
back then,

674
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,920
it was Ms. Mei who taught me to say this.

675
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,490
Yang,

676
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,160
Ms. Luo contacted you

677
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,640
not because she wants you to change your statement in court,

678
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,210
nor will she tell

679
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,450
your husband and children about what happened in the past.

680
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,490
She just wants to help Madam Mei.

681
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,500
I don’t believe it.

682
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,530
I don’t trust anything any of you say.

683
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,170
Senior,

684
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,290
can I speak with Ms. Yang alone?

685
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,640
Alright, you two talk.

686
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,350
Thank you.

687
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,450
Ms. Yang.

688
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,530
This is a personal letter of commitment she has issued.

689
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,700
You can take a look at it.

690
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,450
She just wants to know the truth.

691
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,680
She promised she absolutely won't try to reopen the case,

692
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,590
nor will she leak this matter.

693
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,730
She also told me

694
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,080
that in this society,

695
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,210
a woman is most easily

696
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,120
destroyed by so-called reputation.

697
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,290
So she particularly understands

698
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,640
why you choose to keep this matter confidential.

699
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,290
If you're willing to give her the truth,

700
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,630
she will forever

701
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,580
choose to remain silent about this matter.

702
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,470
If you're still not at ease,

703
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,840
I can put my personal information

704
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,520
and signature on it.

705
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,800
Why didn't she come herself?

706
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,340
Madam Mei was afraid that seeing her might put pressure on you.

707
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,670
She said that even though so many years have passed,

708
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,880
she's still very afraid

709
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,280
that if you two sit face to face,

710
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,360
you may not

711
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,300
be able to handle it.

712
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,480
If I tell you,

713
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,550
can we put this matter behind us?

714
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,520
Yes.

715
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,150
Here's the letter of commitment.

716
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,840
The choice is yours.

717
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,320
Madam Mei.

718
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,810
Why are you here?

719
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,860
Why didn't you inform us?

720
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,940
It was Yingzi who sent me here.

721
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,030
She said to listen to a story

722
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,290
with all the partners of Liangcheng Law Firm?

723
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,560
A story?

724
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,850
What story?

725
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,790
Let's talk in the conference room.

726
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,410
Alright.

727
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,210
Madam Mei,

728
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,750
all the partners are here.

729
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,490
Let's begin

730
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,960
to hear the story, okay?

731
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,290
It was like this.

732
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,860
One day, ten years ago,

733
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,320
On September 21st,

734
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,490
which was a Monday,

735
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,360
Liangcheng Law Firm

736
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,230
received a very special client.

737
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,770
She was the victim

738
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,400
of a rape case that Madam Mei and his husband once represented.

739
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,690
Her name was Yang Cuili.

740
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,210
At that time, the rape case was about to go to trial.

741
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,870
Yang Cuili has already provided testimony that it was a transaction,

742
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,000
not rape.

743
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,250
However, she was under immense psychological pressure,

744
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
so she wanted to come to Madam Mei

745
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,560
for some psychological comfort.

746
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,690
But unfortunately,

747
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,360
Mr. Yu Daliang was on a business trip that day.

748
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,490
Although Madam Mei was in the law firm's office

749
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,050
all day long,

750
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,940
she never saw Yang Cuili.

751
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,080
Instead, many people in this conference room now

752
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,940
saw Yang Cuili that day.

753
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,530
Everyone should still remember, right?

754
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,090
I've never seen this person.

755
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,390
I... I only learned about her

756
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,080
after Madam Mei's incident.

757
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:24,730
Mr. Han,

758
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,400
you didn't see her that day

759
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,870
because that day,

760
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,780
you were caught up with another matter.

761
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,980
What matter? I don't remember.

762
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,800
Chen Chen.

763
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,260
Do you remember this name?

764
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,300
What does it have to do with her?

765
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,690
Early that day,

766
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,250
Chen Chen, who has now resigned,

767
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,360
went to Madam Mei to cry and complain.

768
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,970
Don't say anything yet.

769
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,800
Let her finish speaking, okay?

770
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,600
Alright, go on, continue.

771
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
Those harassing messages Director Han sent me.

772
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,880
I still have them to this day.

773
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,530
I really can't take it anymore.

774
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,070
Don't make false accusations.

775
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,840
You girls are just young,

776
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,040
and neurotic.

777
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,420
I want to talk to you about work.

778
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,400
You call that harassment?

779
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,690
Then don't work anymore in the future.

780
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,770
Madam Mei!

781
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,830
The reason for her tearful complaint is

782
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,750
she claims to have been harassed multiple times by Mr. Han.

783
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,790
After Madam Mei learned about this,

784
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,880
she called Mr. Han to her office.

785
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,600
It was precisely at this moment that Yang Cuili arrived.

786
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,800
Hello, ma'am.

787
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,400
Who are you looking for?

788
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,400
Hello.

789
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,120
Hello.

790
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
I'm looking for Mr. Yu Daliang.

791
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,040
I'm sorry,

792
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,210
Mr. Yu is on a business trip and not in the office.

793
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,460
Then, what about Ms. Mei?

794
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,300
Well, in that case,

795
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,640
please have a seat on the sofa.

796
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,490
I'll ask for you.

797
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,430
Madam Mei,

798
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,410
the receptionist called to inform you that day.

799
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,210
Did you know the person coming was Yang Cuili?

800
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,120
At that time, I was only told

801
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,420
that a client wanted to see me.

802
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,790
I was entangled with Mr. Han's matter.

803
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,600
They were reluctant to apologize at the time,

804
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,040
and the other party wanted to file a complaint with the bar association.

805
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,610
So it was at a standstill.

806
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,750
I sent my assistant to the front desk.

807
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,880
She did go,

808
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,550
but didn't resolve the issue.

809
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,770
Instead, it drew others' attention.

810
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,040
Ms. Yang, you're here.

811
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,490
You're looking for Director Mei?

812
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,970
Yes, is she in?

813
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
She's busy at the moment and can't get away.

814
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,020
Do you have any business with her?

815
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,730
It's nothing major.

816
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,130
If it's not urgent, perhaps you could

817
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,310
come back another day?

818
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,490
Yang Cuili couldn't find Madam Mei.

819
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,040
She didn't know what to do.

820
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,560
The case was about to go to trial.

821
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,360
She didn't know what consequences

822
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,320
her testimony would bring her.

823
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,230
Just as she was disappointedly

824
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,210
about to leave Liangcheng Law Firm,

825
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,390
someone appeared.

826
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,640
Miss Yang,

827
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,580
hello, Miss Yang.

828
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,250
I'm Director Mei's student.

829
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,070
I'm Zhang Zhi.

830
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,970
Director Mei is a bit busy.

831
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,170
She'll be free shortly.

832
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,860
She asked me to receive you for now.

833
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,600
He led Yang Cuili to the reception room.

834
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,290
There,

835
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,290
Yang Cuili saw many more people.

836
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,320
The photos of everyone present here,

837
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,040
I have confirmed them all with Ms. Yang Cuili.

838
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,930
She recognized all of you.

839
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,290
Which means that morning,

840
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,730
all of you

841
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,490
appeared before her.

842
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,250
Although you said different things,

843
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,560
the central idea was the same:

844
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,360
if her latest testimony

845
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,980
differs from what she previously gave to the police,

846
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,850
then she will bear the legal responsibility

847
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,990
for committing perjury,

848
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,520
facing up to three years in prison.

849
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,840
All of this would be written in the verdict

850
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,870
and made public.

851
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,250
Ms. Yang Cuili would have to leave

852
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,160
this city where she had finally settled down,

853
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,930
and face the contempt of her family and friends.

854
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,810
I came back today,

855
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,530
firstly, not to overturn the case,

856
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,610
secondly,

857
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,800
not to settle scores with everyone.

858
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,710
I just want to know the truth.

859
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,250
If one person is dissatisfied

860
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,730
and acts that way,

861
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,120
it might be their problem.

862
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,170
But if everyone does it without prior agreement,

863
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,850
then it's definitely our problem.

864
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,360
Today, while we're here,

865
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,360
let's take this opportunity

866
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,880
to talk it out.

867
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,990
Alright, I'll go first.

868
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,680
Madam Mei,

869
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,810
when I was in school,

870
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,290
you were my mentor.

871
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,040
When I was preparing for the bar exam,

872
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,770
you gave me a lot of help.

873
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,690
Not to mention when I was struggling in my career,

874
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,120
you brought me into Liangcheng Law Firm.

875
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,290
It's no exaggeration to say

876
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,650
that without your help in the past,

877
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,090
there wouldn't be the me of today.

878
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,560
However,

879
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,480
you and Mr. Yu,

880
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:15,989
don't you

881
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,520
realize how you were

882
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,060
at Liangcheng Law Firm back then?

883
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,480
What about us?

884
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,260
You were arbitrary,

885
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,909
domineering,

886
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,650
and inflexible.

887
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,400
Even though we were no longer young,

888
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,090
even though we've achieved success in our careers,

889
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,090
in front of you two,

890
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,570
in your eyes,

891
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,370
we were still just followers.

892
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,330
If we didn't obey you,

893
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,710
it would become treason.

894
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,480
That's right.

895
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,050
Madam Mei,

896
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,679
you've probably forgotten about that incident.

897
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,909
That is the contract dispute case

898
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,659
of Dongfang Electronics versus

899
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,880
Tongda Trading Company.

900
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,470
I brought in this case,

901
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,260
and I was the lead on it.

902
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,090
I just had some opinions

903
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,000
about the distribution ratio.

904
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,650
Mr. Yu, during the morning meeting,

905
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,770
in front of all the lawyers in the firm,

906
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,820
berated me harshly,

907
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,510
showing no mercy at all.

908
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,840
But later, what we allocated to you

909
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,130
was even more than what you had asked for.

910
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,650
But what I cared about

911
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,690
wasn't the extra money you gave,

912
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,690
but my trampled self-esteem.

913
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,410
And I,

914
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,000
during my promotion to partner,

915
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,290
you and Mr. Yu repeatedly said I lacked experience,

916
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,580
and insufficient revenue generation.

917
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,650
But the real reason

918
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,320
was that I often liked to contradict you both.

919
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,520
You two wanted to teach me a lesson,

920
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,540
didn't you?

921
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,000
We still made you a partner.

922
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,880
That was only after I

923
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,960
apologized to your faces and admitted my mistakes.

924
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,440
Madam Mei, have you ever considered

925
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,210
how humiliated I felt

926
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,660
when I had to apologize to you?

927
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,550
What about you, Fang Lihong?

928
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,090
You're the one we admire the most.

929
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,250
We even made you a founding partner.

930
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,270
You don't hold any grudges against us, do you?

931
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,000
Madam Mei,

932
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,920
I think even now,

933
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,090
you still haven't realized

934
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,800
the problem with you and Mr. Yu.

935
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,920
You think that if you do someone a favor,

936
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,390
they should be eternally grateful to you.

937
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:46,800
True,

938
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,330
I am a founding partner.

939
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,690
But do I have the rights of a founding partner?

940
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,360
In every partners' meeting,

941
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,050
doesn't Mr. Yu start,

942
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,120
and you conclude?

943
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,870
Anything said by others in between

944
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,780
is treated like thin air.

945
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,230
And then,

946
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,000
that Yang Cuili appeared.

947
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:14,960
Is that so?

948
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,870
Yes.

949
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,880
But none of us

950
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,450
had any intention

951
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,140
of framing you two.

952
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,730
We just didn't expect

953
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,520
it would lead to such a tragic outcome.

954
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,610
We all feel deeply, deeply sorry for this.

955
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,570
Is this the whole truth?

956
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,660
Of course.

957
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,520
This is not the whole truth.

958
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,770
Then tell me,

959
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,360
what is the truth?

960
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,170
Was your motivation really just because

961
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,990
Madam Mei and Mr. Yu

962
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,790
had all the power in the law firm

963
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,370
and didn't give you any autonomy?

964
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,460
It's not that exaggerated,

965
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,160
but basically,

966
00:37:59,250 --> 00:37:59,900
that's how it was.

967
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,000
This matter

968
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,150
can't be that simple, can it?

969
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,610
Since Madam Mei has said

970
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,610
we should be open today,

971
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,880
I admit

972
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,890
it was because the firm was facing huge risks.

973
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,840
Just huge risks?

974
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,770
Not huge benefits?

975
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,520
Can you not use your values

976
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,480
to judge everything, Yingzi?

977
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,990
The Zhucheng Case back then

978
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,050
had enormous benefits,

979
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,320
but we had no right to distribute them.

980
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,650
However,

981
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,200
we had to bear huge risks.

982
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,960
We were forced to make these small moves.

983
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,340
There's nothing wrong with admitting this.

984
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,440
Let me say it.

985
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,110
The Zhucheng Case had huge benefits.

986
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,780
The management fee eventually exceeded 50 million.

987
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,270
But Madam Mei and Mr. Yu

988
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,730
preferred to cooperate with Xu Zhuo

989
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
rather than using our own people.

990
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,130
Yes, Madam Mei,

991
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,720
you also know

992
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,840
that at the time, the Zhucheng Case

993
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,100
was taken on in the name of Liangcheng Law Firm.

994
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,960
If any problems arose,

995
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,400
not just you and Mr. Yu,

996
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,510
but we, as partners of Liangcheng,

997
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,320
would all have to jointly bear

998
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,480
the risk of paying huge compensation.

999
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,350
We couldn't get a share of the huge benefits,

1000
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,910
but we had to jointly bear the huge risks.

1001
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:43,960
On what grounds?

1002
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,480
So we chose to take the risk

1003
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,410
into our own hands.

1004
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,070
But at that time, you

1005
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,090
didn't understand the situation of the Zhucheng Case.

1006
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,480
Who was the one who leaked the information?

1007
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,050
Can you tell us now?

1008
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
At this point, there's nothing that can't be said.

1009
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,030
It was Xu Zhuo.

1010
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,550
This is

1011
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,610
a fact I've always been unwilling to believe.

1012
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,520
In the Zhucheng Case,

1013
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,840
we worked so well with Xu Zhuo,

1014
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,400
and our interests were aligned.

1015
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,620
But why would he betray us?

1016
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,760
Madam Mei,

1017
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,980
it seems you don't know Xu Zhuo well enough.

1018
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,840
Back then,

1019
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,390
his law firm had just been established.

1020
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,130
It couldn't withstand any turbulence.

1021
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,190
But your actions and Mr. Yu's

1022
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,000
essentially dragged him into

1023
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,090
a deep quagmire.

1024
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,650
Do you think he was willing to take such a risk?

1025
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,840
So that day,

1026
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,180
when Madam Mei was entangled

1027
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,610
with Mr. Han's matter,

1028
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,610
you all gathered together.

1029
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,840
It wasn't just to vent your dissatisfaction with Madam Mei and Mr. Yu.

1030
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,880
You were also discussing

1031
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,940
what to do about the Zhucheng Case.

1032
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,980
It was at this moment that Yang Cuili appeared.

1033
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,730
You discovered a perfect opportunity

1034
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,210
to easily bring down both Madam Mei and Mr. Yu,

1035
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,250
and take the Zhucheng Case from their hands.

1036
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,620
Of course,

1037
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,690
when an avalanche happens,

1038
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,770
no snowflake

1039
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,070
thinks it’s to blame.

1040
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,050
When the two of them fell,

1041
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,990
their former disciples swarmed in,

1042
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,520
snatching away their cases,

1043
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,570
depriving them of their interests,

1044
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,050
even including their means of livelihood

1045
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:48,920
and their lives.

1046
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,090
Each one of you here

1047
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,320
should be held responsible for this.

1048
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,290
I don't accept such accusations.

1049
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,250
I believe I only said what was responsible

1050
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,340
for the law firm and that girl

1051
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,530
at the appropriate time.

1052
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,000
If I've let Madam Mei down,

1053
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,440
I admit,

1054
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,730
as Madam Mei's most trusted student

1055
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,290
and collaborator,

1056
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,190
I should have been the first

1057
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,730
to inform Madam Mei about this matter.

1058
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,540
That's all.

1059
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,050
All these years,

1060
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,230
I've been reflecting on myself.

1061
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,730
Our tyranny,

1062
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,090
our arrogance,

1063
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,170
our

1064
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,380
disregard for others,

1065
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,320
and the harm we've caused to others.

1066
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,260
Here,

1067
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,090
I apologize to everyone.

1068
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,480
I accept the punishment fate has given me.
