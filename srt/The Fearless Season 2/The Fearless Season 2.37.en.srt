[Episode 37]

3
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,560
To be honest,

4
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,920
regardless of Chen Shuo,

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,789
I also don't quite agree with Li Yuan's way

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,789
of handling this matter.

7
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,200
No matter what,

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,610
the man has been lying there for just half a year,

9
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,759
and now she wants to give up on treatment

10
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,610
and let him pass away.

11
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,610
What if he never wakes up?

12
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,530
Even if he really never wakes up,

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,960
I still think that Li Yuan's actions

14
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,080
are a bit too heartless.

15
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,720
Then what do you mean?

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
What I mean is that

17
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,970
I won't be involved in it.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,210
If I can't be convinced,

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,370
the effect of being her representative might be greatly diminished.

20
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,920
-Got it.
-Good morning.

21
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,870
Xia Shu.

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,430
Good morning.

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,290
Come over here.

24
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,520
I need to discuss something with you.

25
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,520
It's about Li Yuan's case.

26
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,750
Qiu Hua just talked to me about it.

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,870
For now, she's still

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,840
unable to accept Li Yuan's

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,190
way of handling this matter.

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
So, how about you and I

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,829
become her representatives in this case?

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,480
Mom, I need to go to the office.

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,000
What would you like to eat for lunch? I can order it for you.

34
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,050
Thank you, but there's no need.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
I've already ordered food at the hospital.

36
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,220
Mom, everything else is fine.

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,120
After I leave,

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,840

You don't need to remind me like this every time.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,190
We've been collaborating on this for a long time.

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,230
I know that in two hours...

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,840
To be precise,

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
in 1 hour and 40 minutes,

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,870
I'll need to turn him over.

46
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,260
Alright. Go on with your work.

47
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,120
Call me if you need anything.

48
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,730
Okay.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,560
Ms. Luo.

50
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,430
Why are you here?

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,230
We made a call to your company.

52
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,400
They said you were here.

53
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,980
So I thought I should come over here

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,510
and learn about the situation.

55
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,340
Mom.

They are the lawyers I've hired.

This is Ms. Luo, and this is Ms. Xia.

58
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,300
Hello.

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,760
Hello.

Hello, lawyers.

61

Who is this?

62
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,150
He's my husband, Yuan Gang.

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,800
He looks like he's just sleeping.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,240
He's just sleeping.

65
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,380
He will wake up sooner or later.

66
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,180
Look how rosy his complexion is.

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,310
He doesn't look like a patient at all.

68
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,400
Compared with his situation when he first returned to the country,

69
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,130
he's really much better now.

Some visitors are here to see you.

73
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,400
Yuan Gang, can you hear me?

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Some visitors are here to see you.

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,710
Excuse me. I need to step out for a moment.

76
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,650
I'll wait for you outside.

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,240
I have something to discuss with Ms. Li.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,590
I'll wait for you outside first.

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,020
Okay.

80
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,900
Alright.

81
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,560
Mom, I'll leave now.

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,630
Xia Shu.

83
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,190
What's wrong?

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,240
Luo.

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,390
I know why Ms. Cui

86
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,830
is unwilling to give up.

87
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,640
Her son is just lying there with a rosy complexion,

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,510
as if he could wake up at any moment.

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,100
How could she possibly give up?

90
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,430
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,870
According to the situation we saw just now,

92
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,130
Mr. Yuan was lying there with a good complexion.

93
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,480
Are you sure he won't wake up again?

94
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,310
Let me take you to meet

95
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,680
Yuan Gang's attending doctor.

96
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,360
Okay.

97
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,750
Let's go.

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,510
To be precise,

99
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,159
Yuan Gang is not in a vegetative state.

100
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,250
He's actually suffering from brain death.

101
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,140
He has no autonomous respiration.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,480
What's lying in the hospital bed now

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
is just a body

104
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,780
that is breathing with the help of machines.

105
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
In fact,

106
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,800
when Ms. Li brought him back from abroad,

107
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,830
he could no longer be considered as a living person.

108
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,310
He has been lying in our hospital for over three months.

109
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,900
His brain waves have never shown any signs of activity.

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,900
But with the advancement of modern medicine,

111
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,940
is there a possibility that he might wake up one day?

112
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,520
There won't be any miracles in brain death.

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,190
If we remove the respirator now,

114
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,630
within a few minutes,

115
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,480
even his body will die.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,870
Keeping him alive in this way

117
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,590
will cost a huge price.

118
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,540
Look. Besides the medical costs,

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,990
there are also labor costs.

120
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,340
He needs to be

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,670
turned over every two hours.

122
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,870
He's completely dependent

123
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,560
on others to poop and pee.

124
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,900
More importantly,

125
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,650
this won't bring him back to life.

126
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,230
From a modern medical perspective,

127
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,590
he's already dead.

128
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,630
Are you two still willing to be my representatives?

129
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,630
If not,

130
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,050
I can find someone else.

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,950
Ms. Li.

132
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,030
If you choose to give up now,

133
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,010
will you be okay with that?

134
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,920
Will you have the feeling

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,920
of betraying your past relationship?

136
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Do you think I'm doing all these things

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,360
just for myself?

138
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,430
Let me tell you something about Yuan Gang and me.

139
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,120
Once,

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,920
we went to climb a snowy mountain abroad.

141
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,100
Unexpectedly, we encountered a blizzard on the mountain

142
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
and had to spend the night there.

143
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,680
Although we weren't novices in outdoor activities,

144
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,510
on that day, we both felt that

145
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,830
we were surely going to die.

146
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,850
At that moment, I asked Yuan Gang,

147
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,800
"We're always pushing our limits

148
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,000
and risking our lives like this.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Do you think it's worth it?"

150
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,830
Yuan Gang said if he could live again,

151
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,430
he would make the same choices.

152
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,690
At that time, we made a promise to each other.

153
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,430
If both of us could survive back then,

154
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,680
and if one day in the future,

155
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,120
we should encounter today's situation,

156
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
one of us would have to take responsibility for the other,

157
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
and when it's time to give up, we should give up.

158
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,370
I know this is a tough choice,

159
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,730
and I'll have to bear it for a lifetime.

160
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,080
But I'm willing to bear the consequences.

161
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,630
I have to let him pass away with dignity.

162
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,030
Ms. Li.

163
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,780
You are truly remarkable.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Don't worry.

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,270
We've decided that

166
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,390
we will represent your case.

167
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,480
And we will do our best

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,190
to help you win this lawsuit.

169
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
We hope to fulfill Mr. Yuan Gang's wishes.

170
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,630
Thank you.

171
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,390
Thank you, ladies.

172
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I won't see you out then.

173
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,040
I still need to handle some paperwork for Yuan Gang.

174
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,310
Take good care of yourself, too.

175
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,320
Bye.

176
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,270
Let's go.

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,610
No. 47.

178
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,270
No. 46.

179
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,120
-Is it here?
-This is No. 46.

180
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,040
There. That one over there.

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,830
Yes, it's this one.

182
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,600
Ms. Cui.

183
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,490
You're here.

184
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,850
Come on. Come in, please.

185
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,120
Yuan Gang.

186
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,039
My son.

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,049
Look at his complexion.

188
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,320
He doesn't look like a patient, does he?

189
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,320
No, he doesn't.

190
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,390
Come on. Please have a seat.

191
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,860
Okay.

192
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,650
Sit down.

193
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Come on.

194
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,630
There are even blankets here.

195
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,750
You're living here, aren't you?

196
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Yes. Li Yuan and I take turns to look after him.

197
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,120
He needs to be scrubbed twice a day.

198
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,670
However, we need to massage him

199
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,550
and turn him over every two hours.

200
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,550
Otherwise, his muscles will atrophy

201
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,840
or he'll have bedsores.

202
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Come on. Please sit down now.

203
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,360
Okay.

204
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,170
So, you have to do this every two hours?

205
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,050
Yes, yes.

206
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,040
Then can you manage that?

207
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,870
Yes, I can.

208
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,380
I enjoy doing it.

209
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,020
To bring him up,

210
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,630
I already took care of him like this

211
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,890
when he was a kid.

212
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Now it feels like

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,110
I'm back to those days when he was a kid again.

214
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,790
It's alright.

215
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,270
Gentlemen, thank you

216
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,370
for coming here to help me despite your busy schedules.

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,510
Please don't say that.

218
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,790
Ms. Cui.

219
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,910
I just think if this continues,

220
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,100
it will be very tiring for you.

221
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,170
Mr. Xue,

222
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,490
you only saw the hardship I had to go through.

223
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,200
But you haven't noticed that behind this,

224
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,790
there is also joy for me.

225
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,840
Yuan Gang's father

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,980
passed away when he was 12 years old.

227
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,040
After that,

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,240
we lived together.

229
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,550
I was a teacher by profession.

230
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,360
I'm well aware that as a single mother who raises a son,

231
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,320
it's necessary to cultivate his independent personality.

232
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,270
So, as soon as he got into university,

233
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,150
I asked him to move out and live alone

234
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,510
so that he could face the society

235
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,030
and deal with difficulties and challenges by himself.

236
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,510
He was quite capable.

237
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,610
As he knew that life wasn't easy for me,

238
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,030
when he had the opportunity to study abroad later,

239
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,790
he didn't go, and he just gave up.

240
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,600
After they got married,

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
they bought a small house for me

242
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,880
right next to their new house

243
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,790
so that when he was free,

244
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,590
he could often come to visit me.

245
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,810
I'm just thinking that

246
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,630
after such a serious accident,

247
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,870
the reason why he's not willing to give up on his own life

248
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,030
might be that he's worried about me.

249
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,120
He can't bear to let me

250
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,120
live alone in this world.

251
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,900
Ms. Cui,

252
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,870
we've also

253
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,030
learned some information indirectly.

254
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,840
As husband and wife,

255
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
Li Yuan and Yuan Gang

256
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,390
might have made some agreements before.

257
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,780
For example, if such a situation occurs,

258
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,550
they'll be willing to give up active treatment

259
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,320
to end their lives.

260
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,950
I don't believe it.

261
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,460
Yuan Gang has never said such things to me.

262
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,610
But there is one thing I know.

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,160
Because of scuba diving,

264
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,720
they both

265
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,670
bought a huge amount of personal accident insurance.

266
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,550
They're beneficiaries mutually.

267
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,070
I don't mean anything else.

268
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,550
I just want to tell you a fact.

269
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,060
They both bought a huge amount of insurance.

270
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,080
I got it.

271
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
Then how is their relationship?

272
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,240
It was fine before the accident.

273
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,610
They could have fun together.

274
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,310
If it weren't for Li Yuan's influence,

275
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,910
I believe that there were many things

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,760
my son wouldn't have done.

277
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,850
For example?

278
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
For example, scuba diving

279
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,970
and being childless by choice.

280
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,090
He's my only son.

281
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,510
He knows I love children very much.

282
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,950
But as Li Yuan didn't want to have children,

283
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,450
they just gave up on the idea.

284
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,320
So, I think my son loves Li Yuan

285
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,440
more than Li Yuan loves him.

286
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,890
Why are you saying that?

287
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,930
I'll tell you this even if you might laugh at it.

288
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,270
After they got married,

289
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,320
they still had their own friends of the opposite gender.

290
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
After I learned about this,

291
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,390
I had several serious talks with Yuan Gang.

292
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,550
Later he said, "Mom, don't interfere anymore."

293
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,030
"This is Li Yuan's idea."

294
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,720
He said, "People of your generation can't understand

295
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,030
our generation's values and views on the world

296
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,820
and romantic love."

297
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
I thought since it was Li Yuan's idea,

298
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,510
I shouldn't pry too much.

299
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,870
If

300
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,180
it's really like what Li Yuan said,

301
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,870
and she loves Yuan Gang so much,

302
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,900
why is she so eager to get rid of this burden?

303
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,080
Why is she in such a hurry to terminate the treatment?

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,080
There's something I have to say.

305
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,000
Otherwise, I'll be overwhelmed.

306
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,640
Go ahead.

307
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,910
Is Luo Yingzi now

308
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,650
determined to represent Li Yuan's case?

309
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,510
Couples are like birds in the same forest,

310
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,890
but they tend to fly apart when a disaster occurs.

311
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,960
Mentor, here's your coffee.

312
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,510
It's hot.

313
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,030
Thank you.

314
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,850
He's been lying in hospital for just half a year.

315
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,270
Now I really want to know

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,670
whether Luo Yingzi is representing this case

317
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,620
just to earn some agency fees

318
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,200
or because of her sincere approval

319
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,480
of Li Yuan's ideas.

320
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,240
If she approves of...

321
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,030
Alright. Can we stop talking about this?

322
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,260
Mr. Xue.

323
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,240
I think Ms. Luo is quite professional actually.

324
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,720
She's just representing a case, isn't she?

325
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,280
I acknowledge that she's professional.

326
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,750
I think if you two

327
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,270
are representing the same case simultaneously,

328
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,640
it will definitely affect your relationship.

329
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,460
Alright.

330
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,360
I still have something to do nearby.

331
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm not going back with you.

332
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
I'll drive you there.

333
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,210
No need. It's just nearby.

334
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,790
Mentor.

335
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't listen to Mr. Xue.

336
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,510
I think it's understandable that

337
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,670
Ms. Cui have doubts about

338
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,510
her daughter-in-law's actions.

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,390
But if she doubts the love between them

340
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:37,970
or even thinks that

341
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,520
her daughter-in-law is doing this because of his personal insurance,

342
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,390
that's... that's a bit too much.

343
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,480
Mentor.

344
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,060
Are we still going ahead with that case?

345
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,560
Yes.

346
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll not only go on with it

347
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,970
but also do it well and win.

348
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,720
Regarding the dispute between the applicant, Cui Weizhen, and the respondent,

349
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,910
Li Yuan, about the revocation of guardianship,

350
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,960
court is now in session.

351
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,670
Article 18 of the General Principles of Civil Law stipulates that

352
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,000
when a guardian seriously harms

353
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,240
the physical and mental health of the ward,

354
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,720
causing the ward to be in a state of distress,

355
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,440
or committing other acts that seriously infringe on

356
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,110
the legitimate rights and interests of the ward,

357
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,270
the People's Court shall, upon application

358
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,900
by relevant individuals or organizations,

359
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
revoke the guardian's qualifications.

360
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,720
In this case,

361
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,750
the respondent, Li Yuan,

362
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,360
despite having the ability to pay for Yuan Gang's medical expenses

363
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,320
and clearly knowing that once the treatment is stopped,

364
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,910
Mr. Yuan Gang will die immediately,

365
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,630
she has still explicitly requested

366
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
to terminate the treatment on him.

367
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,390
As she either hopes for or allows

368
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,840
the occurrence of his death,

369
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,720
it'll seriously harm Mr. Yuan Gang's

370
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,980
rights of survival as a human being.

371
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,320
Therefore, the applicant requests

372
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,710
to revoke Li Yuan's guardianship of Yuan Gang

373
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,900
and designate Cui Weizhen

374
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,510
as Yuan Gang's guardian.

375
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,550
It's justified according to the law and should be supported.

376
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,550
Since the accident happened to Yuan Gang, the respondent

377
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,440
has been doing her best to fulfill her duties as a guardian.

378
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,000
The applicant's claim that

379
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,720
she neglected her obligations

380
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,930
or even harmed Yuan Gang's interests is not true.

381
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,870
In the rescue and treatment

382
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,000
of Mr. Yuan Gang,

383
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,120
she has fully and responsibly carried out

384
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,510
her duties as a guardian.

385
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,630
Both Yuan Gang's domestic and foreign attending doctors

386
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,870
have declared his brain death,

387
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,320
hoping that the respondent

388
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,600
can respect her own wishes

389
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,080
and give up on futile treatment.

390
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
Facing someone who is in a coma

391
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
with heartbeats and respiration,

392
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,270
and even has emotional communication

393
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,360
with the applicant sometimes,

394
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,950
we're discussing

395
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,040
whether he's dead or not here.

396
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,380
Don't you think it's cruel?

397
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,000
Is he dead?

398
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,160
No, he is not.

399
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,390
Mr. Yuan Gang is not dead.

400
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,320
At this very moment,

401
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,120
he's lying in a hospital bed

402
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,260
which is less than ten kilometers away from this courtroom,

403
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,790
and he's fighting hard against death.

404
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,480
But I've found something so regrettable.

405
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,080
Why is someone so eager

406
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,760
to end his life?

407
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,070
Mr. Yuan Gang

408
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,980
is only 34 years old.

409
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
All his physical indicators and functions are good.

410
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,240
With proper care,

411
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,080
he can live for many more years.

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,030
So for such a living person,

413
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,110
why should we...

414
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,840
or who has the right

415
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,820
to end his life?

416
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,290
Who has the right?

417
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,550
May I ask the applicant something?

418
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,550
You mentioned that between you and Mr. Yuan Gang,

419
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,270
there was still emotional communication.

420
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,440
Do you have any evidence?

421
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,069
Yes.

422
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,970
I saw him smile at me.

423
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,829
He was wearing a respirator.

424
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,440
How could he smile at you?

425
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,470
This is a kind of

426
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,800
smile that only a mother can see.

427
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,829
As for this emotional communication between you and him,

428
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,640
apart from you,

429
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
no one else has ever seen it.

430
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,680
Wasn't that just your own illusion?

431
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,830
It was not an illusion.

432
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,830
I... I perceived it.

433
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,210
I perceived it.

434
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,880
In fact, the focus of this case is

435
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,200
whether Mr. Yuan Gang has already died.

436
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,750
If he's not dead yet,

437
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,200
then all of us sitting here and participating

438
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,070
in the discussion today

439
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,640
could be called murderers.

440
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,160
If he's already dead,

441
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,110
what we need to discuss now is

442
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,140
whether to let him pass away with dignity

443
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,270
and to exempt the living people

444
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,550
from unnecessary obligations to a corpse.

445
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,310
Is Mr. Yuan Gang dead?

446
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,830
Of course, he is already dead.

447
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,050
Both the domestic and foreign hospitals

448
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,610
have repeatedly diagnosed him with brain death.

449
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,030
If the applicant is willing to admit,

450
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,000
she should remember that

451
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,640
after the hospital concluded that Mr. Yuan Gang

452
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,830
was already brain dead,

453
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,750
she didn't want to accept it.

454
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,110
She invited experts from outside the hospital for three more consultations.

455
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,270
The conclusion was the same

456
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,210
in these three consultations.

457
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,250
Mr. Yuan Gang is already brain dead.

458
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,880
According to modern medical diagnostic standards,

459
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,460
Mr. Yuan Gang is already dead.

460
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,480
We understand that the applicant in this case

461
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,720
has a deep bond with Mr. Yuan Gang as his mother,

462
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,160
but emotions cannot replace science.

463
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,350
Since Mr. Yuan Gang is dead,

464
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,070
he cannot be revived due to the applicant's reluctance to let go.

465
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,440
The evidence we've just

466
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,590
presented to the court shows that

467
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,070
before his death, Mr. Yuan Gang

468
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,720
repeatedly and explicitly stated

469
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,880
on his social media accounts that

470
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,550
a person should live and die

471
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
with dignity.

472
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,070
Moreover, Mr. Yuan Gang

473
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,200
had an agreement with the respondent in this case.

474
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,400
If one day, either of them

475
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
should encounter a situation like this today,

476
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,270
one would have to assist the other

477
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,030
in passing away with dignity.

478
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Today, when modern medicine has already determined that

479
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,200
Mr. Yuan Gang is brain dead,

480
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,070
due to the love

481
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,930
between them,

482
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,350
and due to the promise they made to each other,

483
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,960
my client has decided to give up active treatment.

484
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,720
Letting Mr. Yuan Gang pass away with dignity

485
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,510
is her duty as a guardian

486
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,070
and is also her greatest love

487
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,160
for her beloved husband.

488
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,270
Dr. Lu,

489
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,770
do you think Mr. Yuan Gang is already dead?

490
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,030
According to modern medical standards,

491
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,030
Yuan Gang is already brain dead.

492
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,880
He has no autonomous respiration.

493
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,790
His brainstem reflexes are gone,

494
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,130
and his brain electrical activity has ceased.

495
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,720
What's more, he has been in this state

496
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,830
for half a year.

497
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,550
In other words, half a year ago,

498
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,010
he was already dead.

499
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,400
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

500
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,550
Then could you please tell everyone here

501
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,790
whether the condition you just described

502
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,510
can be called clinical death?

503
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,860
No, it cannot.

504
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,240
The so-called clinical death in medicine

505
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,750
refers to the cessation of heartbeats and respiration.

506
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,000
So in our country,

507
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,680
when the law declares that a person is dead,

508
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,840
which standard is used?

509
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,570
Is it clinical death or brain death?

510
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,060
It's clinical death.

511
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,840
Thus, we can't say that

512
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,070
Mr. Yuan Gang is already dead.

513
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,680
But from the perspective of modern medicine...

514
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,510
From a clinical standpoint,

515
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,510
Mr. Yuan Gang isn't dead, right?

516
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
You could say that.

517
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,030
So,

518
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,550
Mr. Yuan Gang is not dead.

519
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,880
He's not dead.

520
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,680
I have no more questions.

521
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,900
Dr. Lu,

522
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,550
traditionally in our country, clinical death

523
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,400
has been the standard for diagnosing death.

524
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,440
But now,

525
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,830
more and more hospitals

526
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,720
and family members are accepting brain death as the standard for death.

527
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,260
Is that right?

528
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,700
Yes.

529
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,440
In fact, compared with clinical death,

530
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,210
brain death is more in line with modern medical concepts.

531
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,580
If a person has been declared brain dead,

532
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,680
is there any possibility of waking him up again?

533
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,570
It's impossible.

534
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,680
The damage to the brain from brain death

535
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,640
is irreversible.

536
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,680
Once a person is brain dead,

537
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,620
even though his body hasn't died,

538
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
he absolutely cannot wake up again.

539
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,030
Then I have one last question.

540
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,650
What is the difference between

541
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,570
clinical death and brain death?

542
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,040
Just now, I already explained the criteria for

543
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,500
brain death and clinical death.

544
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,220
In terms of the biggest difference between them,

545
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,590
after a person has been declared brain dead,

546
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,680
through modern medical measures,

547
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,480
his body can still be maintained for several years

548
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,590
or even decades.

549
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,830
But this kind of forced medical treatment

550
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,820
is meaningless.

551
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,590
At least, a brain-dead patient

552
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,760
needs an able-bodied person to provide

553
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,290
continuous care 24 hours a day

554
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,710
for eating and excretion.

555
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,770
He even needs to be turned over

556
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,200
and scrubbed

557
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,240
every two hours.

558
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,510
Additionally, as Yuan Gang can't breathe on his own,

559
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,070
he must be admitted to a special care unit,

560
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,370
which is very expensive.

561
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,070
But more importantly,

562
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,250
this enormous effort is worthless,

563
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,660
because the patient can never recover.

564
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,480
It will also result in a huge waste of medical resources

565
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
and an unbearable burden on his family.

566
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,310
So, from our perspective,

567
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,040
it's meaningless.

568
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,640
Dr. Lu,

569
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,350
according to what you just said,

570
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,720
can I simply understand it in this way?

571
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,440
As long as a person has respiration and heartbeats,

572
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,110
we cannot declare that he's dead.

573
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,790
Is that right?

574
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,500
Yes.

575
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,680
So in this situation,

576
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,240
we must obtain

577
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,730
the consent of the patient's guardian.

578
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,550
If the guardian doesn't agree,

579
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,920
we can't give up treating the patient.

580
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,680
Dr. Lu, but as you mentioned just now,

581
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,070
Yuan Gang doesn't have autonomous respiration,

582
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,160
which means that he's relying on a respirator

583
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,240
to maintain his respiration, right?

584
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,990
Yes.

585
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,680
If we turn off the respirator,

586
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,070
his body will die within a few minutes.

587
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,330
I'm done with my questions.

588
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,640
Respondent, Ms. Li Yuan,

589
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,680
I want to ask whether you once purchased

590
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,110
a big amount of personal accident insurance for Mr. Yuan Gang.

591
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,060
Yes.

592
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
What's the total amount?

593
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
If the insured person dies in an accident,

594
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,400
the claim amount is 1.2 million yuan.

595
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,350
Who is the beneficiary?

596
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,810
I'm the beneficiary.

597
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,720
Ms. Li Yuan,

598
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,420
you claimed that after marriage,

599
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,070
your relationship with Mr. Yuan Gang was very good,

600
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,440
and you loved each other very much.

601
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,170
Was that true?

602
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,580
Of course.

603
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,350
The next question

604
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,310
is a bit sensitive,

605
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,890
but I still hope that you'll answer it honestly.

606
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,440
Have you ever

607
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,970
cheated on your husband?

608
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,550
No.

609
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,830
Do you have any male friends?

610
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,220
Your Honor,

611
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,230
we are now living in a modern society.

612
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,880
The respondent, Ms. Li Yuan,

613
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,530
is a professional woman.

614
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,010
How could she not have male friends?

615
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,240
The applicant's representative had an ulterior motive

616
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,920
to ask such a question.

617
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,640
Having friends of the opposite gender is normal.

618
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,750
But having intimate friends of the opposite gender

619
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,830
is not normal.

620
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,680
Respondent, Ms. Li Yuan,

621
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,920
please answer the question I asked just now.

622
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,580
During your marriage,

623
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,810
did you have any intimate friends of the opposite gender?

624
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,480
May I ask the applicant's representative something?

625
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,210
How do you define "intimate"?

626
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,960
For example, someone who could

627
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,830
handle insurance claims at the insurance company

628
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,640
on behalf of Ms. Li Yuan before Mr. Yuan Gang's death.

629
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
I know who you're talking about.

630
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,510
But I think your insinuations

631
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,350
are very despicable.

632
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,070
It's true that

633
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,440
I did ask a colleague of mine,

634
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,340
a man,

635
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,990
to help me handle insurance claims at the insurance company.

636
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,480
But that person was a mutual friend of Yuan Gang and me.

637
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
We used to have a get-together often.

638
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,120
Is... Is that strange?

639
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Personal accident insurance

640
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,030
is not only claimed at the time

641
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,270
of death,

642
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,380
but the insurance company's obligations also begin

643
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,520
when an accident occurs and treatment begins.

644
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,370
I had to take care of Yuan Gang in the hospital every day.

645
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,440
I... I didn't have time to handle these matters.

646
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,160
I asked my friend to help me.

647
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,230
Is... Is there a problem with that?

648
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,020
No, there isn't.

649
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,830
There's no problem. You don't have to be so agitated.

650
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm just asking.

651
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,270
This male friend of yours is single, right?

652
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,150
Yes.

653
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,030
He once chased you before you got married, right?

654
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,660
He once chased you.

655
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,190
Right?

656
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,110
Yes, so what?

657
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,330
What are you trying to imply?

658
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,720
May I ask what the applicant's representative is implying?

659
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,750
You're implying that the respondent had an affair

660
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,830
and terminated Mr. Yuan Gang's active treatment

661
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,030
for the 1.2 million yuan.

662
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,550
Right?

663
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,720
Then your side needs to provide concrete evidence.

664
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Otherwise, you're suspected of defamation.

665
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,990
At the same time, the court should note that

666
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,590
not only Mr. Yuan Gang

667
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,110
has a huge amount of personal accident insurance,

668
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,440
but Ms. Li Yuan also has it.

669
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,640
Yuan Gang is the beneficiary.

670
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,990
Moreover, a long time ago,

671
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,970
Ms. Li Yuan told Ms. Cui that

672
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,890
upon Mr. Yuan Gang's death,

673
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,110
she would be willing to give up

674
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,040
inheriting all of Yuan Gang's property.

675
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,010
Of course, this includes his accident insurance.

676
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,270
The words of the applicant's representative

677
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,480
have not only desecrated

678
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,590
the sincere love between Ms. Li Yuan and Mr. Yuan Gang with their five years of

679
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,790
dating relationship and seven years of marital relationship,

680
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,920
but also desecrated Mr. Yuan Gang himself.

681
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,880
Ms. Li Yuan,

682
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,390
do you love Mr. Yuan Gang very much?

683
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,160
Please don't laugh.

684
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,030
Answer my question.

685
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,520
Of course.

686
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,470
Of course.

687
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,150
You've just answered that you certainly love him very much.

688
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,810
Right?

689
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,960
Then I think it's very strange.

690
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,440
When Mr. Yuan Gang had just been in a coma for half a year,

691
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,960
why were you so heartless as to end his life?

692
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
The applicant's representative,

693
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,510
may I ask whether you believe that there's romantic love in this world?

694
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Do you believe it?

695
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,830
Do you believe that there's romantic love in this world

696
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,240
or do you believe that there is only plotting against

697
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,650
each other and exchanging benefits between people?

698
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,240
Why do you think that the actions others have taken for love

699
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,570
are just for the purpose

700
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
of money and benefits?

701
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,150
Or is this your principle to handle all issues

702
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,720
in your personal life?

703
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,640
Representative,

704
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,550
please don't express opinions

705
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,190
that are irrelevant to this case in court.

706
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,790
Your Honor,

707
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,160
it's been only half a year since Mr. Yuan Gang was declared brain dead.

708
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,000
But why does the respondent in this case

709
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,510
want to end his active treatment

710
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,400
just after this half a year?

711
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,560
It's because of love.

712
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,770
Because of Mr. Yuan Gang's and Ms. Li Yuan's

713
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,080
mutual understanding and love,

714
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,270
Ms. Li Yuan knows

715
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,420
how to show the utmost respect for Mr. Yuan Gang.

716
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,590
Mr. Yuan Gang is not in a coma.

717
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,920
He's suffering from brain death.

718
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,680
It is his own wish not to

719
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,230
live in this world as a body without emotions

720
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,020
or sensations, which is only capable of

721
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,240
breathing and excreting.

722
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,850
As his beloved wife who knows him the best

723
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,910
and loves him the most in this world,

724
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,350
the respondent in this case

725
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,010
is helping him fulfill his own wishes.

726
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,660
No one can understand how hard it was

727
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,410
for Ms. Li Yuan to make this decision.

728
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,120
She tried to help her husband get rid of the pain.

729
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,160
But meanwhile, she also put the heavy burden

730
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,510
on herself.

731
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,680
Maybe many years later,

732
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,770
she will also ask herself

733
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,960
whether the decision she made back then

734
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,250
was the best

735
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,240
and the rightest choice.

736
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,040
But under that condition at that time,

737
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,370
what was the best choice?

738
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,650
The respondent in this case

739
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,230
is in good financial condition.

740
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,720
And Mr. Yuan Gang

741
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,510
also has substantial assets.

742
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,440
If she keeps him alive in this way,

743
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,520
for the respondent,

744
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,750
she'll be able to do it quite easily.

745
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,500
But she can't do that.

746
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,160
She must not do that.

747
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,720
The reason is that she loves Yuan Gang.

748
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,910
She respects Yuan Gang's choice.

749
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,720
She doesn't want Yuan Gang

750
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,520
to go against his own wishes.

751
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,190
She doesn't want him to stay alive just as the symbol

752
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,530
of being faithful in love.

753
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,250
Do either of you have anything to add?

754
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,050
No.

755
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,560
The judge is asking if you have anything to add.

756
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,060
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes, we do.

757
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,270
We would like to submit a video

758
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,680
as additional evidence.

759
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,020
Your Honor, the court-designated period for presenting evidence

760
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
has already expired.

761
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,590
We object to their submission of evidence in court.

762
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,640
Your Honor,

763
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,510
the applicant in this case

764
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,000
is not very familiar with modern

765
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
technological products,

766
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,000
so this video

767
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,180
has just been restored with our help.

768
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,000
It is of great help

769
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,030
in clarifying the facts of this case.

770
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,570
Therefore, we strongly request that

771
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,170
the court should allow us to present it.

772
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,300
Mom, I'm sorry.

773
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,400
When you're sick.

774
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,640
I can't come back early.

775
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,290
Li Yuan and I are checking for return flight tickets.

776
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,510
We plan to end our trip early.

777
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
We'll try to come back as soon as possible.

778
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
Rest well.

779
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,100
Listen carefully to the doctor's advice.

780
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,510
Recover soon.

781
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,990
You need to have confidence in yourself.

782
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,590
You'll surely live a long and healthy life

783
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,270
and stay with us forever.

784
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,190
And as for me, don't worry.

785
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,820
As long as I'm still breathing,

786
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,460
I will always protect you by your side.

787
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,310
Take good care of yourself.

788
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,800
Wait for me to come back.

789
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,590
[People's Court of Chengdong District, Jingbei City]

790
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,480
Ms. Li Yuan.

791
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,510
If you're willing to acknowledge that this is a fact,

792
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,440
I believe you clearly remember that

793
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,640
Mr. Yuan Gang shot this video

794
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,750
by himself when you and he

795
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,910
went mountain climbing in Tibet.

796
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,900
You watched the video just now.

797
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,240
Everyone here has also watched the video.

798
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,130
Mr. Yuan Gang has explicitly stated that

799
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,780
as long as he's still breathing,

800
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,820
he will always protect his mother by her side.

801
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,240
Always.

802
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,090
But is he merely breathing now?

803
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,640
His heart

804
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,280
is still beating strongly and powerfully.

805
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,450
It's still beating.

806
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,340
It just keeps beating.

807
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,930
Now please allow me to play the second audio clip in court.

808
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,230
Can everyone hear it?

809
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
This sound of heartbeat belongs to

810
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,170
Mr. Yuan Gang himself.

811
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
This sound of heartbeat

812
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,810
shows a person's will to survive.

813
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,920
It's a desire and a shout

814
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,640
to stay alive.

815
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,630
Mr. Yuan Gang is still alive.

816
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,010
His heart has been beating

817
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,570
like this

818
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,640
all this time.

819
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
May I ask you and your representative,

820
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,030
as well as the chief judge and other judges,

821
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,590
and everyone present here,

822
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,350
who has the right and qualification

823
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,350
to make such a heartbeat

824
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,730
stop?

825
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Who has it?

826
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,360
Li Yuan.

827
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,650
Do you have anything else to say?

828
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,170
No, I don't.

829
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,110
Respondent,

830
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,070
do you have anything else to say?

831
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,110
No, she doesn't.

832
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,500
All rise.

833
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,250
The guardianship of the respondent, Li Yuan, is hereby revoked.

834
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,870
Cui Weizhen is designated

835
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,560
as Yuan Gang's guardian.

836
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,820
Court is adjourned.

837
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,590
Thank you.

838
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,420
You're welcome. It's our duty.

839
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,110
They're coming.

840
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,160
Ms. Luo, what's your view on today's verdict?

841
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,030
We're disappointed at the outcome of the verdict.

842
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,630
With the advancement of times,

843
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,950
people's views on life and death should change, too.

844
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,220
When a person exists merely as a physical body,

845
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,820
maintaining his life without dignity is meaningless.

846
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,050
We understand the applicant's

847
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
request in this case.

848
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,720
However, we don't think that

849
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,600
she should use her personal emotions

850
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,240
to control others and the deceased.

851
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,850
Do you plan to appeal?

852
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,590
We've discussed it with our client.

853
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,970
We won't appeal.

854
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,760
However,

855
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,960
it doesn't mean that

856
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,710
we agree with the verdict.

857
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,250
Thank you. Excuse me.

858
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,710
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

859
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,080
There's no need to thank me. It's my duty.

860
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,350
You don't need to worry now.

861
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,510
Ms. Cui,

862
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,840
the court has designated you as Yuan Gang's guardian.

863
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,550
Is there anything you want to say?

864
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,390
You guys can leave first.

865
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,990
My son is not dead.

866
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,970
As long as I'm alive,

867
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,360
he won't die.

868
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,030
He will stay alive with me forever.

869
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm grateful for the court's fair judgment.

870
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,030
Mr. Chen, your statement in court

871
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,760
was very powerful.

872
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,280
I wonder

873
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,130
in your opinion, what the significance of this case is.

874
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,230
I...

875
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,440
Or do you have anything else to say

876
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,760
about this verdict?

877
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,360
I'm sorry, but we have no comment.

878
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,190
Come on. Excuse me. Please make way.

879
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,870
Thank you.

880
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,970
Excuse me.

881
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,220
Mr. Chen, just get back to work.

882
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,410
I need to go to the hospital now.

883
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,960
Please go ahead.

884
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,360
Alright.

885
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,150
Ms. Cui, let's keep in touch.

886
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,550
Okay.

887
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,840
Alright. Fang Rui, please escort Ms. Cui.

888
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,390
-Okay.
-Thank you.

889
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:33,890
Take care.

890
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,360
Goodbye.

891
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,200
Come on. This way, please.

892
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,950
I told you not to take this case.

893
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,530
It has hurt your relationship with her so much.

894
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,230
Mentor.

895
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,590
Go after her now!

896
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,490
Work is work, and life is life.

897
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,190
Don't mix them up.

898
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,780
I won't go after her.

899
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,190
Luo Yingzi has never lost before.

900
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,300
Since she has lost this time,

901
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,070
I have to give her some time to cure her wounds.

902
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,220
Let's not think about it anymore.

903
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,640
We won, didn't we? Let's go have a meal.

904
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,150
Drive the car.

905
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,810
Let's go.

906
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,860
Dad.

907
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:41,960
I'm back.

908
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,510
Yingzi.

909
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,360
Why are you back?

910
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,760
I've received the calligraphy work you sent me.

911
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,400
I just want to come back to see you.

912
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,110
Is everything alright?

913
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,100
What could be wrong with me?

914
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,360
Just go on sitting here.

915
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,760
I'll put my things in the room.

916
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,480
Dad, dinner's ready. Let's eat.

917
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,780
Yingzi.

918
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,860
Come here.

919
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,590
What's wrong?

920
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,590
I'm not able to remove this hangnail

921
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,670
on my finger.

922
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
I'm long-sighted. Look.

923
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,000
Help me cut it off.

924
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:20,980
Dad.

925
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,730
If your eyesight isn't good,

926
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,630
just don't try to cut it yourself.

927
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,840
Look. You've hurt your finger.

928
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,590
Wait a moment.

929
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,070
I'll get some ointment for you.

930
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,040
Don't try to cut it now.

931
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,110
Chen Shuo is such a lucky man.

932
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,640
He has my good daughter as his girlfriend.

933
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,930
He's truly blessed.

934
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,010
Look.

935
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,780
Dad.

936
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,010
You're trying to get information out of me, aren't you?

937
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,650
Can I get any information out of you?

938
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,330
You won't get any information out of me.

939
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,810
Bear the pain. It might hurt a bit.

940
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,150
Bear the pain.

941
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,360
Okay.

942
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,820
Dad.

943
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,770
Are you missing my mom?

944
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,880
How can you say that?

945
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,730
From the moment I walked in until just now,

946
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,470
I noticed that you kept looking at this hand.

947
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
Did you

948
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,060
regret signing it for my mother back then?

949
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,190
I've never regretted it.

950
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,550
But at that time,

951
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,030
if we had kept her alive just like that,

952
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,360
what if

953
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,060
she could wake up one day?

954
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,950
As for this question,

955
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,130
your mother and I discussed it many times.

956
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,780
We both agreed that

957
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,230
we should live well while we are alive,

958
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,950
and once our bodies can't function anymore,

959
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,220
we should leave this world without hesitation,

960
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,840
lest we should become a burden to you.

961
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,270
Dad, how can you say that?

962
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,360
How could you two possibly be a burden to me?

963
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,040
Yingzi.

964
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,530
Let's agree on this first.

965
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,510
Once my body can't function anymore,

966
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,880
just let me pass away without hesitation.

967
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,740
But before I pass away,

968
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,280
I just hope to see that

969
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,190
someone loves you

970
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,850
and you have a family.

971
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,190
Is Chen Shuo that person?

972
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,870
Dad,

973
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,190
do you really want to meet him?

974
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,470
Actually, I haven't let you meet him

975
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,230
because I was afraid you wouldn't like him.

976
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,930
It doesn't matter whether I like him or not.

977
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,680
What's important is whether you like him or not.

978
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,260
I'm not the one who will marry him. Right?

979
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,380
Alright.

980
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,500
I'll bring him over next time

981
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,660
so that you can meet him.

982
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,690
The sooner, the better.

983
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,240
Okay.

984
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,620
Come on. Let's go have dinner.

985
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,770
Don't let this hand get wet for the time being.

986
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,430
Okay.

987
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,360
After dinner,

988
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,370
I'll trim your nails for you.

989
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,640
[Righteous Luo]

990
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,710
Righteous Luo.

991
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,710
You turned around and walked away outside the court that day.

992
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,760
I thought you would be ignoring me.

993
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,250
I've been waiting for your call so eagerly.

994
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,630
Stop it.

995
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,400
I just went back to my hometown.

996
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,600
And when I came back, no one was there to pick me up.

997
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,840
I even had to go back by myself.

998
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,630
You went home and wanted me to pick you up.

999
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,030
But you didn't tell me.

1000
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,760
Besides,

1001
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,150
why didn't you take me with you when you went home?

1002
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,770
Why didn't you let me meet my future father-in-law?

1003
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,590
Don't be so shameless.

1004
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,780
It's still up in the air.

1005
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,700
Well, are you free?

1006
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,220
Shall we meet now?

1007
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,780
What? Are you going to get even with me?

1008
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,320
That's pretty much what I mean.

1009
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,840
I want to review things with you.

1010
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,920
It's about that case.

1011
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,300
What do you think? Is it okay?
