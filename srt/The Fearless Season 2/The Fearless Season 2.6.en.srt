00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,759
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,229
My surname is Song. My name is Song Shumin.

4
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,640
I used to be a teacher in a middle school.

5
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,990
My husband

6
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,370
taught physics in college.

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,200
He had two patents.

8
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,570
Later, he resigned and went into business.

9
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,280
He used the money he earned from his two patents

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,350
and established a company.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,110
Their products were very popular

12
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,340
in the market.

13
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,860
So our family was well-off.

14
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,270
We were well-fed.

15
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,360
I didn't work

16
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,710
when I was 50.

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,680
Auntie Song, you're a lucky person.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Isn't there a saying?

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,880
It's called

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,480
"You don't know how lucky you are."

21
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,840
I returned to family life at a young age.

22
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,210
I was bored staying in a big house alone.

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,520
I walked around at home every day.

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,560
I was not interested in playing mahjong.

25
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,240
I felt embarrassed

26
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,870
about dancing square dance.

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,030
In those years,

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,750
my husband really worked day and night

29
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,030
in the business world.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,760
He simply had no time for me.

31
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,630
It went on like this for two years.

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,150
I felt like I was

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,150
on the verge of depression.

34
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,860
After eating dinner every day with nothing to do,

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,470
I would go to the window alone,

36
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,460
just stand there,

37
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,310
staring blankly downstairs.

38
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,760
I often had the urge to jump.

39
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,360
What about your child?

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
In my early years,

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,670
I did have a child,

42
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,760
a daughter.

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,630
But

44
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,750
she died when she was very young.

45
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,360
It took me a long time

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,770
to get over it.

47
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,770
After that,

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
my husband and I

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,850
didn't have another child.

50
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,810
I'm really sorry, Auntie Song.

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,560
I didn't mean

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,410
to bring up something sad.

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,960
Please don't get upset.

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm really sorry.

55
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,120
It's okay.

56
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,720
Thank you.

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
Auntie Song,

58
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,200
could you tell us about He Qiaohui?

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,329
Tell us about her.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,190
I met her

61
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,360
more than three years ago.

Hello everyone.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,630
Hello, sir.

66
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,040
What's the matter?

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,270
I work for a biotechnology company

68

as a marketing specialist.

69
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,950

No, thank you. No, thank you.

73

It's okay. We have samples for tasting.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,580
We don't need it. No, thank you.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,210
Thank you.

76
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,130
Alright, alright.

No, thank you. I don't need it.

85

It's free. Can I give you a try?

86

I don't need it.

87

Thank you.

can I have a drink of water?

You can just call me Qiaohui.

Thank you, auntie.

Auntie,

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,560
I've been doing this job for a long time,

100
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,250
and you're the first one

101
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,480
to let me in.

102
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,430
It's okay. Come and sit down.

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,850
Thank you, auntie.

104
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,430
You're welcome.

105
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,750
Auntie,

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,870
your skin looks okay,

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,270
but your dark circles are quite severe.

108
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,830
Do you have trouble sleeping?

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
Look, I have this

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,430
capsule extracted from ziziphus jujube seed

111
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,560
for calming the nerves.

112
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,710
It's really good. You can try it.

113
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,390
It works really well. Try it.

114
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,950
That day,

115
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,130
she stayed at our house for half an afternoon.

116
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,560
I didn't buy anything,

117
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,750
but I didn't interrupt her either.

118
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,480
I've been alone for too long

119
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,170
and needed someone to talk to.

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,270
Listening to her sweet talk

121
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,290
and calling me auntie so affectionately

122
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,190
made me feel really good.

123
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,510
The afternoon passed like that.

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,620
I apologized to her and said

125
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,560
that we actually didn't need anything.

126
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,540
I wouldn't buy anything.

127
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,480
She didn't make it difficult for me

128
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,420
and bid me farewell with a smile.

129
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,120
Miss,

130
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,900
why are you still sitting here and not leaving?

131
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,840
Why are you crying?

132
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,560
Auntie, I'm fine.

133
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,420
I just feel suffocated in my heart.

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,270
I'll cry here for a while

135
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,950
and then leave.

136
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,630
Don't worry about me. You go ahead, auntie.

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Don't be sad anymore.

138
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,270
If you have something to say, you can tell me.

139
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,040
Auntie,

140
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,600
it's really hard

141
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,550
for us to do this job.

142
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
Look,

143
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,600
I stayed at your house for most of the afternoon,

144
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,480
but you didn't buy anything.

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,630
Of course,

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,070
I'm not saying you're bad.

147
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,040
I'm just talking about this thing.

148
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,430
Since you didn't buy anything,

149
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,120
I didn't earn a penny.

150
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,310
In the past three days,

151
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,159
I haven't sold a single product.

152
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,740
Our company requires sales performance.

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,430
If I can't meet the target,I won't get paid,

154
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,510
and I'll even be fined.

155
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,240
Don't cry anymore.

156
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,950
I never had a mother when I was young.

157
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,310
I also have a sick father at home.

158
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,320
And I'm so stupid.

159
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,600
Why is my life so hard, auntie?

160
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,600
Don't cry anymore.

161
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,940
Don't be sad.

162
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
It's okay, auntie.

163
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,720
I'll be fine in a while.

164
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,310
Don't worry about me. You go ahead.

165
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,830
Miss, listen,

166
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,360
weren't you selling health products to me just now?

167
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,960
I'll buy them.

168
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
I'll buy two kinds.

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,140
Really?

170
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,240
From then on,

171
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,510
she often came to our house.

172
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,290
She stopped calling me auntie

173
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,230
and started calling me mom directly.

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
When she came,

175
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,690
she would rub my back, wash my feet,

176
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,620
talk to me, and go shopping with me.

177
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,280
By the way, she would also sell her health products.

178
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,670
I never took

179
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,360
these health products,

180
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,790
but I kept buying them.

181
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,910
Slowly,

182
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,290
I accumulated a large pile of them in the house.

183
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,030
I roughly calculated that

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,840
I spent almost 600,000 yuan

185
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
on health products

186
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,100
from her.

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,160
Didn't your husband notice?

188
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,510
Didn't your husband stop you?

189
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,960
At first, my husband did tell me

190
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,510
not to buy these things,

191
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
but I told him

192
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,830
that since Qiaohui came to our house,

193
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,940
I felt much better

194
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
and was no longer depressed.

195
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,030
Besides,

196
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,690
this child was born

197
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,440
in the same year as our daughter.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
I even thought

199
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,600
that this might be

200
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,870
compensation from heaven.

201
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,790
Then my husband said,

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,670
"If it can make you happy,

203
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,320
then buy whatever you want."

204
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,510
Later,

205
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,770
she stopped selling health products

206
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,320
and came to keep me company exclusively.

207
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,440
I didn't treat her badly.

208
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,750
I gave her a monthly salary

209
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,360
of 20,000 yuan

210
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,250
and countless

211
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,870
other things as well.

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,790
During this time,

213
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,990
she also started her own company

214
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,670
and got a boyfriend.

215
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,080
Mom.

216
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,270
Qiaohui, you're here.

217
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,320
Mom, look, this is Damin whom I always talk about.

218
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,270
Say hello.

219
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,120
Hello, auntie.

220
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,970
No, call her Mom!

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,670
Come on.

222
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,440
Hello, Mom.

223
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,480
Come here, child.

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,870
I've always heard about you from Qiaohui.

225
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,240
Mom, look,

226
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,670
Damin bought you a smartphone.

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,820
Isn't it great?

228
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,030
Why spend money on this?

229
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,350
-It’s my duty.
-It's for you, our mom.

230
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,200
Really.

231
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,270
So when did she begin owing you

232
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,050
this five million?

233
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,670
It started when she

234
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,390
stopped selling health products

235
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,310
and came to keep me company exclusively.

236
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,830
At first, she borrowed and repaid,

237
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,950
so I didn't think much of it

238
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,660
when she borrowed again.

239
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,570
In this way,

240
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,820
over the course of more than two years,

241
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,280
this child

242
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,070
always repaid small amounts but borrowed large sums,

243
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,750
and borrowed

244
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,710
another two million from me.

245
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,320
Did your husband not object to her

246
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,910
borrowing so much money?

247
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,840
He didn't know.

248
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,610
All his attention

249
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,630
was on his company,

250
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,480
and I didn't tell him.

251
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
It wasn't until later

252
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,320
when Qiaohui asked to borrow

253
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
one million from me at once

254
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,940
that I felt the need

255
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,960
to tell my husband.

256
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,840
When I told him,

257
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,320
he didn't agree to lend her the money,

258
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,240
but how could I listen to him?

259
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,790
He couldn't convince me,

260
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,680
so he said,

261
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,240
if I had to lend her money,

262
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,170
I must make sure she wrote an IOU.

263
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
At that time,

264
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,030
we were really wealthy.

265
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,840
My husband seemed to have

266
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,410
an infinite ability to earn money.

267
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,510
I didn't use any of it myself.

268
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,240
I gave it all to Qiaohui.

269
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,750
But who could have imagined

270
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
that my husband

271
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,910
would collapse

272
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,100
so suddenly.

273
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,080
Jiasheng.

274
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,830
Jiasheng.

275
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,880
You're back.

276
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm back.

277
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Why are you smoking again?

278
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,150
Just this one.

279
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,390
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?

280
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,630
I'm not hungry. I'm fine.

281
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
You go to sleep first.

282
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,400
I want to sit here for a while longer.

283
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,440
Okay,

284
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,480
but don't sit for too long.

285
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,030
Jiasheng.

286
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,750
-Hurry.
-Jiasheng.

287
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,680
Hurry!

288
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,850
Jiasheng!

289
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,960
Jiasheng!

290
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Jiasheng!

291
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,600
Jiasheng!

292
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,030
Jiasheng!

293
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
Jiasheng!

294
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,430
His condition isn't too bad.

295
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,000
If he undergoes surgery in a timely manner

296
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,440
and cooperates with postoperative treatment,

297
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,780
his life can be extended.

298
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,320
Go pay the deposit first,

299
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,000
and we'll arrange the surgery as soon as possible.

300
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
How much is the deposit?

301
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,630
Ten thousand yuan first.

302
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,230
I've already paid the deposit.

303
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,240
In a moment,

304
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
we can transfer to the ward upstairs.

305
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,970
How are you?

306
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,930
Are you feeling better?

307
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,330
Better, don't worry.

308
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,820
I feel much better than yesterday.

309
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,870
That's great.

310
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,230
Shumin,

311
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,200
I've let you down.

312
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,030
My company went bankrupt.

313
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,480
Last year,

314
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,010
the company was already struggling.

315
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,440
There were too many similar products,

316
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,270
and the market competition was too fierce.

317
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,720
Plus,

318
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,630
I blindly opened dozens of chain stores,

319
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,070
and the capital chain broke instantly.

320
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,830
I'm sorry, Shumin.

321
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,200
I originally thought

322
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,550
I could give you a good life in the future,

323
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,080
but now, in my old age,

324
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,570
I'm making you suffer with me instead.

325
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,320
Jiasheng,

326
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,230
don't say that.

327
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,370
We've been through hard times before.

328
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,800
Plus,

329
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,200
I have a monthly pension of 3,000 yuan,

330
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,890
which is enough for us to live on.

331
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
One more thing, our home.

332
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,240
To support the company,

333
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,070
I mortgaged it to the bank.

334
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,380
Now I can't repay the bank loan,

335
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,320
and they've sued me.

336
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,570
The court

337
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,200
is enforcing the eviction,

338
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,790
asking us to move out.

339
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,480
Shumin,

340
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,490
we're about to become

341
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
homeless people.

342
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,710
As long as we're alive,

343
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,620
we'll always find a way.

344
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,360
Where you are, there's home.

345
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,870
Auntie.

346
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,630
Auntie.

347
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,910
Auntie, hello.

348
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,930
I'm Judge Wang Lingling.

349
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,510
Given your situation,

350
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,480
our court has rented a house for you

351
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,320
and paid six months' rent.

352
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
You can temporarily live there.

353
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,500
Thank you for your cooperation.

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,030
As for all these health products in the house,

355
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,960
they can't be auctioned,

356
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,580
so you can dispose of them yourself.

357
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,600
Auntie, what are you going to do with these health products?

358
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,640
My daughter gave them to me. Let's load them up.

359
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,400
Your daughter is really filial.

360
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,950
But these health products are expired.

361
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,370
I never thought we'd be broke,

362
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,280
so when I lent money out,

363
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,810
I didn't think about

364
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,500
leaving myself a way out.

365
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,670
When I needed money,

366
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I found out

367
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,800
that my bank card was frozen,

368
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,010
and I only had a little more than 10,000 yuan on me,

369
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,720
which was not enough to cover my husband's surgery fees.

370
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,400
At this point,

371
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,650
why don't you go ask He Qiaohui for it?

372
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,069
Since Qiaohui knew about our bankruptcy,

373
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,829
she's been avoiding me.

374
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,650
Auntie Song.

375
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
If your family

376
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,270
hadn't fallen on hard times,

377
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,310
would you still lend her money

378
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,700
if she asked again?

379
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
I don't know.

380
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,720
If she knew I had money

381
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,680
and asked me again,

382
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,000
I would feel embarrassed

383
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,160
to say no.

384
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,660
Yingzi, Mr. Dong sent us a message.

385
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,640
Auntie Song, sorry,

386
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,030
we have an urgent matter to deal with.

387
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,200
Please wait a moment.

388
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,640
Ms. Xia,

389
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,790
are your two colleagues

390
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,270
not intending

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,810
to take my case?

392
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,830
No.

393
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,090
Auntie Song,

394
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,800
my two seniors

395
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,650
are both very righteous people.

396
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,440
They will definitely take your case.

397
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,240
Don't worry.

398
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,230
We can't take this case.

399
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,030
I'm thinking,

400
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,910
even if we can get her money back today,

401
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,400
she'll still be tricked tomorrow.

402
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,710
And right now,

403
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,910
she might not even be able to afford the agency fee.

404
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,810
For sure she can't afford it.

405
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,400
We barely have enough on our plates,

406
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,030
let alone pity others.

407
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,350
Besides,

408
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,220
did you hear about that He Qiaohui she mentioned?

409
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,960
Dealing with people like her is the most troublesome.

410
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,400
It's not even worth our time.

411
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,710
So we've agreed, right?

412
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,920
Don't let pity get in the way again

413
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,030
and change your mind.

414
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,830
Don't worry, I'll listen to you. We won't take it.

415
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,860
Luo,

416
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,000
shall we sign the agency agreement

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
with Auntie Song now?

418
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,070
Actually, it's quite coincidental.

419
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,920
Auntie Song, as I mentioned earlier,

420
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,790
our law firm has just been established.

421
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,840
So we haven't had our official seal engraved yet,

422
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,120
nor have we printed the agency agreements.

423
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,230
Sometimes,

424
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,440
for disputes among acquaintances,

425
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,720
going to court

426
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,350
might not be the best option.

427
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,830
Although we are lawyers,

428
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,060
we shouldn't provoke or encourage litigation.

429
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,930
If negotiation is still possible,

430
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,990
it's best to avoid going to court.

431
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,730
Because I noticed earlier

432
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,750
that you still have some feelings

433
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,490
towards He Qiaohui.

434
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,440
I really have no other choice.

435
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,740
If my husband weren't

436
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,360
lying in the hospital

437
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,170
in need of surgery,

438
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,990
I wouldn't be...

439
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,880
Therefore, our suggestion is

440
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,170
that you continue to negotiate with the other party.

441
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,720
Luo...

442
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Listen to Ms. Luo.

443
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,600
If negotiation fails,

444
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,750
you can consider legal remedies.

445
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,480
But for a case with such a high claim amount,

446
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,160
I think you should find a lawyer

447
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,990
with more experience than us.

448
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,640
Well,

449
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,560
I've troubled all three of you.

450
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,430
By the way, Auntie Song,

451
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,280
I have to remind you.

452
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,030
Among your IOUs, there's one for one million yuan.

453
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,360
The statute of limitations for this debt is almost up.

454
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,890
If you plan

455
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,010
to get this money back,

456
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,750
you'd better go to court as soon as possible

457
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,890
and file a lawsuit on your own.

458
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,070
Once the case is filed,

459
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,400
if the statute of limitations passes,

460
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,390
even with evidence, it won't work.

461
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,900
Thank you.

462
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,720
Goodbye, Auntie Song.

463
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,270
Xia Shu, don't chase after her.

464
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,070
Let's go back to the office.

465
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,180
What do you mean?

466
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,440
You asked me to bring in cases,

467
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,270
and now that I have, you're turning it down?

468
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,660
The statute of limitations for some of Auntie Song's debts

469
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,960
are almost up.

470
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,710
If we don't help her, who will?

471
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,880
It's not that we won't help. It's that we can't.

472
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,400
Our firm has just been established.

473
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,240
We don't even have a seal. How can we take it?

474
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Then I'll go engrave a seal right now

475
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,630
and bring it back in a moment.

476
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,650
Xia Shu, it's not about the seal.

477
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,680
We have so much to do.

478
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,560
We don't have the energy to handle this kind of case.

479
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
You don't have the time, but I do.

480
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,320
All I do every day is go to the courthouse

481
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,870
and distribute business cards to get cases.

482
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,330
Now that I've brought a case back,

483
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,720
if you don't have the energy,

484
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,820
can I take it on myself?

485
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
If you insist on taking it, we won't stop you.

486
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,510
But I'm telling you,

487
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,770
this case is far from as simple as it looks.

488
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,970
Think carefully.

489
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,070
Xia Shu,

490
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,530
this case involves two lives–

491
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,860
hers and her husband's.

492
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,540
Are you sure you can handle the responsibility?

493
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,050
Those who can afford it don't want to,

494
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,610
and those who want to can't afford it.

495
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,000
What should Auntie Song do?

496
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,110
There are plenty of people in the world

497
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,260
who need saving,

498
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,550
like the three of us,

499
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,920
for instance.

500
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,070
Do you think Auntie Song

501
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,110
can't afford the agency fee?

502
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,390
Then I'll pay for her.

503
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
My car just sold for over 800,000 yuan.

504
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,520
Xia Shu, why can't you understand?

505
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
This case is much more difficult than we anticipated.

506
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,040
It's not just about the agency fee.

507
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,070
If there are difficulties, we should address them.

508
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,310
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

509
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,830
I've been at the courthouse for so many days,

510
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,830
handing out so many business cards,

511
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,490
but no one has even given me a proper look.

512
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,520
Only Auntie Song trusts me.

513
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,070
I can't let her down.

514
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,670
Let's go.

515
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,310
Auntie Song,

516
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,250
Auntie Song.

517
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,550
Ms. Xia,

518
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,350
please don't leave yet.

519
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,830
They won't take your case.

520
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,990
I have many more lawyers'

521
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,130
contact information here.

522
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,850
I'll contact them.

523
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,400
Thank you so much.

524
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,730
I'll call them now.

525
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,580
Qiu Hua.

526
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,510
I know what you're going to say.

527
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,310
You don't understand.

528
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,050
You misunderstood me.

529
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,920
I mean, look at Xia Shu now.

530
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,030
She's determined to take on this case.

531
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,490
She's too honest.

532
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,680
What if she encounters an opponent like Han?

533
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,320
We can't just watch her jump into a trap.

534
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,270
Or we could

535
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,830
agree to let her

536
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,440
represent Auntie Song in this case.

537
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,960
Then when we're free,

538
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,480
we can guide her from the sidelines.

539
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,610
Young people

540
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,310
need growth opportunities.

541
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,160
At most, we can let her handle the initial filings first,

542
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,920
and we'll figure out the rest later.

543
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,460
Are you sure that even if we win,

544
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,370
we won't just get an IOU?

545
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,610
Don't blame me for not warning you later.

546
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,030
So, you agree?

547
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,750
She's your assistant, not mine.

548
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,510
But aren't you also a partner?

549
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,240
Then tell me,

550
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,200
if we let her handle this case,

551
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,810
how should we charge the agency fee?

552
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,870
On a contingency basis.

553
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,070
Ms. Xia,

554
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,710
if it's really not feasible, then forget it.

555
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,270
I appreciate your kindness.

556
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,540
I'll think of another way.

557
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,000
Auntie Song, don't worry.

558
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,790
I have many more

559
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,030
lawyers' contact information here.

560
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,110
I'll make a few more calls.

561
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,960
Hello,

562
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,480
Luo, don't try to persuade me. I...

563
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,850
Really?

564
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,960
I love you so much.

565
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,960
I love Qiu too.

566
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,460
Okay.

567
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,310
Auntie Song, they agreed to take your case.

568
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,620
Let's go back to see them now.

569
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,480
Really?

570
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,440
Let's go.

571
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,130
Okay.

572
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,510
I knew they would agree.

573
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,000
Auntie Song,

574
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,350
with the evidence you have now,

575
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,280
it can prove that the claim is worth over 3 million yuan.

576
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
The agency fee

577
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,640
will be over 30,000 yuan.

578
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,990
What are your plans for this expense?

579
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,190
That's a lot.

580
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
But right now,

581
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,100
I can't even afford the surgery

582
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,440
for my husband.

583
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,310
I'll pay for Auntie Song.

584
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,270
How about this, Auntie Song?

585
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,350
Let's sign a full-risk contingency agreement.

586
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,610
That means

587
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,010
we won't charge any fees upfront.

588
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
If we recover the money for you,

589
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,320
we'll take a 15% commission.

590
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,560
If you agree,

591
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,900
we can sign the agreement now.

592
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,030
I agree.

593
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,660
As long as we recover the money,

594
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,270
don't mention 15%.

595
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
I think giving you 50%

596
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,070
is deserved.

597
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,190
Here's the agreement. Please take a look.

598
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,750
It's fine.

599
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,800
Where do I sign?

600
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,830
You should really take a closer look.

601
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,000
Also,

602
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,310
starting today, you need to stop

603
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,160
trusting others blindly.

604
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,680
Okay.

605
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,600
Why don't you go home first?

606
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,070
Later, Xia Shu and I

607
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,430
will accompany Auntie Song to file the case.

608
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,020
Alright.

609
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,960
Then I'll go settle the bill first.

610
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,610
Here are the car keys for you.

611
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,380
Auntie Song,

612
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,210
I have a few more words of advice for you.

613
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,160
The facts of your case are clear.

614
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,350
The 3 million yuan is supported by evidence,

615
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,730
and the evidence is solid.

616
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,420
But the difficulty lies in enforcement.

617
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,960
So, you must not

618
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,420
let He Qiaohui know about your lawsuit.

619
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,590
If she finds out,

620
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm afraid even serving the summons will be a problem.

621
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,520
Do you understand?

622
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes, I understand.

623
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,690
Then I'll take my leave now.

624
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,350
Alright.

625
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,550
All right.

626
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,760
I've finished reading.

627
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,440
It's 56 yuan in total.

628
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,650
Okay.

629
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,330
Auntie Song,

630
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,030
the case has been filed.

631
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,080
This is the receipt for filing.

632
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,450
Please keep it safe.

633
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,170
Now you can go home and wait.

634
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,530
Wait for the court to arrange a hearing date.

635
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,350
I have some other matters to attend to,

636
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,450
so I can't see you off.

637
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
No need.

638
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,550
You take care of your business.

639
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:54,940
Alright.

640
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,720
Then I'll be going.

641
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,360
Goodbye.

642
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,890
Auntie Song, then let's...

643
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,550
Auntie Song,

644
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,340
are you worried about the surgery fees?

645
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,800
How much does your husband's surgery cost?

646
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,080
Over 100,000 yuan.

647
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,720
I'll cover it first.

648
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,820
How can I let you do that?

649
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,640
No.

650
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,400
Ms. Xia, I can't cause you any more trouble.

651
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,430
Healing is the priority.

652
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,870
You can pay me back after you get your money back.

653
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,960
But...

654
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,630
No buts.

655
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,070
Auntie Song, if you keep insisting like this,

656
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,530
I won't help you with the lawsuit anymore.

657
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,530
Thank you so much,

658
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Ms. Xia.

659
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,450
Am I in the wrong for suing Qiaohui

660
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,990
without warning her?

661
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,590
How could you be in the wrong?

662
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,200
She owes you money and refuses to pay.

663
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,510
But suing her

664
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,050
without warning

665
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,530
just feels underhanded.

666
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,600
Like I'm doing something wrong.

667
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,260
Is it okay not to tell her?

668
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,920
Technically, you have the right on your side.

669
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,050
However,

670
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,240
you could also tell her.

671
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,640
Maybe she'll

672
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,350
get scared

673
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,640
and pay back the money.

674
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,110
A pair of five.

675
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,570
[Godmother]

676
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,440
Keep your voices down.

677
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Okay, sister-in-law.

678
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Mom, what a coincidence.

679
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,440
I was just about to call you.

680
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,770
I'm really sorry.

681
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,640
Please forgive me.

682
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
What's going on, mom?

683
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,830
I'm really at my wit's end.

684
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,410
Now, I can only rely on legal means

685
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,220
to help myself out of this dilemma.

686
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,290
What?

687
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,850
I'm sorry.

688
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,000
Qiaohui,

689
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,310
I've already filed a lawsuit.

690
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,930
Mom.

691
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,050
Mom.

692
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,270
Well.

693
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,920
We've been like

694
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,500
mother and daughter for so long.

695
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,370
How could you sue me over such a small thing?

696
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,880
In your heart,

697
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,580
you don't treat me like your own daughter.

698
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,470
Otherwise, you wouldn't do something like this.

699
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,030
Stop talking nonsense.

700
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,570
Mom,

701
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,980
are you disowning your daughter?

702
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,420
Qiaohui,

703
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,830
your uncle is lying in bed

704
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,930
and urgently needs surgery.

705
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,590
If he doesn't get the surgery soon,

706
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,220
he might not survive.

707
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,790
If you had difficulties, you should have told me.

708
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,900
You're my mom.

709
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,240
No matter how hard it gets, I can't abandon you

710
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,780
or my godfather, right?

711
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,450
But you couldn't have

712
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,260
sued me, mom.

713
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,310
Don't cry, Qiaohui.

714
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,770
If you can repay me some of the money now,

715
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,230
I won't sue you.

716
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,990
No, wait.

717
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,610
Right now,

718
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,700
there's over 30,000 yuan in legal fees

719
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,930
that the lawyer lent me.

720
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,740
If you can repay that,

721
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,790
and also

722
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,310
the over 100,000 yuan for your uncle's surgery,

723
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,810
then I won't pursue this any further.

724
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,740
Damin,

725
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,890
she really hired a lawyer.

726
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,100
Ask who the lawyer is.

727
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,640
We don't need to be like this, mom.

728
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,270
So,

729
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,210
who is the lawyer?

730
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,130
I hired the lawyer.

731
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,840
They're here to help me.

732
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,070
I know, I know.

733
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,180
I just thought of

734
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,760
meeting them,

735
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,960
asking them what to do.

736
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,960
Mom,

737
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,140
let's not go to court, okay?

738
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,850
If we really go to court,

739
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,790
we'll ruin our relationship.

740
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,750
Yes, yes.

741
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
My lawyers

742
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,880
are called Xia Shu

743
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,630
and Luo Yingzi.

744
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,790
Their law firm is called...

745
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,440
Yinghua Law Firm.

746
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,970
Alright,

747
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,960
then I'll contact them as soon as possible.

748
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,680
Mom, I'll hang up now.

749
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,450
I need to find out

750
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,770
more about these two lawyers.

751
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,000
Where are you going to find out?

752
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,340
What do you mean?

753
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,790
Jingbei isn't that big.

754
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,440
I have so many friends.

755
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,530
I can handle them?

756
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,430
Don't worry, we'll find a way.

757
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,240
I'll go with you, bro.

758
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,830
Don't just play cards.

759
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,770
Watch your sister-in-law.

760
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,270
Okay.

761
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,240
Take it easy, bro.

762
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,680
Okay.

763
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,440
Mr. He, Mr. Sun's family is facing some difficulties

764
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,410
and urgently needs money.

765
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,440
They want to consult with us.

766
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Alright, alright, Linzi.

767
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,010
Okay.

768
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,110
Let's go.

769
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,720
Hey, buddy,

770
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,160
What happened at home?

771
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,230
How much do you need?

772
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,760
[Jingbei People’s Hospital]

773
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,110
The nurse just told me

774
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,140
that you owe over 10,000 yuan in deposit.

775
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,460
Please pay it first.

776
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,210
I've already got the money.

777
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,020
I'll pay it tomorrow or the day after.

778
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,360
So,

779
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,680
when can they

780
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,570
arrange his surgery?

781
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,320
The speed of his cancer cell spread

782
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,960
is faster than I expected.

783
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,070
It's meaningless

784
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,330
to perform surgery now.

785
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,300
I recommend conservative treatment.

786
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,630
Let's start with chemotherapy.

787
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,890
Hello, Director Han.

788
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,260
Hello.

789
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,720
Excuse me,

790
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,680
make way, make way.

791
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,550
Come on, thank you.

792
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,440
Excuse me, sorry.

793
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,870
Okay.

794
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,110
Okay. Come on.

795
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,070
Be careful.

796
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,700
There are so many lawyers at Liangcheng Law Firm.

797
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,760
Do you know who to find?

798
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,210
We'll go to someone who is those

799
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,520
two women's enemies.

800
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,800
Don't worry, I've already done my research.

801
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,179
That Luo and Xia

802
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,600
were fired from Liangcheng Law Firm.

803
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,760
Just imagine, they were fired.

804
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,580
How many

805
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,440
enemies can they have in the firm?

806
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,400
You're such a clever little one, aren't you?

807
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,360
We need to find the best lawyer,

808
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,179
otherwise, with millions at stake, this could...

809
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:26,770
Keep your voice down.

810
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,909
Are you sure you've found the right person?

811
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,670
Don't be unreliable.

812
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,880
I've made calls.

813
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,190
Isn't it the 16th floor?

814
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,230
Let me ask.

815
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,679
Hello, I'd like to inquire about something.

816
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,750
We, uh...

817
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,000
Hi, miss.

818
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,400
Hello.

819
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,760
We'd like to consult with you about a lawsuit.

820
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,170
What type of case is it?

821
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,510
It's a loan case. A loan.

822
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,600
Mr. Chen, these two have a loan case

823
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,000
Mr. Chen, these two have a loan case

824
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
to consult with you.

825
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,920
Do you have time to see them?

826
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,230
A loan case?

827
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,070
A loan case.

828
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,690
Are you the borrower or the lender?

829
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,270
The borrower.

830
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,810
Dressed so nicely, you look like the lender at a glance.

831
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,880
Just kidding.

832
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,920
Alright,

833
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,640
please wait for me in the reception room for a moment.

834
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,000
Okay.

835
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,590
I'll be over shortly.

836
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,190
Alright, alright.

837
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:11,940
Show them the way.

838
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:12,410
Okay.

839
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,990
Please follow me.

840
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,710
Okay.

841
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,230
Shall we schedule it for the day after tomorrow?

842
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,980
Great.

843
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,300
I'll wait for your call.

844
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,030
Mr. Han.

845
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,000
Mr. Chen.

846
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,360
You're so diligent early in the morning.

847
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,760
Being new here,

848
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,880
I have to learn from senior lawyers

849
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,920
on how to handle cases,

850
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,940
and study their approaches.

851
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,560
Being overly modest is pride.

852
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,690
You're up early, eager to learn, and never tired of studying.

853
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,230
I should learn from you.

854
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,550
Do you need something from me?

855
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,700
You can't hide anything from me.

856
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,400
What's up, bro?

857
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,360
I heard you took on a loan case.

858
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,920
I have experience and I'm interested.

859
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,630
I haven't spoken with the clients yet.

860
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,370
It's not confirmed.

861
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,360
It's not a done deal yet.

862
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,480
It might not be a lucrative case.

863
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,380
Something is better than nothing.

864
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,280
You see,

865
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,510
despite being a partner here

866
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,510
and everyone calling me Director Han,

867
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,360
in reality,

868
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,400
I'm struggling too.

869
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,550
I don't have enough cases.

870
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,310
Come on, don't joke with me, okay?

871
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,070
I heard

872
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,670
that after Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua left,

873
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,330
all the cases are yours now.

874
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,870
What good cases did they have?

875
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,780
Just a bunch of losers that cost money.

876
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,150
Not like you,

877
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,700
all your cases are money-makers.

878
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,800
How about this,

879
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,840
seeing as I'm almost broke,

880
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,860
could you help me out?

881
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,510
Since my older brother has asked,

882
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,620
it wouldn't be right for me not to understand, right?

883
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,210
It's yours, the case.

884
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,000
Thank you.

885
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,110
You're welcome. What are you thanking me for?

886
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,000
Thanks, bro.

887
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,110
Here, let me help you with that.

888
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,170
I'm leaving.

889
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
Excuse me, I have a question.

890
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,960
About the lawyer

891
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,430
in the white suit just now,

892
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,140
wasn't he going to represent us in this case?

893
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,990
You mean Mr. Chen, right?

894
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,980
Yes, yes, yes.

895
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,810
Mr. Chen has other cases on his hands.

896
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,880
He can't make it.

897
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,690
So I'll be taking this case.

898
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,630
I'm a senior lawyer here at Liangcheng Law Firm,

899
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,840
at least more senior than Mr. Chen.

900
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,110
A senior lawyer.

901
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,800
I think he's more reliable than that Mr. Chen.

902
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,200
Hear him out first.

903
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,820
Mr. Zhou, Ms. He,

904
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,530
the loan lawsuit

905
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,030
can be easy to win,

906
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,320
or not so easy.

907
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,070
The tricks of the trade,

908
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,070
a lawyer won't learn them without going through

909
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,150
a dozen times or so.

910
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,170
Clearly, Mr. Han

911
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,230
is experienced in this area, isn't he?

912
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,800
Well, can't say that exactly.

913
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,000
I usually

914
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,260
let my students handle such lawsuits.

915
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,460
Well...

916
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,480
Mr. Han.

917
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,630
I...

918
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,760
I have a question for you.

919
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,550
Back then,

920
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,610
didn't Liangcheng Law Firm fire a couple of lawyers?

921
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,710
One named Luo Yingzi

922
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,120
and another named Xia Shu.

923
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,510
Forget it if you didn't mention it.

924
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,390
Talking about them

925
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,150
makes me angry.

926
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,720
I won't lie to you two.

927
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,710
Those two ingrates.

928
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,400
It was me who suggested they be fired.

929
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,250
It seems we've found the right person.

930
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,120
Are they related to our case?

931
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,690
No, no, no.

932
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,290
Actually,

933
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,690
they are

934
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,140
the plaintiff's attorney.

935
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,190
We know that

936
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,030
Liangcheng Law Firm

937
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,530
was their old workplace.

938
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,070
So we thought,

939
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,840
someone here must be able to handle them.

940
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,000
Is that why you came to us?

941
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,230
No, no.

942
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,160
Is there a problem?

943
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,550
You've said so much.

944
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,530
Let me just ask,

945
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,510
Mr. Han, can we win

946
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,360
this lawsuit?

947
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,320
Of course, we can.

948
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,430
Let's skip the small talk

949
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,310
and talk about the contract first.

950
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,510
For legal fees,

951
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,360
the NDRC and the Ministry of Justice have regulations on this.

952
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,900
The subject matter of your case

953
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,180
is 3.2 million.

954
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,840
I'll round it down to 3 million

955
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
and waive the 200,000.

956
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,880
The agency fee should then be 144,000.

957
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,360
We'll sign an agreement.

958
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,960
That's expensive.

959
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,430
Pay 70% upfront.

960
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,330
The remaining 30% should be paid before the first-instance trial.

961
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,680
Is that okay?

962
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,590
Mr. Han,

963
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,970
your agency fee is too steep.

964
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,150
We can't afford it.

965
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,240
Come on, Damin, let's go.

966
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,290
We'll find another firm.

967
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,840
Let me say one more thing.

968
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,920
Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu

969
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,330
were once under me.

970
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,920
No one understands them better than I do.

971
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,920
If you go out and find another firm,

972
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,720
and come back if you think it won't work,

973
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,480
if it's less than 300,000,

974
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,520
then there's no point in talking.

975
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,780
How about this,

976
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,040
let's sit down and negotiate with him again.

977
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,670
I'll try to haggle the price down.

978
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,360
Mr. Han.

979
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,450
Well...

980
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,670
We

981
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,400
really came here for you.

982
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,800
Can you give us a discount?

983
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,670
50,000.

984
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,510
Let's be friends, okay?

985
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,320
Thank you.

986
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,280
Mr. Zhou.

987
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,170
You can ask around.

988
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,810
I won't take any cases with an appearance fee

989
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,320
less than 1 million.

990
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,110
But since you mentioned

991
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,800
the opposing lawyers are Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu,

992
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,860
I'll take this case.

993
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,720
Those two ingrates.

994
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,650
I'll teach them a lesson.

995
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,000
However,

996
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,920
regarding the legal fees,

997
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,490
there are national regulations in place.

998
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,440
If I lower it, I'll be violating the rules.

999
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,730
After you sign the agreement and pay the fee,

1000
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,170
I'll tell you how to win the lawsuit.

1001
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,360
That's when you'll know

1002
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,150
why I'm worth 144,000.

1003
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,710
Alright?

1004
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,840
Who made the opposing lawyers

1005
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,460
Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu?

1006
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,480
Those two ingrates.

1007
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,190
Alright,

1008
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,780
I'll give you a 14,000 discount.

1009
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,620
130,000.

1010
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,400
That's the lowest I can go.

1011
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,590
Tian,

1012
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,810
please make a copy of the ID and this agreement

1013
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,760
for backup.

1014
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,010
The Wei Cheng rape case.

1015
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,180
Wei Cheng... How about this?

1016
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,280
Mr. Chen,

1017
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,670
the firm now requires

1018
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,290
all case file borrowings to be registered.

1019
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,820
Please register your borrowing.

1020
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,010
Alright.

1021
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,190
What's "ungrateful"?

1022
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,630
Those three ingrates are.

1023
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,400
When they first joined the firm,

1024
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,150
I taught them everything step by step.

1025
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,630
Now that they've grown their wings,they turn their backs on me.

1026
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,760
Typical villains.

1027
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,570
Birds of a feather flock together.

1028
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,210
If they weren't like that,

1029
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,420
they wouldn't be representing this case, right?

1030
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,110
Tian.

1031
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,510
Mr. Chen.

1032
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,360
-What are you doing?
-Typing up a contract?

1033
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,710
Who's Mr. Han talking to?

1034
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,000
What are they gesturing about?

1035
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,020
He looks unhappy.

1036
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,400
Two clients just came in.

1037
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,920
They came to Liangcheng Law Firm

1038
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,920
because they have a grudge against Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu.

1039
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,970
They owe Luo Yingzi's client several million yuan

1040
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
and refuse to pay it back.

1041
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
They client wants to sue her.

1042
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,400
My mentor heard about the large subject matter

1043
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,720
and egged them on,

1044
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,680
badmouthing Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu.

1045
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,240
He convinced them to sign the contract.

1046
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,070
They signed it?

1047
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
So these clients came to the right person, right?

1048
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,750
Absolutely.

1049
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,540
Since the contract is signed,

1050
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,640
that means he'll make money.

1051
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,810
Didn't he give you a share?

1052
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,020
Mr. Chen, you're kidding, right?

1053
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,630
If I want to squeeze money out of my mentor,

1054
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,400
I'd need to have steel nails.
