[Episode 29]

3
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,870
Mr. Han.

4
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,430
How did it go?

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,280
She wasn't too happy.

6
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,350
What did she say?

7
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,550
We talked about Mingshan.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
What was her attitude?

9
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,640
She's very firm.

10
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,280
We have to be reasonable.

11
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,710
So...

12
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,510
Enough, don't say anything else.

13
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,800
This money has to be returned.

14
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,910
I'll return it…

15
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,790
As long as Chen Shuo does.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,710
I can't betray Chen Shuo, can I?

17
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,280
Stop worrying about Chen Shuo, okay?

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,020
He's about to be fired.

19
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,530
What?

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,630
I can't let one person's interests

21
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,840
ruin the entire firm.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,630
Same goes for you.

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,060
Return the money!

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,400
I...

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,050
Well,

26
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,650
I've already paid the taxes.

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,430
I can't return that much.

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,590
Taxes aren't a problem. The firm will cover it.

29
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,460
Okay.

30
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll return it.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,400
It's settled then.

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,110
I'll return it.

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,880
Mentor, can you stop playing with the phone?

34
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,590
What are you really thinking?

35
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,150
Director Han.

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
Director Han.

37
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,050
Mr. Han, you got reprimanded, didn't you?

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
I couldn't protect you.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
They're forcing me to return the money;

40
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,829
I had no choice but to agree.

41
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,470
That's your own business.

42
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,560
You can make your own decisions. No need to inform me.

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,390
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

44
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,079
I really had no choice.

45
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,570
Xu Zhuo might

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,570
sue you in the future.

47
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,090
You need to be careful.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
That guy is no good.

49
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,940
If you need my help in the future...

50
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,680
Mr. Han.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,079
Bro.

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,630
This is my own business.

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,590
I'll handle it myself.

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,930
I'll try not to cause you any trouble.

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,210
But thank you.

56
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,060
I've said everything I needed to say.

57
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,890
He used to be pretty smooth,

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,500
but why is he being so stubborn this time?

59
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,470
I really have no choice.

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,460
We can't take such a huge risk

61
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,450
just for him.

62
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,190
Zhang Zhi,

63
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,010
go and notify him.

64
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,190
Tell him, on behalf of all the partners,

65
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,120
that he must return the money immediately.

66
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,240
If he refuses,

67
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,920
then we'll have to ask him to leave Liangcheng Law Firm.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,270
Okay, I'll notify him.

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,800
You two, come with me.

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,600
Mr. Chen.

71
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,630
Director Zhang, what's the matter?

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,570
Fang Rui, please step out for a moment.

73
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,200
No need. It's fine.

74
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,340
This is my apprentice. It's okay for him to be here.

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,010
Please, go ahead.

76
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,310
Mr. Chen, I'm

77
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,600
speaking to you today on behalf of the partners.

78
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,480
You must return the money.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,030
At the same time,

80
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,870
I can assure you, on behalf of the firm,

81
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,130
that as long as you return it,

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,600
we will cover your losses.

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,310
I refuse. I won't return it.

84
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Chen.

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Liangcheng Law Firm

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,270
can't keep you anymore.

87
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,600
I'll leave, no problem.

88
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,270
I currently have four cases—

89
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,870
two were signed after I joined the firm,

90
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,120
and two I brought in myself.

91
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,480
So, I can take

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,270
the two I brought, right?

93
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,000
No, you can't.

94
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,800
Any case you handled while at Liangcheng Law Firm

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,270
belongs to us.

96
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,409
That's ridiculous.

97
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,390
You're such a big firm,

98
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,680
aren't you afraid of being a joke?

99
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,070
Mr. Chen, since it's decided,

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,360
then leave now.

101
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,360
Okay.

102
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,630
You two, come in.

103
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,200
No need. Don't trouble them.

104
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,280
I can pack up myself.

105
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,020
There's not much stuff.

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,940
Well, Mr. Chen, I won't see you out then.

107
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,770
No need.

108
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,659
You two keep an eye on things here.

109
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,930
He can only take his personal belongings.

110
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,730
Understood.

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,280
Director Zhang,

112
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,000
wait for me.

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,270
It's none of your business.

114
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,960
Wait for me.

115
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,940
You two can go back. I'll keep watch here.

116
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,830
Where's Director Zhang?

117
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,750
You two go back to work. It's really fine.

118
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,310
This contribution is quite significant.

119
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,430
Fang...

120
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,890
Ms. Fang.

121
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,040
What's really going on?

122
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,950
Who let you in?

123
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,190
Get out.

124
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,700
Shuo.

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,270
I... Let me help you.

126
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,560
No, no, don't touch anything.

127
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,070
If they see you helping,

128
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,850
your life here

129
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
will only get harder.

130
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
What happened to my mentor?

131
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,920
The client was the one who acted in bad faith

132
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
and betrayed him,

133
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,720
and instead of protecting him,

134
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,830
the firm is firing him at a time like this?

135
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,240
Are these the so-called

136
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,310
laws and principles you always talk about?

137
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,870
You're just an intern. What do you know?

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,920
I may not understand everything,

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
but he's my mentor.

140
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,040
He's also part of this firm.

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,390
You should protect him.

142
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,190
Fang Rui,

143
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,750
do you still want to keep working here?

144
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,280
Are you going to fire me?

145
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,159
I took money from this case too;

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,830
are you going to fire me along with him?

147
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,000
Say that again.

148
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,860
Ms. Fang.

149
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,270
This has nothing to do with you.

150
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,800
Go back and calm down.

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,430
I'm begging you.

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,480
Ms. Fang, I'm begging you.

153
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,390
You must save my mentor.

154
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,560
Ms. Fang, I'm begging you.

155
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,250
The firm is going too far.

156
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,720
They're just looking out for their own interests;

157
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,320
I get it.

158
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,400
Shuo, why don't you fight back against them?

159
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,100
I did.

160
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,880
And this is the result.

161
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,750
Look at you, all dejected.

162
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
Was it even worth it?

163
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,830
You fought for it, and what did you get? The same outcome.

164
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,430
Fang Rui, since we've been master and apprentice,

165
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,140
I'll allow myself to be sentimental for once

166
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
as I leave Liangcheng Law Firm today.

167
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,390
I've really enjoyed

168
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,159
working with you,

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and having you as my apprentice

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,040
has been a pleasure.

171
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,680
Thank you for being by my side during these days.

172
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,950
We'll have plenty of chances ahead.

173
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,260
Tian,

174
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,190
you've got talent,

175
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,950
but cut back on the little tricks.

176
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,950
Keep it up.

177
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
You should work hard too.

178
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,870
Work hard and pass the bar exam.

179
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,420
I'm leaving.

180
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,200
Fang Rui,

181
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,360
I plan to take a break for a while

182
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
and not do anything.

183
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,840
What about you?

184
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,960
I'll find a place to settle down

185
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,300
and focus on studying.

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,390
I have to pass the exam this year.

187
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,630
Keep your word.

188
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,000
You have to pass, got it?

189
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,550
We'll stay in touch by phone.

190
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,630
I'm leaving now.

191
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,690
Mentor, I... I have something to confess to you.

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,270
Confess? Why so serious?

193
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,030
What is it?

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,440
I… I actually had a task

195
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,940
while staying by your side.

196
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
A task?

197
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,390
What kind of task? Tell me.

198
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,550
You often went to the archives to check case files

199
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,120
after joining Liangcheng Law Firm.

200
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,740
The firm didn't trust you,

201
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,630
so they placed me by your side

202
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,100
to see what cases you were looking at.

203
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,120
Did your aunt send you?

204
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,860
She probably had a hand in it,

205
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,940
but she wasn't the one who arranged it directly.

206
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,410
Got it. Thank you for telling me.

207
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
I... I have one more thing.

208
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,300
Another one?

209
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,090
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,550
When you weren't paying attention,

211
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
I secretly hid the case file

212
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,270
of Han representing He Qiaohui.

213
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,240
But… But I swear

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
I didn't tell my aunt about this.

215
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,070
That authorization letter, right?

216
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,940
Think about it, Fang Rui.

217
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,790
That day, did I really forget it

218
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,120
in the office,

219
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
or did I leave it there on purpose

220
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,530
for you to "accidentally" find?

221
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,730
Think about it yourself.

222
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,440
If I remember correctly,

223
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,270
I placed that authorization letter

224
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,730
in the second layer of that stack of documents.

225
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,790
Wait.

226
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,630
You knew about this, Mentor?

227
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,200
Of course, I planned it.

228
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,970
Fang Rui,

229
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,750
when you first came here,

230
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,530
I knew exactly why.

231
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,120
I was always on guard around you.

232
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,960
People are like that sometimes.

233
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,170
We seem close,

234
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
standing face to face,

235
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,650
smiling at each other,

236
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,870
but deep down,

237
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
we all have

238
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,200
our boundaries.

239
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,610
But in the end, there aren't many people

240
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,340
you can truly let go of those defenses with

241
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,120
and be completely honest.

242
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,910
After everything we've been through,

243
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,320
we're lucky.

244
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,060
From now on, we're brothers for life.

245
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,120
Mentor, I feel much better

246
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,640
after saying all this.

247
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,470
I...

248
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,030
I'm leaving now.

249
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,590
Go.

250
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,730
Alright.

251
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,090
Drive safely.

252
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,040
Okay.

253
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,870
Fang Rui,

254
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,960
there's nothing else you're keeping from me, right?

255
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
There's nothing else.

256
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,430
You already confessed two things today.

257
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,450
There's really nothing else?

258
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,530
No.

259
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Really?

260
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,630
Yes.

261
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,590
Go, I'm just kidding.

262
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,400
Alright, I'm leaving, Mentor.

263
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,370
Drive safely.

264
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,720
Ms. Fang,

265
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,160
Fang Rui actually left with Chen Shuo.

266
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,610
Aren't you going to talk him out of it?

267
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,140
Send a formal letter to Mingshan Group immediately,

268
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,650
and email them a copy as well.

269
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,200
Inform them that Liangcheng Law Firm

270
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,840
has agreed to return the full amount received.

271
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,390
As for the payments made directly to Chen Shuo,

272
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,120
those were his personal dealings.

273
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,450
Since he has already left Liangcheng Law Firm,

274
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,120
the firm bears no responsibility

275
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,310
for his individual actions.

276
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,630
I think you're foolish.

277
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,560
Chen Shuo was brought in by Tao Zheng;

278
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,840
it must have been him who pushed Chen Shuo out.

279
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
Why did you get involved?

280
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,310
Tao Zheng is so sneaky.

281
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,240
Fang Lihong tried several times to get him to talk to Chen Shuo,

282
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,730
but he never managed to get anywhere.

283
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,050
Now that

284
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,630
things are about to blow up,

285
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,450
just let me go and inform Chen Shuo.

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,870
And with that guy's awful temper,

287
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,190
why should I be the one to take the fall?

288
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,000
Chen Shuo may look sharp,

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,960
but just look at the agreement he signed.

290
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,840
It only authorizes him to receive legal documents

291
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
and enforcement payments on behalf of the firm—

292
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,090
nothing

293
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,310
about distributing them.

294
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,790
Now that he's gone ahead and allocated the funds himself,

295
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,600
isn't this the perfect trap?

296
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,590
Forget it, Han,

297
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,220
this matter has nothing to do with you anymore.

298
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,360
Besides,

299
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,440
didn't the firm agree to compensate you for your losses?

300
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,870
What are you still angry about?

301
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,620
I'm not as magnanimous as you.

302
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Not only did I lose the money I had in hand,

303
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,150
but they're also pushing me around.

304
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,150
Not only did they screw over Chen Shuo,

305
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,750
but they came after me too.

306
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,720
Why the hell should I put up with that?

307
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,460
Do they really think I'm just some pushover?

308
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,750
Come in.

309
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,330
Hello, Mr. Sun.

310
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,400
Mr. Han,

311
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,960
what brings you here?

312
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,430
Look, we've worked together;

313
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,470
there's no need to burn bridges, right?

314
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,940
Is there really anything left for us to discuss?

315
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,270
We have a lot to talk about.

316
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,470
Sit down.

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,790
Okay.

318
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,790
Mr. Sun, I came to see you today

319
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,320
to show my sincerity.

320
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,090
I've already returned my share of the money.

321
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,530
Well, thank you.

322
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,640
Our firm's share of the money

323
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,500
will be returned to you soon as well.

324
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,390
We're working on the issue with Chen Shuo.

325
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,920
Thank your firm for me.

326
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
But with all this,

327
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,480
I ended up working for you

328
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,750
for nothing.

329
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,640
Can I be honest with you?

330
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,500
Go ahead.

331
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,990
I think

332
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,960
you didn't handle this matter properly.

333
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,310
No matter what,

334
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,360
without the efforts of me and Chen Shuo,

335
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,090
how could you

336
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,280
have reached a final agreement with Minghai,

337
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,290
and how could you have gotten your 20 million back?

338
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,910
We had

339
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,630
no choice.

340
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,140
The company is waiting for the funds,

341
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,400
and you were asking for too much.

342
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,750
But you turned around

343
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,240
and screwed us lawyers over like this;

344
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,240
doesn't that seem a bit unfair?

345
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,070
There's nothing

346
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,720
we could do about it.

347
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
Didn't we agree

348
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,720
last time that

349
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,500
if you were willing to make concessions,

350
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,390
we'd

351
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,840
compensate you with a certain amount of agency fees?

352
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,150
But who would've expected that

353
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,230
Chen Shuo wouldn't budge an inch?

354
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,480
To be honest with you,

355
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,720
we made significant compromises

356
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,360
to reach this agreement with Minghai Group.

357
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,760
So, that means

358
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,430
we won the case for you,

359
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,750
and according to the court ruling,

360
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,080
Minghai Group was supposed to pay you 50 million

361
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,170
plus 17 million in liquidated damages.

362
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,690
But you gave up those claims

363
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,440
during the settlement.

364
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,130
What else could we do?

365
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,430
Yes, you won the case for us,

366
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,190
but the company desperately needed the money.

367
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,080
Based on our agreement,

368
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,570
we still have to pay you over 10 million.

369
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,150
How are we supposed to

370
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,400
enforce this agreement?

371
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,510
Fine.

372
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,630
But you asked us to return the money;

373
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,550
that's a bit unreasonable, isn't it?

374
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,670
Didn't we agree earlier that

375
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,790
the 5.6 million we claimed would be ours,

376
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,320
and you'd reimburse

377
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,150
Chen Shuo's upfront costs?

378
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,820
Yes, that's what we initially agreed on.

379
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,910
But Chen Shuo

380
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,400
refused to budge even an inch.

381
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,390
And besides, his unauthorized withdrawal of funds

382
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,440
is potentially illegal.

383
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,780
We can get all the money back completely.

384
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,640
Since we can do that,

385
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,180
why wouldn't we?

386
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
So we worked hard for so long,

387
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,130
we didn't make a single cent,

388
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,510
but lost our initial costs,

389
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,380
and now have to bear legal risks as well.

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,750
This case really turned out to be...

391
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,750
Mr. Sun,

392
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,400
no matter what,

393
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,590
I really appreciate you

394
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,980
being upfront with me

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,040
about all this.

396
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,480
Mr. Han,

397
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,650
I'm also genuinely moved that

398
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,590
you came here today.

399
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,920
I, Sun Mingshan, am not heartless.

400
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,020
I've been screwed over before myself;

401
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,800
I know exactly how it feels.

402
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,590
Actually,

403
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,240
we originally wanted to ask for the money back,

404
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,580
and then negotiate a fair price

405
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,300
between both parties.

406
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,270
Since you're here today,

407
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,480
how about this,

408
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,830
you can come again

409
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,510
after I settle this matter

410
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,570
with Mr. Chen,

411
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,120
and I'll definitely give you a fair compensation.

412
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,080
Thank you so much.

413
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,270
You see,

414
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,270
I came here to explain that

415
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,920
I've returned the money.

416
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,340
I just hope that

417
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,070
you won't make things too hard for Mr. Chen

418
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,220
considering the efforts I've put in.

419
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,430
If he could return the money like you did,

420
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,930
I wouldn't give him a hard time.

421
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,030
[Dad]

422
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,440
Hello, Dad.

423
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,480
Fang Rui, where are you?

424
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,830
Come home right now.

425
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,150
I'm not going back. I've already rented a place.

426
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,900
What are you trying to do exactly?

427
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,370
Your aunt has told me everything.

428
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,090
Let me tell you clearly today,

429
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,910
you can't do that.

430
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,590
She's your aunt.

431
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,130
How can you go against her?

432
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,400
Now you're not talking about the law anymore,

433
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
but you're talking about family ties, aren't you?

434
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,350
I said I'm not going back.

435
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
Besides, I'm already an adult.

436
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,000
I can feed myself.

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,160
Don't interfere with my life.

438
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,790
You don't need to plan my life for me anymore.

439
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,020
He's becoming more and more outrageous.

440
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,590
What did you say?

441
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,300
Liangcheng Law Firm fired you at this time?

442
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,640
Yeah,

443
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,270
they saw me as a burden and hassle;

444
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,550
so of course they'd fire me.

445
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,550
This is not right. It's so unfair.

446
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,550
This doesn't even have basic morality.

447
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,160
When they needed you,

448
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,960
and split the money with you, they were all smiles.

449
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,350
But the moment trouble shows up, they drop you first?

450
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,980
Is this how people should behave?

451
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,600
Let's not talk about them anymore.

452
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,210
Stop playing.

453
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,790
Stop playing.

454
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,310
No, no, no, no.

455
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,030
Stop playing.

456
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:16,960
You.

457
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,110
What should you do now?

458
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,190
Here, have some water.

459
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,720
What should I do now?

460
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,280
Well, I'm basically unemployed.

461
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
I can't just keep drifting around.

462
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,030
I gotta find a firm.

463
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,440
But finding the right one won't be easy,

464
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,360
at least not anytime soon.

465
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,350
Come back.

466
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,590
Come back to Dazheng Law Firm.

467
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,270
Don't work there.

468
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,960
Just the other day, the director mentioned that

469
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,960
it was a pity to let you go.

470
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,750
Come back.

471
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,960
Did the director really say that?

472
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,750
Yes.

473
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,360
I'm not going back.

474
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,310
How can I get back?

475
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,750
If I go back, they'll definitely say

476
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,720
I couldn't make it at Liangcheng Law Firm,

477
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,790
so I came back.

478
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,830
You know me—I've got my pride.

479
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,030
A good man doesn't backtrack.

480
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,750
I'm not going back.

481
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,210
Xue, I didn't just call you here today

482
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,480
to sign this agreement,

483
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,000
but there's something important.

484
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,720
I can't count on anyone else.

485
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm counting on you.

486
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
Tell me, what is it?

487
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,350
Based on what I know,

488
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,450
Xu Zhuo might sue me

489
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
as their lawyer.

490
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,000
So you'll have to represent me in court.

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,920
That's the first thing.

492
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,350
Secondly,

493
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,880
I can't just sit at home waiting for them to sue me.

494
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
So, I want to entrust you with this.

495
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,310
You'll be my representative

496
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,550
to send a legal letter to Mingshan Group on my behalf,

497
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,400
demanding every cent they owe me,

498
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,150
exactly as stated in the contract—

499
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,350
not a penny less.

500
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Most importantly,

501
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,270
since Sun Mingshan messed with me,

502
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,370
I'm gonna make sure he pays for it.

503
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,040
I want him to see just how tough I really am.

504
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,420
[Application for Property Preservation]

505
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,040
Pre-litigation asset preservation?

506
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,520
Yes.

507
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,030
You're going to freeze the joint account?

508
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,030
Yes.

509
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,070
Since he made things difficult for me,

510
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,500
I won't let him have it easy.

511
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,480
Is it feasible?

512
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,110
Why wouldn't it be feasible?

513
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,310
The agency contract was signed between Mingshan Group and Liangcheng Law Firm.

514
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,720
You're just the appointed lawyer.

515
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,680
If you sue Mingshan Group directly,

516
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,950
do you even have standing?

517
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,640
Well, you've really honed your skills now.

518
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,770
Is that how it is?

519
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
You've thought it through quite thoroughly.

520
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,590
That's exactly how it is. No problem.

521
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,480
Liangcheng Law Firm wanted to cut ties with me,

522
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,920
so they signed an agreement with Mingshan Group,

523
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,310
stating that all issues regarding agency fees

524
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,860
should be handled directly between me and Mingshan Group.

525
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,760
They won't be involved,

526
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,030
and it has nothing to do with them.

527
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,410
I've included this agreement inside.

528
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,700
So no need to worry too much about the standing.

529
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,590
The bigger issue now is

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,140
the pre-litigation asset preservation—that's gonna be tricky.

531
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,450
But I believe in you.

532
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,270
Just go ahead

533
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,160
and submit the application today.

534
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,240
No matter what obstacles come up,

535
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,550
get it done for me.

536
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,550
Once the court accepts it, stay on them

537
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,110
and make sure they freeze that joint account.

538
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,830
Unless I personally lift the freeze,

539
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,850
Sun Mingshan won't be able to touch a single cent.

540
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,400
I'll file the lawsuit within a month.

541
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,320
Think it through.

542
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,860
If you go through with this,

543
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,280
you'll drag Sun Mingshan down with it.

544
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,690
Are you sure about this?

545
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,110
I want to drag him down.

546
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,250
I'm sure.

547
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,760
Alright.

548
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,640
I can help you with the pre-litigation asset preservation,

549
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,550
but I can't help you go all out against Mingshan Group.

550
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,550
What do you mean?

551
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,400
You think Mingshan is a big corporation

552
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,550
that you can't afford to offend? Are you scared?

553
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,160
It's not that.

554
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,160
Think about it.

555
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,770
Now you're

556
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,550
going all out against them.

557
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,880
This won't be over in a short time.

558
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,880
What you need now is

559
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,550
a capable, energetic

560
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,550
and young lawyer.

561
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,340
I'm not your best choice.

562
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,490
Luo Yingzi is.

563
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,270
You...

564
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,590
You should join Luo Yingzi's firm

565
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,130
and let her represent you.

566
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,000
No.

567
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,510
This isn't the time to be stubborn.

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,680
Think about it.

569
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,140
If Xu Zhuo really takes on Mingshan's case,

570
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,840
he's not going to let it go easily.

571
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,750
I can't handle it alone.

572
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,880
How about this:

573
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,880
if you're too embarrassed to say it,

574
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,790
I'll call Luo Yingzi.

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,400
Don't say anything.

576
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,960
What are you doing?

577
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,550
I'm calling her.

578
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,350
No.

579
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,310
I'm calling her. Put it down.

580
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,810
I'm getting angry.

581
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,590
You think

582
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,830
Luo Yingzi likes Xu Zhuo, don't you?

583
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,990
What is Xu Zhuo, anyway?

584
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,400
He's just a person

585
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,070
with a bit of a reputation.

586
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,400
What girl wouldn't be drawn in

587
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,460
by that at first?

588
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,960
Luo Yingzi's no exception.

589
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,830
But once you get close,

590
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,590
that so-called legend fades.

591
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,590
Luo Yingzi is a good girl.

592
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,570
She's smart too.

593
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
This is the perfect chance

594
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,960
for her to see Xu Zhuo for who he really is;

595
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,510
doesn't that work out just fine?

596
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,150
No, it's not.

597
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
She's handling Wanhe Case,

598
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,710
and she's also in Xu Zhuo's team.

599
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,160
With things so complicated,

600
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,030
is it really a good idea to have her represent me?

601
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,710
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

602
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,710
You still have feelings for Luo Yingzi, don't you?

603
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,200
We brought her up,

604
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,070
and the two of us just kept going back and forth like this...

605
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,160
Alright, did you bring the agreement?

606
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,020
Let's sign the agreement.

607
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,590
I brought it.

608
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,100
You keep saying no to everything.

609
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,640
What exactly works for you?

610
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,550
You can't talk without mentioning her, can you?

611
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,980
It's the same format as before.

612
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,640
How much are you trying to screw me over this time?

613
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,740
Go easy on me.

614
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,030
But if I get that 7 million back,

615
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,790
you set the split.

616
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,330
Brother,

617
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,740
is this correct? One yuan?

618
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,920
That's right.

619
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,950
Are you serious?

620
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,110
You're just putting on a show, aren't you?

621
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,400
I'm telling you, if I get all that money back,

622
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
you're gonna regret this, Xue.

623
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,510
Brother,

624
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,240
actually, over the years,

625
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,920
I've made some money working with you.

626
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Every time we discussed the agency fees,

627
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,550
I was a bit unfair,

628
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,420
and you know it.

629
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,120
I know it even better.

630
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,160
Brother,

631
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,300
you're in trouble now.

632
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,810
If I don't help you,

633
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,050
who will?

634
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,850
Sign it.

635
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Just one yuan?

636
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,790
Yes.

637
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,960
Come on,

638
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,830
let me give you a hug.

639
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,330
Let's hug.

640
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,860
Hang in there; I've got your back.

641
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,240
With you here, I feel more at ease.

642
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,910
Thank you.

643
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
I'm going to take care of this matter.

644
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,070
Here, take this.

645
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,410
Xue,

646
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,110
well,

647
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,930
thank you, really.

648
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,730
Don't mention it.

649
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,940
Go.

650
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,590
I'm leaving.

651
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,220
Mr. Sun, Chen Shuo has sent a lawyer's letter

652
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,650
demanding that we pay all his agency fees.

653
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,990
What do you think about this?

654
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,150
Just ignore him.

655
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,120
For how long?

656
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm just worried if we drag this out too long,

657
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,390
he'll become a bigger headache down the line.

658
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,440
He might cause us trouble again.

659
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,780
Mr. Gao,

660
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,350
back when Chen Shuo had Liangcheng Law Firm backing him,

661
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,040
we had to tread carefully.

662
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
Now that he's been fired,

663
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,460
he's out on his own, completely powerless.

664
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,830
No one wants to deal with him.

665
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,350
He's not a threat, so just let him be.

666
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,960
Yes.

667
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,960
Come in.

668
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,480
Mr. Sun, bad news.

669
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,720
The court has frozen our joint account.

670
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,000
Why did they freeze it? On what grounds?

671
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,880
There's over 10 million in there!

672
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,550
Chen Shuo filed for

673
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,310
a pre-litigation asset preservation,

674
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,720
and the court approved it.

675
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,350
What do you mean by preservation?

676
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,510
What pre-litigation?

677
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,640
What's going on, Mr. Gao?

678
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
What about my money?

679
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,160
The funds are temporarily frozen

680
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,920
unless you provide equivalent asset collateral

681
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,810
or Chen Shuo voluntarily lifts the freeze.

682
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,330
He did this on purpose.

683
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
He's definitely going to sue you next.

684
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,250
We can file for a reconsideration,

685
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,710
but it will take time

686
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,750
and comes with legal risks.

687
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,300
I suggest we rethink Xu Zhuo

688
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,840
and start preparing for the lawsuit.

689
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,730
Chen Shuo.

690
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,340
Chen Shuo is just a bastard.

691
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,000
Mr. Sun,

692
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,140
Xu Zhuo won't budge on the price.

693
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,450
I'm suing for 5 million, and he wants 5 million?

694
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,720
One is greedier than the other.

695
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,680
Mr. Sun,

696
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,690
as long as the account stays frozen,

697
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,040
that 14 million is as good as useless.

698
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,590
If they file a lawsuit

699
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,750
and drag this out for months,

700
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,240
we won't be able to resume work and pay salaries,

701
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,400
and it might

702
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,110
even affect our negotiation with Minghai Group.

703
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,880
So you're suggesting that

704
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,310
I should get back the 5.6 million

705
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,070
and give him over 10 million?

706
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,160
I think

707
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,480
we should push him to force Chen Shuo to unfreeze the account first.

708
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,750
We can deal with the agency fee

709
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,070
after the lawsuit.

710
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
Xu Zhuo,

711
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,790
Chen Shuo,

712
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,350
and Minghai Group

713
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,930
all want to pin me down;

714
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,620
they all want to crush me.

715
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,550
Agree to him,

716
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,290
but

717
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,130
I want a contingency fee arrangement.

718
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,830
Mr. Xu, our Mr. Sun has agreed,

719
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,230
but he hopes you're willing to take this on a contingency basis.

720
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,200
Would that be acceptable for you?

721
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,890
Your boyfriend is quite impressive.

722
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,240
He's good-looking and wealthy.

723
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,400
Oh, come on.

724
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,550
He doesn't have money.

725
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,160
He even owes me money.

726
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
I still have to help him collect debts.

727
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,790
I'm just worrying about him all the time.

728
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,180
That's not a great dynamic for love.

729
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,110
You're not even dating but already acting like his mom.

730
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,270
That's a big no-no.

731
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,790
Can I ask you a question?

732
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,000
Does he have abs?

733
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,350
How would I know that?

734
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,220
After everything you two have been through chasing debts together,

735
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,110
you never got curious?

736
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,960
Are you okay?

737
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Are you feeling shy and embarrassed?

738
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,160
Mr. Xu.

739
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,880
Your face is all red.

740
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,570
Mr. Sun has repeatedly emphasized that

741
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,060
this matter depends on you.

742
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,400
I can't speak for others,

743
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,100
but if you choose me for this case,

744
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,660
I won't let your boss down.

745
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,200
Happy cooperation.

746
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,830
Happy cooperation.

747
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,960
Happy cooperation.

748
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,610
Alright.

749
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,590
We'll send the contract over to you

750
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,980
as soon as possible.

751
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,540
Okay.

752
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,370
Goodbye.

753
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,080
Goodbye.

754
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,270
The person next to Mr. Xu

755
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,310
looks familiar.

756
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,090
Oh, he's the legal counsel from Mingshan Group.

757
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,590
He came to see Mr. Xu before.

758
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,480
They couldn't agree on the price last time.

759
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,600
This time, it seems they've reached an agreement.

760
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,920
Go ahead and eat.

761
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,590
I'll eat, but aren't you having any sauce?

762
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,860
Nope. I'm on a diet.

763
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
He just called me, but I didn't answer.

764
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,440
I'll go call him back.

765
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,440
Ask him if he's got an eight-pack.

766
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,200
Qiu,

767
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,560
Xu Zhuo's definitely going to represent Mingshan.

768
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,790
I saw it with my own eyes.

769
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,790
What should we do now?

770
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,170
Should we tell Luo?

771
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,790
Let's end this matter here.

772
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,440
Don't let Xu Zhuo discover you.

773
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,390
I'll think about how to tell Luo Yingzi.

774
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,370
Alright.

775
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,070
So it's just Xia Shu busting her ass

776
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,200
at Zhuoyue Law Firm today

777
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,920
while you're chilling at office?

778
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
They're just wrapping things up over there.

779
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,560
She can handle it on her own.

780
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,310
How about we ask Xia Shu to come out?

781
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,030
You two have been holding the fort

782
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,830
at Zhuoyue Law Firm all this time—it hasn't been easy.

783
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,480
My treat for a big meal.

784
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,170
Let's talk about the big meal later.

785
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,270
Let me ask you something.

786
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,720
Did you leave

787
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,830
that gossip groupchat from Liangcheng Law Firm?

788
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,640
I don't work there anymore,

789
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,140
so why would I stay?

790
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,530
I couldn't care less about their drama.

791
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,720
Three days ago,

792
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,040
Liangcheng Law Firm cut ties with Chen Shuo.

793
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,310
They forced him out,

794
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,140
just like what happened to us back then.

795
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,010
Chen Shuo voluntarily proposed to resign.

796
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,000
Why didn't he tell me anything about it?

797
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,030
What was the reason?

798
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,350
Apparently, he

799
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,350
made an unauthorized transfer from the joint account,

800
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,350
and Mingshan Group threatened to sue him.

801
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,830
But that's not the main point.

802
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,080
The key is that Xia Shu just called me

803
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,450
and told me that Xu Zhuo has officially taken on Mingshan Group's case

804
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,760
and is going to sue Chen Shuo.

805
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,030
What?

806
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,920
Actually, a few days ago, Xia Shu had already noticed

807
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Mingshan Group had reached out to Xu Zhuo.

808
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,480
They just hadn't finalized the deal back then,

809
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,310
so I didn't mention it to you.

810
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,480
Now that Xu Zhuo is officially representing Mingshan Group

811
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,880
and Liangcheng Law Firm has fired Chen Shuo…

812
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,160
Wait, but Chen Shuo talked to me about this case.

813
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,440
Isn't it just some kind of financial dispute?

814
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,770
That's exactly why I think

815
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,880
it might be more than that.

816
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,440
If it were just a simple financial dispute,

817
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,050
would Liangcheng Law Firm have gone this far?

818
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,530
What else could it be then?

819
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,960
Mingshan Group hired Xu Zhuo for one reason—

820
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,010
to take down Chen Shuo.

821
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,350
Hello?

822
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,490
Is this Mr. Chen? This is Xu Zhuo.

823
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,680
Can we meet?

824
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,480
Mr. Xu, this place is good.

825
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,960
It's stylish and spacious,

826
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,620
but it lacks a bit of liveliness.

827
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,670
I've never been in prison,

828
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,360
but does it feel kind of like this—

829
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
no one cares about you

830
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,070
and quite desolate?

831
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,230
This place is way bigger than prison.

832
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,920
When I was inside, I swore that

833
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,760
if I ever got out,

834
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,320
I'd never go back.

835
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,630
Never thought I'd end up back in here again.

836
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
But when I made it out safe again,

837
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,840
I knew one thing for sure—

838
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,620
no one would ever take me down

839
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
again.

840
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,550
Mr. Xu,

841
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,320
your story is quite inspiring.

842
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,710
But I'm not some young girl who idolizes you.

843
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
This kind of talk

844
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,110
won't move me.

845
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,239
Please have a seat.

846
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,270
No, thanks.

847
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,630
Just get to the point.

848
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,440
Mr. Chen, I have no intention of being your enemy.

849
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,230
Taking on the Mingshan Case wasn't exactly my choice.

850
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,360
As long as you're willing to

851
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
negotiate with Mingshan Group

852
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,710
and admit that transferring funds from the joint account

853
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,660
was a violation,

854
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,960
you can get the money you want.

855
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,000
Mr. Xu, does Mingshan Group know

856
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,110
you asked me here today

857
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,820
and that you just made me this offer?

858
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,010
I didn't tell them.

859
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,770
I wanted to resolve this with you privately.

860
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,070
Secretly reaching out to the opposing party

861
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,920
behind your own client's back—

862
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,800
doesn't that go against a lawyer's professional ethics?

863
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,990
Also,

864
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,880
if this is all you wanted to discuss,

865
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,230
I can give you a direct answer—

866
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
I don't agree.

867
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,230
Mr. Chen,

868
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,590
I've never wronged you

869
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,350
in the past, and we have no ongoing grudges.

870
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,110
Why are you forcing my hand?

871
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,800
That's right.

872
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,330
What you said is correct.

873
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,820
We have no grudges.

874
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,920
Even if we were on opposing sides in that lawsuit

875
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,710
three years ago

876
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,550
and I lost,

877
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,070
I never held anything against you.

878
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Why would I force you?

879
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,210
And what exactly am I forcing you to do?

880
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,840
You know.

881
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,040
I don't know.

882
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,170
Alright.

883
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,640
Now,

884
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,450
I'm not speaking on behalf of Mingshan Group,

885
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,840
I just represent myself.

886
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,240
As long as we stay out of each other's way

887
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,440
and you don't make trouble for me,

888
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I can make the Mingshan issue go away for you.

889
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,800
Mr. Xu, what are you afraid of?

890
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,680
So,

891
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,040
you're not agreeing then?

892
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,390
Aren't you afraid of making an enemy?

893
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,230
I, Chen Shuo, have always walked the right path.

894
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

895
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,270
And if you're thinking about

896
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
doing something to me because of this,

897
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,250
go ahead. I'm not afraid.

898
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,360
Think about it again.

899
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,160
No need.

900
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,830
Goodbye.

901
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:52,880
Goodbye.

902
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,510
Hello?

903
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,930
Unscrupulous Chen.

904
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,280
I heard you were fired from Liangcheng Law Firm.

905
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,720
You're right; I was fired.

906
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,760
Do you need something?

907
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,830
Yes, I do. What are you doing?

908
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,080
What can an unemployed person do? Just idling around.

909
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,940
Let's meet.

910
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,620
Is there something you need?

911
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,020
Let's talk when we meet, okay?

912
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
See you at the usual place.

913
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,230
I'm leaving now.

914
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm hanging up.

915
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,710
What's it?

916
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,850
I heard about the Mingshan Case.

917
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,000
It's just a regular lawsuit.

918
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,980
Besides, there's no rule regulating that

919
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
a lawyer can't fight their own case.

920
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,840
You're being strange.

921
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,850
You came here just for me?

922
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,070
You're not here on someone's behalf to persuade me to back down, are you?

923
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,630
What do you mean?

924
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
If you didn't understand, let me be more clear.

925
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,060
Are you here to persuade me on behalf of Xu Zhuo?

926
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,710
Let me tell you,

927
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,490
it's pointless.

928
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,330
I wasn't raised to be scared.

929
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,920
Talk you into backing down?

930
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,180
Come on, you really don't know why I came?

931
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't.

932
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,440
Isn't this just

933
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,150
an ordinary economic case?

934
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,270
Why did you come all this way?

935
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,670
I...

936
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,030
Because...

937
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,070
Because of what?

938
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,860
As for this case,

939
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,700
even if I lose in the end,

940
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,760
at worst, I'll just have to pay back the money.

941
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,170
Why are you so anxious? What for?

942
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,320
For...

943
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,110
For what?

944
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,060
Because I just want to have an honest discussion with you

945
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,100
about this case.

946
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,920
Just about the case?

947
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,050
You've told me about this case before.

948
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,800
I'm asking you, just to talk about the case?

949
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,390
I just want to know more details now.

950
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,510
Fine, let's talk about the case then.

951
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,520
And send me that contract.

952
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,090
I've sent it.

953
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,370
The case is like this.

954
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,300
I represented Mingshan Group in a lawsuit against Minghai Group.

955
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,280
We won the case,

956
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,960
but then Mingshan Group went behind my back

957
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,630
to negotiate a settlement with Minghai.

958
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,510
Fortunately, when I signed the contract,

959
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,630
I had the foresight to include a clause

960
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,430
stating that if they negotiated a settlement behind the lawyer's back,

961
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,570
it would be considered that all the lawyer's duties

962
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,520
and representation

963
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,040
had been fully completed.

964
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,220
So, Mingshan Group

965
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,000
was supposed to pay me all the agency fees.

966
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,920
Of course, I didn't do that.

967
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,190
I just waited until

968
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,800
the first payment came in,

969
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,230
and then I took out 5.6 million myself.

970
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,840
Now, Mingshan Group is demanding that I return the money,

971
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,280
and since I refuse, they are suing me.

972
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,090
The contract stipulates that

973
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,600
you can collect enforcement payments on their behalf,

974
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,610
but it doesn't specify that you can directly deduct

975
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,820
or allocate agency fees.

976
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,920
I know.

977
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,060
I didn't mention it at the time

978
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,190
because I knew it wouldn't make any difference.

979
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,870
If it can be resolved with money, then it's not a big deal.

980
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,800
You're suggesting that I should return the money, right?

981
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,900
I suggest you protect yourself.

982
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,610
Mingshan Group isn't entirely in the right here,

983
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,090
but what you did wasn’t exactly flawless either.

984
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Mingshan Group wants to hire Mr. Xu now.

985
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,630
They clearly want to make a big deal out of this.

986
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,630
I'd suggest you return the money first

987
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,080
to secure your position both legally and morally.

988
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,960
You can always sue them later with the agreement,

989
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,430
and you might win.

990
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,720
Why do you keep mentioning Mr. Xu?

991
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,780
Can you stop mentioning him?

992
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,710
He's not important.

993
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,710
Then who is important?

994
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,840
Am I important?

995
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,840
Tell me, Luo Yingzi,

996
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,710
am I important?

997
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,850
Am I important?

998
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,290
He's not important.

999
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,630
Fine, he's not important.

1000
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,460
I'm not important either.

1001
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,090
He's not important.

1002
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,240
This matter can be big or small,

1003
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,110
entirely depending on Mingshan's attitude.

1004
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,880
Right now, they're taking the civil lawsuit route,

1005
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,610
but it might escalate to a criminal case next.

1006
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,260
If they accuse you of embezzlement,

1007
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,770
you could end up in jail.

1008
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,480
I know.

1009
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,890
I knew it would turn out this way.

1010
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,960
But as a lawyer,

1011
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,880
let's talk about this case.

1012
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,150
If you were representing Mingshan Group,

1013
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,280
which direction would you take it?

1014
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,650
Would you push for criminal charges?

1015
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,630
Of course not.

1016
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,340
This is just a regular financial dispute.

1017
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,160
Then there you go. So why even bring up criminal charges?

1018
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:24,880
You just said

1019
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,770
this is just a regular financial dispute—

1020
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,640
unless you know for sure that Xu Zhuo

1021
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,920
is determined to accuse me of embezzlement

1022
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,020
and get me thrown in jail.

1023
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,550
If you know what kind of person he is,

1024
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,980
why are you still siding with him now?

1025
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,970
Can we stop talking about him?

1026
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,230
I came here today because I think

1027
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,280
you should negotiate with Mingshan Group.

1028
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,730
Fine, Luo Yingzi.

1029
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,300
Let's not talk about this anymore, okay?

1030
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,150
I appreciate you taking the time

1031
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,950
to come all this way

1032
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,780
just to talk to me about this.

1033
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,800
Thank you.

1034
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,920
But I also need you to tell Xu Zhuo that

1035
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,650
I'm not returning the money—

1036
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,660
unless he's got what it takes to beat me.

1037
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,950
You are very important.
