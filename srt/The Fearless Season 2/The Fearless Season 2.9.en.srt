00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,860
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,840
The key now is

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
how we can legally and cleverly

5
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,870
distribute the assets.

6
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,320
Is it correct for me to understand it this way?

7
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,870
Well,

8
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,350
I'm thinking of giving my assets to my dad,

9
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,220
do you think that works?

10
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,420
That won't work.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
The direct line of relatives

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,070
is too obvious.

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,200
Once they look into it, it'll be easy to find.

14
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,950
Is there anyone that

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,920
both of you trust completely

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,540
and

17
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,570
who hasn't been involved in this matter at all?

18
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,280
Hui,

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,539
we can transfer the money

20
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,290
to my third uncle's account.【】

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,310
We registered a new company

22
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,400
under his name recently

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
and opened a company account.

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
You know, my third uncle

25
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,260
can't even read,

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,329
he doesn't know anything—

27
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,450
he just listens to my dad,

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,360
so it's definitely safe.

29
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,110
But it's like giving the money to someone else.

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,450
So, Mr. Xue, do you think this will work?

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,090
This is your family matter;

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,200
how can I interfere?

33
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,350
It's up to you.

34
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,630
Let me remind you,

35
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,910
no matter who you transfer the money to,

36
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,560
you need to leave some money

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,760
in your company's account.

38
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,360
At least let the court

39
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,980
be able to enforce something,

40
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,520
right?

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,579
I think it works.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Then how about this?

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
Let's have Mr. Xue

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,960
represent us in this case.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
You handle it alone, is that okay?

46
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,150
According to the law,

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,970
a lawyer can only represent one person.

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,190
Wait.

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,110
I'll represent Mr. Zhou,

50
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
and you find another lawyer to represent you.

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,920
Let's sign the agreement today.

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,700
Okay.

53
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,290
My agency fee is 300,000 yuan.

54
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,110
You see,

55
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,590
we are really in a tough spot right now.

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,670
We've been hiding and not doing any business,

57
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,900
and honestly, we don't have much money.

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,950
Could you consider

59
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,430
giving us a discount?

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,000
The key is that I still have to design the path for property distribution

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
and risk isolation.

62
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,800
Anyway, if you don't

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,150
pay the money to me,

64
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,650
you might end up losing it all to someone else in the future.

65
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,500
We're really in a tough spot right now, but...

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,770
We won't bargain.

67
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,390
We'd rather give it

68
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,800
to someone else

69
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,380
than to give it to the old lady.

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
Mr. Xue, I'll entrust this

71
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,540
to you.

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,150
Are you relieved now?

73
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
Yes.

74
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. Tian,

75
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,190
I'm telling you, the 300,000 yuan

76
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,400
is worth way more than

77
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,800
the 130,000 yuan we gave to Mr. Han.

78
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,840
Mr. Han

79
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,880
is just a big scammer.

80
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,690
Don't forget that

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,630
it's me who recommended to you

82
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,000
such an excellent lawyer.

83
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,910
Mr. Tian, don't worry.

84
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,310
We know what to do.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,250
As long as the matter is settled,

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,320
we will reward you.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,120
Thank you.

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,750
Don't worry.

89
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,910
How about this?

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,960
You two go first.

91
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,540
I

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,400
have another case to introduce to Mr. Xue.

93
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,390
I was so happy that I forgot.

94
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,120
Okay.

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,600
Come on.

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Go on with your work.

97
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,870
Thank you.

98
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,600
You're welcome.

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,390
Thank you.

100
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,190
Take care.

101
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Mr. Xue.

102
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,800
Why are you back?

103
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,010
Mr. Xue.

104
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,560
I have to thank Mr. Chen for the introduction;

105
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,659
otherwise, I wouldn't have had the chance to meet a senior like you.

106
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,420
You're

107
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
so experienced and skillful.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
I hope you'll guide me more in the future.

109
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,790
I wouldn't dare to guide you;

110
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,290
you already have a mentor.

111
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,159
When it comes to experience and skills,

112
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,680
your mentor is much better than me.

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,159
He's not as good as you.

114
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,880
Well, Mr. Xue,

115
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,790
do we have any specified brokerage

116
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,450
in our firm

117
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,660
regarding cases that come through referrals?

118
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,050
Okay, got it.

119
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,290
I see.

120
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,670
Don't beat around the bush.

121
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,020
As for the referral fee, I'll give you 10%.

122
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Mr. Xue.

123
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,570
You see,

124
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,100
you're a respected senior in the industry,

125
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,920
so don't be too strict with me, a junior.

126
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
Ten percent

127
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,290
is a bit too low.

128
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,520
How about

129
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,120
15%?

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
You're even greedier than your mentor.

131
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,340
Okay, 15% is fine.

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,290
Are you relieved now?

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,390
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

134
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
Goodbye, Mr. Xue.

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,360
The defendant should

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,870
bear corresponding legal responsibility

137
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,680
for escaping during his sentence

138
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,720
and committing additional crimes.

139
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,040
But we would like to particularly remind

140
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,560
the court that

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,040
the defendant's actions

142
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,160
were driven by circumstances.

143
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,560
In light of the questioning of another defendant,

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,510
Ma Lili, it has been established that

145
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,810
Ma Lili took advantage of Xu Jianshe's detention

146
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,200
and his isolation from the outside world,

147
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,650
deceiving him

148
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,400
into believing

149
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,920
he had been subjected to unjust treatment.

150
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,370
This led Xu Jianshe to develop a mindset of escaping as a form of retaliation.

151
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,480
At the same time, Ma Lili also illegally controlled

152
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Xu Jianshe's assets.

153
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,560
It was only after Xu Jianshe realized the truth

154
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,250
that he directed his retaliation toward Ma Lili.

155
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,110
Xu Jianshe should indeed face severe legal punishment

156
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,870
for committing another crime during his sentence,

157
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,430
while the deception

158
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,680
and unlawful possession of his assets

159
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,070
by Ma Lili

160
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,409
were significant contributing factors to the situation.

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,750
After learning the full facts,

162
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,360
Xu Jianshe has sincerely repented,

163
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,480
accepted legal consequences,

164
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,890
and is willing to cover

165
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,120
the medical expenses of the victim, Ma Lili.

166
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,159
Here, on behalf of the defendant,

167
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,560
we extend an apology to the victim,

168
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,520
express remorse to the court,

169
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,480
and hope that the court will take the aforementioned circumstances into account

170
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,240
during sentencing.

171
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
All rise.

172
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,560
In accordance with Articles 234

173
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,870
and 316

174
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,160
of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,

175
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,750
the defendant, Xu Jianshe,

176
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,590
is hereby sentenced to death

177
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,620
with a two-year reprieve.

178
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,890
Xu Jianshe,

179
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,800
we're here to discuss your opinion on filing an appeal.

180
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,360
Do you still want to appeal?

181
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,560
No.

182
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,630
Filing an appeal won't lead to a harsher sentence,

183
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,310
so you can take your time to think it through

184
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
before making a decision.

185
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,710
I know.

186
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
Honestly, I didn't expect to

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
be spared my life

188
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,480
when I went to court this time,

189
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,370
so I won't appeal.

190
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,860
I plead guilty and will work on reforming myself.

191
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,630
Thank you.

192
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,750
Your assets

193
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
are currently being managed by your cousin's family.

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
We've interacted with them a few times

195
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,890
and feel they can be trusted.

196
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,590
However, we'd like to remind you that

197
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,070
even while you're in prison,

198
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,830
you still have the right to manage your assets.

199
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,990
If you need assistance in this regard,

200
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,560
feel free to reach out to us

201
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,240
or another lawyer.

202
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
If needed,

203
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,270
I'll only turn to you.

204
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,909
Thank you for trusting us.

205
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
We'll go back and discuss it,

206
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,669
and next time we'll bring an agreement.

207
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,260
Okay.

208
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,360
We'll have many chances to stay in touch.

209
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,150
Take care.

210
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,400
Thank you.

211
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,120
Xu Jianshe,

212
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,360
who was the one

213
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,270
who dealt the fatal blow to Li Zhanjun

214
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,580
in that case back then?

215
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,240
I need to correct something I said before.

216
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,630
What is it?

217
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,960
I once told you that

218
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,200
I don't like dealing with innocent clients.

219
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
When the client is innocent,

220
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,360
the pressure on the lawyer is much higher.

221
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,960
But I've realized now that

222
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,470
even when the client isn't innocent,

223
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,970
the lawyer won't be easy either.

224
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,720
He's clearly guilty,

225
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,070
and yet you help him get away with it.

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,270
Can you feel at peace with that

227
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,350
after knowing the truth?

228
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,920
You're overthinking it.

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,560
Whether or not he was the one who struck the fatal blow,

230
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,260
this case accusing him of being the main culprit

231
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,760
lacks solid evidence.

232
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,890
Even if we defended him

233
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,040
and won the case at the time,

234
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
as long as it complied with the legal principle

235
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,030
that facts must be clear and evidence must be sufficient,

236
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,320
the prosecution would still strengthen their evidence

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,690
in the later stages of the trial.

238
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,120
Isn't this precisely the point

239
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,520
of the adversarial system in law?

240
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,070
Forget about it.

241
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,870
Anyway, we've helped someone

242
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,550
and made money.

243
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,750
Auntie Song's case has been announced,

244
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,080
but the trial won't be scheduled

245
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,230
for at least 60 days.

246
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,720
If we can manage

247
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,750
Xu Jianshe's assets,

248
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
we'll have a steady income.

249
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,510
Let's find an office as soon as possible.

250
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
These days,

251
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,820
I feel like I'm living in the office;

252
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,250
there's no privacy at all.

253
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,810
Hello, Ms. Luo.

254
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,550
Feng.

255
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,270
These are Ms. Qiu and Ms. Xia.

256
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,120
Hello, Ms. Qiu, Ms. Xia.

257
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,890
This way, please.

258
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,270
Please come in.

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,850
Why are you here again?

260
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,720
Instead of thinking of ways to deliver the summons,

261
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,130
why are you running over here?

262
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,280
What a waste of time.

263
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Manager Feng,

264
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,360
which floor

265
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,550
is the property I want to see on?

266
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,840
On the 17th floor, Ms. Luo.

267
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
Speaking of which, you have really good taste.

268
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,260
A law firm is just downstairs.

269
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,540
What?

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,670
You want to rent the 17th floor?

271
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,780
Director Han, are you talking to me?

272
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,810
Yes, let's go and have a look. It's not decided yet.

273
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,590
What's the deal, Director Han? Are you not happy about it?

274
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,920
No, no complaints at all.

275
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,630
But, when it comes to it,

276
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,320
if I do end up renting the 17th floor,

277
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
you're just below me.

278
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,930
It looks like we're really destined to be neighbors.

279
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,180
Why put yourself through this?

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,920
Just a rehearsal.

281
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,890
Dreams will always come true.

282
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,980
Yes.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,760
Please.

284
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,460
Ms. Luo,

285
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,190
this is the central business district,

286
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,680
surrounded by high-end projects.

287
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,860
The commercial atmosphere is perfect

288
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,490
for a law firm like yours.

289
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,960
The lighting and view are great.

290
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,910
How much is the rent?

291
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,840
Twelve per square meter,

292
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,910
including property fees and invoices.

293
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,790
You can ask around.

294
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
For the best location in the city,

295
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
this is already a bargain.

296
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Let me tell you, this office building

297
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,890
has no municipal heating—

298
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,820
electricity costs will be high.

299
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
And don't forget the parking fees.

300
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,670
After all, it is the central business district.

301
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,910
The price is reasonable.

302
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,630
Yeah, it's not too expensive.

303
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,960
How about this?

304
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,550
We go back and discuss it.

305
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,750
If we don't find

306
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,080
a better place,

307
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,960
we'll choose this one.

308
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,000
Take your time to decide.

309
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,060
Okay, thank you.

310
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,080
How is it?

311
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,550
Ms. Qiu. Ms. Xia.

312
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Good.

313
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,800
But we have no money.

314
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
The door is open. You can go inside.

315
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Let me know when you're done so I can lock up.

316
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,300
Alright, thank you, Uncle Liu.

317
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,120
Thank you.

318
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,150
I heard it used to be a newspaper office.

319
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,150
Anyway, it's got everything

320
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,510
we need for now.

321
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,870
It's enough for us now.

322
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,750
Luo,

323
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
even if we can't afford the central business district,

324
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,490
we don't have to settle for this place, right?

325
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,030
Look at

326
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,270
these windows—they're patched with paper.

327
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,280
What if the building collapses one day?

328
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,340
Xia Shu.

329
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,870
Love stays despite flaws, and home is cherished despite hardship.

330
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,840
As a member of Yinghua Law Firm,

331
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,350
do you think it's appropriate to say something like that?

332
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,410
I'm telling you,

333
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,750
make the most of this experience while you can.

334
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,670
If we make it big one day

335
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,150
and move to the Central Business District,

336
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,240
you won't even get the chance to visit a place like this again.

337
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,320
If that's the case,

338
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,960
why bother showing off

339
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,150
at Liangcheng Law Firm?

340
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,240
If he finds out that

341
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
we ended up renting here,

342
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,620
he'll laugh at us.

343
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,490
Let it be.

344
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,080
It's our dream

345
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,370
to move into Liangcheng Law Firm.

346
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,750
You should always have dreams,

347
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,120
because who knows, maybe one day it'll come true.

348
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,490
There are only two things in the world

349
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,040
that can deeply touch our hearts:

350
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,070
one is the brilliant starry sky above us...

351
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,020
The other is the noble moral law within us—

352
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,900
Kant.

353
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,200
This plaque looks nice.

354
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,550
Let's keep it here.

355
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,670
Hello.

356
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,880
Is that Lawyer Han Zhitong?

357
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,510
This is Chengdong District People's Court.

358
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,870
It's me.

359
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,150
You're representing He Qiaohui and Zhou Damin

360
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,390
in the civil loan dispute

361
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,550
against Song Shumin, right?

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,030
Who?

363
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,290
Why haven't I heard of this case?

364
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,000
Mr. Han,

365
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,660
we already know that you're representing

366
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,560
this case.

367
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,910
The summons will be delivered to your law firm soon.

368
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
Please sign on behalf of He Qiaohui and her husband,

369
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,250
fill out the delivery receipt,

370
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,120
and send it back along with the complete agency documents.

371
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,120
Do you understand?

372
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,750
Judge, may I know your name?

373
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,430
Wait, who told you that I'm representing this case?

374
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,180
Is there some misunderstanding here?

375
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,390
Mr. Han,

376
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,790
I remind you to pay attention to professional ethics

377
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,790
and stop using those small tricks.

378
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,040
The court

379
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,950
is currently considering whether to submit a judicial recommendation

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to the Judicial Bureau regarding your behavior.

381
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,420
Do you understand?

382
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,380
Yes.

383
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,310
Yes, I got it.

384
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,670
A mole!

385
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,890
There must be a mole in our firm.

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,610
My strategy and plan are all ruined.

387
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,360
It took me so much effort.

388
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,220
Ms. Fang.

389
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:40,720
Mr. Chen.

390
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
We must find the mole,

391
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,550
Mr. Han is inside?

392
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,360
or we...

393
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,840
Mr. Han, it's inappropriate for me...

394
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,390
No, no, no.

395
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:48,910
-Mr. Chen.
-I'm leaving.

396
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,150
Mr. Chen, don't go.

397
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,330
Don't go.

398
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,590
You're just in time

399
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,940
to be a witness.

400
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,540
I'm telling you, we've got to be careful.

401
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,020
There's a mole in our firm.

402
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,270
I signed the agency agreement, and before it even left our firm,

403
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,320
the court already knew I'm the representative.

404
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,840
Isn't this obviously a problem

405
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,790
inside our firm?

406
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,360
Really?

407
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
Of course.

408
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,060
Ms. Fang, we can't just ignore this.

409
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,550
If something like this happens again,

410
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,000
how are we supposed to do our jobs?

411
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,750
Exactly.

412
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,580
Ms. Fang, are we going to look into this or not? You decide.

413
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,390
Decide what, Han?

414
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,040
I already warned you before

415
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,600
not to use these tactics.

416
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,730
Did you listen?

417
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,090
My stance is clear.

418
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,720
This ends here.

419
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
Get back to work.

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,150
Does this end here?

421
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,860
What tactics, Mr. Han?

422
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,390
No, it's a secret.

423
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,670
How can I say that?

424
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,270
Dragging out.

425
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,830
You're as heartless as me, Mr. Han.

426
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,960
Dragging out.

427
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,140
Dragging out.

428
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,970
We all know how to take off coats, right?

429
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,950
If we don't root out the mole, we'll never have peace.

430
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,290
Yes, we must root out the mole, Mr. Han.

431
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,290
How can you be so angry?

432
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,270
What's up, Mr. Chen?

433
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,620
The case of Mr. Dong that I was assigned to

434
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,120
is progressing smoothly.

435
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,870
I just reported it to you.

436
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,730
Alright, good work, Mr. Chen.

437
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,970
From now on,

438
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,630
coordinate your cases with Tao Zheng.

439
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,150
No problem.

440
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,760
I'll talk to Mr. Tao directly, okay?

441
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,420

Bye.

500
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
Judge Yu called and said that

501
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,400
someone inside the Liangcheng Law Firm

502
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,820
leaked that

503
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,750
Han is representing He Qiaohui.

504
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,570
She'll bring people to deliver the summons tomorrow morning.

505
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,110
What?

506
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,880
Really?

507
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,350
She also asked if we wanted to go with her.

508
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,880
Of course.

509
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,270
Let's go to the hospital and find Auntie Song now.

510
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,530

Hello.

515
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,990
Well, where's the patient in bed number six?

516
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Grandpa left.

517
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,330
Where did he go?

518
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,120
Grandpa will be back soon.

519
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,660
He passed away last night.

520
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,260
Where is his wife?

521
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,160
She's handling the paperwork.

522
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,410
She hasn't come back yet.

523
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,850
Let me call Auntie Song.

524
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,620
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

525
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,790
Qiu Hua.

526
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,350
Look.

527
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,750
Is that Auntie Song?

528
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,350
It seems like her.

529
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,290
Auntie Song.

530
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,750
Auntie Song, my condolences.

531
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,850
I made this hat

532
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,290
for Jiasheng.

533
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,200
Later,

534
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,340
his white hair stuck to it,

535
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,750
so I

536
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,110
had to pick it out, one strand at a time.

537
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,240
When they were about to take him to the morgue,

538
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,270
I wanted to put it on him

539
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,140
to keep him warm,

540
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,880
but I never got the chance.

541
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,570
Auntie Song,

542
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,110
it's too cold outside.

543
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,830
Let us take you home.

544
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,230
Thank you

545
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,110
for all your hard work

546
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,910
during these days.

547
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,550
I caused you so much trouble.

548
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,710
I don't want to

549
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,220
continue with this lawsuit anymore.

550
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,090
I'm afraid I can never repay the kindness

551
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,340
you've shown me.

552
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,010
Auntie Song, don't need to say that.

553
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,680
We came to

554
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,510
tell you something.

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,070
The court

556
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,110
will deliver the summons to He Qiaohui's lawyer tomorrow.

557
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,650
We have hope about this case.

558
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,310
Once it goes to court,

559
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,340
you should be able to recover most of your money.

560
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,490
But I

561
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,240
just don't have the strength anymore.

562
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,690
I don't want to continue with this case.

563
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,960
Auntie Song, what do you want?

564
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,710
Don't do anything stupid.

565
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,510
Auntie Song,

566
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,480
we've worked so hard

567
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,880
for you these past few days.

568
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,350
Can't you see that?

569
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,200
Why focus on those

570
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,750
worthless people?

571
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,350
There are still good people in this world.

572
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,110
You need to have faith in it.

573
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,640
But I can't go on living like this,

574
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,480
not even for a day.

575
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,880
Auntie Song,

576
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,270
don't blame me for being harsh.

577
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,110
If you really give up and leave,

578
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,350
you'll be just like

579
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,350
He Qiaohui.

580
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,460
If you leave,

581
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,100
there will be no plaintiff in this case,

582
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,000
and it will get dismissed.

583
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,000
All our

584
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,400
hard work will be in vain,

585
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
and we won't get a single cent back.

586
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,240
People will say that

587
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,000
our abilities as lawyers are lacking.

588
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,580
You, as the plaintiff,

589
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,110
aren't paying attention to this,

590
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,640
and we're just standing by, helpless.

591
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,070
And you're not even willing to accept

592
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,090
the favor we've done for you.

593
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,110
I'm sorry.

594
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm really sorry.

595
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,460
I'm sorry.

596
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,020
Auntie Song,

597
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,550
I truly understand you.

598
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,190
I know the pain of losing a loved one.

599
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,960
But no matter how hard life is,

600
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,670
we have to grit our teeth and carry on.

601
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,550
Those who do evil,

602
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,350
and hurt others,

603
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,790
don't feel a shred of remorse

604
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,510
and they are still living well.

605
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,450
So you should live your life to the fullest.

606
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,490
Even if

607
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,030
we're left with just a breath after being hurt by bad people,

608
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,400
we have to hold on

609
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,200
until the day

610
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,720
we see them get what they truly deserve.

611
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,550
Got it?

612
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,100
How is the new office?

613
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,740
Do you need to renovate it?

614
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,270
The cousin of my friend's colleague

615
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,750
is in the renovation business.

616
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,920
We've spent all our money on rent.

617
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,490
There's no budget for renovations.

618
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,850
We'll just leave it as it is for now.

619
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,960
What are you looking at so intently?

620
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,270
I'm just calculating

621
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,160
how much we can earn in a year.

622
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,200
How much do you make a month?

623
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,480
I know what you mean.

624
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,790
What do you know?

625
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,480
I know.

626
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,820
Wait, I'm asking you how much you earn a month?

627
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,880
I put my entire monthly salary,

628
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,210
except for living expenses, into this card.

629
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,460
The password is your birthday.

630
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,360
It's officially handed over to you.

631
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,190
That's not what I meant.

632
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,110
I get it;

633
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,110
I offered it to you.

634
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,330
It's natural for a wife to manage the money.

635
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,510
Take it.

636
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,270
What do you want?

637
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,240
Do you need me to kneel down to you?

638
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,750
No, no, no.

639
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,680
Honey, please accept it.

640
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,070
Get up.

641
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,060
Then I'll keep it for you.

642
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,880
Do you know

643
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,910
what I'm going to do

644
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,390
with the money?

645
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,610
It's for the future education fund.

646
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,590
I save it for our child.

647
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,350
Fine.

648
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,030
From now on, every time I earn money,

649
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,740
I'll also transfer some money into this card.

650
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,380
When are we going to have a baby?

651
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,880
My mom called me today and urged me.

652
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,330
She said she's about to retire

653
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,480
and wants to help take care of the baby

654
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
while she's still in good health.

655
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,960
One or two are fine.

656
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,510
Two?

657
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,440
You're making it sound simple.

658
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,270
Who will take care of the baby?

659
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,120
Do I still have to work?

660
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,680
Let's save some money first.

661
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,920
How much can a child spend?

662
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,670
I'm saving it now.

663
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,310
Keep the summons.

664
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,990
Director Han.

665
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,590
See you in court.

666
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,990
Mr. Han,

667
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,110
you're an experienced veteran lawyer.

668
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,880
Yingzi,

669
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,160
who do you think

670
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,680
has been helping us behind the scenes?

671
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,350
Also, Mr. Tian,

672
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,550
as a co-counsel,

673
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,110
you are also jointly responsible.

674
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,550
Please both be present in court on time.

675
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,750
According to your wishes,

676
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,160
I've drafted this document.

677
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,920
Please take a look

678
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,110
and see if this division is okay.

679
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,120
All the company shares will go to the female party,

680
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,620
except for the one house

681
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,450
that has been frozen by the plaintiff, which will remain with the female party.

682
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
The remaining two properties will be given to the male party.

683
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,400
Well.

684
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I understand.

685
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,970
Given the company's financial status,

686
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,080
this agreement is relatively fair.

687
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,860
In fact, you might even be getting a bit of an advantage

688
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,690
since the company is making money, right?

689
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,280
Fine.

690
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,160
Also, aside from the payment

691
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,650
made to your uncle's company,

692
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,520
there's less than 2,000,000 left in the account.

693
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,270
Do you think we should use this as working capital, or...

694
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,620
Transfer it to Damin.

695
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,920
If I keep it in my account,

696
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,110
all the money in the company's account

697
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,000
might end up being given to her

698
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,660
once the lawsuit is lost.

699
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,530
Yes, if we leave it in the company's account,

700
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,930
it's essentially giving it to the old lady, right?

701
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,310
I'll revise it.

702
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,920
But I want to remind both of you—

703
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,040
I think you should keep some money

704
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,070
in the company's account.

705
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,790
After all, it is not good

706
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,350
that the plaintiff can't get a single penny from the public account.

707
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,030
Yes, I understand.

708
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,480
Okay.

709
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
If there are no other issues,

710
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,160
once I revise the agreement,

711
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
you sign it

712
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,220
and go to the Civil Affairs Bureau for the divorce.

713
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,770
Okay.

714
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,140
[Divorce Registration Area, Jingbei Civil Affairs Bureau]

715
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,030
Sign here.

716
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,630
Okay.

717
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,510
Sign it.

718
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,340
Sign it.

719
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,070
Here.

720
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,440
Be serious, this is a divorce.

721
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,620
Are you two really getting divorced?

722
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,270
Has the relationship broken down?

723
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,310
Let me tell you, Sis,

724
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,740
divorce today is different from before.

725
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,930
The times have changed.

726
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,130
Here, this is yours.

727
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,240
Keep it.

728
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,850
Here is the household register.

729
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,440
Thank you.

730
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,880
Okay.

731
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,160
Let's go.

732
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,750
Thank you.

733
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,750
Take care.

734
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,400
Okay, thank you.

735
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,200
Take the documents.

736
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
I really don't understand today's young people.

737
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,740
Gosh.

738
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,750
Let me see

739
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,090
what that old lady can do this time,

740
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,750
right?

741
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,160
No lawyer can help her.

742
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,000
Wait.

743
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,350
Let me hold this for you.

744
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,290
[Mr. Han]

745
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,200
Look, it's Han again,

746
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,480
calling me every day these past few days.

747
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,440
He scammed us out of tens of thousands,

748
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,350
and hasn't done anything for us.

749
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,530
Wait, you take this call first.

750
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,550
Let me take a call.

751
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
[Mr. Xue]

752
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,350
Hello, Mr. Han.

753
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,060
Ms. He, you'd better come to me quickly.

754
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,950
The court has sent the summons to me.

755
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:22,850
No.

756
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm not going.

757
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,390
Just tell them you can't find us.

758
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,590
Let me tell you,

759
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,590
the lawyer is responsible for receiving legal documents on your behalf.

760
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,340
If I received it, it means you received it.

761
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,900
Mr. Han,

762
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,470
didn't you teach us how to hide?

763
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,080
Why aren't you hiding yourself?

764
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,550
The court called me directly.

765
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,240
What can I do?

766
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,310
I can only accept it.

767
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,230
Let me tell you,

768
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,830
it's useless to say this now.

769
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,970
Come to me now.

770
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,930
Don't you want to know how we're going to handle the case next?

771
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,460
Okay, I'll be right there.

772
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,980
Hui.

773
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,230
Let's go. Han asked us to go.

774
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,890
I'm not going.

775
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm annoyed when I see him.

776
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Go by yourself.

777
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm going to ask Ma for money.

778
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,300
Okay.

779
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,390
Okay, you drive there.

780
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,350
Take care.

781
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,350
Okay, you take care too.

782
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,440
Okay, you take care too.

783
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,020
Okay.

784
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,210
Ms. He.

785
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,310
Mr. Han.

786
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,920
You've handed me this case,

787
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,480
but haven't shown up for days.

788
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,160
You're really quite bold, aren't you?

789
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,000
No, Mr. Han.

790
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,070
Didn't you teach us

791
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,790
to hide as much as possible?

792
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,920
Besides,

793
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,070
with you,

794
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,670
there's nothing to worry about.

795
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,850
I never gave you any guarantees.

796
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,030
When we first met,

797
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,160
I made it very clear—

798
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,410
this case is straightforward,

799
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,310
and they have the IOU you wrote.

800
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,350
If this goes to court,

801
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,740
there's no way we'll win.

802
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
That's right.

803
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,750
You did say that for the first time.

804
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,690
So, Mr. Han, I just want to ask,

805
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,210
what did we spend over 100,000

806
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,280
on?

807
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,050
How can you say that? What's for?

808
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,680
Of course, you're hiring me for the lawsuit.

809
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,860
You'll lose if you hire someone else.

810
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,750
If you invite me,

811
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,970
I have a way to handle it,

812
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,640
right?

813
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,600
Since we're already on this topic,

814
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,160
have you given any thought to the matter

815
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
I raised last time

816
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,880
about increasing the agency fee?

817
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,590
Mr. Han,

818
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,960
we're still in the middle of the case,

819
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,690
and now you're talking about increasing the agency fee?

820
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,970
If you raise the agency fee,

821
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,470
I'll tell you how to protect your assets.

822
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,640
Alright then,

823
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,640
tell me

824
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,200
how to protect my assets first,

825
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,420
and I'll consider raising the agency fee.

826
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,150
But if I tell you and you don't raise the fee,

827
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,000
what should I do?

828
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,030
If I raise the fee

829
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,240
and you end up treating me like you're doing now,

830
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,890
then what?

831
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,910
I'm a lawyer.

832
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,100
You should trust me.

833
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,210
I trusted you.

834
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,120
I signed the agreement because I trusted you.

835
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
But now,

836
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,600
you're forcing me to raise the agency fee, right?

837
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,700
If you think that way,

838
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,320
I won't say anything.

839
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,690
Let's just wait for the trial and lose the case.

840
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,200
Mr. Han.

841
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,510
I spent over 100,000 hiring you.

842
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,760
If you talk to me like this,

843
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
maybe we should find another place

844
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,730
to talk properly.

845
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,770
I'm just kidding.

846
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,210
Don't be so nervous.

847
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,920
Mr. Han.

848
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,060
Just think of a way to protect my assets.

849
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,590
As for the increase in the agency fee,

850
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,400
that's easy to discuss.

851
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,320
Okay.

852
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,510
Let me tell you first.

853
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,750
Well,

854
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,550
there might be a way

855
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,550
to succeed

856
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,890
in your situation,

857
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,720
which is by dividing your assets through divorce.

858
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,530
Although you two are still living under the same roof,

859
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,580
legally speaking,

860
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,680
you no longer have

861
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,050
any marital relationship.

862
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,350
You are now wealthy,

863
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,620
but you need to prepare yourself.

864
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,030
We may lose this lawsuit.

865
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,250
The judge is no fool.

866
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,480
If the court finds out that

867
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,750
you tried to transfer assets or evade debts

868
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,590
through divorce,

869
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
you need to be prepared.

870
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,690
They will investigate thoroughly,

871
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,429
and in the end, there's a possibility that

872
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,590
they will forcefully seize your assets.

873
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
That's it?

874
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,489
Yes.

875
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,800
You're asking me for money again for the trick?

876
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Mr. Han,

877
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,460
I'm sorry.

878
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,080
My husband and I are divorced.

879
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,980
Divorced? When did this happen?

880
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Just now.

881
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,719
The divorce certificate is still in my bag.

882
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,810
We just came out of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

883
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,920
Wait, you got divorced?

884
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,360
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

885
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,550
Discuss it with you?

886
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,840
Why would I need to?

887
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,030
If you tell me to do this, you may ask me for money.

888
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,800
Who said it was a fake divorce?

889
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,590
Why would I

890
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,760
stay with her and suffer?

891
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,270
I've had enough

892
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,240
with her, a bugger face.

893
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,500
I don't want to go back that home.

894
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Mr. Xue, thank you so much.

895
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,190
I've really

896
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,250
gotten a divorce.

897
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,490
Here comes the elevator.

898
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,150
Here.

899
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,970
Tian, thank you.

900
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,760
You're welcome.

901
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,830
-Go back.
-See you, Ms. He.

902
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,940
Bye.

903
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,640
Master, she left.

904
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
What's wrong with you, Mr. Han?

905
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,340
Mr. Chen.

906
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,510
Did you make your mentor angry?

907
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,230
No.

908
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,990
A client came earlier.

909
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,960
Come on, Mr. Han.

910
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,440
After all these years of being a lawyer,

911
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,960
what kind of clients haven't you seen?

912
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,110
No need to get angry.

913
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,800
Chen Shuo,

914
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,950
I have to learn from you from now on.

915
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,820
What do you learn from me?

916
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,330
Some people in this world

917
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,780
aren't worth helping at all.

918
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,150
She deserves to lose the lawsuit.

919
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,010
That's right.

920
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,060
But I should learn from you on this point.

921
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,000
Mr. Han, haven't you always been like this?

922
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,930
No, I learned this from you.

923
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,890
No, I have to learn from you.

924
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,680
I'll learn from you.

925
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,550
Let's learn from each other.

926
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,280
I'll focus on learning from you, and you can just learn a little from me.

927
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,740
Fine.

928
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,470
Anyway, you've got the agency fee;

929
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,130
let her lose the case.

930
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,030
That's right.

931
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,900
Since you've already got the money,

932
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,850
why get angry, right?

933
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,540
Exactly.

934
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
What are you standing here for?

935
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,020
Go and cheer up your mentor.

936
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,440
It's okay.

937
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,230
It's okay.

938
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,080
Don't be angry, Mr. Han.

939
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,510
No one can help you if you get sick.

940
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,080
Exactly.

941
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,130
[Jingbei City, Chengdong District People's Court, Courtroom No. 6]

942
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,550
Hello.

943
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,070
Here is my attorney representation file

944
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,470
and the evidence catalog.

945
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,330
Ms. Qiu.

946
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,840
Mr. Han.

947
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,230
Okay.

948
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,120
All the evidence is ready.

949
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,530
I've also prepared it for the judge.

950
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,750
Mr. Han.

951
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,490
Tian.

952
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,890
Ms. He.

953
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,260
There aren't many people here.

954
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,280
You're here.

955
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,090
Are you here to watch how your brother gets embarrassed?

956
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,970
Who is my brother?

957
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
You two are practically twins,

958
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,560
both as bad as each other.

959
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,790
Keep your voice down. Be disciplined.

960
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,730
Okay. Be disciplined.

961
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,240
Yes, I'm here today to learn from my brother,

962
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,570
my senior, on how to handle a court case.

963
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,870
Luo Yingzi, have you ever thought about it?

964
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,710
Even if you win this case

965
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,600
in the end,

966
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,510
all you'll get is an IOU.

967
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,070
What do you mean?

968
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,030
As far as I know,

969
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,150
He Qiaohui and Zhou Damin

970
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,700
have divorced.

971
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,770
Besides,

972
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,670
Zhou Damin has transferred

973
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,130
all the assets away.

974
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,480
How did you know?

975
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,960
What a coincidence.

976
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Xue

977
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,570
is Zhou Damin's lawyer.

978
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,300
It's not just a coincidence.

979
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,900
I know you had something to do with this.

980
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,700
Do you realize that

981
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,150
you might end up causing two deaths?

982
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,150
Stop saying "you" all the time.

983
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,360
What does it have to do with me?

984
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Who cause two deaths?

985
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,120
I'm just trying to give you a friendly reminder,

986
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,430
but it seems like...

987
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,340
Never mind, I can't explain it to you.

988
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,250
If you think it's me, then it's me, okay?

989
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,720
And by the way,

990
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,670
it's your responsibility

991
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,000
to take care of your clients' interests.

992
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,030
This is your duty.

993
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,150
Don't just push everything onto others

994
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,670
when things go wrong.

995
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,570
Don't worry.

996
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,000
My client will definitely stay alive

997
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,240
until the day she gets her property,

998
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,960
while your client...

999
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,320
It's not mine, but Xue's.

1000
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,940
It's almost.

1001
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,000
Xue's client will definitely have everything seized.

1002
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,990
Okay.

1003
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,070
Stand up.

1004
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,880
Sit down.

1005
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,110
Don't stay here.

1006
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,740
Go over there.

1007
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,460
The trial begins now.

1008
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,320
Defendant,

1009
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,320
do you have any objections

1010
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,530
to the evidence provided by the plaintiff?

1011
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,760
No.

1012
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,840
Yes!

1013
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,380
What is it?

1014
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,500
We do not acknowledge the authenticity of the loan agreement.

1015
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,960
The plaintiff and the defendant have a close

1016
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,470
foster mother-daughter relationship,

1017
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,030
and there have been financial transactions between them,

1018
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,190
but no lending agreement was made.

1019
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,150
And the signatures on the promissory note

1020
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,560
don't seem to match the defendant's,

1021
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,280
so we request

1022
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,550
an authentication of the signatures on the promissory note.

1023
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,980
You suspect these IOUs are forged?

1024
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,550
No.

1025
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,470
I just express doubts about their authenticity.

1026
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,010
Representative, don't speak first.

1027
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,880
-Defendant He Xiaohui,
-Shameless!

1028
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:53,870
tell me

1029
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,780
are these IOUs genuine?

1030
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,940
Yes.

1031
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,440
But Judge,

1032
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,400
I've spent all the money.

1033
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,080
I have no money to pay back.

1034
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,440
But according to the evidence provided by the plaintiff,

1035
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
you have a company under your name

1036
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,020
that's involved in financial services.

1037
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,480
The plaintiff's representative claimed that

1038
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,630
the company's revenue last year was nearly 10 million.

1039
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,000
How did you spend all that money?

1040
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,920
Cries of poverty.

1041
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,960
Judge, you might not know,

1042
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,400
the business was doing alright last year.

1043
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,510
This year, though, it's been really tough.

1044
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,150
All the money I earned last year has been lost,

1045
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,480
and now I'm drowning in debt.

1046
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,400
Mom.

1047
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,030
Don't speak directly to the defendant;

1048
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,440
-speak to the court.
-Mom.

1049
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,630
Judge,

1050
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,670
it's not that I don't want to pay back the money,

1051
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,760
it's just that I don't have money to repay with.

1052
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,630
How about I sell my company

1053
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,390
and the house I live in,

1054
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,340
and

1055
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,110
pay back one-third?

1056
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,190
Would that be acceptable?

1057
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,950
You borrowed over 3 million,

1058
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,000
but you only want to pay back one-third?

1059
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,550
Judge, you might not know

1060
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,820
the relationship between my mom and me.

1061
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,660
You might not know the relationship

1062
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,490
between Ms. Song and me.

1063
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,920
I grew up without a mother,

1064
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,670
and I consider Ms. Song my own mother,

1065
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,210
even closer than my biological one.

1066
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,630
My mom also has no children,

1067
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,590
and she treated me as her own.

1068
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,960
I'm even planning to support her in her old age.

1069
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,090
She's been really good to me,

1070
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,300
and without this bond,

1071
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,500
without this kind of relationship,

1072
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,750
how could

1073
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,520
she have possibly lent me so much money?

1074
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,030
Mom,

1075
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,880
I didn't expect us to end up like this.

1076
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,760
We even have to resort to court. I feel...

1077
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,980
Mom,

1078
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,200
if you force me to pay it all back,

1079
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,120
that's like taking my life.

1080
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,710
How about...

1081
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,080
Mom,

1082
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,590
how about I pay back one-third?

1083
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,150
Would that be okay, Mom?

1084
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,190
The defendant fabricated various reasons to gain the plaintiff's trust

1085
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,760
and borrowed money from them,

1086
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,110
draining the plaintiff's entire savings.

1087
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,800
The principal loaned

1088
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,680
was not just the 3.2 million claimed

1089
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,900
but actually 5.37 million.

1090
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,820
At the time of the lawsuit, the plaintiff's husband had been diagnosed with cancer

1091
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,290
and urgently needed surgery funds.

1092
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,790
Due to the temporary inability to gather all the evidence,

1093
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,690
the plaintiff is filing the lawsuit based on the claimed amount only.

1094
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,270
For the remaining unclaimed amount,

1095
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,870
the plaintiff reserves the right to file a new lawsuit.

1096
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,560
The defendant's actions are no longer mere borrowing

1097
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,200
but a manipulation of the plaintiff's kindness

1098
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,490
to deceive their trust and seize wealth through trickery.

1099
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,480
We insist on the full claimed amount

1100
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,940
and do not agree to reduce the principal, interest,

1101
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,220
or allow for installment repayments.
