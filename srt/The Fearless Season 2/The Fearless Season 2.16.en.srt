00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,660
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,039
Xia Shu hasn't called us again

4
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,800
after that call this morning, right?

5
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,070
No, she has entered the city.

6
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,330
I think she should be fine now.

7
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,320
Xia Shu, where are you?

8
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,180
Hello, Luo. I...

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,960
Ms. Luo.

10
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,950
Ms. Luo? Why are you being so serious?

11
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,560
Xia Shu, are you okay?

12
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,740
Well, I've found clues

13
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,210
about that batch of goods.

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,710
I hired a taxi to chase him.

15
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,200
The driver of this taxi is a man older than me.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,400
The license plate number is Guan UA825J.

17
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,780
We are driving

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
on a mountain road right now.

19
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,710
There are woods on both sides.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,590
I knew it.

21
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,150
Give your phone to the driver.

22
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,710
I'll talk to him.

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,030
Well... My lawyer wants to talk to you.

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,680
What are you doing? What did I do to you?

25
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,190
What lawyer? I'm not answering.

26
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,360
Ms. Luo, he's not answering.

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,880
Turn on the speaker.

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,870
I'll talk to him.

29
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,920
The speaker is on.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,170
Hello, Sir.

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,830
Thank you for helping our client.

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
Miss Xia's father

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,870
is a local provincial leader.

34
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,570
I was supposed to make arrangements for her and her ride,

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,970
but she wouldn't listen and went there by herself.

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,150
Luckily, she met you.

37
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,150
Could you please

38
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,080
safely take her to the place she wants to go?

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,630
This way, I can arrange for the local police

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,590
and staff to pick her up.

41
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,440
Thank you.

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,290
Xia Shu.

43
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,400
Take a photo of the driver's operation certificate

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
and send it to me.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,190
This way, we can thank him later, alright?

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, I got it. I'll send it to you later.

47
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,280
I've turned the speaker off.

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,030
Hey, Xia Shu.

49
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,750
Can you please take your personal safety

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
seriously?

51
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,150
When you get to the next town,

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,960
get off immediately

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
and find a safe hotel to stay.

54
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,160
Listen to my arrangements.

55
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm worried that batch of goods will be lost.

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,800
Human lives are more important than goods. Be good.

57
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,510
Okay, I got it.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,710
What's wrong? Is Xia Shu in danger?

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,290
She's in great danger.

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,020
I need to find someone to help her.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,430
Why don't you go to that place first?

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,930
Let's keep in touch, okay?

63
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,400
Okay, call me if you need anything.

64
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,950
Okay.

65
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,730
Girl.

66
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,120
Were you trying to threaten me with that phone call?

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,360
That's not what I meant.

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,040
She just called

69
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,290
to confirm my location.

70
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, I should thank you.

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,100
For what?

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,750
Do you think I'm stupid?

73
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,269
When will we hit the road?

74
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,810
We can't. It's too cold.

75
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,950
The engine needs a rest.

76
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,380
I need a rest too.

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,690
Are you cold in the back?

78
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,430
Come sit in the front if you're cold. There's hot air from the A/C.

79
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm not cold.

80
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,240
You're so stubborn, Girl.

81
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,800
Alright. I feel quite hot.

82
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll come accompany you in the back.

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,630
Look, the hot air has come through.

84
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,840
I'll take a rest.

85
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,900
There's hot air now, right?

86
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,820
Officer, what's the matter?

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Why are you parked here?

88
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,260
I just took a piss. I'm leaving now.

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,480
Miss, where are you going?

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,330
I'm in a hurry to go to Inner Mongolia.

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,480
But the navigation kept saying we were off-course,

92
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,610
so we stopped here.

93
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,950
If you were heading to Inner Mongolia,

94
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,360
why didn't you take the main road?

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,740
I mistakenly took the wrong way.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,870
Are you okay?

97
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,040
I am.

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,830
Are you sure?

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,630
Show me your ID card and driver's license.

100
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,140
Write it down.

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,159
I've recorded your information.

102
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,830
Drive to the main road immediately.

103
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,030
Thank you, Officer.

104
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,230
Thank you.

105
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,260
Go.

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,830
Girl, what kind of person do you take me as?

107
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,100
I was just joking with you.

108
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,680
Sir, don't waste any more time.

109
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,560
Just hurry up and drive.

110
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,200
They scared me.

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,190
Come in.

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,840
Mr. Zhou.

113
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,750
Yingzi.

114
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,360
What was that you wanted to tell me on the phone?

115
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,430
It sounded urgent.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,910
What happened to your arm?

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
Some young men have no martial arts morality.

118
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,950
I got in a fight with them when having barbecue.

119
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,870
No... No big deal.

120
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,870
Are you okay?

121
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,630
Yes.

122
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,180
Who was that again? Xia Shu, right?

123
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,620
The one in your firm whose family is very wealthy.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,430
Not anymore.

125
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,960
She's been working with me.

126
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,340
Xia Shu

127
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,100
hired a taxi

128
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,790
to Guanbei alone

129
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,130
to help our client collect debts.

130
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,040
How impressive is that?

131
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,270
The taxi

132
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,940
is heading to Inner Mongolia now,

133
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,240
and the driver is a bit handsy with her.

134
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,409
So I'm a little worried.

135
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,370
I can't let her be there alone.

136
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,040
So I thought I'd ask you

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,480
if you have any reliable friends

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,870
in Guanbei?

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,600
I've got a lot of reliable friends there.

140
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,990
I come from Guanbei.

141
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,409
That's great.

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,510
She sent me this location

143
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,830
an hour ago. Look.

144
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,790
This place is called Yuanlin Town.

145
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,740
She's heading there in this direction.

146
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,270
I told her to get off and wait

147
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,360
when she got to the next town.

148
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,680
The next town is called Song Village.

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
This is quite troublesome.

150
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,790
Both places are quite remote.

151
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,090
Why is she so bold?

152
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,760
Exactly.

153
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,620
She's even risking her life for her job.

154
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,510
Mr. Zhou.

155
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,500
You have friends there, right?

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,480
Can you ask some of them to go and protect

157
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,580
our lawyer, Xia Shu?

158
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,610
Regarding this matter,

159
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,150
I have to go there in person.

160
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,200
People from Guanbei have this thing that they are quite proud.

161
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,800
If I send some subordinates there

162
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,580
to collect debts,

163
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,850
of course they won't succeed.

164
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,310
I have to go there in person and treat them to dinner,

165
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,520
and then it'll be settled.

166
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,770
Send me the address.

167
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,090
Mr. Zhou.

168
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,280
Thank you.

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,050
Well, has Lanlan contacted you

170
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,990
after she left?

171
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,390
Why would she contact me?

172
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,240
She took a million from me

173
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,530
and ran away with some rich guy.

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,740
She's long forgotten about me.

175
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,840
Boss. Boss.

176
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:05,940
Boss.

177
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,180
Yingzi.

178
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,830
Mr. Zhou.

179
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,520
Have a safe trip.

180
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,720
Wait for my news.

181
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,160
Right, if Xia Shu

182
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,270
says anything wrong

183
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,130
or does anything wrong,

184
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,750
just treat her

185
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,340
as a child.

186
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,550
I know what to do. Don't worry.

187
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,360
Go back. Don't worry.

188
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,650
-Be careful.
-I'll sit over there.

189
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,390
Hello, Xia Shu, are you okay?

190
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,789
Just stay right there.

191
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,480
I've told Mr. Zhou about this.

192
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,390
He's on his way to meet you now. He'll be there tomorrow.

193
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,390
I'll share his WeChat account with you later.

194
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,909
Send him the address.

195
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,590
Let's keep in touch. Bye.

196
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,230
How did it go?

197
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
What about Xia Shu?

198
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,010
It's okay now.

199
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,910
Let's hurry there.

200
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,570
Okay.

201
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,720
Mr. Xu.

202
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,350
Fangyuan Law Firm's attitude is very arrogant.

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,370
We turned them down once before,

204
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,030
but now you need something from them.

205
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,270
They probably have known about the report letter too.

206
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,280
They must think they can control us at will.

207
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,500
If we can cooperate with Fangyuan Law Firm,

208
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,160
we can let Mr. Jiang bear the brunt.

209
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,830
This way, the report letter won't be used against us.

210
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,510
Will Fangyuan Law Firm listen to us like that?

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,670
This is not the time to be aloof.

212
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
We need to be flexible at critical moments.

213
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,140
It's okay. Let's talk with them first.

214
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,370
Mr. Xu, are you going out?

215
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,460
Ms. Luo, pardon me.

216
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
I have an emergency meeting.

217
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,160
Why don't we talk next time?

218
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,210
We'll just take a few minutes of your time.

219
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,270
Ms. Luo. About the cooperation,

220
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,620
I'd like to put it on hold for a while.

221
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,040
Yingzi.

222
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,930
Don't push it.

223
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,970
Mr. Xu.

224
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,210
We heard that the court has brought forward

225
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,150
the date for the election competition.

226
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,650
If we delay the signing of the contract

227
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,380
and the systematic work any longer,

228
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,860
we might not make it in time.

229
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,600
Ms. Luo, how about we talk over the phone?

230
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,460
Mr. Xu, your plan may not be able to win.

231
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,890
Hey, Luo Yingzi, you...

232
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,840
What do you mean?

233
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,800
According to our inference,

234
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,920
your thinking is somewhat biased.

235
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,150
We should take the path of reorganization

236
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,190
instead of liquidation.

237
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,430
Besides, we suspect that

238
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,510
Wanhe has hidden

239
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,260
high-quality assets which haven't been completely stripped.

240
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,700
We should try to impress the court

241
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,660
from the perspective of protecting the creditors' interests,

242
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,000
especially the interests of

243
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,430
those small creditors.

244
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,180
Luo Yingzi, Mr. Xu is on his way out.

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,840
Can't we talk to him some other time?

246
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,460
Let's talk now. Let's go upstairs.

247
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,010
Okay.

248
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,120
Let's go.

249
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,120
Let's go. Come on.

250
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,950
[Zhuoyue Law Firm]

251
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,550
We found that after Wanhe's capital chain ruptured,

252
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,200
they actually started to sell products aggressively

253
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,090
and received tens of millions of dollars in advance payments.

254
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,210
Since Wanhe dared to amass wealth like crazy,

255
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,130
they must have left a way out for themselves.

256
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,850
Therefore, we investigated the enterprises that have done

257
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,240
large payment transactions and non-core business dealings with Wanhe

258
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,210
over the past five years,

259
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,650
and found that Wanhe once transferred a parcel of land to Xinyuan Group

260
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
at a low price.

261
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,160
Not only has this parcel of land been idle until now,

262
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,710
but the owner of it also

263
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,810
has a secret relationship with Wanhe.

264
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,150
We infer that

265
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,760
Wanhe was just pretending

266
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,200
to sell this parcel of land,

267
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,990
while in fact, it's still Wanhe's secret asset.

268
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,520
So according to this logic,

269
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,440
this parcel of land is not the only secret asset

270
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,930
of Wanhe.

271
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,280
There should be more.

272
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,110
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

273
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,280
And you.

274
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,420
This is my partner, Qiu Hua, Ms. Qiu.

275
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,210
Ms. Qiu, you are both great.

276
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,560
Alright then. Please wait a moment.

277
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,840
We'll have a discussion.

278
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,850
Okay, no problem.

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,790
My throat is hoarse from all the talking.

280
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,910
I'll go get a glass of water.

281
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,790
Let's wait and see.

282
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,570
We'll show them our strength.

283
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,750
Yingzi.

284
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,420
Why should we carry their water?

285
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,600
What are you talking about?

286
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,880
As long as we take the information we've got

287
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,460
to see the biggest creditor of Wanhe, Dingxin,

288
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,220
Dingxin will entrust us,

289
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,280
and we'll be able to get a large agency fee.

290
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,840
Why should we offer this information to them now?

291
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,780
Because I want to win Wanhe over.

292
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,560
Think about it. If we can win Wanhe over,

293
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,780
not only can our law firm be revitalized,

294
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,830
but we can also take the chance to defeat Liangcheng Law Firm.

295
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,560
Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

296
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,830
Can't you see

297
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,260
he wants to replace us?

298
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,380
That can't be.

299
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,920
It was him who said he wanted to work with us last time.

300
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,420
Wouldn't that be slapping his own face

301
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,890
if he goes back on his word?

302
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,660
We agreed to discuss the contract today,

303
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,980
and they were about to leave just like that.

304
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,790
We haven't agreed to sign the contract yet,

305
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,730
and they changed their mind.

306
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,980
Do you think this is cooperation?

307
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,740
We can barely say they're using us, okay?

308
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,690
I just feel that

309
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,260
we finally get a chance to compete with Liangcheng Law Firm fair and square

310
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,910
and kick them out of the picture.

311
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,910
Besides, it's such a big case.

312
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
I don't want to give it up.

313
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,410
Now the trump card has been played.

314
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,960
Perhaps Xu Zhuo will kick us out.

315
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,420
He may give up competing for administrator

316
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,970
and go directly to Dingxin to sign a contract with them.

317
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,820
I don't think so.

318
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I think Mr. Xu

319
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,310
will see our value.

320
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,890
Besides,

321
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,150
Madam Mei also said Mr. Xu is a nice person.

322
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
What's the advantage of him competing for administrator?

323
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,620
But if he becomes Dingxin's representative,

324
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,150
I'm sure he'll get a large agency fee.

325
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,330
Besides, he's got the core resources.

326
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,000
That's the biggest advantage.

327
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,720
Those agency fees

328
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
should have been ours in the first place.

329
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,720
We do have the capability,

330
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,070
but we have to be realistic.

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,970
Our law firm has just been established.

332
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,920
We don't even have the qualification to compete for administrator.

333
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,830
We need a law firm like Mr. Xu's

334
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,790
which is willing to let us get involved

335
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,360
to make money.

336
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,260
If you keep telling them everything you know,

337
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,620
we'll never make money.

338
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Making money is not the most important thing right now.

339
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,390
The most important thing

340
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,930
is to get a good endorsement for our law firm.

341
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,880
I always take making money

342
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,430
as my priority.

343
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,250
Okay, I promise you.

344
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,800
Let's take this case first.

345
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,560
Once this big case is over,

346
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,100
I promise you'll make endless money in the future.

347
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,030
Okay, rich lady?

348
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,930
Smile, rich lady.

349
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,850
I didn't expect

350
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,680
those two girls to be so capable.

351
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
They even managed to dig up

352
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,070
such a secret in such a short time.

353
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,790
We didn't do our job carefully enough.

354
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,070
Are we still going to compete for administrator?

355
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,160
It seems if we go bankrupt and reorganize now,

356
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,150
the administrator's fee will probably be higher.

357
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
But correspondingly,

358
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,150
the qualification requirements for the administrator will be higher.

359
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,180
Plus, the report letter.

360
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,790
The situation is not optimistic.

361
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
The greater the profit,

362
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
the more likely Judge Wei

363
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,240
will try to avoid arousing suspicion.

364
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,720
We'll give up competing for administrator

365
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,970
and represent Dingxin.

366
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,710
Dingxin has a debt of more than a billion to Wanhe.

367
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,120
They're coming.

368
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,110
Mr. Xu.

369
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,180
Ms. Luo.

370
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,850
I've decided

371
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,070
to give up the competition for administrator

372
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,380
and be Dingxin's representative.

373
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,560
At the same time, I want to invite you

374
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,750
to join our team

375
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,060
to represent Dingxin.

376
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,700
Now we need to hurry up

377
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
and verify the information you brought.

378
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,110
If it's completely true,

379
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,620
we can go and discuss cooperation

380
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,080
with Mr. Liu together.

381
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
What do you think?

382
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,650
We think it's awesome.

383
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,660
Mr. Xu, I look forward to our cooperation.

384
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,170
Me too.

385
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,670
Cheers.

386
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,660
Here. Cheers.

387
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,880
Cheers.

388
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,620
Let's talk about some details.

389
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,180
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

390
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,080
Do you have any specific demands or ideas

391
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,120
for this cooperation?

392
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,640
Qiu Hua, you were right.

393
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,790
But I didn't expect

394
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,270
he would let us join his team.

395
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,290
So what? Should I thank him?

396
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,570
This should have been our chance to make a fortune.

397
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,130
But now, he's going to take the bulk

398
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,780
and enjoy all the limelight.

399
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,600
Why should we do such a thing?

400
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,850
I'm sorry.

401
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,890
I was stupid.

402
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,940
But what's done is done.

403
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,280
Let's just make peace with it, okay?

404
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,890
I think after this experience,

405
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,640
he should know our value.

406
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,760
I think he won't neglect us

407
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,950
for future contracts.

408
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,370
Xu Zhuo is such a shrewd person.

409
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
Do you think he'll let you make money?

410
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,230
Even a fool knows the value of our information.

411
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,730
We could have represented Dingxin independently.

412
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,730
But now,

413
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,040
we have to work for them.

414
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,599
How much longer do I have to wait?

415
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,440
They'll get to Inner Mongolia if I wait any longer.

416
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,110
Hello?

417
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,750
Who's this?

418
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,120
I should be asking you that question.

419
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,550
This is Liu Desheng.

420
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,750
Why did I

421
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,790
hear from my mom that you went to my house to look for me,

422
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,510
and you pretended to be my girlfriend?

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,970
Who on earth are you?

424
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,290
Oh, Desheng.

425
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,520
I'm sorry.

426
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
This is...

427
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,450
This is your girlfriend's bestie.

428
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,760
She's been complaining to me these days,

429
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,920
saying you broke up

430
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,550
and she missed you.

431
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,360
So I thought

432
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,960
I'd be a peacemaker and help you two reconcile.

433
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,470
So I went to your house without telling you.

434
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,310
Maybe your mom misunderstood.

435
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,470
You are Hui's bestie?

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,790
What?

437
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,270
She wants to make up with me?

438
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,740
Hui is hesitating.

439
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,590
Desheng, where are you?

440
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,940
I'll go find you. Let's talk in person.

441
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,170
I'm on my way to Inner Mongolia.

442
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,110
Then you'll have to wait until I come back.

443
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
The truck broke down. I'm getting it fixed now.

444
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,310
What a coincidence.

445
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,770
I'm going to Inner Mongolia too.

446
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,740
Which part of Inner Mongolia are you going to?

447
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,520
Why are you asking so much?

448
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,950
It's all for Hui, okay?

449
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,520
I'm sad to see you two fighting.

450
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,070
How about this? Send me your location.

451
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,810
Maybe I can catch up with you.

452
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,350
How can I send you my location?

453
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,640
You have to add me on WeChat first.

454
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,130
Of course. Let's do that.

455
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,580
Desheng, my phone number is my WeChat number.

456
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,720
You can add me, or I can add you.

457
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,650
Okay, go ahead.

458
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,840
Why didn't she do that earlier?

459
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
She's a beauty.

460
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,870
With her coming, why would I make up with Hui?

461
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,560
There's still such a long way to go.

462
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,790
What should I do?

463
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,510
Who is this?

464
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,640
This is Xia Shu. Ms. Xia.

465
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,370
Which Ms. Xia Shu?

466
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,420
You don't remember?

467
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,840
You asked me to collect debts for you.

468
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,620
Ms. Xia.

469
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,920
How did it go? Have you found him?

470
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,110
Yes.

471
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,940
He's heading to Inner Mongolia

472
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,770
with the goods he took from you without paying.

473
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,300
He has resold that batch of goods.

474
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,800
I've got his location.

475
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,470
I'm on my way to catch up with him now.

476
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,930
You mean that batch of goods

477
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,540
worth six million?

478
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,700
Don't you remember your own goods?

479
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Where are you now?

480
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,180
I told you. I'm on the road.

481
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,220
Where is he?

482
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,880
He's on the road too.

483
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,050
He's over 400 kilometers ahead of me.

484
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,320
I can catch up with him in one day.

485
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,700
Ms. Xia, thank you. How about this?

486
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,010
Send me your location.

487
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,660
I'll take a plane to meet you right away.

488
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,750
Sir.

489
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,380
Ms. Xia! Ms. Xia!

490
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,920
Don't go.

491
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,390
Are you Mr. Zhou?

492
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,340
Yingzi sent me here.

493
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,370
Mr. Zhou, you're finally here.

494
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,270
I've got the creditor's location.

495
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,940
He's only 400 kilometers from us.

496
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,800
He's getting his truck fixed now.

497
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,110
He might leave soon after the fixing is done.

498
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,750
Let's hurry up.

499
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,760
There's no hurry.

500
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,710
It's only 400 kilometers. We can make it.

501
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,070
A truck won't be able to outrun us.

502
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,200
Let him go. Let him go.

503
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,070
You can go.

504
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,280
Get in.

506
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,060
Let's go.

507
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,960
Let's go.

508
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,260
Sir, can't you drive faster?

509
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,210
How fast do you think I can drive on this road?

510
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,730
Just drive a bit faster.

511
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,560
Thank you.

512
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,780
Be careful.

513
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,720
No problem, Boss.

514
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,640
Stop the car!

515
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,780
Come on! Pull over!

516
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,370
Alright, pull over.

517
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,910
Xia, what is it this time?

518
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,800
What are you doing?

519
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,940
Sir, get off. Come on.

520
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,060
Hurry up.

521
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,830
Alright, let her drive.

522
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,170
Come on. I'll drive.

523
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,930
What's the hurry?

524
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,160
He was too slow.

525
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,810
You could have just asked him to drive faster.

526
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,310
Fasten your seat belt.

527
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,200
Done. Done.

528
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm about to hit the road.

529
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,100
Don't worry. No hurry.

530
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,570
We can definitely catch up with him today.

531
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,610
Just follow this car.

532
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,720
Oh my god.

533
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,770
It's too dangerous.

534
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,550
The address is on my phone.

535
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,090
Keep an eye on it. Don't miss it.

536
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,560
We can definitely catch up with him today.

537
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,490
Don't worry.

538
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,900
Let him...

539
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,460
I'm about to throw up.

540
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,370
Just drive straight.

I am.

555
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,410
or I won't allow the release of this batch of goods.

556
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,270
How bold of you.

557
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,650
You pretended to be my girlfriend

558
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,790
and went to my house to lie to my mom.

559
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,810
And then, you pretended to be Hui's bestie

560
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,920
to fool me, right?

561
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,540
I had no choice.

562
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,440
You're the one who deceived Xincheng Group first.

563
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,350
You signed a contract with Xincheng Group

564
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,970
but have not yet executed the payment agreement.

565
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,100
You even want to resell the goods.

566
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,900
You're the one who broke the contract.

567
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,270
Mr. Liu, as long as you fulfill the agreement,

568
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm willing to apologize for my actions.

569
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,430
Apologize? What the hell are you talking about?

570
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,770
Do you think I need your apology?

571
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,380
How dare you!

572
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,620
Do you know where this is?

573
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,390
Do you think you can just do whatever you want here?

574
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,410
I'm telling you.

575
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
Move your car immediately.

576
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,130
Don't hinder me from driving.

577
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,430
I won't be responsible if I hit you.

578
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,600
Whose car is this? Move it now!

579
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,420
It's mine.

580
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,480
What?

581
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,750
So you brought people with you?

582
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,370
Buddy, don't make such a scene.

583
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,630
We're all friends.

584
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,510
Do you know Loafer?

585
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,750
No.

586
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,240
You don't know Big Head Du, either?

587
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,740
I, Liu Desheng, don't know anyone.

588
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,310
Move your car right away.

589
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,130
You're not loyal to your friends then.

590
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,220
They both know you.

591
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,800
How about this?

592
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
I'll call Big Head Du,

593
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,680
and you can talk to him, okay?

594
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,360
Don't call him. I won't talk to him.

595
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,370
Move the car right now,

596
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,250
or I won't go easy on you.

597
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,360
Come on. Don't go easy on us.

598
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,880
Come on. Show us.

599
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,370
You want to challenge me?

600
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,740
Zhang.

601
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,300
Drive.

602
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,690
Hit it head-on.

603
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
If I dodge, you can call me coward.

604
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,290
Come on. Hit it. Come on.

605
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,570
Come on.

606
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,130
Zhang.

607
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,300
Go around.

608
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,750
No! You can't leave without paying.

609
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,700
I'm telling you, go away.

610
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,970
I won't be responsible if I hit you.

611
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Go. Go this way.

612
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,420
What are you doing, Xia?

613
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,040
It's too dangerous. Get up. Get up.

614
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,200
If you don't pay,

615
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,980
just run over me.

616
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,560
Zhang, drive!

617
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,240
You can't!

618
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,560
You'll be sentenced to death if you dare to drive, you know?

619
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,270
Run her over!

620
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,570
Don't you dare! You'll kill her! Don't drive!

621
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,100
Come on out, Xia.

622
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,050
How about this? Make her come out.

623
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,920
For the sake of Big Head Du,

624
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,130
I'll save you some dignity.

625
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,270
Xia, Xia, let's do it another way.

626
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,350
You won't get any money this way.

627
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,370
You won't come out, right?

628
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,170
You just won't come out, right?

629
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,810
That's right. I won't come out whatsoever.

630
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,410
Alright!

631
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,450
Zhang, get off!

632
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,170
Don't...

633
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,880
Just get out!

634
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,510
Get out.

635
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,540
Let me ask you one last time.

636
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,540
Are you coming out or not?

637
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,470
If you don't pay,

638
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,860
I won't come out even if I die.

639
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,680
Fine!

640
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,710
Go away!

641
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,660
Come out. Come out.

642
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,100
No!

643
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,450
Don't drive! You'll be sentenced to death if you run her over!

644
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,060
I'm asking you one last time. Are you coming out?

645
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,460
I won't. Go ahead and run me over!

646
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,330
Okay!

647
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,210
Even if I, Liu Desheng, risk being sentenced to death,

648
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,230
I can't let a woman like you control me!

649
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,240
Sir.

650
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,260
Please drive faster, okay?

651
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,180
Thank you.

652
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,680
Don't drive!

653
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,960
He's started the engine!

654
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,630
Get up! He'll run you over!

655
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,510
Are you coming out or not?

656
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,440
No!

657
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,520
Are you coming out or not?

658
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,230
-Come down here!
-I'm not!

659
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,780
You're still young! How much is it? Is it worth it?

660
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,520
It's not worth that much!

661
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,230
Run me over!

662
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,180
Don't! Don't drive! Stop!

663
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,950
Come on. Let's talk.

664
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,950
Turn off the engine.

665
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,130
Turn off the engine.

666
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,980
Half.

667
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,510
I can't pay more.

668
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,310
I don't have that much money on my account.

669
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,680
Xia, he said he'll pay half.

670
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,490
He'll give you the rest after he sells the goods.

671
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,520
That won't do.

672
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,440
Then I'll have to get under the truck again

673
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,150
and force him to give me the other half, right?

674
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,000
She means half won't do.

675
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,920
Where should she go to get the rest from you?

676
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,890
How can she collect debts like this?

677
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,880
Is this how you collect debts?

678
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,590
She's just a young girl. Please understand.

679
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,870
70%. That's the best I can do.

680
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,890
I don't have that much money.

681
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,800
Do you think I need to be like this if I have the money?

682
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,160
Besides, I've already sold this batch of goods.

683
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,690
When I get to Inner Mongolia,

684
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,480
the money will be transferred to me,

685
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,790
and I'll transfer it to them, right?

686
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,480
I understand.

687
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,000
-I understand.
-Right?

688
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,790
Yes.

689
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,860
Wait.

690
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,960
You two, get under the truck.

691
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,950
Okay, Boss.

692
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,960
They've got under the truck now.

693
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,310
Get up, okay? The truck won't be able to escape.

694
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,160
I'll lie here a while longer.

695
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,590
He said he'll pay 70%, okay?

696
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,200
As for the remaining 30%,

697
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,750
he'll give it to you when he sells the goods there, okay?

698
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,720
That still won't do.

699
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,920
This kid.

700
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,030
So stubborn.

701
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,130
She said...

702
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,400
What does she want?

703
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,450
Can you please understand me, my lady?

704
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,850
Even if you kill me now,

705
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,860
I won't be able to pay you in full, right?

706
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,790
Am I right?

707
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,840
-That makes sense.
-Right?

708
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,450
Once I get to Inner Mongolia

709
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,410
and sell this truck of goods,

710
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,910
I'll give you the money right after I'm back, right?

711
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,090
How simple is that?

712
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,030
How about this?

713
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,380
If you can't trust me, come with me to Inner Mongolia.

714
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,650
Let's all go, okay?

715
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,630
Okay. Go to the bank with me now

716
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,720
and transfer the 70% payment

717
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,230
to our account first.

718
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,490
Then we'll go to Inner Mongolia.

719
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,440
Once the goods are delivered,

720
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,920
transfer the remaining 30% to us

721
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,830
at once.

722
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,060
Also,

723
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,730
we need to add another clause to the contract.

724
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,430
You broke the contract first,

725
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,430
so you have to pay the late fee for the time you delayed.

726
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,350
What the hell?

727
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,160
Why is there late fee?

728
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,450
Can I not pay the late fee?

729
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,440
No.

730
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,830
Ms. Xia.

731
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,680
Mr. Hao, you're finally here.

732
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,750
This woman you hired is too imposing.

733
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,150
I promised to pay,

734
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,480
yet she asked for late fee.

735
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,120
Please ask her to drop the late fee, okay?

736
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,730
I do have my difficulties.

737
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,430
I apologize for what happened before.

738
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,730
Please forgive me, okay?

739
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,070
Mr. Hao, he broke the contract first.

740
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,240
He should pay the late fee.

741
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,510
Don't budge easily.

742
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,170
Ms. Xia.

743
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,870
I'm already very satisfied to get the money back.

744
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,680
As for the late fee, how about...

745
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,470
No.

746
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,510
What do you mean no?

747
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,440
What do you mean no?

748
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,000
Who's the boss, you or him?

749
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,410
He's agreed to drop it. Who do you think you are?

750
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,590
Come on, Liu.

751
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,640
Let me tell you.

752
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,610
You know what?

753
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,230
The law firm she's from is very powerful in Jingbei.

754
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,980
They put a lot of people in jail.

755
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,400
Listen to me.

756
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,620
Pay half of the late fee, okay?

757
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,440
Can you do that?

758
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,790
Half is okay.

759
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,460
All right, he's going to pay half. Get up.

760
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,150
When will you pay?

761
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,050
I'll pay as soon as we get to Inner Mongolia, okay?

762
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,200
Okay?

763
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,070
If you don't agree, I can give you my mink coat.

764
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,030
-I'll pay for it with my mink coat, okay?
-Come on.

765

I'll go with you.

773
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't know how to drive.

807

Judge Wei.

808
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,350
On behalf of Dingxin Group,

809
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,840
Wanhe Group's biggest creditor,

810
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,070
we've learned some of the latest information

811
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,920
about Wanhe Group.

812
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,750
We want to withdraw

813
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,720
some opinions regarding Wanhe's bankruptcy

814
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,800
and debt disposal.

815
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,990
At the same time, I hereby solemnly announce that

816
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,620
no matter which organization will be elected as the administrator,

817
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,830
we firmly disagree with

818
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,280
Wanhe Group's choice of bankruptcy liquidation.

819
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,930
This will inevitably seriously damage

820
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,470
the interests of the majority of creditors.

821
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,770
Therefore,

822
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,460
without a complete investigation

823
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,910
of Wanhe's assets,

824
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,140
I will object to

825
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,790
the administrator

826
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,710
and any disposal of the bankruptcy property,

827
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,830
and prepare for litigation.

828
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,070
Mr. Xu.

829
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,670
What do you mean?

830
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,240
Because as far as we know,

831
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,430
Wanhe Group

832
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,790
didn't reveal the truth.

833
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,330
They concealed and hid

834
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,330
huge amounts of high-quality assets.

835
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,380
What does he mean?

836
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,790
Is there something we don't know?

837
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,340
It can't be.

838
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,730
We've investigated it.

839
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,920
Hello.

840
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,400
Wanhe's biggest asset

841
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,540
is their land and construction in progress.

842
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,750
But these have been repeatedly mortgaged

843
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,860
or seized.

844
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,520
They can't be considered high-quality assets at all.

845
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,300
Exactly.

846
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,120
May I stream something to the smart TV, please?

847
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,040
Yes, you may.

848
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,680
Thank you.

849
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,540
Please look at this parcel of land.

850
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,270
It's located in the western suburbs of Jingbei.

851
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,240
It covers an area of ​​about 1,000 acres.

852
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,070
Ten years ago, Wanhe Group

853
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,770
bought this parcel of land at a very low price.

854
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But two years and three months ago,

855
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Wanhe resold it to a company called Xinyuan

856
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,710
at a premium rate of 15%.

857
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,340
15% premium.

858
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,870
We all know what the land price has been like

859
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
in Jingbei in the past ten years.

860
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,980
But since there was a premium,

861
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,970
the deal seemed completely fine.

862
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,390
But if we look into

863
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,240
the relationship between these two companies,

864
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,870
there's a lot behind it.

865
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,760
The legal person of this Xinyuan Company is surnamed Peng.

866
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,020
On the surface, he seems to have nothing to do

867
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,250
with Mr. Wan of Wanhe.

868
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,500
But in fact, Mr. Peng

869
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,440
is the godfather of Mr. Wan's son.

870
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,790
What? Godfather?

871
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,440
Therefore, the real owner of this parcel of land

872
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,239
still needs to be investigated by the court.

873
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,480
But we have reason to believe that

874
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,880
this land actually still belongs to Wanhe Group.

875
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,690
Or we should say, its real owner

876
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,760
is Mr. Wan's son, who was sent abroad by him in advance.

877
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,300
Wanhe Group still owns high-quality assets.

878
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,710
So it must not choose bankruptcy liquidation.

879
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,190
If they want to go bankrupt,

880
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,920
they should take the path of bankruptcy and reorganization.

881
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,150
This way, it can best protect

882
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,540
the interests of creditors,

883
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,360
and it can also help revitalize Wanhe.

884
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
That's all. Thank you.

885
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,480
Who do you think found out about this?

886
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,310
Those two are so capable.

887
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,160
We shouldn't have

888
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,960
let them go.

889
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,740
We should have kept them in our law firm

890
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
rather than let them out

891
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,450
and become our rival.

892
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,230
What's the point of saying this now?

893
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,270
If they choose reorganization over liquidation,

894
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,580
the administrator's fee will only be higher.

895
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,030
As long as we succeed in the election,

896
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,840
it will only benefit us.

897
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
But now, Xu Zhuo is representing Dingxin Group.

898
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,750
That's the biggest creditor of Wanhe.

899
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,570
They'll definitely keep an eye on the administrator the whole time.

900
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,330
Even if we win the election,

901
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,550
we have to deal with them all the time.

902
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,960
What's there to be afraid of?

903
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,790
We're not guilty anyway.

904
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,050
Please be quiet.

905
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,400
Considering the special situation,

906
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,680
that's all for today's meeting.

907
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,050
The relevant results

908
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,610
will be announced in the form of a court notice.

909
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,440
Let's go.

910
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,150
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

911
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,810

912
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,850

913

Congratulations.

914
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,440
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

915
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,180
Do you remember what I said

916
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,330
when you left Liangcheng Law Firm?

917

00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,690
and trained you.

921
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,040
You're right, Ms. Fang.

922
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,960
You'll always be our senior and teacher.

923
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,660
It's my honor and the best reward

924
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,530
to your help and education

925
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,450
that I do my best to win the competition

926
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,690
we're both in.

927
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:02,980
Alright.

928
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,550
Good job. Keep it up.

929
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,940
Good job.

930
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,560
Thank you.

931
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
Mr. Xu, this is what we should do.

932
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,670
I officially invite your firm

933
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,080
to join the team representing Dingxin Group.

934
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,880
Let's handle this case together.

935
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,920
I hope I have the honor

936
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,260
to work with you.

937
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,270
That's great.

938
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,450
We'll start working

939
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,800
after signing the contract.

940
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,670
You may have to come to my firm

941
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,320
often in the future.

942
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,210
I'm looking forward to it.

943
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,890
Bye.

944
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

945
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,890
"Goodbye, Mr. Xu."

946
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,600
Your face

947
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,960
must be stiff from all the smiling.

948
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,610
See?

949
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,090
He finally acknowledged our value.

950
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,670
Does our value need his acknowledgment?

951
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,920
You're being haughty again.

952
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,710
Did you forget how desperate we were when Liangcheng Law Firm

953
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,970
kicked us out?

954
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,460
It's like a cooked duck flew into someone else's bowl,

955
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,330
and we only get to drink some duck soup.

956
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,040
We have to learn how to drink soup first

957
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,860
before we can know what meat tastes like.

958
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,110
Righteous Luo.

959
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,670
Why didn't Liangcheng Law Firm bring you along

960
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,670
for such a big case?

961
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,170
Are you not included?

962
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,300
Yeah, I'm not.

963
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,840
I specially came here today

964
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,710
to tell you something.

965
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,320
But if you treat me like this,

966
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,250
forget it. I won't tell you.

967
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,080
It's up to you. Don't pretend to be mysterious.

968
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,550
You'll regret it if you don't hear it.

969
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,550
He came here specially to wait for you.

970
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,460
He must have something important to tell you.

971
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,290
Go ask him.

972
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,430
Give me the car key.

973
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,240
I'll go wait for you in the car.

974
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,530
You still have to come, don't you?

975
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,440
What is it?

976
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
First of all, congratulations.

977
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,900
I heard that Xu Zhuo ruined

978
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,080
the election competition review meeting for Wanhe.

979
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,150
You must have contributed to it.

980
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,560
What does it have to do with me

981
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,720
that Liangcheng Law Firm didn't prepare well?

982
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,320
Did Liangcheng Law Firm ask you to come

983
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,340
and inquire with your handsome face?

984
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,760
So you admit that I'm handsome?

985
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,400
Let me tell you.

986
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,760
I've taken on a big case of tens of millions.

987
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,150
I don't even want to pry

988
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,920
into such a tiny case.

989
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,780
Alright, enough with the bragging. Let's get down to business.

990
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,550
There's a gossip.

991
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,400
What gossip?

992
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,150
So excited?

993
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,960
You want to listen?

994
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,940
Fine, I'll tell you.

995
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,510
Liangcheng Law Firm

996
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,920
once handled a case similar to Wanhe's.

997
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,230
It's also a case of bankruptcy and reorganization, called Zhucheng Case.

998
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,540
This case was handled by Tao Zheng back then.

999
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,720
Guess which year it was?

1000
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,570
Which year?

1001
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,190
The same year as Wei Cheng's rape case.

1002
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,910
Regarding the Zhucheng Case,

1003
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,840
Mei Daliang and her husband were the head

1004
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,070
of the administrators' team back then.

1005
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,860
But later, something happened to the couple,

1006
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,640
and the case fell into Tao Zheng's hands.

1007
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,920
But Tao Zheng is Madam Mei's right-hand man.

1008
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,190
It's normal that the case fell into his hands, right?

1009
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,220
Do you think there could be such a coincidence?

1010
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,360
Let me tell you.

1011
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,490
The amount of subject of Zhucheng Case

1012
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,880
was very big.

1013
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,550
Whoever got it done would rise to fame

1014
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,580
and benefit from it.

1015
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,070
This is Zhucheng Case's file. I took a picture.

1016
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,030
I've got it copied.

1017
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,510
Anyway, I'm from Liangcheng Law Firm.

1018
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,810
That's all for now.

1019
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,920
Why are you so nice to me?

1020
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,140
I've always been nice to you.

1021
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,090
Alright. Alright.

1022
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Aren't you going to thank me?

1023
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,640
You're welcome.

1024
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,760
Also,

1025
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,550
Xu Zhuo also has something to do with Zhucheng Case.

1026
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,360
What did you say?

1027
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,010
He was Mei Daliang's assistant back then,

1028
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,810
so he must be involved.

1029
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,730
Be careful.

1030
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,520
Okay.

1031
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,760
I'm leaving.

1032
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,360
Thank you.

1033
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,420
You're welcome.

1034
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,950
You finally said 'thank you' to me.

1035
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,590
What did he say?

1036
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,670
Take a look at this. The file.

1037
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,740
He told me

1038
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,010
Liangcheng Law Firm once took on

1039
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,580
a bankruptcy and reorganization case called Zhucheng Case.

1040
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,320
It's similar to Wanhe's cae.

1041
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,440
This is the case file.

1042
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,360
He said that Zhucheng Case

1043
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,110
happened in the same year

1044
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,280
as Wei Cheng's rape case.

1045
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,520
He also mentioned Madam Mei and Mr. Xu to me.

1046
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,560
This Zhucheng Case was a case concerning Madam Mei.

1047
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,060
What does it have to do with Xu Zhuo?

1048
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,800
Mr. Xu was Madam Mei's assistant back then

1049
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,250
on this case.

1050
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,760
Chen Shuo was at Liangcheng Law Firm.

1051
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,960
He found the information,

1052
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,690
and he specially came here to tell you.

1053
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,120
Quite impressive.

1054
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,850
He's serious about pursuing you.

1055
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,470
He only gave me a case file, and you think he's serious?

1056
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,000
Are you kidding?

1057
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,780
It's not like I haven't been pursued before.

1058
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,360
Do you feel weird

1059
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,260
that Chen Shuo said this case

1060
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,240
involves Xu Zhuo?

1061
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,290
Why should I?

1062
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,960
It's just

1063
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,450
Mr. Xu is a person Madam Mei thinks highly of.

1064
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,550
And now he's about to work with us.

1065
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,060
Why did Unscrupulous Chen send these to us at a time like this?

1066
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
What is he up to?

1067
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,360
Isn't this ruining

1068
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,380
our relationship with Mr. Xu?

1069
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,870
It's not ruining our relationship with Xu Zhuo,

1070
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,850
but your relationship with him.

1071
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,880
What?

1072
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,400
So when we get the commission,

1073
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,600
you won't take the money?

1074
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,770
Mr. Xu, what's the matter?

1075
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,920
Ms. Luo.

1076
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,550
Are you at Yinghua Law Firm?

1077
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,280
Yes, I'm working overtime.

1078
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,860
I'm checking the creditor situation of Dingxin and Wanhe.

1079
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,000
Have you eaten?

1080
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,990
Until what time are you going to work overtime?

1081
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,220
That's hard to say.

1082
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,300
I've prepared some food in advance.

1083
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,810
Why? Is something up?
