00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,770
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,990
I've organized the data again

4
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,340
and sent it to you, Mr. Xu.

5
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,680
I've seen it. Thank you, Yingzi.

6
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,789
Don't say that. Isn't it what I should do?

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,710
Mr. Xu,

8
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,350
do you like dried tofu?

9
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,130
I heard it's a local specialty here.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,950
How about I bring some back for you?

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,759
No need, thank you.

12
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,200
I heard the natural scenery there is quite nice,

13
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,430
suitable for a relaxing vacation.

14
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,180
Once we're done with this case,

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,280
I'll take you all there,

16
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,480
find a homestay, and we'll enjoy a few days off.

17
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,580
Sounds great, Mr. Xu. It's a deal then.

18
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,680
Here, your coffee.

19
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,710
Here.

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,440
Hello, Mr. Xu, I know this area well.

21
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,560
If you like homestays,

22
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,360
I can recommend a few for you.

23
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,560
Mr. Xu,

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,520
Mr. Chen is here working on this case with me.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,190
Hello.

26
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,940
What are you doing?

27
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm just casually chatting with him.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm working.

29
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,590
It doesn't look like you're working.

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,970
Alright then, Mr. Xu, you take a look first.

31
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,240
Let's talk later when you're done.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,870
Bye.

33
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,560
Bye.

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,610
Can you move over now?

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,960
Why?

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,800
It's too crowded. Move over.

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,600
Look, the weather is so nice,

38
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,320
with blue sky and white clouds.

39
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,800
It would be perfect if we didn't have to work.

40
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,610
It'd be even better if we were on a trip,

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,470
right?

42
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,130
What's wrong?

43
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,020
You haven't said a word for a long time.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm just a driver who keeps quiet.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
I have no right to speak.

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,030
Come on, bro.

47
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,590
I was busy with work.

48
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,040
Now that I'm done with it, you can stop being quiet.

49
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,250
Busy with work? Then why were you talking about rural tourism?

50
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,170
And why were you talking about local specialties?

51
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,160
Well, we couldn't just talk about work, could we?

52
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,060
I'm out of town.

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,560
Shouldn't I bring something back for him?

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,829
Besides, what we talk about

55
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,360
is none of your business.

56
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,310
We?

57
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,130
What's the matter? I'm talking about Mr. Xu and me.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
You and Mr. Xu are "we."

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Up ahead,

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,870
there's a nice homestay.

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,430
Let's stop by and have a look.

62
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,940
What?

63
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,769
Homestay.

64
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:18,950
To do what?

65
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,450
Just to check out the homestay.

66
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,340
Check out the homestay?

67
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,070
Yes.

68
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,710
I thought you meant to check out the homestay.

69
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,980
Turns out you meant to check out the homestay

70
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,570
What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,970
You and I checking out a homestay together?

72
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,120
What are you thinking?

73
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,470
Who's "we" with you?

74
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,870
Are you done?

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,710
So annoying.

76
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,030
Let's stop talking. I'm tired.

77
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,840
This is the equity transfer agreement

78
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,490
from Lei's uncles.

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,610
So much?

80
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,720
They now hold the same number of shares as Lei.

81
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,170
Clearly, they know that

82
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,040
Lei can only win if he has my vote,

83
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,860
so they've decided to take the plunge.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,430
But this money

85
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,400
is too much for Hao Lei.

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
His uncles have been making a scene at the mine,

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,250
deliberately withholding wages.

88
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,450
Hao Lei is using his own money to cover it.

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,930
Sister, even if you don't want to transfer the shares,

90
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,810
just vote for Hao Lei.

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Once he becomes chairman,

92
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,000
Xincheng will definitely get better,

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,560
and your dividends will keep increasing.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,490
Shu,

95
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,630
my entire family's

96
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,920
future happiness

97
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,390
is tied to this business.

98
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
I can't afford to gamble.

99
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,750
Just listen to me.

100
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,830
Go back and discuss with Hao Lei.

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,500
As long as he agrees,

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,360
I'll give him time to raise the money.

103
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,430
Okay.

104
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,270
Mom, the lawyer told me

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,640
the court date has been set.

106
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,240
I'll ask for time off to go back then.

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,750
Dad doesn't agree?

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,040
Why?

109
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,090
Do you think you can handle it alone?

110
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,660
Okay.

111
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,600
Mom, about Dad,

112
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,890
the lawyer has already warned us.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Don't be afraid.

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
Once the trial is over

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,710
and Dad's situation settles down,

116
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,660
I'll go back.

117
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,270
If anything comes up, call me.

118
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay.

119
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm back.

120
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,740
[Yinghua Law Firm]

121
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,870
Xia Shu, over here.

122
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,820
You're back? How was it?

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,930
What's going on?

124
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,190
Hello, Ms. Xia.

125
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,000
What's wrong with this world?

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
There's someone who suffered serious harm,

127
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,260
so much so that her entire life was changed.

128
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,160
But no one is held accountable for it.

129
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,070
Everyone thinks it's insignificant.

130
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,510
Instead, the person who wants to seek justice for her

131
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,950
is seen as overly sensitive.

132
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,860
What went wrong?

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,760
Is it the world, or is it us?

134
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,770
This is the way the world is.

135
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,680
You're overreacting.

136
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,159
What does that mean?

137
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,390
This is the true face of the world.

138
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,800
Everyone who comes into this world

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,140
will be hurt in some way.

140
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
There's no other way.

141
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,930
You have to force yourself to be strong.

142
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,659
I don't agree.

143
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,670
Being strong

144
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,420
doesn't mean condoning evil.

145
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,420
If evil goes unpunished,

146
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,730
those who commit it will only grow bolder.

147
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,240
Just like that Ms. Fang.

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
If her actions had been punished back then,

149
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
she probably wouldn't have been able to become a teacher.

150
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,390
Even if she did,

151
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,410
she wouldn't dare to treat her students like that now.

152
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,910
Small evils, if left unchecked,

153
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,220
will grow into big ones.

154
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,310
And no matter how strong a person is,

155
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,940
they'll lose faith in this world.

156
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,300
Just like Qiu Hua.

157
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,250
Don't talk about me.

158
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,080
I've lost my faith a long time ago.

159
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,330
Let's get back to this case.

160
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,560
I still suggest

161
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,220
we terminate the agency agreement with them.

162
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,500
The situation is already like this,

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,760
and it has caused very serious consequences.

164
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,600
But we can't do anything about it.

165
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
So what should we do?

166
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,669
Stop playing that match-3 game.

167
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,270
You've been my shadow for two days.

168
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,840
Why don't you share your opinions and insights too?

169
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,970
Didn't you just say that?

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm just a shadow.

171
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,930
Can my opinions and insights even be useful?

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,390
What you should do now

173
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,010
is to call Mr. Xu.

174
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,580
He knows everything

175
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,510
and can solve

176
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,560
all your problems.

177
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,720
We're discussing the case here.

178
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,340
What does Mr. Xu have to do with this?

179
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,050
What does that mean?

180
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:06,920
Nothing.

181
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,450
But I just want to say,

182
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,760
the Criminal Law has 562 articles,

183
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,000
and the soon-to-be-enacted Civil Code

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,390
has 1,260 articles.

185
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,360
Why are all your perspectives

186
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,840
on this matter focused on

187
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,900
bullying and harm?

188
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,170
Aren't there other perspectives to consider?

189
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,350
Does this case have no solution?

190
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,240
Defamation?

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,200
Defamation?

192
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
The "Rich Girl's Sayings" they posted

193
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,960
on the forum back then

194
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,390
was full of defamation,

195
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,440
which directly led to Xiao Nannan having to drop out of school.

196
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,510
Later, after she went to university,

197
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,760
they reposted the "Sayings"

198
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,030
on a website,

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,160
which received thousands of views.

200
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,110
This definitely counts as a serious offense, right?

201
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,170
Yes.

202
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,650
Although we can't arrest everyone

203
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,080
who hurt Xiao Nannan,

204
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,840
we can catch the one who led it.

205
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,990
Let's arrest Liu Jianming.

206
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,340
He's the one who compiled and posted the "Sayings."

207
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,140
You didn't see him.

208
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,720
He looks really nasty.

209
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,250
I can't stand him.

210
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,710
Right, Chen Shuo?

211
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,450
Yes.

212
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Luo Yingzi is always right.

213
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,090
Are you out of your mind or something?

214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,900
Why are you being so sarcastic?

215
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,930
What do you mean by that?

216
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,440
I mean, I've been your shadow for two days, and I'm a bit tired.

217
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,710
I'm going back to rest.

218
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,800
Bye, Ms. Qiu.

219
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,010
Bye, Ms. Xia.

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,820
Bye,

221
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,250
well...

222
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,940
What is he doing?

223
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,130
What does he mean?

224
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,920
Did they have a falling out?

225
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,470
Did you two have a falling out?

226
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,440
Why did you pass on her words to me?

227
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,270
Xia Shu, seriously.

228
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,040
I can hear

229
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,430
your whispers.

230
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,220
I don't have time to argue with him.

231
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,540
You really don't know who's a good person.

232
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,200
Look at your attitude toward him.

233
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,150
Is he a good person?

234
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,120
Is he?

235
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,240
You have no idea. These past

236
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,270
couple of days with him,

237
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,420
I was the one who was arguing with people,

238
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,790
and he was hiding behind me.

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,670
He's a good person?

240
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,720
Alright, alright.

241
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,530
Just don't regret it in the future.

242
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,480
Why would I regret it?

243
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,840
These people are saying really awful things.

244
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,910
What are you looking at?

245
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,910
The campus online forum about Xiao Nannan.

246
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,360
These people are too much.

247
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,720
Just because of one photo of a girl,

248
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,990
they're cursing her like this.

249
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,200
"Rich girl?" How disgusting.

250
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,150
"Get out of our school."

251
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,200
"Get lost."

252
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,840
These people are completely lawless.

253
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,590
They are just a bunch of internet bullies.

254
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,270
They say whatever they want and take no responsibility.

255
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,900
Fang Rui.

256
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,310
Check when the last post

257
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,010
from the forum moderator was.

258
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,950
The last one?

259
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,670
March 1, 2013.

260
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,500
2013?

261
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,010
Yes.

262
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,630
2013...

263
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,850
Can we register now?

264
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,520
Yes, registration is available anytime.

265
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,880
Lawsuit?

266
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,930
Is that really necessary?

267
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,990
Because all of them

268
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,120
refuse to

269
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,910
apologize for their past actions

270
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,840
toward you.

271
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,470
Our suggestion is to file

272
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,310
a criminal defamation lawsuit

273
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,910
against the main person involved back then.

274
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,060
Once it becomes a criminal offense,

275
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,740
we believe it will deter others.

276
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,950
What will happen if we win?

277
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,320
Let me explain Article 246

278
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
of the Criminal Law regarding defamation.

279
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,360
When a person publicly insults others

280
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,390
or fabricates facts to defame others

281
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,360
through violence or other means,

282
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
with serious consequences,

283
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,550
the punishment is imprisonment for up to 3 years,

284
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,760
detention, or deprivation of political rights.

285
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,690
The number of views on this post

286
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,660
has exceeded 5,000,

287
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,200
and back then,

288
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,750
you chose to drop out because of it.

289
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,360
This can already be considered a serious consequence.

290
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,830
Therefore, we believe

291
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,140
that filing a criminal lawsuit

292
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,960
is feasible in theory.

293
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,570
But,

294
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,820
this doesn't feel right, does it?

295
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,310
Suing them over something so trivial

296
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,230
and sending them to jail?

297
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,170
What's wrong with that?

298
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,110
It happened many years ago,

299
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,600
and they still

300
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,350
haven't shown any remorse.

301
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,040
Ms. Xiao,

302
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,310
you are the victim.

303
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,390
You have the right to claim your rights.

304
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,150
Whether or not to let those who bullied you in the past

305
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,740
face legal punishment

306
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,040
is up to you.

307
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
As your lawyers,

308
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,880
we cannot incite you to file a lawsuit.

309
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,710
In other words,

310
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,930
we cannot make any decisions for you.

311
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,780
Well, Ms. Luo,

312
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,900
Nannan feels that making them

313
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,520
pay such a heavy price for this is a bit too much.

314
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,660
She feels bad about it.

315
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,380
Is there any other way?

316
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,420
We've already tried everything

317
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,810
we should have

318
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,990
and could think of.

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,560
Can I think about it?

320
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,240
Okay.

321
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,140
Let's call it a day, okay?

322
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay.

323
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,770
Is it that person calling again?

324
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,610
It's Fang Renmei.

325
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,980
After you contacted her,

326
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,960
she somehow got

327
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
Nannan's contact information.

328
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
She's called twice.

329
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,220
It seems that because some parents contacted her,

330
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,050
the school is considering disciplining her,

331
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,610
and now she's taking her anger

332
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
out on Nannan.

333
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,990
Is it her?

334
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,290
Don't hang up just yet.

335
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,220
Here, put it on speaker

336
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,630
and start recording.

337
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,080
Hello?

338
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,270
Rich girl.

339
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Why are you guys so sensitive?

340
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,490
This must be your lawyer's doing, right?

341
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,260
They incited my students' parents

342
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,670
to report me to the education bureau.

343
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,950
And now?

344
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,370
The school is going to discipline me, maybe even fire me.

345
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,150
Where's that lawyer of yours?

346
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,290
Tell her to come out.

347
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,940
Rich girl, why are you such a bitch?

348
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,610
You've been living in wealth since you were a kid.

349
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,200
And just because we joked around with you a little,

350
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,630
you got all dramatic?

351
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,050
A bitch like you needs to be taught a lesson!

352
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,280
Well...

353
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,670
If I file a lawsuit,

354
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,950
who should I sue?

355
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,630
Our suggestion is to sue

356
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,800
Liu Jianming.

357
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,440
Because he is the one who compiled

358
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,080
and fabricated the "Rich Girl's Sayings"

359
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,700
and was the first to post them online.

360
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,050
Therefore, he is considered the main person in this.

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,590
Can we try contacting him again

362
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,970
and explain the seriousness of the situation?

363
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,880
I hope he will change his attitude.

364
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,750
If he apologizes,

365
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,750
I'm willing to accept it.

366
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,050
If he still refuses to apologize,

367
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,140
I will choose to sue.

368
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,890
Okay, we can try again.

369
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,470
However...

370
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,810
I don't think it will make much of a difference.

371
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,580
So, Ms. Xiao,

372
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,070
you should be mentally prepared.

373
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,230
Mr. Liu,

374
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,790
we are here specifically

375
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,520
to inform you of this.

376
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
You must provide an apology letter

377
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,630
to Ms. Xiao Nannan within 10 days

378
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,350
and post it in your former classmates' group and on the forum.

379
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,910
Otherwise, Ms. Xiao Nannan

380
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,670
will file a criminal lawsuit against you.

381
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,000
If convicted,

382
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,690
you will face criminal penalties.

383
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,020
What's she suing me for?

384
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,000
Ms. Xiao Nannan will file

385
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,310
a defamation lawsuit against you.

386
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,260
Is that enough

387
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,820
to be a criminal case?

388
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,650
That depends on how the court views it.

389
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,540
Mr. Liu,

390
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
we have already fulfilled our duty of informing you.

391
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,630
Think about it.

392
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,920
Ms. Luo!

393
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,810
Ms. Luo.

394
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Ms. Luo.

395
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,750
Don't leave yet.

396
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,460
Well, for such a small matter,

397
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,339
you personally made two trips here.

398
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,550
Since it's around mealtime,

399
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,770
let me treat you to a meal.

400
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,480
No need.

401
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,960
Did you understand

402
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,069
everything we said to you?

403
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,349
Yes.

404
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:25,849
Don't worry.

405
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,750
I'll definitely think about it.

406
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,880
But about your request to post it

407
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,730
on the forum and in the classmates' group,

408
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,140
let me think about it.

409
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,950
After all, I have a family and children.

410
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,410
I need to consider my reputation.

411
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,350
How about this?

412
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,590
I'll give you an answer in 15 days, okay?

413
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,070
Sorry.

414
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,040
Sorry, we've already given you 10 days.

415
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,080
If we don't

416
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,580
receive your apology letter by then,

417
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,090
we'll see you in court.

418
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,750
Ms. Luo, you...

419
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,420
Oh no.

420
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:02,730
Sir.

421
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,210
Put a screen protector on my phone.

422
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,100
I have something urgent to deal with.

423
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,520
Ask someone else to do it.

424
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,240
Turning down a deal? What a fool.

425
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,840
Uncle, it's me, Jianming.

426
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,810
Long time no see. I've missed you.

427
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,550
I happen to be going to Jingbei for something,

428
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,580
so I'll come by and see you.

429
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,830
Uncle!

430
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,720
Uncle.

431
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,230
Uncle!

432
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,320
Are you busy?

433
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,390
Oh, you shouldn't have brought anything.

434
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,440
Wait a minute.

435
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,830
Tian.

436
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,350
Come here.

437
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,640
Jianming, don't be so polite.

438
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,400
These were raised by my mom herself. They're delicious.

439
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,900
Here, take these two chickens and put them in the bathroom.

440
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,090
Mentor,

441
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,450
I'll put it at the corner downstairs.

442
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,230
That won't do.

443
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,890
What if someone takes it?

444
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,360
You can't buy them with money.

445
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,270
Jianming, take a seat.

446
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,310
Tian?

447
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,500
Tian, what are you doing?

448
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,940
Do you think this is a farmers' market?

449
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,010
Don't you have any work to do?

450
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,730
Jianming.

451
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,530
How is your mom?

452
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,590
She's doing well.

453
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,610
That's good.

454
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,940
Your mom was so beautiful and capable

455
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,350
when she was young.

456
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,550
She's been taking care of everything in your family these past few years.

457
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,240
Jianming, you have to be filial to your mother.

458
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Uncle, you're right.

459
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,170
Don't worry.

460
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,150
I treat my mom well.

461
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,680
That's good.

462
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,850
Here, have some water.

463
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,780
Uncle,

464
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,010
I came this time

465
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,390
to ask you for a favor.

466
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,570
Uncle, you see, it's just a small matter,

467
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,050
but her lawyer won't let it go

468
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,610
and even wants to take me to court.

469
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Do you think I should apologize?

470
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
If I do, well...

471
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
Our hometown is a small place.

472
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,270
If everyone knows about it,

473
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,630
I'll lose face.

474
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,990
But if I don't

475
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,690
and I lose the lawsuit,

476
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,110
I won't be able to afford the compensation.

477
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,190
Their lawyers

478
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,070
are Luo Yingzi and Xia Shu, right?

479
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,680
Their names are on the business cards.

480
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,030
You can't apologize.

481
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,780
But what if we lose the case?

482
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,290
Lose?

483
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,880
The word "Lose" is not in my vocabulary.

484
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,240
Let me tell you,

485
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,770
you might lose if you go to someone else.

486
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,070
But since you've come to your uncle,

487
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,440
losing is out of the question.

488
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,260
These two girls,

489
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,360
I know them

490
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,920
better than anyone.

491
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,790
Don't worry.

492
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,450
I'll handle this.

493
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,120
Great.

494
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,310
I knew my uncle would have a solution.

495
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,730
However...

496

business is business, and personal is personal.

I'll have my assistant come in,

and you can sign a agency agreement with him.

502
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,040
Don't worry about the agency fee.

503
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,550
I'll make sure they give you a discount.

504
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,010
Discount?

505
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,210
Okay, discount.

506
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,940
My uncle would never take advantage of me.

507
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,110

You don't quite understand how our society works.

We Chinese

545
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,070
Lawsuits damage relationships.

Why don't we sit down and talk things through

to clear up the misunderstandings?

548

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,610
So, what kind of genes

562
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,690
do they have in that family?

563
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Inferior genes.

564
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,380
Han must have

565
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,840
the worst genes in their family.

566
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,440
You and Xia Shu must be careful tomorrow.

567
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,490
We must.

568
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,960
Our opponent is Han.

569
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,680
Inferior Han.

570
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,550
Mr. Han.

571
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,430
You're here.

572
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
This must be Ms. Xiao.

573
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,300
You're so pretty.

574
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,190
Nice to meet you.

575
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,480
Mr. Han,

576
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,080
where's Liu Jianming?

577
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,300
Didn't you agree to meet for negotiation today?

578
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,550
He didn't come today.

579
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,160
Jianming is not like Ms. Xiao.

580
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,920
If his little shop doesn't open for a day,

581
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,520
his whole family goes without food.

582
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,380
He's fully entrusted this to me.

583
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,840
Well then, please have a seat.

584
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,250
Get them some water.

585
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,270
Have a seat.

586
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,330
Mr. Han.

587
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,880
Let's talk over here.

588
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,180
Okay.

589
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,200
Xia Shu.

590
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,880
Ying Zi, Xia Shu,

591
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,390
after you left, you didn't come back much.

592
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,640
Liangcheng Law Firm

593
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,500
is your home, after all.

594
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Mr. Han.

595
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,180
We agreed to meet today for negotiation,

596
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
but the principal didn't show up.

597
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,640
Doesn't that seem a little insincere?

598
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,400
Of course not.

599
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,900
He was terrified.

600
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,970
He's from a small town

601
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,720
and has never been involved in a lawsuit.

602
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,880
Let me put it this way.

603
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,070
He'll do anything

604
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,370
as long as it doesn't go to court.

605
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,720
That simple.

606
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,660
If he doesn't want to go to court, it's easy.

607
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,750
Our request is clear and simple.

608
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
We want Liu Jianming to delete everything

609
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,270
he has posted online

610
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,400
that slanders

611
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,590
Ms. Xiao Nannan,

612
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,880
and we want him to publicly admit

613
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,880
his mistake

614
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,070
and offer a formal apology

615
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,900
both online

616
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,720
and in real life.

617
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,150
Ms. Xiao, is this our request?

618
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,790
Yes.

619
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,990
Is it really necessary?

620
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,740
I've seen those comments too.

621
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,880
Well...

622
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,830
How old

623
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,400
were you back then?

624
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,240
It was just a joke between kids.

625
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
Do we really need to take it this seriously?

626
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
Mr. Han, Director Han,

627
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,030
is this your attitude?

628
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,090
Well then, let's not talk anymore.

629
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,760
Look at you, you're getting angry again.

630
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,550
Right?

631
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,680
You used to be short-tempered.

632
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,200
Now that you've started your own business,

633
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
you're still the same.

634
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,960
Let me tell you,

635
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,410
as a lawyer, you must have patience.

636
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,450
Without patience, you're only hurting your own clients.

637
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,510
Director Han,

638
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,040
what do you mean by saying this

639
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,510
in front of my client?

640
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm sorry.

641
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,030
I forgot that while I used to be your mentor,

642
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,790
I'm no longer one anymore.

643
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,110
I forgot for a moment

644
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,960
that you're already capable of handling things on your own.

645
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,950
Ms. Xiao,

646
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,110
Jianming

647
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,890
is terribly sorry for the harm caused to you

648
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,010
by that incident from back then.

649
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,330
But it happened

650
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,920
many years ago.

651
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,470
Do we really need to bring it up again?

652
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,640
We think

653
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,160
you should bury the past,

654
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
shake hands,

655
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,070
and become good friends.

656
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,510
Be friends? No apology？

657
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,240
You're really dreaming.

658
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,790
Mr. Han,

659
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,550
is this your final stance?

660
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,440
If it is,

661
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,790
then we won't waste any more time.

662
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,210
Look, you're angry again.

663
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
You're angry again.

664
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,590
What did I say?

665
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,350
Our attitude

666
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,030
is very sincere.

667
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,590
We hope both sides can reach an agreement

668
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,990
and understanding through negotiation.

669
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,310
Ms. Xiao,

670
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,490
I can tell

671
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,020
that you are a well-educated young woman

672
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,890
from a good family.

673
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,960
But Jianming is different.

674
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,640
He lives in a small town

675
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,110
and didn't get into university.

676
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,880
He's running a so-called phone shop,

677
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,970
just applying phone screen protectors.

678
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,200
His life...

679
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,590
Let me put it this way.

680
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,640
It isn't so bad that he's starving,

681
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,350
but if his shop closes for two days,

682
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,120
his family's livelihood will be in jeopardy.

683
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,750
When this incident happened,

684
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,500
he was really scared.

685
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,450
In that small town,

686
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,550
if he were sued

687
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,880
over this,

688
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,830
not only him,

689
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,630
but even his children would be embarrassed.

690
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,610
Who hasn't been young?

691
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,830
Who hasn't made mistakes?

692
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,690
He deeply regrets

693
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,750
what happened.

694
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,620
He's asked me many times

695
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,350
to talk to you.

696
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,750
He knows that you're a generous person

697
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,960
and wouldn't push him to the edge.

698
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,270
Edge?

699
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,400
Mr. Han.

700
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,680
As you just said,

701
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,350
in such a small town,

702
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,350
a few words

703
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,880
can quickly stir up a big fuss.

704
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,840
And your client's children

705
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,880
would be embarrassed.

706
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,790
But have you thought about the fact

707
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,750
that my client was also a child back then?

708
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,590
With years of bullying,

709
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,570
how could she possibly live a peaceful life

710
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,210
in that small county?

711
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,830
How could she not be embarrassed?

712
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
And now, we're just asking you to admit the mistake and apologize,

713
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,750
and he's being pushed to the edge?

714
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,400
We can forgive him,

715
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,550
but the premise of forgiveness

716
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,890
is that he must publicly and formally apologize.

717
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,310
I'm not authorized to promise that.

718
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,610
I-I can't agree to it right now.

719
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,590
But I don't think

720
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,750
it should be a problem.

721
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,920
However, Jianming...

722
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,920
cares about his reputation.

723
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,110
I must go back and have a proper talk with him.

724
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,550
How about this, Ms. Xiao?

725
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,890
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

726
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,880
I have an urgent case

727
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,160
I need to handle.

728
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,640
Please give me some time.

729
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,350
Once I finish that case

730
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,510
and return, I'll go back to my hometown.

731
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,270
I need to talk to Jianming properly.

732
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,090
I will try my best

733
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,500
to get him to agree to apologize.

734
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,490
Hurting such a beautiful girl

735
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,960
is a crime.

736
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,680
What do you think, Yingzi?

737
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
I think,

738
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,780
actually, it's just about conveying one message.

739
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,370
There's no need to make a special trip.

740
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,860
A phone call will be enough.

741
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,670
No.

742
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,870
I have to

743
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,400
take Ms. Xiao's request seriously.

744
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,880
Besides, I've signed

745
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,840
a formal agency agreement with him.

746
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,880
Just a casual phone call

747
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
would be too disrespectful, right?

748
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,040
Okay. How long do you need?

749
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,660
I'm just going there to collect evidence.

750
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,200
About a week would be enough.

751
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,130
Director Han,

752
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,750
please excuse us.

753
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,110
I need to talk to my client.

754
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,000
Okay. Go ahead.

755
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,830
What do you think?

756
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,880
You can choose to agree to

757
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,350
the week's time or not.

758
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,370
It's up to you.

759
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,480
Okay.

760
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,270
Are you sure?

761
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,070
Mr. Han.

762
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,400
We can wait a week,

763
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,270
but you must make it clear to Liu Jianming.

764
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,640
If he truly doesn't want this to go to court,

765
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,830
an apology is the only way out.

766
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,680
After all, he's been hurting Xiao Nannan for so many years.

767
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,770
An apology is our bottom line.

768
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,440
Is that alright?

769
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,360
No problem. No problem.

770
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,210
Alright, we won't bother you anymore.

771
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,030
We'll leave now.

772
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,920
Okay, okay.

773
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,750
Come on.

774
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,140
Let me open the door for you.

775
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,300
Please.

776
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,210
One week.

777
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,240
One week it is.

778
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,840
Ms. Xiao,

779
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,760
let's give him one more week.

780
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,790
Don't worry.

781
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,400
We'll keep an eye on them.

782
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,030
After a week,

783
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,000
whether it's a negotiation or going to court,

784
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,030
we hope

785
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,720
you can stand firm in your position.

786
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,070
Xia Shu.

787
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,040
Take Ms. Xiao back now.

788
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,920
I have some business to handle.

789
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,220
Okay.

790
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,260
Ms. Xiao, let's go.

791
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,550
Mentor,

792
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,700
when are we going to eat?

793
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,960
All you know is eating.

794
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Just focus on your study.

795
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,870
Although you were dumped,

796
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,200
you still need to eat.

797
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,250
Who was dumped?

798
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,690
I don't love anyone.

799
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,470
I only love myself.

800
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,210
Fang Rui.

801
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,550
Ms. Luo, you're here.

802
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,960
Hello, Mr. Chen.

803
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,510
What are you busy with, Mr. Chen?

804
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm busy with a case.

805
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,510
Ms. Luo, come in.

806
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,640
Please have a seat.

807
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,880
Fang Rui,

808
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,860
is that aunt of yours your real aunt?

809
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,370
How come she introduced you to him?

810
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,510
Isn't my mentor quite nice?

811
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,140
Yeah, your mentor is quite nice.

812
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
I'm delivering a file.

813
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,830
Take your time.

814
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,970
Unscrupulous Chen,

815
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:13,180
why did you leave the case midway

816
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,240
and disappear?

817
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,070
You just left.

818
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
As long as you're capable.

819
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,270
You don't need anyone else.

820
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,980
You know what?

821
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,760
Liu Jianming entrusted the case to Han.

822
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,000
So isn't it only right that I don't show up?

823
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,000
This case now

824
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,320
conflicts with our firm's interests.

825
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,440
You're being sarcastic.

826
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,350
What's wrong with you?

827
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,210
Nothing. Just a bit tired.

828
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,050
When I came in just now,

829
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,370
I saw your face looked off.

830
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,670
Are you sick?

831
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,450
No.

832
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,950
I'm far from dying.

833
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,200
Alright.

834
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,750
I came today to accompany Xiao Nannan

835
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,240
to negotiate with Han.

836
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,830
I stopped by to see you.

837
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,140
Thank you.

838
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,270
You're welcome.

839
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,600
I wasn't right in how I talked to you

840
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,240
the other day.

841
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,040
Don't take it to heart.

842
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,180
It's fine, I didn't take it to heart.

843
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,510
Chen Shuo, are you okay?

844
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,660
I'm fine.

845
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
Well then,

846
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,960
drink more water.

847
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,200
I'll be leaving.

848
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,030
I'm leaving. Bye.

849
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,920
Bye.

850
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
How can I get along with her?

851
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,710
We're not meant to be.

852
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,030
S-She's left?

853
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,770
Don't say anything.

854
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,469
Don't ask anything.

855
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,860
I don't want to hear anything.

856
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,840
Wait, Mentor, what kind of attitude is that?

857
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,080
Ms. Luo obviously came over to make peace.

858
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
How can you be in a relationship like this?

859
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,090
What's wrong with that?

860
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,730
The point of dating

861
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,000
is to

862
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
advance when the enemy retreats, retreat when the enemy advances,

863
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,389
disturb them when they're stationary, and strike when they're vulnerable.

864
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,360
Only with these moves

865
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,980
does dating become meaningful.

866
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,489
These moves?

867
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
Fang Rui, when it comes to dating,

868
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,960
in my eyes, you're just a rookie.

869
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,239
Who are you showing off to?

870
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,280
Mentor,

871
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,110
when it comes to lawsuits, you're my mentor.

872
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,510
But when it comes to dating,

873
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,150
you have to listen to me.

874
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,710
Anyway, this is my analysis.

875
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,000
You and Ms. Luo

876
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,840
are about to take a big step forward.

877
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,219
Stay calm.

878
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,670
A big step forward?

879
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,230
Forget it, I don't want to think about it. It's too tiring.

880
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,840
Making money is much better.

881
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,340
See?

882
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,010
As soon as I mentioned money, it came.

883
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,400
Hello, Judge Lin.

884
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,340
Really? Already?

885
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,860
Thank you.

886
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm hanging up.

887
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,420
As soon as I mentioned money, it came.

888
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,000
What money is this?

889
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,230
The first batch of the enforcement payment, 20 million, has been credited.

890
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,990
Really?

891
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,780
The court is that efficient this time?

892
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,910
20 million?

893
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,890
Got it, got it, I see.

894
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,080
Bye.

895
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,700
I want to see Ms. Fang.

896
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,070
Ms. Fang is inside.

897
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,720
Please come in.

898
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,610
Thank you.

899
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,240
Mr. Han.

900
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,070
The 20 million has been credited.

901
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,870
However,

902
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,280
this is just the first batch of enforcement payment.

903
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,670
It's already going very well, Chen Shuo.

904
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,780
It's all thanks to you.

905
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,070
Are you busy?

906
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,550
I'll come back in...

907
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,420
What is it, Han?

908
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,440
Well...

909
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,030
Come in.

910
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,160
Just tell me.

911
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,060
Come in, Mr. Han.

912
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,360
Mr. Chen is here too.

913
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,550
Well, I...

914
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,290
What is it?

915
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm here to tell you good news.

916
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,880
You have good news, Mr. Han?

917
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,780
What is it?

918
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,590
The first enforcement payment for Mingshan has arrived.

919
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,440
It's a total of 20 million.

920
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,620
Nice job, Mr. Han.

921
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,040
You're really well-informed.

922
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,070
Of course.

923
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,010
Mr. Chen

924
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,400
just told me about it.

925
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,590
I already know it.

926
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,640
I'm a step ahead of you.

927
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,230
You both know already?

928
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,890
My channels for information

929
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,110
are just so-so,

930
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,860
right?

931
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,500
Mr. Han.

932
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,920
When we were at the court,

933
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,570
I left my phone number.

934
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,520
This news

935
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,210
came straight from Judge Lin just now.

936
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,590
Where did you get your information from?

937
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,110
Well...

938
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,990
Ms. Fang,

939
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,010
I have to talk to you about this.

940
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,070
I wouldn't say I put in all my effort

941
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,590
for the Mingshan case,

942
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,440
but I worked really hard.

943
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,090
Although this case

944
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,230
was mainly handled by Mr. Chen,

945
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,940
I've been involved from the contract stage,

946
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,190
overseeing everything.

947
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,810
I used so many of my eyes and ears to keep watch.

948
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
I was afraid they might try something.

949
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,860
So, as soon as the money came in,

950
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,200
I knew about it immediately

951
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,550
and came to report it to you right away.

952
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,280
Right?

953
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,350
And then?

954
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,230
And then?

955
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,600
And then? Just tell me.

956
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,660
And...

957
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,630
I was too focused on reporting.

958
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,820
Mr. Fang,

959
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,360
here's the thing.

960
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,310
For this case,

961
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,070
I've used all the connections I've built

962
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,460
over the years.

963
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,960
But I'm only getting 20% of the commission.

964
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,190
I've spent all that money on the process.

965
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,400
It's not enough. It's a huge loss.

966
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,570
Han,

967
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,110
do you know why Minghai Group Group

968
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,960
suddenly obediently transferred

969
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,770
this enforcement payment?

970
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,590
We won the case.

971
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,590
And the court was especially efficient this time.

972
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,510
Not entirely, right?

973
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,660
There's also Chen Shuo's contribution, right?

974
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,230
Mr. Chen, tell us.

975
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,680
Forget it, I only did some little things.

976
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,960
No, no, no, please tell us.

977
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,030
It's not worth mentioning, really.

978
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,900
Come on, just say it.

979
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,830
Well, if you insist.

980
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,680
Here's the thing.

981
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,950
I also used some of my connections

982
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,590
and found out that there was a piece of land

983
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,930
belonging to Minghai

984
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,800
that hadn't been sealed.

985
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,910
So, I quickly provided this information

986
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,960
to the court.

987
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,280
The court then planned to force the auction of the land,

988
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,630
and Qianhai had no choice

989
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,850
but to pay back the money.

990
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Just that.

991
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,000
I probably sound like I'm taking credit now, huh?

992
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,430
No, no, no.

993
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,440
Mr. Chen is indeed capable.

994
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,550
You flatter me.

995
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,760
Chen Shuo,

996
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,040
your main job now

997
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,400
is to quickly go find Mingshan Group

998
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,030
and make sure we get the money

999
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,000
we're owed.

1000
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,590
Because I'm afraid something might go wrong at this point.

1001
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,160
I know.

1002
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,760
I'm keeping an eye on it. I'll take care of it.

1003
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,610
I've already made an appointment with Sun Mingshan.

1004
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,810
This money

1005
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,670
is still in the joint account, right?

1006
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,290
Yes.

1007
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,550
They can't take it out

1008
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,840
without our consent.

1009
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,920
Then have a good talk with them

1010
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,820
and tell them to strictly follow the agreement.

1011
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,070
If anything comes up,

1012
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,960
report it to the firm promptly.

1013
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,360
Don't worry, Ms. Fang.

1014
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,230
I'm going to work hard on it.

1015
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,230
Mr. Han, be generous.

1016
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,320
Thank you for your hard work.

1017
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,110
Not at all.

1018
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,910
It's just a piece of land,

1019
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,180
and you're acting so smug about it.

1020
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,020
Well, you need to find the land first before you can act smug.

1021
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,220
Han,

1022
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,030
as a man,

1023
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,100
why are you being so petty now?

1024
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,030
Speaking so sarcastically.

1025
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,460
So boring.

1026
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,840
Really?

1027
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,870
Look at Chen Shuo,

1028
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,880
and then look at you.

1029
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,790
As you know,

1030
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,360
Mingshan Group

1031
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,650
has only received the first batch of enforcement payments.

1032
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,000
You won't get your full 20%

1033
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,490
until all the debts are cleared.

1034
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,460
Don't you have a lot of eyes and ears?

1035
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,840
Get back to work.

1036
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
Find out

1037
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
what Minghai Group is planning next.

1038
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,480
That's the most important thing, okay?

1039
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,100
Didn't he find a piece of land?

1040
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,280
I'll just find a piece of building.

1041
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,360
"A piece of building?" A building!

1042
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,360
Come on.

1043
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,590
Sir, your guest is here.

1044
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,910
Mr. Wang.

1045
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,780
Thank you for coming.

1046
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,110
Mr. Han,

1047
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,190
what did we say?

1048
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,250
Although I don't represent Minghai,

1049
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,230
this is a case of our firm after all.

1050
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,440
If others find out

1051
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,760
I've been leaking information to you,

1052
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,410
I won't be able to continue as a lawyer.

1053
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,880
Who else knows?

1054
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,930
Besides, you didn't even participate in this case.

1055
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,550
What could you possibly be leaking to me?

1056
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,320
Mr. Wang,

1057
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,920
the risk I took for you in the last case

1058
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,380
was much bigger than this one.

1059
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,290
Alright, go ahead.

1060
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,580
What else do you want to know?

1061
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,270
The next move of Mingshan and Minghai.

1062
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,670
Minghai has already

1063
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,710
had 20 million enforced by the court.

1064
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,490
Don't they have any next steps?

1065
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,590
Are they just waiting

1066
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,400
to be enforced again?

1067
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,510
Of course not.

1068
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,320
Minghai is no longer the same Minghai as before.

1069
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,450
Now it's a pillar industry in the city.

1070
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,360
As far as I know,

1071
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,400
these two companies are already sitting at the negotiation table.

1072
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,320
So soon?

1073
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,780
It was decided a few days ago.

1074
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,840
At first, Minghai acted all high and mighty,

1075
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,050
and that's why Mingshan asked the court to enforce the 20 million.

1076
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,800
Minghai was severely hit,

1077
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,870
so now they're sitting down at the negotiation table.

1078
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,880
I see.

1079
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
Now that they're at the negotiation table,

1080
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,670
how much does Minghai need to pay back?

1081
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,280
The principal plus the penalty

1082
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,820
amounts to over 70 million.

1083
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,710
I heard them say

1084
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,320
the goal is to keep the repayment rate

1085
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,840
at 50%.

1086
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,870
But they think Mingshan probably won't agree.

1087
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,530
So they want to push it down to 70%.

1088
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,190
70%?

1089
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,510
So, they plan to only pay back the principal of the goods,

1090
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,090
but not the penalty?

1091
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I guess so.

1092
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,520
I see.

1093
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,960
Thank you.

1094
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,880
Here, have some tea.

1095
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,550
Mr. Han.

1096
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,670
I think the agreement

1097
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,760
you signed with Mingshan back then

1098
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,960
was really cruel.

1099
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,120
You asked for tens of millions in agency fees for one case.

1100
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,650
Which company would be willing to accept that?
