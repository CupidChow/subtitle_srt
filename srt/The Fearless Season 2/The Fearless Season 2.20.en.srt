[Mr. Tao]

4
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,710
Hello, Mr. Tao.

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,840
Chen Shuo.

6
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,400
What time is it? What are you doing?

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,440
Why aren't you here yet?

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
I heard you won the first trial of that case.

9
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,780
You think you can make a lot of money and want to quit?

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,490
What else is there to do, right?

11
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,750
It's all about making money.

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,600
Boring.

13
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,780
How can you say that?

14
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,350
Come over quickly.

15
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,130
I'm short-handed on Wanhe's case.

16
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,860
Join my team.

17
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,560
Mr. Tao, thanks for the offer.

18
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,490
But I want to take a break.

19
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,170
I'm a little tired.

20
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,310
Can't you take a break after finishing this case

21
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,970
for me?

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,480
I'm in trouble.

23
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,520
Who else can I turn to?

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,290
Hurry up.

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,800
Who do you think I am?

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,410
Do I have to take every case?

27
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,680
Go. When they come,

28
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,200
take the consultation fee and send them away.

29
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,370
Mentor,

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,190
I've already promised them

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,360
we'd take this case.

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,100
Just because you promised, I have to take it?

33
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,940
Do you think I'm like you?

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,190
Taking all the cases that come to you?

35
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,740
Enjoying the show, huh?

36
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,370
Mentor, when did you get here?

37
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,930
Been here for a while, watching you slack off.

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,280
No, I...

39
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,590
Look at them.

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,070
I should treat you like Mr. Han

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,980
treats Tian,

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,480
then you'd improve faster.

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,260
Yes.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Mr. Tao wants to see me. I'm going up.

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,350
Okay.

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,410
Wipe the milk off your mouth.

47
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,220
Get back to work.

48
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,800
Come in.

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,020
Ms. Fang.

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,690
Discussing something?

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,380
Finished.

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,490
Go ahead.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,790
Come in. Have a seat.

54
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,800
Did I interrupt?

55
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,550
No.

56
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,280
We were just discussing some management issues at the firm.

57
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,470
Have some tea.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
No, no, no, don't bother.

59
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,620
Congratulations.

60
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,000
For what?

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,620
We've worked half our lives,

62
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,290
but you earn more in one case than we do.

63
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,430
Everyone has good days.

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,420
I just got lucky.

65
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,950
Well, you called me this morning,

66
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,230
said you had a case for me.

67
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,250
Your team is full of talents,

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,360
excellent ones.

69
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,220
Do you even need me?

70
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,240
What have you been up to lately?

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,960
Not much, just thinking about taking a break.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,070
Turn your face.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,510
You do look a bit off.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,040
Although I'm short-handed on that case,

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,900
I can find someone else.

76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,780
How about this?

77
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,550
You take a good rest

78
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,470
and recuperate.

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,640
Thanks for understanding.

80
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,930
I'm leaving.

81
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,920
Won't disturb you.

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,600
-Bye.
-Bye.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,190
Take care.

84
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,920
Okay.

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,230
Mr. Chen.

86
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,240
Shuo, Shuo.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
Could you do me a favor?

88
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,760
A favor? Sure, go ahead.

89
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,930
Take a case.

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,670
What?

91
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,310
How is taking a case a favor?

92
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,280
That's you letting me make money.

93
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,960
I should thank you.

94
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,340
Yes.

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,020
What's this?

96
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,190
It's the case that Han didn't take, right?

97
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,480
You're handing me a mess.

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
Am I right?

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,270
No, no, come in first.

100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,040
Come in.

101
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,950
See? I knew it.

102
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,040
You wouldn't think of me for good things.

103
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,300
Shuo,

104
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,000
let me tell you about the case first.

105
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,510
It's a female client.

106
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,990
She suffered from school bullying.

107
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,630
I thought it's a hot topic now.

108
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,070
Besides, I was bullied

109
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,400
when I was a kid.

110
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,680
So I took it.

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,440
I thought my mentor would guide me.

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
Now the client is about to come.

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,320
He won't take it. What do I do?

114
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,710
School bullying cases are tough.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,000
How bad was it?

116
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,080
Injuries? Disabilities?

117
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,740
None.

118
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,320
It's a ten-year-old case,

119
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,490
mainly verbal abuse.

120
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,120
A ten-year-old case,

121
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,159
and just verbal abuse.

122
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,690
Well,

123
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,490
no one would want to take that.

124
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,990
Maybe you should explain to them

125
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,630
and turn it down.

126
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,530
Shuo, I made big promises

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,960
to the client.

128
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,360
Besides, my mentor told me to charge

129
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,830
a 2,000 yuan consultation fee.

130
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,620
Wait, wait a minute.

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,210
So your mentor won't show up.

132
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,520
He let you meet the client

133
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,070
and ask for 2,000 yuan consultation fee.

134
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,630
Your mentor is so harsh.

135
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,210
Shuo.

136
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,180
Fine.

137
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,940
I'll go take a look later.

138
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,040
I can try hard to explain this.

139
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,950
But I'm telling you,

140
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,140
I can't guarantee I'll get you the 2,000 yuan.

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,250
No, Shuo.

142
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,680
Shuo.

143
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,380
Don't.

144
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,390
Why are you on your knees?

145
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,350
No, no, no. Don't do this.

146
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,100
Shuo, considering I've

147
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,400
helped you before...

148
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,480
You're guilt-tripping me.

149
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,370
Because you helped me,

150
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
you want me to cover the money for you,

151
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,510
right?

152
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,480
If you insist,

153
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,860
I won't refuse.

154
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,930
Tian, you...

155
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,300
Mr. Yang, Ms. Xiao.

156
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,830
This is Chen Shuo.

157
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,830
He's a senior lawyer at our firm.

158
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,920
Hello, I'm Chen Shuo.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,630
Hello, Mr. Chen.

160
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,159
Hello.

161
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,630
Mr. Yang, Ms. Xiao.

162
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,500
Have a seat.

163
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,950
Let me introduce,

164
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,320
this is my assistant, Fang Rui.

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,190
Tian briefly

166
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,390
told me earlier that

167
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,310
you two have some legal matters

168
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
to consult about, is that right?

169
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Yes, we'd like to consult.

170
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,020
If someone has been a victim of school bullying,

171
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,880
can they still seek legal help now?

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
It depends on the actual situation.

173
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,630
How long ago was it?

174
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,490
Ten years.

175
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,810
Ten years is really a long time.

176
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
The victim...

177
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,230
must be Ms. Xiao.

178
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,230
[School Bullying Victim, Xiao Nannan]

179
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,310
I wonder if it's convenient for you

180
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,480
to briefly tell us about

181
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,040
the bullying experience.

182
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Again?

183
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,000
Well,

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,210
we already talked about it with Mr. Tian.

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,080
Here's the thing.

186
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,510
Mr. Chen

187
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,390
has more experience

188
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,720
and seniority than I do.

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,630
I haven't told him

190
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,390
about your experiences.

191
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
I thought it would

192
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,870
be better to meet

193
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,990
and discuss in detail.

194
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes, I'd like to know more too.

195
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,380
Maybe we should just leave.

196
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,830
Ms. Xiao,

197
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,240
if you have any concerns,

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
how about this?

199
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,790
You can leave us

200
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,030
and let Mr. Yang tell us.

201
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,120
Nannan,

202
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,970
why don't you get in the car first?

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
I'll talk to Mr. Chen.

204
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,800
Mr. Chen,

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,960
we know that

206
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,470
what happened ten years ago

207
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
with no physical damage

208
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
might be hard to pursue,

209
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,820
but we have to try.

210
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,220
Why is that?

211
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
We've been in a relationship for five years,

212
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,550
but we can't get married.

213
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,940
Nannan is afraid of people;

214
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,060
she can't even go to crowded places.

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,150
You saw her just now.

216
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,340
She seems fine,

217
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,190
but she's very insecure.

218
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,950
She can't even look people in the eye.

219
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,180
And she often has auditory hallucinations and illusions.

220
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,870
Whenever I mention marriage,

221
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,490
her symptoms get worse.

222
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,350
We've been to psychological counseling.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,070
The psychologist believes

224
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,200
the root of her issues

225
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,870
lies in the trauma from

226
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,800
the school bullying.

227
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,310
To solve her current psychological problems,

228
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,280
we first need to address the past.

229
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,160
That's why we're here.

230
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,560
What did Ms. Xiao experience back then?

231
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,150
Rich girl, rich girl!

232
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,290
Look, the rich girl is here!

233
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,990
Rich girl, come here, come here!

234
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,700
Check out the rich girl's quotes!

235
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,880
That's right.

236
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,360
You must be sick!

237
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,870
Stop pretending to be pitiful!

238
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,960
Get back to Jingbei!

239
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,080
Psycho!

240
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,610
Psycho!

241
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,990
Mr. Yang, here's the thing。

242
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,910
School bullying

243
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,980
is indeed a very harsh behavior.

244
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Currently,

245
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,270
apart from the Ministry of Education's

246
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,440
comprehensive management plan for bullying

247
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,960
among primary and secondary school students,

248
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,290
there's no specific law in our country.

249
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
If bullying

250
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
caused physical harm,

251
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,670
we could refer to the Civil Law,

252
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,790
the Public Security Administration Punishment Law,

253
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,150
or the Juvenile Protection Law.

254
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,140
For more severe cases,

255
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,750
it could fall under

256
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,000
the Criminal Law.

257
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,510
But if there was no

258
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,120
actual physical harm,

259
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,790
asserting rights against the bullies

260
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,010
is indeed difficult.

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,260
There are also issues like the statute of

262
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,040
limitations and evidence.

263
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,430
Regarding your girlfriend's case,

264
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,860
if she

265
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,510
had reported,

266
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,870
filed a police report, or sued

267
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,270
at the time of the bullying,

268
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,570
things might be different.

269
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,680
But now,

270
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,030
after ten years,

271
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,190
it's been so long.

272
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,080
We need to gather evidence

273
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,550
of her being bullied back then—

274
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,270
whether we can find it is one problem,

275
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,510
and whether the statute of limitations

276
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,270
has expired is another.

277
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,360
These are all considerations.

278
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,060
It's quite complicated.

279
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,230
I think so too,

280
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,180
but her symptoms are severe.

281
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,660
We really don't know what to do.

282
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,150
As a lawyer,

283
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,720
thinking from your perspective,

284
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,230
it's indeed quite a dilemma.

285
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,870
As I mentioned,

286
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,910
as lawyers,

287
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,450
we have a lot to consider,

288
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,050
and it's indeed challenging.

289
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,200
Mr. Yang,

290
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,270
how about this?

291
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,030
You and Ms. Xiao go back first,

292
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
[Send Mr. Yang off later. Tell him to wait for me downstairs.]

293
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
[Chen Shuo]

294
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,540
and wait for our news.

295
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll carefully think about it

296
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,750
and see if there's any legal remedy

297
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,720
to help solve your problem.

298
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,360
I'll inform you

299
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
of any progress, okay?

300
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,110
Okay.

301
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,030
Tian, is there anything else

302
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,740
you need to add?

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Mr. Chen, about the consultation fee...

304
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,070
It's free.

305
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,240
You trust us

306
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,200
and shared your private matters

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,270
with us.

308
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,440
I appreciate your trust.

309
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,870
Thank you.

310
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,960
You're welcome.

311
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,630
Sorry for taking your time.

312
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,120
Not at all.

313
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,390
See you next time, okay?

314
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

315
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,630
See them out for me.

316
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,080
Okay.

317
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
Mr. Yang, this way please.

318
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,060
Thank you.

319
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,150
Mr. Chen,

320
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,730
what do you mean?

321
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,400
Well,

322
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,290
they brought up the consultation fee,

323
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,030
but you insisted on not taking it.

324
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,670
How am I supposed to explain that to my mentor?

325
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,190
Explain to your mentor?

326
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
He's not my mentor.

327
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,090
Well, Mr. Chen,

328
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,840
you promised me earlier.

329
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,600
Did I guarantee you?

330
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
Did I say I'd get the money for you?

331
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,640
Look at how miserable

332
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,320
that couple is, right?

333
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,030
How could you ask for the consultation fee?

334
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,270
I'm miserable too.

335
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,390
Are you afraid your mentor will

336
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,480
scold you over those 2,000 yuan?

337
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,240
Yes.

338
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,020
Here, look.

339
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,210
I transferred it to you.

340
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,570
2,000 yuan, sent.

341
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,670
Shuo.

342
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,630
Cut it out.

343
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,440
You play nice after I transferred the money.

344
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,110
No...

345
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,720
And a totally different attitude before that, huh?

346
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,290
No, Shuo.

347
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,090
I didn't mean that.

348
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,640
2,000 yuan.

349
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,140
You can arrange it like this.

350
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
Tell your mentor

351
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,670
you got 1,000 yuan for the consultation fee.

352
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,340
With your skills, asking for 2,000,

353
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,430
your mentor wouldn't believe it anyway.

354
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,200
Use the other 1,000 to buy food.

355
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,230
Take care, Shuo.

356
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,070
Cut it out, Tian.

357
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,010
Shuo.

358
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,250
Rich man.

359
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,360
This is my mentor's business card,

360
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,380
with his phone number on it.

361
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,790
If it's convenient for you,

362
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,080
can I add you on WeChat?

363
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,600
Sure.

364
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,970
Okay, it's done.

365
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,390
I'll head off now.

366
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,870
Wait a second.

367
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,870
Mr. Chen asked you

368
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,790
to wait for him here for a bit.

369
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,500
Okay.

370
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,630
Mr. Chen.

371
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,990
Mr. Yang.

372
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,390
Sorry to keep you waiting.

373
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm sorry.

374
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,840
There are some things that I can't say up there.

375
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,270
Let's talk down here, okay?

376
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,830
Okay.

377
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,750
To be honest,

378
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,370
it's not convenient for me

379
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,780
to take this case.

380
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,390
While we were

381
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,630
talking upstairs,

382
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,780
I noticed your girlfriend

383
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,170
is very sensitive.

384
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,050
Yes.

385
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,930
She just had a breakdown.

386
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,250
Since she's a girl

387
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,270
who's suffered so much before,

388
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,510
having her tell

389
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,370
those experiences to a man like me

390
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,040
might cause her psychological barriers.

391
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes.

392
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,440
I have a suggestion.

393
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,690
I have a good friend,

394
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,800
a female lawyer, very capable.

395
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,800
I'd like to introduce

396
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,040
your situation to her

397
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,880
and see if she's willing to be your agent.

398
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,910
Of course, it's a two-way choice,

399
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,510
depending on your willingness too.

400
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,510
I just talked with Nannan.

401
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,060
She said

402
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
maybe we should give up.

403
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,200
It's been so many years.

404
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,960
She's afraid of stirring up trouble

405
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,750
and feels guilty about

406
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,150
confronting those people again.

407
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,620
You feel guilty?

408
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,570
Why think like that?

409
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
They bullied

410
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,070
and hurt her first.

411
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,690
Isn't it the right thing to ask for justice?

412
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,240
Right?

413
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,630
Yes.

414
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,000
And I remember you said

415
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,380
you've seen a psychologist, right?

416
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,930
What the psychologist said is correct.

417
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,190
In fact, the process of seeking legal help

418
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,520
is also a process of healing for her.

419
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,720
You surely want her to get better quickly, right?

420
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,840
Of course, I do.

421
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,840
But...

422
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,910
Then what's there to hesitate about?

423
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,850
I'll make the decision for you.

424
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,070
Wait for my call.

425
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,720
I'll notify you immediately

426
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,840
if there's any progress, okay?

427
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,050
Okay, thank you so much.

428
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,120
You're welcome.

429
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,920
One more thing I need to remind you.

430
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Today you came to our firm

431
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,470
to see me,

432
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,790
but due to some circumstances,

433
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm transferring this case to someone else.

434
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,520
Make sure the firm doesn't know, understand?

435
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,150
Yes.

436
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,240
Alright, thank you.

437
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Okay, thank you, Mr. Chen.

438
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,960
No problem.

439
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,020
[Yinghua Law Firm]

440
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,620
Hello, Qiu Hua.

441
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
Hello, Yingzi.

442
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,190
I didn't go today.

443
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,600
Did Mr. Xu say anything?

444
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,320
Nothing.

445
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,440
Okay.

446
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,850
That's good.

447
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,470
I'll sleep a bit more.

448
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,770
I'll leave it to you over there, bye.

449
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,410
Bye.

450
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,080
Luo Yingzi.

451
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,440
Who? Who is it?

452
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,300
Chen Shuo.

453
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,510
Why are you here?

454
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,510
What are you holding all that stuff for?

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,200
Bringing some warmth.

456
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,450
Bringing warmth?

457
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,870
Listen,

458
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,000
don't think a little thing like that

459
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,910
can soothe my inner pain.

460
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,310
I'm still angry.

461
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,480
It was just a couple of reminders yesterday.

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,640
What big deal?

463
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,070
Cover up. It's cold

464
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,630
in your room.

465
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,030
Didn't go to Xu Zhuo's today?

466
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,230
Who dares to go?

467
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,069
Who knows what kind of

468
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,790
gossip versions there'll be if I go again.

469
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,560
I don't dare.

470
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,310
Haven't eaten yet, right?

471
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,270
Not yet.

472
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,560
Shall I cook you some noodles?

473
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,240
Are you teasing me again?

474
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,680
Are you going to say

475
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,240
Mr. Xu cooked instant noodles for me?

476
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm telling you, I'm still not over my anger.

477
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,270
Watch what you say.

478
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,520
What I want to say is,

479
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,160
he definitely wouldn't know how to make it my way.

480
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,510
I'll make it for you with milk.

481
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,440
I've only had milk baths,

482
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,880
never milk noodles.

483
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,740
Alright, go ahead and make it for me.

484
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,750
Listen,

485
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,140
if it doesn't taste good, I'll kill you.

486
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,130
I'm afraid after eating it, you'll love me to death.

487
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,950
Love who to death?

488
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,030
I'll slap you to death.

489
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,020
I like your feistiness.

490
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,240
Slap me to death.

491
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,290
Save some electricity on the induction cooker,

492
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,510
it's prone to tripping.

493
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,750
Got it, cheapskate.

494
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,750
Righteous Luo.

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,590
The unscrupulous cuisine is ready.

496
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,310
Come out.

497
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,880
You cooked the noodles for me.

498
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,030
Why didn't you bring them over to me?

499
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,550
I had to come over myself.

500
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,550
Not sincere enough.

501
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

502
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,100
Alright, I'll give it a try.

503
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,320
You didn't put anything in the noodles

504
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,780
besides milk, did you?

505
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,310
All the ingredients are there, see for yourself.

506
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,310
If I get sick from eating this,

507
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,480
I'm blaming you.

508
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,400
Fine, I'll take care of you for the rest of your life.

509
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,590
Listen, I haven't eaten yet, don't gross me out.

510
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,550
Not enough for me to eat.

511
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,750
Love me to death now?

512
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,690
Skip the sausage.

513
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,760
I'm on a diet.

514
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,830
You can go now.

515
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,160
What, are you waiting to wash the dishes

516
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,200
after I finish eating?

517
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,400
Do you have to be so harsh?

518
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,500
Kill the donkey after it's done working?

519
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,640
I didn't say anything.

520
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,270
You called yourself a donkey.

521
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,880
Where did you

522
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,660
learn these little tricks like cooking noodles

523
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,790
with milk?

524
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,790
How many girls have you used them on?

525
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,720
What tricks?

526
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,620
I used sincerity

527
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,030
and love to make it for you.

528
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,310
How many girls have you

529
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,310
used your sincerity and love on?

530
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,480
Alright, let's talk business, seriously.

531
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
I have a case to introduce to you.

532
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,460
The client is looking for a female lawyer.

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,680
What kind of case specifically needs a female lawyer?

534
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,270
A school bullying case from ten years ago.

535
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,670
Ten years ago?

536
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,720
Physical harm?

537
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,460
No, just psychological.

538
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,920
Are you kidding me?

539
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,920
Who wasn't bullied by other kids when they were young?

540
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,720
I have psychological scars too.

541
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,000
Let's all sue then.

542
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,200
Now running to the court to sue.

543
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,310
What's the court supposed to do?

544
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,750
Should it even stay open?

545
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,440
Unscrupulous Chen,

546
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,240
you've made so much money.

547
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,070
Why are you suddenly introducing me to this kind of case?

548
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,550
Is there a profit to be made?

549
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,640
You must be trying to squeeze something out of me, right?

550
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,000
I knew it.

551
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,070
Good thing I didn't fall for your trap.

552
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,240
You call me Unscrupulous Chen,

553
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,480
thinking I'm unscrupulous. It's fine.

554
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,880
But Righteous Luo, let me ask you,

555
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,400
why do you think

556
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,830
a school bullying case from ten years ago

557
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,200
is normal?

558
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,440
Why is the person

559
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,790
seeking justice for what happened back then

560
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,110
just stirring up trouble?

561
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,550
Aren't you called Righteous Luo?

562
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,710
Where's your sense of justice?

563
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,310
Do you know

564
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,070
what kind of damage this has done

565
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,310
to the person involved?

566
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,810
Ten years have passed,

567
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,160
and she's still suffering.

568
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,160
She's afraid to get married

569
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,270
or make new friends.

570
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
Isn't all this terrifying?

571
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,350
Don't you want to seek justice for her?

572
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,740
Then why call yourself Righteous Luo?

573
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,550
You always have the moral high ground.

574
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,400
Justice is always on your side.

575
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,730
Hearing you say these things today,

576
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
I'm really disappointed.

577
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,920
Forget I came.

578
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,930
I didn't say any of those things.

579
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,260
Sorry for wasting your time.

580
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
No, wait,

581
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,440
you didn't tell me the whole story.

582
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,960
Unscrupulous Chen.

583
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,400
Chen Shuo.

584
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,480
Chen Shuo.

585
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,230
Chen Shuo.

586
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm sorry.

587
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm used to joking around with you

588
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
all the time.

589
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,350
I apologize for my

590
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,750
earlier attitude.

591
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,640
No need.

592
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,480
Well...

593
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,960
When has Righteous Luo ever been wrong?

594
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,510
I'm serious with you.

595
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't be mad.

596
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,520
We're good friends, right?

597
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,260
So, are you still willing

598
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,720
to introduce them to me?

599
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,920
Let me think about it.

600
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,590
I'll let you know later.

601
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,360
Showing off.

602
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,440
Okay, I'll send it to you later.

603
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,300
You're here, mentor.

604
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,070
Finished with work?

605
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,680
Help me schedule a meeting with Mr. Yang

606
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
and Ms. Xiao tomorrow.

607
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,500
I'll send you the time and place later.

608
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,880
Not at our firm.

609
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,840
Where to?

610
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,570
Yinghua Law Firm.

611
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,920
Mentor, you're really playing

612
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,920
a big game for Ms. Luo.

613
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,790
What else can I do?

614
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,770
For her,

615
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,960
I have to put in some effort

616
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,040
and strategy.

617
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,220
Also,

618
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,080
this case was transfered from our firm.

619
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,210
So, you must...

620
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Keep it confidential.

621
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,160
Smart.

622
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,070
And don't tell your aunt.

623
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,550
I won't.

624
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,130
Mr. Hao, seriously?

625
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,280
You came to pick me up personally.

626
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,720
You helped me get back millions.

627
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
I definitely need to welcome you properly.

628
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,880
What's really going on?

629
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,640
I need to get back to the firm.

630
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,410
I've run into some trouble.

631
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
I need to talk to you.

632
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,070
Okay.

633
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,000
You don't know,

634
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,270
Zhang Lan is hiding and won't see anyone.

635
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,750
I can only work on Ms. Ma and Mr. Yang.

636
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,680
They hold four and five percent

637
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,790
of the shares respectively.

638
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,270
No matter which one I win over,

639
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,510
I can ensure

640
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,170
a smooth victory at the shareholders' meeting.

641
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,350
Mr. Hao,

642
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,030
all you have left now is

643
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,440
to spend money to buy shares.

644
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,070
It's none of my business.

645
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,250
Why not?

646
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,170
Negotiations and agreements

647
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,630
need a lawyer present.

648
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,930
Moreover, our company's legal counsel

649
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,480
is from my uncle's side.

650
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,100
I can't be without someone.

651
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,600
I've been on the train all night

652
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,160
and I'm exhausted.

653
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,970
Please send me back to the law firm as soon as possible.

654
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,680
Let's talk about this later.

655
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,820
Get some rest if you're tired.

656
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,640
This car is suitable for sleeping anyway.

657
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,510
Here?

658
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,400
Who sleeps here with you?

659
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,310
Send me back now.

660
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,320
Alright.

661
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,000
I guess

662
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,390
you'll be taking this car less and less.

663
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,000
What do you mean?

664
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,830
To buy shares,

665
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,550
I'll need tens of millions at least.

666
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,680
Besides, my uncle and younger uncle

667
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,570
are deliberately causing trouble at the mine,

668
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,480
stopping workers' wages

669
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,220
and blaming it all on me.

670
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,820
Now I have to

671
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,510
use my own money to cover the costs.

672
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,030
So this car

673
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,940
might have to be sold some day.

674
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,460
Ms. Xia, can you help me

675
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,480
with the shares?

676
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,920
I can't help.

677
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,020
Helping would be working for free.

678
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,810
But I can be hired.

679
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,570
Ms. Xia,

680
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,450
you help me with the shares,

681
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,400
help me rise to power,

682
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,880
and I promise you,

683
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,480
all legal issues for Xincheng Mining

684
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,740
will be yours to handle.

685
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,790
How about that?

686
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,110
Really?

687
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,390
Of course.

688
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,110
You can't go back on your word.

689
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,720
But

690
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,280
I have one more condition.

691
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,990
Can I pay

692
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,350
part of the fee in advance?

693
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,270
I need to buy shares

694
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,870
and pay the workers.

695
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,430
Can you give me a break for a while?

696
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,000
You're asking me to take your word for it.

697
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,300
Isn't that gambling?

698
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,240
It is a gamble.

699
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,800
So you need to think it through as well.

700
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,790
What I have here are pre-construction properties,

701
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,600
not ready-to-move-in ones.

702
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,550
This is at best a half-finished project.

703
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,540
Alright, I'm in.

704
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,720
Then pay me part of the fee first.

705
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,490
I'll figure out something

706
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,030
with Mr. Yang and Ms. Ma.

707
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,000
It's a deal.

708
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,590
We're almost there.

709
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,010
Just drop me off at the intersection.

710
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,400
Xia Shu.

711
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,100
Thank you.

712
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,880
I mean it.

713
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,680
Why is Ms. Luo's law firm in a dilapidated building?

714
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,890
It's too shabby.

715
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,110
Making do with what she has.

716
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,450
I don't know if it can withstand an earthquake.

717
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,960
Who are you cursing?

718
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,920
It's the unscrupulous ones who fear earthquakes.

719
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,920
Hello, Ms. Luo.

720
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,830
The partner came out to pick us up personally.

721
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,000
Why are there only the two of you?

722
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,920
Where's the client?

723
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,920
Almost here?

724
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,830
Yes.

725
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,790
Come in.

726
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,310
This, this one.

727
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,160
For us?

728
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,610
-Yes.
-Thank you.

729
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,200
I'll take it.

730
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,390
No, I'm afraid you'll regret it.

731
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,070
Give it to me.

732
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,480
Focus.

733
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,070
Qiu Hua.

734
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,200
They're here.

735
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,000
Morning, Ms. Qiu.

736
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
Hello, Mr. Chen.

737
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,550
Hello, Ms. Qiu.

738
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,400
Hello.

739
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,310
Have a seat.

740
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,550
Dressed in cashmere, huh?

741
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,550
You knew this place is cold.

742
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,040
Have a seat.

743
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,880
Is it cold in here? It's okay.

744
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,790
Why isn't it cold?

745
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,960
I was just saying to Yingzi.

746
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,270
Mr. Chen is so persistent.

747
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,790
What do you mean persistent? In love?

748
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,750
Making money.

749
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,590
Haven't I always been like this? A money-grabber.

750
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,560
And to the point of unrepentant obsession.

751
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,820
Trade secret, I won't look.

752
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,240
Just counting the zeros.

753
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,000
You're so annoying.

754
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,200
You just serve the guests rice crust to eat?

755
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,160
Dry and tasteless.

756
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,680
You deserve this dry stuff.

757
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,880
Fang Rui,

758
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,190
choosing the right mentor is really important.

759
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,920
But what's wrong with your aunt?

760
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,960
Isn't she afraid she'll ruin you?

761
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,710
My aunt has a good eye for talent.

762
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
His aunt has already raised a Righteous Luo.

763
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,450
She doesn't need another Serious Fang.

764
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,650
I'm back.

765
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,210
-You're back. 
-You're back.

766
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,480
Mr. Chen.

767
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,120
Ms. Xia, where have you been?

768
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,400
Where have I been?

769
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,880
I've been working on a case.

770
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,500
Helping the client collect debts.

771
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,990
You can really collect debts now?

772
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,840
For real?

773
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,830
How do you do it?

774
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,340
Just sit at the door and cry, right?

775
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,480
Let me tell you,

776
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,790
if anyone labels Xia Shu

777
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,640
as naive and sweet,

778
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,030
they'll end up realizing they're the naive and sweet one.

779
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,610
What brings you here, Mr. Chen?

780
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,990
Are you unemployed

781
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,150
and come to our firm for an interview?

782
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,310
I'd like to.

783
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,200
Come on.

784
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,310
Mr. Chen just said

785
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,830
our place needs better decoration.

786
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,070
He practically called this place a dilapidated building.

787
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,070
He was just short of saying we three aren't capable.

788
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,550
It's okay.

789
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,030
I made a lot of money anyway.

790
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,550
Let's move to a new place.

791
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,110
What? Are you feeling uneasy

792
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,590
because Xia Shu is making money now?

793
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,330
Naive and sweet.

794
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,990
I'm happy for you three.

795
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,680
Fang Rui, they're here.

796
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,380
Help me pick them up.

797
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,550
Okay, mentor.

798
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,790
Make yourselves at home.

799
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,750
Let me introduce.

800
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,670
This is Yang Shu, Mr. Yang,

801
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,920
and Xiao Nannan, Ms. Xiao.

802
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,050
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu, Ms. Xia.

803
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,830
What a perfect couple.

804
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,890
We need to help.

805
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,400
Mr. Yang, Ms. Xiao, have a seat.

806
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,720
Chen Shuo has told us

807
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
about your case.

808
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,150
But we still hope

809
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,680
you can describe it to us

810
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,550
in detail yourselves.

811
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,680
No problem.

812
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,160
Nannan, why don't you get in the car

813
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,160
and wait for me?

814
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,590
Mr. Yang,

815
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,830
we really hope Ms. Xiao Nannan

816
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,260
can retell it herself.

817
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,920
After all, there might be omissions in someone else's retelling.

818
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,180
And there could be exaggerations and embellishments.

819
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,880
She might not be able to say it herself.

820
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,350
Even to me,

821
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,920
she only told me bits and pieces over the years.

822
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Because those things are still

823
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,150
too painful for her.

824
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,000
Actually, speaking them out is a process

825
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,310
of relief and healing for herself.

826
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Maybe if you speak it out,

827
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,000
your pain could be lessened a bit.

828
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,920
Would you like to give it a try?

829
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,270
Why not give it a try?

830
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,830
I don't want to.

831
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,370
Go ahead, you can do it.

832
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,670
Didn't you talk about it once

833
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,800
with the psychiatrist?

834
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,130
Go ahead, I'm here with you.

835
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,200
When I was young, I grew up with my grandma in my hometown.

836
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,050
My parents were busy with business in Jingbei

837
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,880
and had no time for me.

838
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,350
So they left me in the hometown.

839
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,480
When I was in junior high,

840
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,440
I once went to Jingbei to study,

841
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,310
but I couldn't adapt.

842
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,830
I always felt looked down upon there.

843
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,590
Besides, my parents were busy with business

844
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,440
and had my younger brother.

845
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,400
So when I was in senior high,

846
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,330
I went back to the county.

847
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,310
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Nannan.

848
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,630
Nice to meet you.

849
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,480
Why is she so fair?

850
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,440
She must have put on makeup.

851
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,310
She's from Jingbei.

852
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,440
What's she doing here?

853
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,270
What are you talking about?

854
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,230
That's right.

855
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:13,930
Be quiet!

856
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,920
Later I found out,

857
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,160
although my household registration was in my hometown,

858
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,480
everyone thought I had a Jingbei household registration

859
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,640
and I went back there as a temporary student,

860
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
occupying their educational resources.

861
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,870
And that's why

862
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,660
they hated me even more.

863
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,830
I tried so hard to please them,

864
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,920
but it backfired.

865
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:47,310
All the gossip, rumors, and insults

866
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,860
came my way.

867
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
Xiaolian, hurry up

868
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,680
and get to the chorus.

869
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,480
No way, I like listening to this part.

870
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,410
Let's listen to English.

871
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,470
The teacher is going to test us next class.

872
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,700
Why haven't you do that earlier?

873
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,560
That seems to be her newly bought MP4.

874
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,320
Let's take a look.

875
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,950
Xiao Nannan.

876
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,390
Come here.

877
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,210
Come here.

878
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,850
What's the matter?

879
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,160
This is the latest

880
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,110
MP4, right?

881
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,590
Let me listen to it.

882
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,590
Give it to me.

883
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,960
The latest MP4, so advanced.

884
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,480
I have no idea.

885
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,640
My mom bought it for me when she was on a business trip to Hong Kong.

886
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,960
You bunch of bumpkins, did you hear that?

887
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,680
I haven't finished yet.

888
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,830
Bought in Hong Kong.

889
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,640
Listening to English, Fang Renmei, huh?

890
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,070
She uses a MP4 to listen to English.

891
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,440
You're still using tapes.

892
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,400
You're the bumpkin.

893
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,960
Give it to me.

894
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,790
Xiao Nannan,

895
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,090
your MP4 is mine now.

896
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,720
Your parents are so rich anyway.

897
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,200
Ask them to buy you another one.

898
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,680
How long are you going to use the MP4?

899
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,550
I need to use it to listen to English.

900
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,720
It's hard to say.

901
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,440
Can't we listen to it for a few more days?

902
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,090
You're just showing off.

903
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,830
Bought in Hong Kong.

904
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,750
I'm not showing off.

905
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,150
I don't understand why you said that to me.

906
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,130
You don't understand?

907
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,230
I think you like to rob things.

908
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,590
You, with a Jingbei household registration,

909
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,010
can get into a top university with a low score.

910
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,960
Why did you come to our county to rob resources?

911
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,550
And now you're even

912
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,700
showing off.

913
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,240
Fang Renmei,

914
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,560
did you guys misunderstand me?

915
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,480
I can lend it to you. It's okay, I...

916
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,550
Let's go.

917
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,550
-Listening to her hypocritical words makes me upset.
-Move.

918
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,840
How do we use this thing?

919
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,230
You're such a bumpkin.

920
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,070
Fang Renmei.

921
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,240
Show us your MP4.

922
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,670
Alright, here you go.

923
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,730
Check this out.

924
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,030
How would you rate Xiao Nannan in this photo?

925
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,070
Full marks.

926
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,880
Who is this?

927
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,270
-Especially this one in the dress.
-Xiao Nannan.

928
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,110
Her figure is amazing.

929
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,640
Yes.

930
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,590
She's way better than those skinny girls in our class.

931
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,270
I don't even want to give back

932
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,750
the MP4 to her.

933
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,030
Let's take the photos out

934
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,440
and save them before we return it.

935
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,630
Ming.

936
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,190
Why would she have photos showing her body on the MP4?

937
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,840
Who would she show them to?

938
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,760
Isn't it obvious? For the boys.

939
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,550
They've already commented on them.

940
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,610
You don't get it.

941
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,260
Fang Renmei,

942
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,159
have you finished using my MP4?

943
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,130
What MP4?

944
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,000
Have you seen it?

945
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,590
No.

946
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,150
The one you were passing around.

947
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,429
The one with

948
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,650
all the photos of you showing your body?

949
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,000
Give it back to me, please.

950
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,480
Return it quickly.

951
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,889
Give it to her.

952
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,239
Sorry, I accidentally dropped it.

953
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,230
Your family is so rich.

954
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,880
It shouldn't be a problem for your parents

955
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,110
to buy you a new one.

956
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,880
I just got my meal.

957
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,219
It's already five yuan without the braised pork.

958
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,630
Xiao Nannan.

959
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,320
Your family is so wealthy.

960
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,030
Why don't you buy me a meal?

961
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,490
Everyone,

962
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,690
Xiao Nannan

963
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,200
is treating us to today's lunch.

964
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,760
Okay, thank you, Nan.

965
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,070
Treating.

966
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:18,980
Treating.

967
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,570
I don't want to talk anymore.

968
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,320
Okay.

969
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I'll speak for her.

970
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,440
Back then, her classmates

971
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,280
couldn't stand that she was from a big city,

972
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,670
so they started bullying her,

973
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,220
charging her meal card,

974
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,640
taking her things,

975
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,190
and giving her nicknames,

976
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,280
like "rich girl" and "show-off."

977
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,850
Rumors started spreading in the class,

978
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,320
saying her family had a mine,

979
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,080
that she was tired of delicacies,

980
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,480
and some even claimed her money was ill-gotten.

981
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,030
They shamelessly spread false rumors.

982
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
They didn't just talk about it in person;

983
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,320
they posted it online too,

984
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,860
on their school's forum.

985
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,630
It spread to the entire school

986
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
and even the whole town's middle school students knew.

987
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,800
Nannan didn't know what she had done wrong,

988
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,070
so she tried to explain desperately.

989
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,930
The more she talked, the more mistakes she made.

990
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,670
Those ill-intentioned people

991
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,800
found her

992
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,000
and listened to her explanations,

993
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,590
then twisted them into various versions

994
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,350
and posted them online.

995
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,280
And there were even something

996
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,800
called the "Rich Girl's Sayings."

997
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,440
As it spread,

998
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
the Rich Girl's Sayings grew in number,

999
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,880
reaching over a thousand in the end.

1000
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,110
No matter where Nannan went,

1001
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,110
they would mock and ridicule her

1002
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,900
with theoe sayings.

1003
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
In fact, none of

1004
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,500
those sayings were ever said by Nannan.

1005
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,770
How could these people be so mean?

1006
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,110
Ms. Xiao,

1007
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,590
didn't you

1008
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,360
ask your teacher for help?

1009
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,030
No.

1010
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,840
Why not?

1011
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,670
Because at that time,

1012
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,280
she was used to blaming herself for everything.

1013
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,400
She always thought, how could everyone be wrong?

1014
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,510
If people didn't like her,

1015
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,110
it must be her fault.

1016
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,360
So she tried to please everyone,

1017
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,250
but ended up being seen as a clown by them.

1018
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
At that time, Nannan couldn't even sleep well.

1019
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,760
She was depressed,

1020
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,840
and even

1021
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,510
self-harmed.

1022
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,630
Didn't your teachers notice?

1023
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,590
Didn't your teachers take any action?

1024
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,630
The teacher did say something,

1025
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,550
but they already thought the teacher was biased towards me.

1026
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,250
The more the teacher said,

1027
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,120
the more they made a fuss.

1028
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,440
Later, with so many people involved,

1029
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,710
the teacher didn't know who to discipline.

1030
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,150
In the end,

1031
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,720
the teacher just pretended not to see.

1032
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,830
Later, when they realized Nannan had become numb,

1033
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,530
the violence escalated.

1034
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,120
They hit me for no reason.

1035
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,070
They didn't just hit her,

1036
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,480
also recorded a video of it.

1037
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,550
The forum administrator of their school edited the video,

1038
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,550
added commentary, and posted it online.

1039
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
It caused a huge stir.

1040
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,040
Every day, people commented, insulted,

1041
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,880
and humiliated Nannan.

1042
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,540
More people started to provoke her.

1043
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,360
Nannan was slapped

1044
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,880
and spat on by her classmates

1045
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,030
more than once.

1046
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,500
She experienced the worst things

1047
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,630
you could imagine.

1048
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,710
Didn't your parents sue them?

1049
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,270
No.

1050
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,780
I felt it was my fault.

1051
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,760
I called my parents,

1052
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,570
but I didn't dare tell them what happened.

1053
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,280
I just asked to go back to Jingbei.

1054
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,280
But my parents were in the middle of

1055
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,190
a divorce at that time

1056
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,670
and couldn't take care of me.

1057
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,630
Besides, there was my younger brother.

1058
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,360
And after that?

1059
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,150
I became depressed.

1060
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,000
I couldn't sleep, I was losing hair,

1061
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,510
and I was afraid to go out and see people.

1062
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,570
My grandma got scared

1063
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,690
and withdrew me from school

1064
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,200
and brought me back here.

1065
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,290
So, after you came back,

1066
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,300
did you feel better

1067
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,800
after leaving them?

1068
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,360
I took a break from school for half a year

1069
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,150
and then returned to repeat a grade.

1070
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,920
The next year, I got into college.

1071
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
But, I don't know why,

1072
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,330
getting into college again

1073
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,100
made them angry.

1074
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,070
They just wouldn't let me go.

1075
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,070
Liu Jianming

1076
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,590
posted all

1077
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,690
the "Rich Girl's Sayings"

1078
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,020
and those videos

1079
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,720
on my college website.

1080
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,880
I became infamous in college again.

1081
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,940
Those sayings spread everywhere,

1082
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,470
and some people even used them

1083
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,320
to insult me to my face.

1084
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,440
Then...

1085
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,800
Here.

1086
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,710
I don't want to talk.

1087
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,710
Okay.

1088
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,920
So, Nannan broke down again.

1089
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,150
She dropped out of school

1090
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,510
and never went back.

1091
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,480
She stayed home and recuperated for two years.

1092
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,840
Once she felt better,

1093
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,670
she started learning graphic design

1094
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,280
and then set up her own studio.

1095
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,110
Using the funds from her dad,

1096
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,840
she made herself better and better.

1097
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,670
But after that, she never dared to see anyone

1098
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,190
or date a boyfriend.

1099
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,730
Until she met me, the persistent

1100
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,150
and clueless one,

1101
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,850
who chased her for five years.

1102
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,760
But whenever I mention marriage,

1103
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,600
she gets scared.

1104
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,990
That's why

1105
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,620
we came to you.

1106
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,270
Okay.

1107
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,290
Thank you.

1108
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,230
Xia Shu, you stay with them for a bit.

1109
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,240
I'll be right back.

1110
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
What are we discussing here?

1111
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,590
I feel like I'm a partner here.

1112
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,960
And this room is filled with the light of justice.

1113
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,110
Less joking, let's get down to business.

1114
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,440
We can look for

1115
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,150
the evidence she just mentioned.

1116
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,880
The internet has a memory.

1117
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,320
If those words really existed online,

1118
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,030
the evidence shouldn't be hard to find.

1119
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,860
But even if we find it, what then?

1120
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,550
We can't do anything about this kind of situation.

1121
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,550
Why?

1122
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,230
I believe every word Xiao Nannan said.

1123
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,890
But passion for justice

1124
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,030
can't replace the law.

1125
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,030
Although everything Xiao Nannan went through

1126
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,320
is extremely infuriating,

1127
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,150
it's hard to hold the perpetrators accountable.

1128
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,940
Moreover, these things

1129
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,360
happened ten years ago.

1130
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,190
Criminal liability cannot be established between minors.

1131
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,030
And Civil Law, the Law on the Protection of Minors,

1132
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,920
both require evidence and timeliness.

1133
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,060
Most importantly,

1134
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,130
the consequences

1135
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,760
for Xiao Nannan aren't

1136
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,710
reflected in tangible harm.

1137
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,590
I think it's difficult to measure

1138
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,500
the personal and mental damage

1139
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,670
in terms of lawsuits.
