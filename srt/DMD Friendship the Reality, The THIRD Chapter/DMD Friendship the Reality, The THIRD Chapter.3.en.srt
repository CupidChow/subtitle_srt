1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Our mission for today

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,360
is 'Acoustic Singing Challenge.'

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,520
For those who aren't here today...

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,240
Are they missing out on something?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,800
The winners are...

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,000
Pete and PatJi.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,440
I want to spend Friendship Time with...

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,600
I think I'll go with...

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,360
- Fifa.
- Fifa.

10
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,880
Good morning, artists.

11
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,440
This morning,
the winners of last night's mission

12
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,200
will choose a friend

13
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,840
to spend
Friendship Time outdoors together.

14
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,680
However, we were notified
this morning by Phupha

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,079
that he has an urgent matter.

16
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,510
As a result,
the winners of last night's mission

17
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,510
are unable to choose Phupha
for Friendship Time today.

18
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,760
I think everyone probably thinks

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,079
that PatJi would choose Ryujin,

20
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,520
but anything can happen.

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
So...

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm not sure.

23
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,240
I have two or three people in mind,

24
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,990
both someone new

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,040
to try going out with

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,560
and someone...

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
I've been with for a long time.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,200
He's someone...

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
I've wanted to get to know
from the very start.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,720
I want to open up more

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
and get closer to him.

32
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,280
This choice
feels like the best one for me.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm not sure
if I'll win again, you know.

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,200
And now, PatJi and Pete
have already chosen a friend

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,760
they want to spend Friendship Time with.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,280
First,

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,880
PatJi has chosen...

38
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Fifa.

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,280
- Wait...
- Whoa...

40
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Fifa.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,640
Going out, huh?

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,079
Going out.

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,520
Have fun.

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,800
You're out pretty often.

45
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
- You're rarely home.
- Exactly.

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,520
- You're so hot.
- Tell me about it when you're back.

47
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm glad I was honest the other day

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,270
and told him I wanted
to get to know him better,

49
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,700
and today he actually chose me.

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,360
That moment
might have influenced his choice.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
It might have.

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,400
PatJi has chosen Fifa.

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
And?

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,130
Why?

55
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,300
It's up to him

56
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,740
to decide
who he wants to spend time with.

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,640
We've already
spent a lot of time together.

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,640
It's okay
for him to share it with someone else.

59
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,560
Next up,

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
the person Pete has chosen...

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Who would he choose?

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
That person is...

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Who?

64
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Fifa.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,680
- Wait, what?
- What?

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,520
Both of them?

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
The same person?

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,680
Can you be chosen by 2 people?

69
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
I was shocked.

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Like,

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
I was surprised.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,120
How will it work?

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
Going out as a trio?

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,240
Therefore,

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,960
we may invite Fifa
to discuss this with us.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,200
- Good luck.
- Is he going to choose, too?

77
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,370
You know,
to choose who he wants to go with.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,400
Oh, just one, right?

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,720
That makes sense.

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
You know, to spend Friendship Time
with just one person.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
Or just one at a time?

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,000
If you had to choose
between PatJi and Pete,

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,200
who would you want
to spend Friendship Time with?

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,560
Whoa...

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
If I can't decide,

86
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,160
can I go out with both of them?

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,600
If you really had to choose just one,

88
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,520
who would you choose?

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,640
Gosh...

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Do I really need to choose?

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,200
Come on.

92
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Whoa, they're on the tables.

93
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,840
- Whoa, whoa...
- Hi.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Wait...

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,480
Hey, hey.

96
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
Okay, he loves that.

97
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,400
Easy.

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,640
If they all want it, who gets it?

99
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,280
Here.

100
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,560
Alright, you're done.

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,400
Down.

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
Next...

103
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
Next.

104
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,400
- Down.
- Down.

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Good.

106
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Easy.

107
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,240
There she is.

108
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Are you not coming?

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
There you are.

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,240
Are you...

111
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,240
If you had to choose a partner,

112
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,800
what would your ideal partner be like?

113
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,170
Well...

114
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,840
Someone I feel comfortable around.

115
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,360
Since we have to work in this industry
for a long time,

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,360
I want to be with someone passionate

117
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,800
who can...

118
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,040
go through everything with me,

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,760
while we understand each other.

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,880
What matters the most is the passion.

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,880
- I know.
- And you?

122
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,800
Similar to yours, actually.

123
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
From our conversation,

124
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
PatJi seems very passionate.

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,240
He wants to sing and dance.

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,840
It was nice.
At first, we hadn't really talked

127
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,520
or gotten close,

128
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
but once we did,

129
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,930
I realized
he's much nicer than I expected.

130
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,520
My ideal partner is similar to yours.

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
I want someone...

132
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,520
with a strong passion...

133
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,720
who can go through things with me.

134
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,640
Yeah.

135
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Has anyone in this program...

136
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,640
caught your eye yet?

137
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm still exploring everyone.

138
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,240
What about Cop?

139
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,400
- Sorry?
- I mean Copper.

140
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
He's...

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,320
nice.

142
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
He's nice, and...

143
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
He's okay.

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
I'll probably...

145
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,080
just keep learning about everyone.

146
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,920
I haven't made up my mind yet.

147
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
- Hey, don't fight.
- No, no.

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
Go play somewhere else.

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
Why? You already have someone in mind?

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
No.

151
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,840
It's just...

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,400
I often see you with him.

153
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
I see. Actually,

154
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,080
in the very first days,

155
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,480
we wanted to get to know each other,
so we talked a lot.

156
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,360
What about you and Ryujin?

157
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,400
Do you guys have anyone in mind?

158
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,600
Or are you planning
to choose each other?

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,760
No...

160
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
Just like you, I haven't decided yet.

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,920
I'm just trying to meet someone new.

162
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,120
We still have many days, you know.

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll just go with the flow.

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
Now that I know him better,

165
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,080
I feel like he's really nice.

166
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,790
That's a lot.

167
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,240
Oh, my God.

168
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,240
If PatJi and Pete are okay

169
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,720
with me spending Friendship Time
with both of them on the same day,

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,960
can I...

171
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
do that?

172
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
Making a DIY body mist.

173
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,560
- It's great.
- Hi.

174
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

175
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,080
Today, I'll teach you
how to make body mist.

176
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,520
There are so many scents.

177
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,320
Honestly,

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,840
I know which one to pick now.

179
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
If this is fun,

180
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
we can come back later.

181
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,560
- Really?
- Yeah, we can come here often.

182
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I can't pick it up.

183
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
I think I need that one.

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,640
What's that?

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
It's not that strong.

186
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,880
- That smells good.
- Better?

187
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
- It's good.
- I know, right?

188
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,920
Look.

189
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
What's your favorite festival?

190
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,480
What do you think?

191
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,200
Let me tell you something.

192
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

193
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
It's something between...

194
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
just...

195
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
And Porsche.

196
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,080
What is it?

197
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,600
Do you know that
the letter you received...

198
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,480
- On the first day?
- Yes.

199
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,000
- I have no idea.
- It wasn't from Porsche.

200
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,600
I thought it was him,

201
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,880
- but...
- It was from me.

202
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
- You? Really?
- Yeah.

203
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,880
- Seriously?
- Yes.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,920
Do you believe me?

205
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,720
- No.
- Just wait and see, then.

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Fine, I'll watch that episode later.

207
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
I wanted to tell you first.

208
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
- Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,080
I didn't think it was you.

210
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,040
I thought it was from
either Porsche or Phupha.

211
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,240
It was from me.

212
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
- Really?
- I wrote it.

213
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
Aw, thank you so much.

214
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I wasn't gonna tell you.

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,280
- I'd let you find out for yourself.
- Okay.

216
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Why did you send it to me?

217
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
- Sorry?
- Why did you send it to me?

218
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280
- Because you're the newbie.
- Maknae.

219
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,200
I thought you'd feel awkward,

220
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
so I wanted to cheer you up.

221
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,360
Oh, thank you.

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm actually surprised.

223
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
- I didn't think it was you.
- I know.

224
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,120
You were my last suspect.

225
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
I'll write "Maknae" on this.

226
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,480
Sure, I'm fine with anything.

227
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,720
If I use this somewhere else,

228
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,640
will people wonder what this means?

229
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,520
Tell them to watch this program,

230
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,080
- and they'll understand.
- Watch this so you'll understand.

231
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
Watch the program, guys.

232
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
You've probably dropped it
10 times already.

233
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
It might break
before you get a chance to use it

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
since you've dropped it many times.

235
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,160
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing.

236
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,440
Today, we have another special activity
for those who are still here.

237
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,290
You'll get a special chance

238
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,950
to win Friendship Time outdoors.

239
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Each of you will write the name
of the person you want to go out with.

240
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
If any pair writes each other's names,

241
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,200
they will earn the right to go out.

242
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,240
From now on,

243
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,600
no discussion is allowed
under any circumstances.

244
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,720
You will write the name
and drop it into the box, one by one.

245
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,230
Well, actually,

246
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,440
I've had my eye on Otto
for some time already,

247
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,850
but there hasn't really been
an opportunity

248
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,840
for us to sit down and talk.

249
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,720
At first, I was gonna choose...

250
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,990
If Phupha were here, I'd choose him

251
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,960
'cause we sang together last night.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,960
You know,
I just wanted to thank him

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
while we were out together.

254
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,140
But since he's not here,

255
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,720
I'd also like to
get to know North better.

256
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,720
That's why I chose him.

257
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,400
I've been wanting to
make a sandscape for ages.

258
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,040
I love it.

259
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,360
Here we go.

261
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,200
How was your singing mission?

262
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Was it fun?

263
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
Yeah, it was fun.

264
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,000
And everyone sang so beautifully.

265
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,120
I sang with Phupha,

266
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,120
and he sang really well.

267
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
You like it?

268
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,640
What do you mean?

269
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,720
This.

270
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
I love it.

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
I love art, you know.

272
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,680
And do you like Phupha, too?

273
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Well...

274
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
He's nice.

275
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,320
We can work together.
He's experienced

276
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,400
and talented.

277
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,250
So,

278
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,240
it was...

279
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
a great experience to work with him.

280
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,760
- I'm finished.
- Okay.

281
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
It's beautiful.

282
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Okay.

283
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Do you know who I'm gonna choose?

284
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,280
You've already chosen?

285
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,920
You haven't even
really gotten to know everyone yet.

286
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
But I didn't say I'd choose you.

287
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,040
What?

288
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,360
I didn't say you'd choose me.

289
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,800
Do you know who I'm gonna choose?

290
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,080
I do,

291
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,280
but...

292
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,720
it's up to you.

293
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,040
Just pick whoever
you want to know better.

294
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,880
Just wait until I win a mission,

295
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,520
and you'll know who I'll choose.

296
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,560
Aw,

297
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,720
I'll wait, then.

298
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm not sure
when that's gonna happen, though.

299
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Or I might win,

300
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,960
and then we'll know who I'll choose.

301
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,040
Do you wanna know who I'll choose?

302
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,200
I do,

303
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
but I think I know the answer.

304
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,160
Who?

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,120
Maybe someone
you sang 'Rak Raek Pob' with.

306
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
You sure?

307
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,280
We'll find out.

308
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,600
Look, it's a heart.

309
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,400
That's so messy.

310
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,080
- You're so fussy.
- Hey.

311
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,530
Are you usually fussy?

312
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
Be nice, and I won't be fussy.

313
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,520
You're so fussy,
do you even like dogs?

314
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,280
I love dogs, but I'm not fussy.

315
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
I see.

316
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
Think you want a dog?

317
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,400
I do. Why?

318
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,200
I was just asking.

319
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,640
What about a puppy?

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,880
That's interesting.

321
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,440
But...

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
You want a puppy, but...

323
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,880
I'm not a puppy you want, am I?

324
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Who told you that?

325
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,880
It's not like that in the slightest.

326
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
For real?

327
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Yeah.

328
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,000
But what I see is different.

329
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,560
No, it's because
you didn't join the singing mission.

330
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,640
I had an urgent matter, you know.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,480
Anyway,
we didn't get to sing together.

332
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,200
Does that mean

333
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,320
you wanted to sing with me?

334
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
If you had gotten to sing,

335
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,640
the instructor
might have let you sing with me.

336
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
Who knows?

337
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
I might not be
as good as Phupha, though.

338
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,120
I can teach you.

339
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,800
- Really?
- Yes.

340
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,560
You'll teach me?

341
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,360
I can help you.

342
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,080
I can teach you
how to sing and dance, too.

343
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
Want me to teach you, too?

344
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,080
- Why?
- You teach me how to sing and dance,

345
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,200
and I'll teach you something else.

346
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,320
What is it?

347
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,280
I chose Pung because...

348
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,109
the first time
we spent Friendship Time together,

349
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,280
I felt very comfortable around him.

350
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,000
If there's a chance,
I want to do it again.

351
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,680
I was gonna write Copper's name,

352
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,320
but I remembered that last night

353
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,040
he said he wanted to rest today.

354
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,400
So I didn't write anything down.

355
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
Staying home with him
means our choices matched, too.

356
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,160
I was gonna choose North,

357
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,120
but...

358
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,360
I knew he wasn't gonna choose me.

359
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
You knew that, too.

360
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,320
So I chose my other close friend,

361
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,840
Ryujin.

362
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,320
I'll just let North enjoy his time.

363
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
I chose Porsche

364
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,280
because...

365
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,080
he always supports everyone,

366
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,280
so I wanna know him better.

367
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,730
I'm here to find a partner,

368
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,760
but with such a huge age gap,

369
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,280
they're all like little brothers to me.

370
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll just support them

371
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,160
and let them be with someone
who's a better match.

372
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,560
When PatJi didn't choose you,

373
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
were you disappointed?

374
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,760
No, I was not.

375
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,840
It's up to him.

376
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,360
But if it were me, I'd choose him.

377
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,800
Have you talked to everyone else yet?

378
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,640
I have.

379
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,000
But PatJi is still number one, right?

380
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,400
Well...

381
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,280
And you?

382
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,720
I don't know, like...

383
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,800
This season may not be...

384
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
Maybe it's because I'm old now,

385
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,840
so this season might not be
the right time for me.

386
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,800
I don't know.

387
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
There might be a surprise ahead.

388
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
You know,
even in the first two seasons,

389
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,360
more people joined the program.

390
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,160
Out of the blue, there might be...

391
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,560
Maybe something will happen.

392
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,920
But for now...

393
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,960
It's been days,

394
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
and I think everyone...

395
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
already has someone in mind.

396
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
I have no idea who Wave chose.

397
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,960
I think...

398
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
he'd either choose North...

399
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,970
Either North or you.

400
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
You know,
to spend Friendship Time with.

401
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,360
And you wouldn't be here
eating grapes with me.

402
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,880
Who did you choose?

403
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
No one.

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,920
No one?

405
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Whoa...

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,120
If you had chosen me,

407
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,120
we would've matched

408
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
and gone out together.

409
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,880
What?

410
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,760
I chose you.

411
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,000
Why did you choose me?

412
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,280
Why didn't you choose someone else?

413
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,520
Are you serious?

414
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,560
I am.

415
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,520
Neither of us got to sing,

416
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,480
so...

417
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,320
I wanted to ask you to...

418
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,560
- eat with me.
- You were worried I'd be lonely?

419
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,450
Kiddo.

420
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Sorry?

421
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,400
What did you say?

422
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,000
- I called you kiddo.
- Oh, I see.

423
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,360
You're so nice.

424
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm so upset.

425
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,520
I didn't get any letters again.

426
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,480
Don't get stressed out.

427
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,640
- Porsche, come here.
- It's okay. I love you the most, Wave.

428
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,560
I also love you the most, Wave.

429
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,130
It's okay.

430
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,450
Hey, what are you doing?!

431
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,410
Hold on.

432
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,240
Ow!

433
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm done writing letters.

434
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,160
Honestly, I wasn't upset at all.

435
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
But...

436
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,490
I don't know why

437
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,160
they thought I was actually upset.

438
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,710
So I played along with them.

439
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,800
Who wrote you letters today?

440
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,280
- I saw you've got...
- I've been hiding them.

441
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,520
- What? Oh, they're right here.
- Two letters.

442
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,120
- Sheesh.
- I've got two.

443
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,000
What a popular guy.

444
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Who is it from?

445
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,640
Which one should I start with?

446
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,560
- One is a dog, and the other is a crocodile.
- Which is better?

447
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
- I like the dog.
- This one.

448
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I want to hear you read this one first.

449
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,480
- Yeah, this one.
- Alright, this one.

450
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,200
"Sup, Bro!"

451
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,360
I can already tell
who it is from the handwriting.

452
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
- Really?
- Yes.

453
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah.

454
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,560
This handwriting is like...

455
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,480
It's that of someone from
an international school.

456
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,800
And it's someone who has

457
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,410
played games with me,

458
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,970
as mentioned in the letter.

459
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,120
It's probably not Ryujin,
from the looks of it.

460
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,920
Fifa?

461
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
That's even less likely.

462
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,320
So Pete is my only guess.

463
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,040
I think this first letter is from Pete.

464
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,320
At first, I wrote two letters

465
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,800
I couldn't decide
whether to give it to Copper or Fifa.

466
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,560
In the end, I gave it to Copper.

467
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,320
I'd like to thank him for...

468
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Since I got here,
I think Copper has been someone

469
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,880
I've spent a lot of time with.

470
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,400
We're like good brothers to each other.

471
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
We also play games pretty often.

472
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,920
I hope our bond grows deeper

473
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,440
and that we'll talk a lot more.

474
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,640
Let's read this one.

475
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,080
- This one made me blush.
- This one.

476
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Really?

477
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,520
I was beet-red.

478
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Let's see.

479
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
It's from Pung.

480
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,360
He says

481
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,320
he's comfortable being around me.

482
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,350
He hopes that

483
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,550
he's also my comfort zone.

484
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
I feel

485
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,360
comfortable with Copper, and...

486
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
That's why I sent him the letter.

487
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm jealous.

488
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,080
- What?
- Who's next?

489
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,640
Did you get any letters?

490
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,080
You're just smiling.

491
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Did you get any?

492
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Who wrote it to you?

493
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,340
I did.

494
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,360
How many?

495
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Let's see.

496
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,840
Here they are!

497
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
- Look!
- Two letters?!

498
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,320
Whoa.

499
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,240
"You've got this, Ryujin.

500
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,680
Feel free to talk to this big bro
about anything, anytime."

501
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,320
What?

502
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,920
- "Feel free to talk to this big bro?"
- How do you know who this is?

503
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
I do know.

504
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,530
From the looks of it...

505
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,200
Oh, it's got a Korean look to it.

506
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,160
It also has a smiley face
with its tongue out.

507
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
I've figured it out.

508
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,400
- Who?
- Who is it?

509
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
The tongue-out smiley emoji
has been used once.

510
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,920
This one's commonly used.

511
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Don't you guys use it?

512
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,450
- No.
- I don't.

513
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,680
- No.
- I've never used it.

514
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,440
So...

515
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,000
Who is it?

516
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,240
PatJi chose Fifa
to spend Friendship Time with him,

517
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,440
and I think Ryujin
talks to PatJi quite often.

518
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,440
So I think
he couldn't talk to PatJi about this.

519
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,760
That's why I wanted to tell him that,

520
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,480
in case he needed any advice on this.

521
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
- Let's go with this one.
- We'll find out who the sender is later.

522
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,960
- This one's for later.
- Let's go with this one.

523
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
- Oh?
- Whoa!

524
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,200
Isn't this amazing?

525
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,280
The one who wrote the letter
in this fashion

526
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
has to be like...

527
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Like...

528
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
He adores you dearly.

529
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,080
He has to be talented, too.

530
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,120
Even if I adored
someone that much, I couldn't do this.

531
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,560
It was a drawing.

532
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,920
Yeah.

533
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,360
No words.

534
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,800
I sent mine to Ryujin

535
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
because...

536
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
Like,

537
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,840
we haven't talked much lately,

538
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,120
and he barely smiles,

539
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
so I drew him a sunflower.

540
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,520
So?

541
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Why did you call me?

542
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
About the letter.

543
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,520
Okay.

544
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,720
Watch that.

545
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,360
What's wrong?

546
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,680
Now that we're in this program,

547
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,840
do you still think
we should choose each other?

548
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,040
For me,

549
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,800
I'll choose you no matter what.

550
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
But...

551
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,120
I understand that the reason we're here

552
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
is to meet new people.

553
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,080
So if someone has caught your eye,

554
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,040
you can get to know him better.

555
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,720
Whoever you choose,

556
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
I'm fine with it.

557
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,000
You didn't send me any letters.

558
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
But I did.

559
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,160
I drew it with all my heart.

560
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,520
Oh...

561
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
I always keep it with me, though.
Didn't you know?

562
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
You didn't send me a letter,

563
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
but someone else did.

564
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
"I had so much fun today.

565
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Let's go out together again."

566
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,720
After going out with him,

567
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,160
I found him really nice,

568
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,720
so I wrote him a letter.

569
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,440
Why didn't you choose me?

570
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,280
I was trying to get to know someone new.

571
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,440
Okay.

572
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,920
Once you've gotten to know them all,

573
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,000
if you still don't find anyone,

574
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,240
I'll always be right here.

575
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
Yeah.

576
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
I feel kinda bad...

577
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,720
for...

578
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
hesitating.

579
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,160
Okay.

580
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,080
It's okay.

581
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,040
Since we're on this program,

582
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,760
we should get to know someone new.

583
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
We already learned
about each other last season.

584
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,760
For this one,

585
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,920
let's get to know someone else.

586
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I get it.

587
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Chill.

588
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
You can do whatever you want.

589
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
So?

590
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,480
How was it?

591
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
Did you get any?

592
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,560
- Yeah?
- Did you get any?

593
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,360
No.

594
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,200
You're lying.

595
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Come on.

596
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Did you get any?

597
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
How was it?

598
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,640
It was good.

599
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,400
Do you know who it's from?

600
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
I don't.

601
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,880
I have no idea.

602
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,080
There's no name.

603
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,080
Of course there isn't.

604
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
But you need to know

605
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,360
- if he wrote a secret just for you.
- Oh...

606
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,480
It reads...

607
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,340
"A puppy is not bad."

608
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Well,

609
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
it made me smile.

610
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,320
Like, kinda smiled.

611
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,400
At the workshop, he asked me

612
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,320
if I liked a puppy,

613
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,720
so I replied, "A puppy is not bad."

614
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,880
Is there a heart sticker used as a seal?

615
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Right here. Is there?

616
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,880
Yeah, there is.

617
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,080
Let me see.

618
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,800
Could it be true?

619
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,440
He just sang with Phupha, you know.

620
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,680
And?

621
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,480
When we were making the sandscape,

622
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
he said

623
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,120
Phupha was okay.

624
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,600
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

625
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
He just wanted to make you jealous
'cause you never did.

626
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,560
No, that's not true.

627
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,920
I could tell.

628
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,560
Gosh...

629
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,040
You're mad at him now?

630
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm not.

631
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
See? There's a heart,

632
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,320
and the paper's orange.

633
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,920
That's exactly what I saw.

634
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,840
- For real?
- Yeah.

635
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,320
We were together when we wrote ours.

636
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,080
Really?

637
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,480
Why would he send me this
when he doesn't even care?

638
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,840
It's 'cause you sent him yours first.

639
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,880
- Oh, so he's just a good person?
- Yeah.

640
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,960
Okay, then.

641
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,560
It's just because Phupha isn't here.

642
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
That's why he wrote it to me.

643
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,120
You sure are an overthinker.

644
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,400
But anything is possible,

645
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,760
isn't it?

646
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And you?

647
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,760
What?

648
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,520
- Did you get any?
- No.

649
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,360
That's not true.

650
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,000
- Be serious.
- I got one.

651
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,640
Okay.

652
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,560
Who is it from?

653
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,400
- What?
- Who wrote it?

654
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
I don't know.

655
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,360
The letter reads,

656
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,360
"Wow, you're hot.

657
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,400
You even got chosen by two people
to spend Friendship Time with."

658
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,720
Who could it be?

659
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,880
If I had to guess from the letter,

660
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,960
I think I know who it's from,

661
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,560
but I'm not really sure.

662
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,760
But now that I think about it,
I actually have someone in mind,

663
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,440
and it's Wave.

664
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,520
I think it's from him.

665
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,720
I sent mine to Fifa

666
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
'cause...

667
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
I feel...

668
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,100
comfortable around him.

669
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,080
So I wrote to ask him how he felt,

670
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,600
'cause...

671
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,320
he looked unwell when he got back.

672
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,240
That's why I wrote that.

673
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,680
It's hard to explain.

674
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,880
I'll let him read it himself.

675
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,440
Hi there.

676
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,800
There you are.

677
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,600
Pung...

678
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,520
- Got any letters?
- Yeah.

679
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,360
- Did you?
- Oh...

680
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,040
I saw it.

681
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Oh, you did?

682
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,920
- Come on.
- I was hiding it.

683
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,920
- Who is it from?
- Have you read it yet?

684
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,520
"How bad.

685
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,800
I didn't win the last mission,

686
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,440
so we couldn't eat out together."

687
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,800
- Oh...
- Who is it?

688
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,240
- That's it?
- Can you guess who it's from?

689
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
I can't.

690
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,600
But you're smiling.

691
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
I have no idea.

692
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,800
I really have no idea,

693
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,680
but...

694
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,670
deep down,

695
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,570
I hope it's the person I have in mind.

696
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
I wrote that to him

697
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,960
because we got to spend Friendship Time
in the first few missions.

698
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,800
I just felt...

699
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
comfortable around him,

700
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,120
and we could talk about many things.

701
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
So...

702
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
it's really sad that...

703
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,400
I didn't get to
go out with him this time.

704
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,760
Yeah.

705
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,320
It's okay.

706
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,160
I also sent mine to...

707
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,800
Anyway, forget it.

708
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,440
It's okay. You...

709
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,200
No, I'm fine.

710
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,360
- I already won the first week.
- Pete...

711
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,840
- I'm rooting for you.
- Thank you.

712
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,040
It's okay. I'm fine.

713
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,960
- But this one...
- Otto, you?

714
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,770
His letter is the most intense.

715
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,480
- It's okay.
- He's a bit stressed.

716
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,200
Let me read it.

717
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,680
I won't read it out loud.

718
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,230
Okay, then.

719
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,440
That's so cute.

720
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,840
- It's...
- It's decorated.

721
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Could it be that person?

722
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,680
I don't know, but it says everything.

723
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,880
- Try reading it.
- Read it.

724
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,280
- Hey...
- I won't read it out loud.

725
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,800
- Give me a moment.
- The first sentence is already obvious.

726
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,110
I can read it out loud, right?

727
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:57,790
Yeah.

728
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
It reads,

729
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,280
"I don't know
what you think about Phupha,

730
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,400
but I want you
to give me, North, a chance too.

731
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
I may not be very talented,

732
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,560
but I'll try my best to be good enough

733
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,120
to be your partner."

734
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,000
I can see his sincerity,

735
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,040
but I don't want him
to feel stressed or pressured.

736
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,360
We can just let things be.

737
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,200
I may not be very talented.

738
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,360
I'm not a good dancer

739
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,610
or a good singer.

740
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,010
Otto might be better than me,

741
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,600
but...

742
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,560
I'll try...

743
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,960
my best

744
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,160
to be a partner worthy of him.

745
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm not sure if I can do it, though.

746
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,400
He's stressed.

747
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,960
Which one is more intense, yours or his?

748
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,960
- Intense in a different way.
- In a different way?

749
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,800
Is it intense?

750
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,800
You should talk things out.

751
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,120
Let's put it that way.

752
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,200
- What's with this season?
- I'm going crazy.

753
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,000
Right?

754
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,800
- Like...
- It's something new.

755
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,440
It's really new.

756
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Let's go to bed.

757
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,520
I don't want to talk to anyone anymore.

758
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,790
Let's go to sleep.

759
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You won't even fall asleep.

760
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,240
Neither of you will.

761
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Please turn off the light.

762
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,130
Sure.

763
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,320
- Good night, guys.
- Have a good night.

764
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,000
- I'm closing this.
- Good night.

765
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,000
Good night, guys. Relax.

766
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,600
- Good night.
- Don't stress out.

767
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Let's see what tomorrow brings.

768
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,800
Good morning, artists.

769
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,400
For this morning, please prepare yourself
for your destination

770
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,440
for the next mission.

771
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Whoa...

772
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,600
Come on, wake up.

773
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
Wake up.

774
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,640
This is so exciting.

775
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,920
This is so exciting.

776
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,160
Bro, Phupha is refusing to wake up.

777
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,520
Alright, I'll take a shower first, then.

778
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,760
I'll be lying here waiting.

779
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,760
Okay.

780
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,560
Ooh, hello, Aof.

781
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,000
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

782
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

783
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,480
He's even wearing a blazer.

784
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,880
It's very cold today,
so the blazer is a must.

785
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,840
- Isn't it cold today?
- It really is.

786
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,000
- It's an affirming room, not elimination.
- Yep.

787
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,320
There are 11 of us in here at once.

788
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,320
Okay,

789
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,320
why do you think I'm here today?

790
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,640
To be one of the Bros?

791
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,760
One of the Bros?

792
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Can I still pass as one?

793
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,640
Alright, so today,

794
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,680
you guys know that before joining
the company and being in this show,

795
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,960
you were interviewed by me to some extent.

796
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,640
Today, of course, I want the viewers

797
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,600
and all of you to come together
and share your thoughts once more.

798
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,080
This time, with some added suggestions.

799
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
Being a part of DOMUNDI,

800
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,400
apart from your abilities
and your appearance,

801
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,840
your mindset is also very essential,

802
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,880
and what I'd like to see more
than your attitude

803
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,000
is your passion toward the industry.

804
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,639
So today, I want to talk
to you guys one-on-one

805
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,920
to get to know you more.

806
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,400
But I didn't come here by myself.

807
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,800
I asked one of your seniors to join.

808
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
- A senior?
- Who do you think it is?

809
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,159
Definitely Namping

810
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,040
since I've always seen him going viral.

811
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,880
- That's correct.
- Whoa...

812
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,080
- Whoa!
- Wow...

813
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,080
Did you see him getting his makeup done?

814
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,600
- Not at all.
- You didn't, did you?

815
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,800
I just thought that,
when it came to giving answers,

816
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,080
- there was no one other than Namping.
- Correct.

817
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,440
You'll see him soon.

818
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
- Yay!
- Yeah.

819
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
- Gen 5 must survive!
- Okay.

820
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,960
But, aside from taking a look
at your mindset or passion,

821
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,680
I'd also like to see
who gives touching answers

822
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,760
or fascinates us with your passion.

823
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,880
This way, you will...
They'd say these are...

824
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,360
little tokens of appreciation

825
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,720
so that you guys
can have more Friendship Time.

826
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,120
I wish you guys the best of luck.

827
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
And don't be nervous.

828
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Be your truest self.

829
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,080
If you have any questions
or want suggestions from Namping or me,

830
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,360
don't hold back.

831
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,840
We'll be looking forward to those.

832
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,080
- Of course.
- Yes, sir.

833
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,800
- We got this.
- Okay.

834
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,520
Hello,

835
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,080
I'm Namping, Napatsakorn Pingmuang,

836
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,200
a guest in this episode.

837
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,440
First of all, I'd like
to put out a disclaimer

838
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,920
that I'm not an expert or specialized
in speaking or anything like this,

839
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,880
but I'm here today as someone
who's been through DMD Friendship the Reality

840
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,000
with a fair share
of experience in the industry

841
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,720
and some interviews with the press.

842
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,920
So, I believe that I can use my experience

843
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,680
to help them...

844
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,910
crack themselves open
in some ways or see...

845
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,680
some developments
that could really benefit their growth.

846
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Also, I'd like to check up on them

847
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,160
since we're already halfway through
the reality show.

848
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,800
I'd like to know what they're feeling
and where they're at

849
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,000
and to give them support.

850
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,880
Hello, hi.

851
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,000
Hi.

852
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Hello.

853
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,780
Hello.

854
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,120
Why did Mentor Keng send you here?

855
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,080
He...sent me here

856
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,760
to participate in these competitions

857
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,880
and find myself a partner.

858
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,520
But do you know there's a chance
of elimination once you set foot here?

859
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,520
I do know.

860
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,640
Do you think you can stay?

861
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,400
I have prepared myself partially,

862
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,400
but...

863
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
when there's a challenge,

864
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,880
I always do my best.

865
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
This is too serious.

866
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,600
Alright, before we get into it...

867
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,360
I don't think he got the reference.

868
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Well, Namping asked that
in such a serious way.

869
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,480
- It's just fun and games.
- Right.

870
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,200
Let's consider that... What is it called...

871
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,040
- An ice-breaking session.
- Yes.

872
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Anyway, you've been with us for...

873
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
Has it been a year?

874
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,520
- It has.
- It has.

875
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,280
Definitely.

876
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
And...

877
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,840
What goals do you have for next year?

878
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,600
Where do you see yourself
in the industry?

879
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,680
I want to become more skilled

880
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,280
so that I'm prepared
for whatever the industry has in store.

881
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,800
I think your strength is your sincerity,

882
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,440
which comes through in your voice and...

883
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,040
your gestures, or something
along those lines.

884
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,680
This is what you should treasure.

885
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,360
When it comes to working
in the entertainment industry,

886
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,320
of course I understand very well

887
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,880
that a rookie or a newbie
needs a lot of experience.

888
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,360
But I want you to be more confident

889
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,440
and articulate,

890
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,920
as that could really help you connect
with listeners more easily.

891
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,320
They'll understand you better.

892
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,100
- Thank you.
- Is there something you want to...

893
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,520
- Yeah.
- ask me, Pung?

894
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
Any advice you'd like from Aof?

895
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,200
We're chill here.

896
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,560
You can vent or ask for advice.
Anything at all.

897
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,560
I'd like your advice

898
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,720
- Yes.
- on...

899
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,840
how to be more confident on this show.

900
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,280
I think you can start by not being afraid

901
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,600
- to ask questions
- Right.

902
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,640
or share your thoughts.

903
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
- If something goes wrong,
- Right.

904
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,720
let it be a lesson
that helps you improve.

905
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,840
That's how you'll grow through the show.

906
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,440
At this point, for the people
who will watch you on this reality show,

907
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,120
I want you to get them hooked
on your true self,

908
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,280
the part of you that lasts.

909
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,720
No matter how many years from now,

910
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,480
they will love you for who you are.

911
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,440
Also, I want you to enjoy
your time with your friends

912
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
and be truly confident.

913
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,200
Thank you, Namping.

914
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,160
- Hi, I'm North,
- Hi.

915
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,040
Chatchapon Pranotphong,

916
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,000
- and I'm 20 years old.
- Right.

917
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,760
- Okay.
- He has sharp features.

918
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Right?

919
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,560
In similar ways to Keng.

920
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,480
What made you decide that
you want to be here,

921
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,880
and what still...

922
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,840
pushes you forward every day?

923
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,200
So... I want to help my mom.

924
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,640
Because my parents divorced
when I was a child,

925
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,600
my mom was the one providing for

926
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,960
and taking care of everything
in the house, so...

927
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,640
- I want to help her.
- Of course.

928
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,710
Yeah.

929
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,560
Is there anything you want our advice on?
Anything on your mind?

930
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,440
Or anything
you just want to talk about,

931
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,800
maybe casually, with Aof and me?

932
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,880
Well...

933
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,440
What I'd like to ask is...

934
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,360
Right now, I'm concerned.

935
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,360
Everyone in Gen 5

936
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,160
is so skilled.

937
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,280
They can all sing and dance.

938
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,760
That being said, if I get a partner

939
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,960
while I'm still not that skilled
at singing or dancing,

940
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
I think...

941
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,160
the person who becomes my partner
will definitely get tired

942
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,800
of helping me.

943
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,120
This is what I'm worried about.

944
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,200
At the end of the day, people improve.

945
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,320
They don't just match

946
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,720
each other's skill level in a single day.

947
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,800
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

948
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,080
One simple example would be me.

949
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,520
When it comes to having a partner
who's highly skilled in singing,

950
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,360
it's inevitable to feel pressured

951
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,680
the moment you reflect on yourself.

952
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,480
But what I want to tell you

953
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,920
is that you need to see
whether that person shares the same vision

954
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,200
and wants to grow with you.

955
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,080
Because if they approach it
with a mindset of,

956
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,280
"Okay, I want to be better,
and we will be better,"

957
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,720
I think it's gonna be fun

958
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,160
since you'll be helping each other out.

959
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,560
Still, I want you to keep fighting.

960
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,400
Like Namping said,

961
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,560
I believe that, in the end,
you have your own strength,

962
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,520
which could
ultimately fulfill your partner.

963
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,760
This is why I created this show,

964
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,160
so you guys can see whether
the person you choose shares the same vision

965
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,800
- Yes.
- and whether they are ready to grow with you.

966
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,720
- That's about it for North.
- That's right.

967
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
- Are you nervous?
- I am.

968
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
- I was afraid that...
- Don't be.

969
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,560
Tony Stark here isn't.

970
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,800
Fine, Spider-Boy.

971
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,440
Oh!

972
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
Mr. Stark!

973
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,400
Why are you
wearing a suit today, Mr. Stark?

974
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,560
- Oh.
- There it is.

975
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,800
Come on,
let's move on to the next one.

976
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,880
- Hi, Hello.
- Hello.

977
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,550
- Copper.
- Yes.

978
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,120
- I want to ask you something...
- Sure.

979
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,760
Having been
on this career path for a while,

980
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,960
- Right.
- have there been any moments you found...

981
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,840
particularly challenging or dissatisfying?

982
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,680
How did you deal with those feelings?

983
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,760
I always tell myself

984
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,120
that even though today is bad,
tomorrow will be better.

985
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,960
I always stay positive

986
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,840
- that it can't get any worse.
- Right.

987
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,040
Even if it does,

988
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,280
my time will come.

989
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,400
I always tell myself, "Okay, I'll start over.

990
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,560
Don't get discouraged.

991
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,960
My day's gotta come soon."

992
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,680
Now, what are your expectations

993
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,760
about being here,
or even being on the show?

994
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,800
Actually,
when I joined the show, I thought

995
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,120
I wanted to gain experience,
develop my skills,

996
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,040
and make new friends.

997
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,760
After some time, I realized that...

998
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,520
I also wanted
to find someone to work with

999
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,240
and be around, someone who

1000
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,120
makes me think in the morning,
"Wow, I get to work with them again.

1001
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,760
I'll get to see them again."

1002
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,510
I want someone I can rely on, who...

1003
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,400
gives me peace of mind.

1004
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,600
As for the entertainment industry,

1005
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,600
what do you expect to gain from it?

1006
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,080
My end goal is to have my own movie

1007
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,440
in theaters
that I can take my grandma to watch.

1008
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,600
That's my highest goal.

1009
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,600
And right now,
what are your thoughts on choosing a partner?

1010
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
Do you happen to have...

1011
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,600
anyone in mind?

1012
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,000
This is a tough question because...

1013
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,040
I'd say I do,

1014
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,960
but not just one.

1015
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,520
That's why it's hard.

1016
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,360
Can you tell me
what's keeping you on the fence about these two?

1017
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,960
The first one, I adore him.

1018
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,400
I feel like I want to take care of him.

1019
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,840
I want to... How do I put this?

1020
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,800
I want to support him
and stay close to him.

1021
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,640
Something draws me in.

1022
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
There's something mysterious about him.

1023
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,440
But when it comes to giving me
peace of mind,

1024
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,920
he still can't compare to the other boy.

1025
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Being around him,

1026
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,320
I can talk about anything.

1027
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,400
I don't even have to think.

1028
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,640
I also feel
that he's comfortable around me.

1029
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,200
No need to hurry, though.

1030
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,120
I mean, let's say that...

1031
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,440
there isn't enough time here, you can...

1032
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,160
take some extra time after the show.

1033
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I don't want you
to be too hard on yourself.

1034
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,920
- Oh, I do have one question.
- Sure.

1035
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,200
If someone commented that

1036
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,600
you seem to be
polishing your words too much,

1037
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,840
- Whoa...
- how would you handle it?

1038
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,360
I've received it before, like...

1039
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,320
"Hey, is that scripted?"

1040
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,040
Or like, "Do you fake your smile?"

1041
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,800
I'd just tell them straight up

1042
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,800
that this is who I am,

1043
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,840
and hope they open up

1044
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,640
and try to understand me.

1045
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,240
Part of the reason I asked,
"Do people think you're overdoing it with your words?

1046
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,360
Tell me how you'd handle it,"

1047
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,040
is that I can relate to him.

1048
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,480
When there's a lot going on,
misunderstandings can happen,

1049
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,560
like what I went through.

1050
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,400
I can really relate to it,
so I wanted to know his thoughts.

1051
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,720
I think it has something to do
with analyzing your listeners,

1052
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,600
as in who they are,
what the purpose of your speech is,

1053
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,640
and who you are in that situation.

1054
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,880
If I'm a public figure,

1055
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,040
there will definitely
be younger people listening,

1056
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,200
so what I say
could have an impact on many people.

1057
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,760
Thinking before speaking is always a must.

1058
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,280
And I believe that preparing yourself
for these situations

1059
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,720
and making sure your words
don't hurt others

1060
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,120
is fundamental for everyone.

1061
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,960
Okay.

1062
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
- Thank you.
- How very touching.

1063
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,440
Hello.

1064
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,840
- Hello.
- Hi.

1065
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,200
- Phupha.
- Yes.

1066
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,520
Okay, I wanna know...

1067
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
- Right.
- In this show,

1068
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,360
you know that you have another mission

1069
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,320
besides self-improvement,

1070
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,400
such as
getting to know your friends,

1071
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,560
which comes down
to choosing your partner.

1072
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,360
What are your thoughts on that?

1073
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,920
For me, a partner is...

1074
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,400
I'd say a work duo.

1075
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,960
With a supportive partner,

1076
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,600
I think it's gonna work out okay,

1077
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
and I'll find it to be something positive.

1078
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,400
I think I need to look for a partner
who gets along well with me

1079
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,880
when it comes to work.

1080
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,080
What kind of people don't you like?

1081
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,600
The kind of people I don't like?

1082
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,640
Someone who...

1083
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,840
Maybe someone who is...

1084
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,680
Someone like you.

1085
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,520
Whoa...

1086
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,200
Wait, that's not it.

1087
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,840
If it's someone
I completely despise at work,

1088
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,120
it's someone who is... exploitative of me.

1089
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,720
Let's say that while we work,
they let me handle the hard work by myself

1090
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,320
and aren't willing to work alongside me.

1091
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,960
I'd think he's unfit for this.

1092
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,240
What did you major in, Phupha?

1093
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
Social Science.

1094
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:32,710
Geography, specifically.

1095
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,240
- Geography?
- That's correct.

1096
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,600
You have good gestures.

1097
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,360
- Let me compliment you on that.
- Thank you.

1098
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,920
Because his body language is very open.

1099
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,960
I mean, he doesn't seem unapproachable.

1100
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
It kinda got me wondering

1101
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,440
if he studies
something like communications.

1102
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,160
He seems to have some experience
answering questions,

1103
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,360
not at all like...

1104
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,720
- He barely avoids eye contact, too.
- Yep.

1105
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,840
There's one thing
I want to put out there, though.

1106
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,320
As Phupha is someone who...

1107
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,320
Are you an introvert?

1108
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,800
I think it depends on the people
or the situation I'm in,

1109
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,600
along with how my mood

1110
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,720
or my tiredness affects me.

1111
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,320
That is an important point
that has been...

1112
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:21,480
a turning point
for many actors in the industry.

1113
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,040
I want you to know it's important

1114
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,680
to bring some kind of energy
for the crowd,

1115
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,280
not just your fans,

1116
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,640
but starting
with the people on set or anyone...

1117
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,120
- sharing the space with you,
- Right.

1118
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,720
since they work for your sake.

1119
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,860
Partly, I think that

1120
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,280
- because you have a solemn demeanor,
- True.

1121
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,440
it's really easy for people to assume

1122
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,680
you're haughty or quiet.

1123
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,200
I think that, since you already
seem like a fighter,

1124
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,620
I want you to try to...

1125
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,230
- open up and approach people.
- We can see how nice you are after this talk.

1126
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,440
- Exactly.
- But it's just your look.

1127
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,960
- You have quite a stern look.
- Kinda like a bad boy.

1128
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,200
Yeah, what Namping said,

1129
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
- I totally agree with it.
- Right.

1130
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,880
At the end of the day,

1131
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,880
you need to show more of who you are,

1132
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,280
- especially your loveliness.
- True.

1133
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,000
Of course.

1134
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
It will make you more charming.

1135
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,240
We're not trying to turn an introvert

1136
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,720
- into an extrovert or anything,
- No.

1137
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,760
but when it comes to working
and leading your life,

1138
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,840
- you need to be nice
- Right.

1139
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,800
to both the crew and the fans.

1140
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,640
That will make you easier to discover

1141
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,240
- and help boost your fanbase.
- Sure.

1142
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,120
- Alright, thank you.
- Thank you.

1143
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,760
- Thank you very much.
- Appreciated.

1144
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,280
I won't settle for this, Father.

1145
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,560
What's the problem?

1146
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,320
How could you let my younger brother
become the head of the company?

1147
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,440
- Here he comes.
- Hello.

1148
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,400
You've arrived?

1149
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,720
You're here to take over
the position, aren't you?

1150
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,000
Huh?

1151
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,360
I will become the head of the company,
no matter the cost.

1152
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,920
You can't take that away from me.

1153
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,600
What do you think, Father?

1154
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,520
Firing is the only way.

1155
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,160
- Who?
- Me?

1156
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,440
That's enough. He's confused.

1157
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,520
- Okay, Ryujin.
- Hi.

1158
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,320
We're familiar with each other, right?

1159
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,120
I want to ask you...

1160
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:10,200
What is one of the important qualities

1161
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,220
you want

1162
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,800
your partner to possess?

1163
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,680
For me, I think...

1164
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,360
It's the ability to create
a comfortable working environment

1165
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,700
- or
- Right.

1166
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,400
be a positive source of energy
for one another.

1167
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,040
What if one day...

1168
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,320
your partner has negative energy?

1169
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,760
How would you deal with him?

1170
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,120
If he has that energy...

1171
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,640
There is a reason behind everything.

1172
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,080
So, I need to talk to him

1173
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,720
so that we can understand each other.

1174
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,720
There must be reasons
why he has become that way,

1175
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
so I need to talk to him.

1176
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,680
How are things currently?

1177
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,800
Currently?

1178
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,040
How confident are you about choosing
that person as your partner, and vice versa?

1179
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,800
I'm fairly confident.

1180
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,560
- Whoa!
- However...

1181
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,960
- You don't know if it's the same for him?
- Yes.

1182
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Let me be clear.
You mean PatJi, correct?

1183
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
You were confident that you'd be
each other's partner, right?

1184
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,120
What changed that?

1185
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,840
What did you come across?

1186
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,680
Well, I...

1187
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,520
He came to me.

1188
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,080
I get that this is the show for Gen 5.

1189
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,480
We're Gen 4.

1190
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,960
Would it be weird if we were to

1191
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,520
pick each other?

1192
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,360
Honestly,
I'm opening up to everyone new here.

1193
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,840
However,
PatJi remains my only option.

1194
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,760
- Oh?
- Whoa.

1195
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,800
He's making it clear.

1196
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,640
- ♫Kiminoto♫
- You have no idea how it'd be for PatJi, right?

1197
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,800
Yes, yes.

1198
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,960
- Well...
- Just enjoy and go with the flow.

1199
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,880
I believe many things
will help you two connect.

1200
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,880
- Yeah.
- However, if you two don't become a thing,

1201
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,960
or things don't go as planned,

1202
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,320
you'll still have more chances. It's okay.

1203
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,160
This show isn't...

1204
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,280
- This show isn't the end for anyone here.
- Yeah.

1205
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,920
You chose to come to this show

1206
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,520
mainly because
you want to improve yourself.

1207
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,880
- Yes.
- You want to try things you've never done before,

1208
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,840
right?

1209
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,760
As for having a partner,
it may seem like the core of the show,

1210
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,720
but what is truly significant is
the friendship you all foster.

1211
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,680
Having the chance to use your talents
is much more important.

1212
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,680
What I'd like to add is

1213
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,520
your self-confidence.

1214
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,600
- You need to find a way
- Right.

1215
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,360
to make yourself
feel confident being here.

1216
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,800
I think you have the talent,

1217
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:32,040
but you're selling yourself short.

1218
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,280
I'm rooting for you.

1219
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,510
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1220
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,190
Hello.

1221
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:35,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

1222
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,960
- It's Wave.
- Wave.

1223
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,440
How old are you?

1224
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,320
- I'm 19.
- I see.

1225
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,560
Why do you want to join
the entertainment industry?

1226
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,160
Why do you want to be here?

1227
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,360
I've actually been wanting to be
an actor since I was little.

1228
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,000
I felt like I'd received the opportunity,

1229
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,800
so I decided to go for it.

1230
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,480
Let me give you
a piece of advice, first of all.

1231
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,840
When it comes to your gestures,

1232
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
I'd like you to be more confident.

1233
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,360
And be careful with pursing your lips.

1234
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,920
It'd make you look stiff.

1235
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,560
To give you an example...

1236
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,200
- If I...
- He just relaxed his lips.

1237
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,120
Yeah, yeah.

1238
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,080
If you always do this,

1239
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,840
it'd create
a sense of anticipation, like...

1240
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,240
"What are you going to say or do next?"

1241
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,680
It'll make you look tense.

1242
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,080
However,
you have a very lovely smile.

1243
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,000
Yes.

1244
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,360
- Thank you.
- I think your smile is something that could make

1245
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,800
- a lot of people fall for you.
- Yeah.

1246
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,400
No matter what happens,

1247
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,040
don't forget to smile.
That's my suggestion.

1248
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,840
If you smile,
I think everything will turn out well.

1249
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,840
I feel you.
We're just sharing the experience.

1250
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,720
- Yes.
- Keep learning.

1251
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,440
It's just like what Namping said.

1252
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,040
Knowing yourself now

1253
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,000
will be an advantage if you can change.

1254
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,480
Still, keep it natural.

1255
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,720
I can see a certain charm
and charisma in you

1256
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,480
- when you're yourself.
- Yes.

1257
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,640
- It's right there.
- Can't wait to see you shine.

1258
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,440
Yeah, like...

1259
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,520
Just let it out.

1260
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,280
You're simply too afraid to do so.

1261
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,680
- Right.
- Yes.

1262
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,520
Alright. Two more questions.

1263
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,440
What do you think about
having a partner?

1264
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,160
Oh...

1265
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,160
To be honest,
I do want to have a partner.

1266
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,240
However, it takes time to find one.

1267
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,280
Has anyone caught your eye?

1268
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,820
- Someone who makes you go, "Oh?"
- Actually, there's one

1269
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,640
that I simply feel comfortable with.

1270
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,600
Oh...

1271
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,160
Did he approach you,

1272
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,040
or did you approach him?

1273
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,040
It was both, actually.

1274
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,960
Feel free to take your time.

1275
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,560
After the show... I mean...

1276
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,880
If you're uncertain
or feel like the time here isn't enough,

1277
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,840
don't rush it.
You're still so young.

1278
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,520
More opportunities will come your way
after the show's over.

1279
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,240
- You'll get to meet a lot more new people,
- Exactly.

1280
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,360
or someone with the right chemistry,

1281
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,720
someone you might
feel confident with at that time.

1282
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,880
Are there any questions?

1283
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,520
Feel free to ask us anything.

1284
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,840
Well, I...

1285
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,000
I often feel inferior to others.

1286
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,000
When I have to
compete against others, I get...

1287
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,280
extremely nervous.

1288
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,400
Consider this show part of the experience.

1289
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,800
It's one of the main points of this show.

1290
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,800
I think right now,

1291
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,880
- I just want you to keep going.
- Right.

1292
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,120
You can bridge your skill gaps here.

1293
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,320
Just don't think you're bad,
because you can improve.

1294
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,040
I want you to find some kind of motivation.

1295
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,240
It can be someone

1296
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,600
you find inspiring.

1297
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,920
Or it can be any simple thing
that motivates you,

1298
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,680
and when you do it,
it makes you feel passionate

1299
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,880
and enjoy yourself.

1300
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,520
Okay.

1301
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

1302
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,240
Thank you.

1303
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,880
- Hello.
- Hello!

1304
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,040
Coming here with a smile.

1305
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,560
- Hello, there.
- You look different from when we first met.

1306
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,280
- I'm nervous.
- You were quiet back then.

1307
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,370
You want to pursue acting instead, don't you?

1308
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,760
You told me that

1309
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,840
you want to do more acting.

1310
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,320
Why? You don't see yourself as a singer

1311
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,840
and want to act instead?

1312
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,240
Or do you just want to find out

1313
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,560
whether you want to be
a jack-of-all-trades?

1314
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
I just feel like...

1315
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,160
It's what I'll be doing in the future,

1316
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,480
singing, dancing, and performing.

1317
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,040
I just want to dip my toes into acting.

1318
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,360
I want to do that first.

1319
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,120
Acting is the foundation,

1320
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,840
and it goes hand in hand
with singing and dancing.

1321
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,400
That's why I want to learn acting.

1322
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,920
If someone told you

1323
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,360
that you should've stuck with being an idol
instead of becoming an actor,

1324
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,160
how would you respond to that?

1325
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,520
I think...

1326
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,840
These careers complement each other.

1327
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,680
They naturally go together.

1328
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,240
I never understand
why they have to be separated.

1329
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,040
Each one is good on its own.

1330
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,560
- Yes.
- I see.

1331
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,160
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.

1332
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,920
It's about getting to know
and understand yourself.

1333
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,000
You need to be able to
answer your own question,

1334
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,120
or at least identify

1335
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,000
what drives you to be here and do this.

1336
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,720
Since you come across as sociable.

1337
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,040
Your eye contact is excellent,

1338
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,480
and you always smile.

1339
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,240
This makes you look relaxed and open.

1340
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,120
It's just that the content within you,

1341
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,520
- if you manage to get it organized,
- Yes.

1342
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,400
will captivate the audience.

1343
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,560
I do know that you have big dreams.

1344
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,000
It's something you need to work on.

1345
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,400
This will make you...

1346
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,240
You'll improve from this as well,

1347
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,320
once you've set the bar in your career.

1348
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,800
You're pretty popular here, aren't you?

1349
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,800
Kind of?

1350
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,600
Not really.

1351
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,480
No?

1352
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,360
Maybe it's just...

1353
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,440
But you haven't had a chance to stay home
and eat instant noodles as I did.

1354
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,800
It might not be a thing this season.

1355
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,480
Might not?

1356
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Do you want to experience it?

1357
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,920
I'm fine with that.

1358
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,160
Whoa!

1359
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,760
I heard

1360
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,720
you've got a couple of people
in mind, haven't you?

1361
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,360
It's just that
we need to get to know each other more.

1362
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,640
It's not just me choosing him.

1363
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,320
We have to choose each other.

1364
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,280
Yeah.

1365
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,440
I hope you find a compatible partner.

1366
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,560
However, as I've said,

1367
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,080
we're not in a rush.

1368
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,040
If you're still uncertain
after the show,

1369
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,640
you don't have to decide yet.

1370
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,880
If you're certain,
go for it and see how it turns out.

1371
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,480
I'm fine with anything.

1372
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,880
- Sure.
- Okay. Thank you.

1373
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,680
- Yay, great job.
- Thank you.

1374
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

1375
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,120
Alright, Otto.

1376
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,640
We know that you're someone
who truly stays true to yourself

1377
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,800
and expresses who you are very clearly.

1378
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,760
When you take a clear stance,

1379
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,840
there will naturally be people
who like you and people who don't.

1380
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,470
How do you deal with comments, criticism,

1381
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,910
or anything that might affect
your ability to stay true to yourself?

1382
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,810
First of all, I don't think
I'd ever change who I am for anyone.

1383
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,600
But I'll consider whether the feedback

1384
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,200
is constructive criticism
or just personal bias against me.

1385
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,400
I choose to focus on

1386
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,680
what I can actually improve,

1387
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,680
but I wouldn't let it
put too much pressure on me.

1388
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,120
Right, about the partner.

1389
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,000
I have a question.

1390
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,000
Well, I've heard some buzz...

1391
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,840
from the birds around here.

1392
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,400
They've been saying that

1393
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,040
there's a pretty high chance

1394
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,760
that you're quite strongly committed
to this person.

1395
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,680
Is that true?

1396
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,200
That's the first question.

1397
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,680
The other question is...

1398
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,360
when you're this committed,

1399
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,800
what do you think
the pros and cons are?

1400
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,600
As for choosing my partner,

1401
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,520
I actually have someone
I want to work with

1402
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
or someone...

1403
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,720
I really click with.

1404
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,520
You know, someone
I think can go along with me.

1405
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,240
But I also think that
being committed to just one person

1406
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,560
means you're not opening yourself up
to other opportunities.

1407
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:56,320
At the same time, having someone
you want to work with is a good thing.

1408
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,880
When you were on the other show,

1409
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,920
you didn't get to debut.

1410
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,960
How disappointed were you,

1411
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,840
and what motivated you to keep going?

1412
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,440
I got eliminated at that time,

1413
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,720
but I also felt that, at that age,

1414
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,760
with all the skills and everything I had,

1415
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,520
I was already happy with the result.

1416
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,520
I was happy to have gotten that far

1417
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,000
after trying my best

1418
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,520
and giving it everything I had.

1419
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,040
I have no regrets.

1420
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,120
However, I'm not gonna stop
chasing my dream.

1421
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,960
Up to this point,

1422
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,720
I feel like
I'm getting closer to my dream.

1423
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,320
Like...

1424
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,480
I've dreamed of being on stage,

1425
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,480
and I think I'm close
to finally reaching that point.

1426
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,280
So you think being in DOMUNDI

1427
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,320
has brought you closer to your dream?

1428
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,120
Absolutely.

1429
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,080
I always go all out.

1430
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,160
I'm...

1431
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,060
really glad to be here.

1432
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah, like...

1433
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,240
I give my all
in everything I do,

1434
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,280
and I'm really passionate about it.

1435
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,840
I enjoy being here,
and it makes me happy.

1436
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,560
I mean...

1437
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,120
Let me tell you this.

1438
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,520
Everyone has their own timing.

1439
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,360
Everything we've gone through
comes together to bring us to this point.

1440
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,160
Keep it as experience, as memories,
and as fuel to move forward.

1441
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,640
Don't stop improving yourself.
Just keep chasing your dream.

1442
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,480
One day, your time will come.

1443
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,480
- Thank you.
- Those with passion always succeed,

1444
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,000
and I can see that passion in you.

1445
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,400
Okay.

1446
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,120
- Yay, thank you.
- Thank you.

1447
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Thank you.

1448
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1449
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
Are you nervous?

1450
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,960
Yes, I am.

1451
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,640
I heard you haven't gotten
to go out much yet. Is that right?

1452
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,440
That's right.

1453
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,200
May I ask if you've ever felt worn out
or sad at times?

1454
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,040
With such a limited amount of time,

1455
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,500
there's a lot of pressure.

1456
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:14,540
I want to choose someone
who's willing to walk this journey with me.

1457
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,630
Do I feel worn out? Yes, sometimes.

1458
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,640
When I saw the other members...

1459
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,280
click and get along well,

1460
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,240
I started to...

1461
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,080
Like, when I helped them break through,

1462
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,960
I ended up feeling lonely myself.

1463
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,440
You're more of a Cupid.

1464
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,760
- Yeah.
- A Cupid.

1465
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,120
But I deal with those feelings

1466
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,400
by reminding myself that there are still
people who recognize my potential.

1467
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,880
When I know that
they still believe in me,

1468
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,400
it makes me want to keep going.

1469
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,680
What's your biggest challenge right now?

1470
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,440
Everyone's about to debut
at such a young age,

1471
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,920
but I'm relatively older.

1472
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,080
It makes me feel like...

1473
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,430
I don't fit in with the others.

1474
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,440
I'm close to all of them, though.

1475
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,930
It's just that there's a chemistry
that feels very different,

1476
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,560
perhaps in terms of
experience or attitude.

1477
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,680
And that's pretty challenging
when it comes to finding a partner.

1478
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,560
Especially since this gen...

1479
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,240
probably has the youngest average age
across all 3 gens.

1480
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,000
I have another question.

1481
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,040
If you were to choose
your partner today,

1482
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,760
what is one thing
you would discuss with them

1483
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,000
about your vision?

1484
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,080
What would you say
is most important to you?

1485
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,280
I've always believed that a partner
will go through both pain and joy with me.

1486
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:39,680
So when we have to answer questions
from the media, we do it together.

1487
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,280
Whoever is stronger in a certain area

1488
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,760
steps up to help,
and no one gets left behind.

1489
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,080
If mistakes happen, it's okay.
We can forgive each other

1490
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,460
because I believe
mistakes are part of learning.

1491
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,120
We learn from our mistakes
to become who we are today,

1492
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,080
and we must also learn
to forgive ourselves.

1493
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,840
Okay.

1494
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,560
Sure, finding a partner does matter,

1495
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,760
but it's not everything.

1496
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,920
So don't stress too much about it.

1497
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,120
That's my advice.

1498
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,870
- You actually have a childlike side.
- Right.

1499
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:09,790
I don't want you to feel labeled
as being older or anything like that.

1500
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,890
You can just enjoy the moment

1501
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,960
and have fun with the others.

1502
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,960
You don't need to feel like
you have to take care of anyone.

1503
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,720
I believe this will allow...

1504
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,920
- a different charm to come through,
- Right.

1505
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,100
one where you don't have to
worry so much about others.

1506
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,720
It might lead to a new kind of chemistry

1507
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,470
where the others

1508
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:34,480
get to see another side of you
beyond just being older.

1509
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,180
- Let your brightness come out fully.
- Right.

1510
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,360
It'll help you grow

1511
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,880
even more than having a partner.

1512
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,400
- Good luck, Porsche.
- Okay.

1513
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1514
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
Thank you.

1515
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

1516
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,760
- Hi.
- Hi, Aof, Namping.

1517
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,960
You've been with DOMUNDI
for over a year now.

1518
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,240
What do you think is something
you still need to improve on

1519
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,480
and want to do better?

1520
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,110
There are actually a lot of things.

1521
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,430
I'm not even satisfied
with my singing and acting skills yet.

1522
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,240
As for talking to the media and people,

1523
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,360
I think I can do better there, too.

1524
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,920
Since we've already met you many times,

1525
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,700
we know how sweet and playful you are.

1526
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,440
You're just you.

1527
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,460
It makes it easy to chat with you
and laugh without trying.

1528
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,160
If you can find a way
to let those charms shine through

1529
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,360
so people notice them more easily,

1530
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,320
it would be really good for you.

1531
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,160
Just be yourself.

1532
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,640
If your style is deadpan humor,
then embrace it.

1533
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,520
Go all out.

1534
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,570
For example, Keng...

1535
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,480
has a completely different
sense of humor than mine.

1536
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,080
He has his own pace and style,

1537
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,840
and one of his strengths is that

1538
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,280
he's not really afraid.

1539
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,800
He just goes for it.

1540
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,720
Even if the joke doesn't land,
or even if it does,

1541
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,920
the fans will see it for themselves.

1542
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,320
If they like it,
they'll naturally like it.

1543
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,960
- Right.
- Not every joke has to be funny.

1544
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,350
There will be people who appreciate you
for being who you are.

1545
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,920
At the very least,
you have to show it first

1546
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,880
without harming anyone.

1547
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,470
No bullying jokes,

1548
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,730
nothing that makes others feel wounded.

1549
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:26,000
It's simply about doing your part well.

1550
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,880
And I know you can do it.

1551
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,840
What about your partner?

1552
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,120
- I was pretty stressed.
- Wow.

1553
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,000
But right now,

1554
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,280
I actually have someone in mind.

1555
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,920
However, I still want
some advice from you.

1556
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,520
Honestly, you're here

1557
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,420
to prove many things, right?

1558
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,360
- To open up and prove things.
- Right.

1559
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,480
So, for me, there's not much else to say.

1560
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,080
Just follow your heart.

1561
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,240
I mean...

1562
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,040
when choosing a partner, the key is
whether you feel comfortable around them.

1563
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,120
Second, do you share the same vision?

1564
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,520
Then go talk to the person
you're ready to walk this path with

1565
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,680
- and see if you share the same views.
- Okay.

1566
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,090
With the program ending soon,

1567
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:13,810
I hope you find
the answer that's right for you.

1568
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,240
Seriously,

1569
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,360
if you really don't know the answer,

1570
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,280
have your fortune read.

1571
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,000
Wait...

1572
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,600
Yes. Trust me.

1573
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,000
It's the easiest way.

1574
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,840
I do check my fortune, too.

1575
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,320
- Really?
- My feelings are complicated sometimes.

1576
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,240
Your fortune
can help guide your decision,

1577
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,960
- along with your own thinking.
- Let's bring Net Siraphop next time.

1578
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,710
Let's have him read everyone's cards

1579
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:34,790
and tell them who to choose.

1580
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,320
Come on, it could work.

1581
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,280
- Alright.
- If you can't decide, give it a try.

1582
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,560
Take your time, though.
Don't stress over it.

1583
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,840
Okay. Thank you.

1584
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1585
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,640
- Hello.
- Hi!

1586
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,800
It's Pete.

1587
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
- The last person of the day.
- Our last person.

1588
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,150
How's it been meeting
all the Gen 5 members here?

1589
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:56,150
At first, it was a bit awkward for me.

1590
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,760
However, as time went on,
I found them to be

1591
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,880
really sweet,
and I got along with them well.

1592
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,840
First of all,
props to you for being self-assured

1593
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,520
and maintaining eye contact while speaking.

1594
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,790
- It makes you look charming when you speak.
- Right?

1595
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:11,350
You look nice and cool
even when doing nothing,

1596
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:15,280
but you look even more charming
when you speak.

1597
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,680
Okay, now that you've dipped your toes
into the industry...

1598
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,760
- I mean, you've barely seen half of the industry...
- Yeah.

1599
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,800
Despite that, how are you feeling?

1600
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,360
I feel like...

1601
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,880
To be honest,
this is my first step in the industry.

1602
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,520
I'm lucky that DOMUNDI
is the company I signed with.

1603
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,520
It's like...

1604
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,280
It allows me to learn many things,

1605
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,680
such as doing missions,
with the first one being a portrait shoot

1606
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,020
and the second one
being singing and performing.

1607
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,880
These things suit me fairly well.

1608
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,410
We can't just jump into

1609
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:48,520
doing something harder than
what we're capable of.

1610
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,800
It's the first step that allows me to grow.

1611
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,240
Are you serious about having a partner?

1612
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,720
Actually, I've been
thinking a bit about it,

1613
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,980
wondering if this person
would be compatible with me.

1614
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:04,020
However, since I'm still young
and new to the industry,

1615
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,480
I think it might be too early,

1616
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,640
and I shouldn't jump the gun.

1617
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,040
- Agreed.
- That's great.

1618
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,720
Yeah, you're only 17, you know?

1619
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,140
- Yes.
- You've still got a lot of time

1620
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,439
to think about it.

1621
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:17,490
I'm not against it, though.

1622
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:20,680
- Right.
- If you've found a partner, I'm cool with that.

1623
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,160
At the end of the day, it's work,

1624
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,920
and you have to know your boundaries
and the limits of your age.

1625
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,319
It's something that
we're always concerned about.

1626
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,760
- So don't worry about this.
- I get it.

1627
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,560
Here's one important thing.

1628
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,120
I want you to learn
as much as you can from here.

1629
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,080
Of course,
there are more challenges ahead.

1630
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,200
- We're only halfway through.
- Right.

1631
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,040
There's a lot more
that will put you to the test.

1632
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,520
- There's one thing we'd like to know.
- Yes?

1633
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,640
You're very new here

1634
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,720
and to the world of social media,

1635
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,960
since you rarely post anything.

1636
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
- He barely posts anything?
- Yes.

1637
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,680
- He's new to many social media platforms.
- Yes.

1638
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:57,450
Let's say you came across
a very negative comment.

1639
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,080
As a 17-year-old boy,
how would you deal with it?

1640
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,189
It depends on what it's about.

1641
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:08,350
If the negativity isn't reasonable,
I'll just ignore it.

1642
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,200
If it's a valid criticism,

1643
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,359
I'll certainly think about it,

1644
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,760
and maybe I can learn from it.

1645
01:09:16,649 --> 01:09:17,770
I want you to be strong,

1646
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:22,960
because social media isn't that simple.

1647
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,279
I'm simply worried about you

1648
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,479
since you're this young.

1649
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,680
I just wanted to be straight with you.

1650
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,319
You're mature beyond your years.

1651
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,850
- The mindset and the worldview.
- Yes, these things.

1652
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:35,680
I just want to tell you to
feel free to talk to me.

1653
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,760
Okay, good luck.

1654
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,600
- Good luck out there.
- Thank you.

1655
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1656
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,399
Okay, it's done.

1657
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:46,560
It's a bit of a shame that Namping
has something to attend to.

1658
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,160
So I'm the only one left
who will announce

1659
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,880
who Namping and I are giving the gift to.

1660
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,840
Of course,
the winner gets to choose a friend

1661
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,760
to spend Friendship Time with.

1662
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,840
Well...

1663
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,800
Are you guys ready to hear the results?

1664
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,390
- Yes, we are.
- We're ready.

1665
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:06,460
Ready? Okay.

1666
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,880
First of all, I want to say that
you all did very well.

1667
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,880
Also, this isn't an indicator that
you have the best mindset,

1668
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,680
nor does it mean you have
a bad mindset if you didn't win.

1669
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,200
Given the short amount of time,
it's too early to decide

1670
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,630
exactly 100%.

1671
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:25,990
I just want to see who can give us
the most energy.

1672
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,420
The first one...

1673
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,720
is...

1674
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:43,530
Porsche.

1675
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,680
Thank you.

1676
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,750
I was shocked.

1677
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:54,130
I didn't expect to win anything.

1678
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,450
I simply wanted to give it my all
in every mission.

1679
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,880
I'm delighted, actually.

1680
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,360
We can't deny that
his answer was excellent.

1681
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,840
We got to see his mindset, and...

1682
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,840
He wasn't shy to say that,

1683
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:09,690
despite his age,
he has a big dream he'd like to accomplish.

1684
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:12,160
We can clearly see what his passion is,

1685
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,400
and he's exactly
what the challenge is looking for.

1686
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,510
- Yay.
- Wow.

1687
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,350
If there's the first person,
that means there's a second person.

1688
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,000
It's neck and neck, really.

1689
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,920
The second winner is...

1690
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,160
Certainly.

1691
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,560
Otto.

1692
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,960
You're sitting next to each other, too.

1693
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,760
I'm glad.

1694
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,400
This might be...

1695
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,880
If this counts as a mission,
it's the first one I've won,

1696
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,160
and I'm happy about that.

1697
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,600
Moreover, this is the first time
Porsche has won a mission.

1698
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,440
I'm happy that we both won.

1699
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,480
In my eyes,
Otto managed to show us a magic moment.

1700
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,680
Despite the interview being so short,

1701
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,850
he managed to give us a clear picture
of his past experiences.

1702
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,760
It showed us how much of a fighter he was.

1703
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,320
Listening to him
made me tear up on the inside,

1704
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,640
thinking about what he'd been through.

1705
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,720
That's why I was touched by Otto's words.

1706
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,280
However, there's a special prize.

1707
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:24,320
Namping understands
the significance of having a partner,

1708
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,750
and he wants these two to
learn about and understand each other

1709
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:34,240
so they can see what their future holds.

1710
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,280
These two people are...

1711
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,920
PatJi and Ryujin.

1712
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,690
They're one of the pairs
that made me think long and hard.

1713
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,760
Maybe it's time for them
to check in with each other.

1714
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,920
If this continues
past the halfway mark,

1715
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:00,990
it'll be hard for them.

1716
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,750
I'm concerned about them,

1717
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,400
as they might have expectations
for their second attempt.

1718
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,810
That's why I asked for a special request,

1719
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,760
a gift that gives them another chance to
open up to each other

1720
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,880
so they can see how things might unfold.

1721
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Okay.

1722
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:22,560
Before ending my section,

1723
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,200
I'd like to see the reactions.

1724
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,920
So, I want you two to pick a friend

1725
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,480
to have dinner with.

1726
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,120
Oh, my God.

1727
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,520
This is bad.

1728
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,120
What's going to happen from here on out?

1729
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,120
Otto, I'd like you to go first.

1730
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,880
Who's the person
you'd like to have dinner with?

1731
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,360
Well...

1732
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,320
I don't know what's going to happen next,

1733
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,570
but I hope that this Friendship Time

1734
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:50,130
sparks something delightful.

1735
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,840
Now, this is hard.

1736
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,080
I can say it now, right?

1737
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,920
The one I want to have dinner with...

1738
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,480
is...

1739
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,240
Phupha.

1740
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,400
- Oh?
- Whoa!

1741
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,160
Whoa.

1742
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,480
- Whoa...
- What?

1743
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,520
It was very hard for me.

1744
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,800
Well...

1745
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,720
I've spent Friendship Time with North,

1746
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,930
but I haven't spent it with Phupha.

1747
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:29,360
I also haven't gotten to
talk to him that much.

1748
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,040
Maybe this is the opportunity
that I get to do just that,

1749
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,920
talking to him a bit more.

1750
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,480
This is a surprise, really.

1751
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,020
During the Friendship Time,

1752
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:50,210
it was obvious
that I wasn't Otto's first option.

1753
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,180
This caught me off guard.

1754
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,320
I didn't think he'd choose me.

1755
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,680
It was...

1756
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,240
It was a bit beyond my expectations.

1757
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,920
Still, it feels great

1758
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,760
that we'll get to talk to each other more.

1759
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,160
Okay.

1760
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,640
Next up...

1761
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It's Porsche.

1762
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,760
At first, I had so many options:

1763
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,320
Pete and Ryujin.

1764
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,640
Right. The one I'd like to spend
this Friendship Time with is...

1765
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,840
Pung.

1766
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,960
Okay.

1767
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,040
The moment
I was about to make my decision,

1768
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,640
I turned around and stared at Pung.

1769
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,800
He looked sad and a bit hungry.

1770
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,120
So I chose him.

1771
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,880
When I first heard it...

1772
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,160
I got excited.

1773
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,840
I was surprised, excited,

1774
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,720
and flabbergasted.

1775
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,520
It was kind of shocking.

1776
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,040
I hope you get to know each other more.

1777
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,720
Don't be sorry if you weren't chosen.

1778
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,040
You can still get to know each other
back at the house,

1779
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,800
cooking and eating instant noodles
like Namping did.

1780
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,120
- Instant noodles.
- Let's go.

1781
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:04,920
I'll cook them for you guys.

1782
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,010
Make the most of this moment, okay?

1783
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:11,000
There are more challenges to come
that will put your skills to the test.

1784
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,640
As I've said, this is a very short moment.

1785
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,760
I want you to do your best,

1786
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,650
especially for the final performance.

1787
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,840
I'll be back here, watching you guys

1788
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,600
and seeing how you perform.

1789
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,760
I hope you get good news on that day.

1790
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

1791
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,080
Thank you, thank you.

1792
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,200
Do you like sushi?

1793
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,120
How about sashimi?

1794
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,560
I do...

1795
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,720
I do have it pretty often.

1796
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,960
How are things going?

1797
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,440
I mean, with everyone in the house.

1798
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,880
It's been fun.

1799
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,280
How about you?

1800
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,920
It's been fun.

1801
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,240
And we've met Namping today, too.

1802
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,440
- Right.
- How was it?

1803
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,440
Do you still want Namping
to be your partner?

1804
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:03,920
Whoa...

1805
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,800
That's impossible.

1806
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,440
He already has a partner.

1807
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,640
How about you?

1808
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,600
What kind of person do you like?

1809
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,320
Someone...

1810
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,560
For me, a partner is...

1811
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,600
another version of myself.

1812
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,840
I want to find someone
I can share everything with.

1813
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,640
It's a mutual kind of sharing, right?

1814
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,320
Yeah, being a partner...

1815
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,640
Is it when you give something positive,
and they give it back?

1816
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,680
- How?
- Oh...

1817
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,720
Can you explain that?

1818
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,320
You give them good energy,
and they give good energy back, right?

1819
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,720
It's like...

1820
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,120
On this journey, there will be
both good days and challenging days.

1821
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,400
And you'd probably want
to share everything with someone, right?

1822
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,320
So I want my partner to be that person.

1823
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,200
And I think you...

1824
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,280
You played 'Chayod' before,

1825
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,200
and I know there were days
when you didn't get enough sleep,

1826
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,880
days when you were stressed or upset,

1827
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,020
and days when you felt down, right?

1828
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:04,280
I want to find someone

1829
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,520
who can make me feel better.

1830
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,560
You know, someone...

1831
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,660
- I'm comfortable with.
-Whoa.

1832
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,920
Listen, Porsche.

1833
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,400
You will find them.

1834
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,400
Yeah, 'cause...

1835
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,040
you're such a nice person.

1836
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,440
- I mean it.
- Why do you think so?

1837
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,840
- What?
- Tell me why.

1838
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,360
Whenever I needed advice from you,

1839
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,560
you were always there for me.

1840
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,480
You'd always explain things to me.

1841
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:33,120
But once you find a partner,

1842
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,160
let me check them out first, okay?

1843
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,360
We'll help check them out,
because we're like...

1844
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:43,840
'Gen 5 Checking Porsche's Partner Gang.'

1845
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,160
Could that be possible?

1846
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,040
But all of you
already have your own partner.

1847
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:49,800
Well,

1848
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,760
we adore you.

1849
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,200
Even I adore you.

1850
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,560
We like you for who you are.

1851
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,760
We see you as our brother.

1852
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,240
You know...

1853
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,440
Don't you wanna do that
for Pete instead?

1854
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,920
That's strange.

1855
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,160
I mean...

1856
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,200
Come on.

1857
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,080
I mean, if you ever find a partner,

1858
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,610
let us check them out first.

1859
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,730
Yeah, sure.

1860
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,200
- Yay.
- Yay!

1861
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,040
Don't go, Khem.

1862
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:32,800
What?

1863
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,240
Dad!

1864
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,880
What brings you here,
Your Royal Highness?

1865
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,800
The dialogue felt awkward to him.

1866
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,840
I've decided.

1867
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,880
You have?

1868
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,080
I chose this person.

1869
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,240
This one.
