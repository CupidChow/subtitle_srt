00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,760
From this moment on...

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,700
Let's go after our dreams.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
Let's do this together.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,000
Don't look at me too much.
I'm blushing.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,200
Thank you, Otto,

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,640
for trusting me
to help you reach your dream.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,560
Loving yourself never hurts.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,480
- Right?
- Mm.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,280
Don't regret not choosing me.

10
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,240
Hello.

11
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,310
Welcome to

'DMD Friendship the Reality,
The THIRD Chapter: The Final Stage!'

13
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,160
This is the final stage
of our search for talented artists

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,790
and actors for the new DOMUNDI series.

15
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,500
♫No need for Cupid,
we click like never before♫

16
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,280
♫The closer we are, the more I'm sure♫

17

♫It's bizarre, don't you agree?♫

20

♫What a surprise we found each other♫

21
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,110
♫I don't know where you've been♫

♫But we've got the same vibe♫

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
♫Maybe give it a try, alright?♫

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,720
♫I wonder why my heart just clicks,♫

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
♫Wonder why, wonder why♫

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360

Please give it up for Gen 5
and their performance, 'My No.1 Duo.'

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Welcome, boys.
Hello to the nine of you.

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,480
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,880
This is Gen 5's very first
group performance.

82
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,480
But I gotta say, this is the last stage

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
for you guys to prove

84
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,730
who will be the Best Performance.

85
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,840
First, let me introduce you
to the three judges.

86
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
The first

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,840
is someone who has grown
alongside the previous gens,

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,440
overseeing their vocal development,

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Instructor P. Prapruet Tongthanee.

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

91
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,080
[Vocal instructor]

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
Our next judge

93
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,280
is another mentor who's done a great job
shaping DOMUNDI's artists.

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,120
He's a spectacular acting coach,

95
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:51,480
and he's been directing
many series with DOMUNDI.

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,760
It's none other than him.

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Please give a round of applause to
Instructor Kla, Nathawat Piyanonpong.

98
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,040
Hello.

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,120
And for our next judge,

100
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,520
we have someone
all DOMUNDI artists call "Dad,"

101
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,480
"Friend,"

102
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,920
and "Brother."

103
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,200
The list goes on,

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,640
because he's everything
to the DOMUNDI family,

105
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,680
including the founder
and the CEO of DOMUNDI,

106
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,160
Aoftion Kittipat Champa.

107
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Please give it up for him.

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Now that we've introduced
our three judges,

109
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
we also have special guests

110
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,960
who will serve as the audience
for Gen 5's performances

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
and represent the previous gens.

112
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,800
The first is Park from Gen 1.

113
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,200
- Hi.
- Bro, bro.

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,600
- Bro.
- My bro Park.

115
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,159
Next up, we have
Tutor and Yim from Gen 2.

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,200
Wow...

117
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,760
For Gen 3, we have TeeTee.

118
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,280
Hello.

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,320
And we have many people
joining us from Gen 4:

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
Ryujin,

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,160
and last but not least, PatJi.

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,140
Ryujin and PatJi

127
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,690
are also contestants in Gen 5.

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,960
Alright, this stage is
another important competition

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,840
as we're looking for
the Best Performance.

130
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,360
Each of the nine boys
has to prepare a special performance

131
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,200
for this stage.

132
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,760
The points they receive here

133
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
will be added to their scores
from previous missions

134
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,679
to determine the Best Performance.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,559
And the Best Performance

136
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,680
will receive a guaranteed solo single
under DMD MUSIC.

137
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Without further ado,

138
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,800
let's have the boys
prepare for their own show.

139
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Please give them a round of applause.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,640
Our first contestant, Wave,

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680

188
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,800
Please give it up for Wave.

189
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,560
Wow, he's such a cutie.

190
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,320
Alright, Wave.

191
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,720
Let's hear some comments from the judges,

192
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,320
starting with Aoftion.

193
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
Alright, Wave.

194
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:16,560
I feel like
I'm attending my kid's school event.

195
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,320
Very cute. Such a cutie.

196
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,600
I have to say that,

197
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,360
even though you've had no experience

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
in either singing or dancing,

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,720
I have to give it up to you
for how expressive you are.

200
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,080
You have
such a distinct personality, Wave.

201
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,080
What I'd like to add

202
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,400
is that I want you to be more confident
in your stage performance,

203
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,520
but I understand
that it's a matter of experience.

204
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,360
Stuff like this takes a lot of time,

205
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
but I want to encourage you

206
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,960
because you have
a cool quality to your voice.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,720
You do. And...

208
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,000
like I said, you have
a distinct personality,

209
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
which allows your charisma
to really shine in your performance.

210
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,200
Even though you still looked
a little shy at times,

211
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,640
I want you to keep improving.

212
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Don't change your character.

213
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,620
Do improve, but keep that cuteness

214
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,440
and stay true to who you are.

215
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Alright.

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
Thank you.

217
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,240
Next, let's hear it from an older gen,

218
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Yim.

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,880
I used to be like him,

220
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,240
so I have to say that I understand
what it's like to start something new.

221
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,960
Considering this, having to be on stage
and standing right where you are,

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
this already exceeds our expectations.

223
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,400
When I did it, I completely froze

224
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,320
and zoned out entirely.

225
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,400
I want you to keep going.

226
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
You have a long way to go.

227
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,680
Thank you.

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,160
Those are some nice words.

229
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,840
Alright, what do you think, Wave?

230
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,720
Did you take anything away from Yim?

231
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,200
Yes... Yes, I did.

232
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
- You did?
- Yes...

233
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I need more experience.

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,880
Alright, that's it for our first show.

235
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,760
Please give it up for Wave.

236
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Alright.

237
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,080
The next person is North
with the song 'Magic.'

238
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,680
Oh, 'Magic'?

239
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,450
♫Is it my mind, or is this true?♫

240
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,840
♫Is it a dream that I'm going through?♫

241
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,660
♫What does my heart want me to do♫

242
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,560
♫Whenever I am near you?♫

243
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,320
♫Can't hide my own smiles,♫

244
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,760
♫Lost in the maze of my own mind♫

245
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,860
♫Wish to stay here right by your side,♫

246
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,860
♫Where my heart is no longer mine♫

247
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:04,420
♫Don't know what kind of spell you cast,♫

248
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,620
♫But it makes my heart beat so fast,♫

249
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:16,760
♫Losing myself whenever you walk past♫

250
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,580
♫Is this the love that will forever last?♫

251
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
♫Do you call this love?♫

252
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,680
♫Is this the love that will forever last?♫

253
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,260
♫Can't hide my own smiles,♫

254
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,460
♫Lost in the maze of my own mind♫

255
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,780
♫Wish to stay here right by your side,♫

256
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,520
♫Where my heart is no longer mine♫

257
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,240
♫Don't know what kind of spell you cast,♫

258
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,440
♫But it makes my heart beat so fast,♫

259
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,480
♫Losing myself whenever you walk past♫

260
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,220
♫Is this the love that will forever last?♫

261

♫Don't know what kind of spell you cast,♫

262
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,760

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,800

♫Is this the love that will forever last?♫

♫Do you call this love?♫

266
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,960
♫Is this the love that will forever last?♫

267
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,280
Please give it up to North!

268
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,290
Oh, wow!

269
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,850
Let's hear it from the judges.

270
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,640
Please be kind.

271
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
- Instructor P.
- Okay.

272
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
- Hello, North.
- Hello.

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,960
We didn't get to meet you
during the singing mission.

274
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,840
So it's the first time
we're hearing you sing loud and clear.

275
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,920
Today, all of us were surprised
and said the same thing

276
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
that you've got a great vocal tone.

277
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,360
This song isn't easy to sing either.

278
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,880
It might sound easy,

279
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,080
but there are fine details to it.

280
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,080
The tempo is also a challenge.

281
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,960
The difficult part is this:

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
whether it's the part you're singing

283
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,200
or the emotions you're trying to convey,

284
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,720
you have to maintain the tone
and expression throughout the song.

285
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,520
Storytelling-wise,

286
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,040
you were able to immerse us.

287
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,040
However, what you can improve
on your singing side of things

288
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,400
is the dynamics in your voice.

289
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
On top of that, it's your enunciation.

290
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,800
There are some words
you can make sound clearer,

291
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,800
for instance, 'smiles' and 'love.'

292
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,400
You might want to work on that.

293
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Still, I hope you keep it going.

294
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,120
I think your voice has so much potential.

295
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,480
Yes, thank you very much.

296
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Thank you.

297
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,200
Now, let's hear it from your senior, JJ.

298
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
Hi, North.

299
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,580
Hello.

300
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,170
After hearing you sing,

301
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,720
by the end, I felt like...

302
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
"Hey, I want to hear more.

303
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,360
Can we get to the next one?"

304
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,620
- Huh?
- Oh, no, not the silence.

305
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,210
I'm kidding!

306
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,560
No, I mean...

307
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
All jokes aside...

308
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,200
I think you're someone with a voice that...

309
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,200
Your voice is a gift.

310
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,970
It's something that not everyone
can achieve, even with training.

311
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,970
You have what it takes, really.

312
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,600
I also saw you using techniques,
such as ad-libbing and so on.

313
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,440
That intrigued me.

314
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,040
You have the potential.

315
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,570
If you get to study under Instructor P.,
the judge sitting over here,

316
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,560
you'll be able to achieve so much
in this department,

317
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,560
and you'll be able to go very far.

318
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
Thank you.

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
Thank you so much, North.

320
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,520
- Thank you.
- Please take a rest.

321
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,840
Thank you.

322
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,640
Next up, it's Copper
with the song, 'Silent Mode.'

323
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,480
♫It might seem like I don't care,
giving you the cold shoulder♫

324
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,560
♫I might reply to your text so slowly,
like I've got nothing to say♫

325
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,840

329
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,040
♫I might be a bit slow,
not because I don't feel it,♫

330
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,400
♫But I'm worried you'll misunderstand me♫

331
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,480
♫What should we do?
(What should we do?)♫

332
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,320
♫Should we be lovers?♫

333
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,160
♫'Cause I'm not a good talker
(And I don't talk)♫

334
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,440
♫I just want to quietly be by your side

not because I don't feel it,♫

346
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,080
♫But I'm worried you'll misunderstand me♫

347
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,000
♫What should we do?
(What should we do?)♫

348
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,920
♫Should we be lovers?♫

349
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,760
♫'Cause I'm not a good talker
(And I don't talk)♫

350
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,800
♫I just want to quietly be by your side
(Till the end)♫

351
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
♫I don't talk
'cause I'm a man of few words♫

352
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,680
♫Though I stay quiet,
my love for you is true♫

353

♫Can I love you, can I love you?♫

354
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,680
♫I'm not a talker,

355
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,080
♫I want to say hi so bad,
but I can't do it♫

356
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,440
♫I want to confess my love,
but I can't express it♫

357
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
♫I can't let it out, and this is upsetting♫

358
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,160
♫What should I do?
No words come flying out♫

359
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,680
♫I can't do it,
but do you know how to get over it?♫

360
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,000
♫I can't talk when I'm with you,
and I hope you understand♫

361
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,280
♫Confused?
You don't get the picture, apparently♫

362
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,000
♫I'm not a good talker,

376
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,600
A round of applause for Copper, please!

377
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,680
Your performance was very interesting.

378
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,270
Let's see what the judges have to say.

379
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,710
Instructor Kla, you're first.

380
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,800
Hello, Copper.

381
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,080
Hello, Instructor Kla.

382
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,040
Okay, after seeing the entire performance,

383
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,720
I have to say that
you're a charming individual.

384
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,640
Also, you can convey emotions really well.

385
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,300
However, when you find something difficult

386
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,040
or are worried about something,

387
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,640
you also express those emotions as well.

388
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,080
I see.

389
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,800
It's very obvious.

390
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,400
If you can make some minor adjustments,

391
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,480
making you look confident all throughout,

392
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,400
you'll easily immerse the audience
in your performance.

393
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,620
Right.

394
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,840
When you're relaxed,

395
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
that's when you're the most charming.

396
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,760
Keep improving.

397
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,920
You've done well,
and you can do a lot more.

398
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,920
I also believe you're one of the members
we should be excited for.

399
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Alright. Thank you.

400
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
Let's hear it from your senior.

401
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,280
Tutor.

402
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,680
Hi, Copper.

403
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,120
Hello, Tutor.

404
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,000
I must say that
I was really surprised by you,

405
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,320
as this is my first time
seeing you sing and dance.

406
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,960
I think you've done really well
in both departments.

407
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,280
I believe that you'll be able to
improve and go very far.

408
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm rooting for you.

409
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

410
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,880
Can I compliment him as well?

411
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,600
Alright.

412
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
- Yim wants to chime in, too.
- You want to say something, too?

413
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,560
Yes, I want to say something as well.

414
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
- Okay.
- Thank you!

415
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,560
That's it for you, Copper.
Thank you!

416
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,840
Thank you.

417
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,680
Just kidding!

418
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,200
- Let's hear it from you, Yim.
- I'll keep it short.

419
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,520
- Short and sweet.
- You really caught my eye.

420
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,520
I'm sitting here at the back,
but I couldn't stop looking at you.

421
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,760
My eyes were all on you
throughout the performance.

422
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,600
You really drew me in,
and you deserve the praise.

423
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,080
That's all.

424
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,560
- Okay.
- Thank you.

425
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,320
Right.

426
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,040
Thank you very much.

427
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,420
- Thank you very much, Copper.
- Thank you! Thank you.

428
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,360
The next person is Pung,
with the song, 'Yang Kong Koi.'

429
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,760
♫Do you still think of me♫

430
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,400
♫On the days we are apart?♫

431
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,040
♫The horizon has remained shrouded♫

432
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,960
♫Since the day you left♫

433
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,040
♫I feel so lonely♫

434
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,280
♫I miss you wholeheartedly,♫

435
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,800
♫Waiting for your return♫

436
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,480

♫Come and embrace this yearning heart♫

438
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,560
♫I'm waiting for you to come back♫

440
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,600
♫Do you know it calls for you?♫

441
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,280
♫You are the one my heart yearns for♫

442
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,800
♫And it has always been that way♫

443
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,440
♫Often my heart dwells,♫

444
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,120
♫Worrying that you'd change♫

445
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,920
♫'Cause our paths are so far apart♫

446
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,160
♫On the days my heart grows weak,♫

447
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,600
♫You are the one I seek♫

448
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,440
♫Oh, baby♫

449
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,480
♫Come and embrace this yearning heart♫

450
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,000

♫Do you know it calls for you?♫

461
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,080
Please give it up to Pung!

462
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,480
Thank you.

463
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,680
Would you like to hear
what the judges have to say?

464
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,680
I'd love to.

465
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,000
- Let's hear it from the producer, Aoftion.
- Right.

466
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,880
Alright.

467
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,240
Okay, Pung...

468
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,480
I met you on the very first day.

469
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
- Right.
- Up until now,

470
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,040
I have to give you credit
for how much your singing has improved.

471
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,320
It's now up to the standard
to a certain degree.

472
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,600
I can tell that
you've put a lot into this performance.

473
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,000
However, you looked so focused that it felt like
you were living the moment by yourself.

474
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,280
Thus, you didn't convey your emotions
very much to the audience.

475
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,000
I think you should be able
to express emotions more clearly.

476
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,320
You still have the potential
to improve.

477
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,560
It's just that
you need more practice and time.

478
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,620
Best of luck to you.

479
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,640
I think what everyone feels is this:

480
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,800
All of us adore you.

481
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,840
It's rare to see someone who,
despite not being able to perform at their best,

482
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
has everyone rooting for them
and eager to see them shine.

483
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,240
Not everybody has that, but you do.

484
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,080
And I want you to maintain it.

485
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,920
- Thank you, Aof.
- Thank you.

486
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,210
Park.

487
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
- Hello, Pung.
- Hello, Park.

488
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,440
First, here's my positive feedback.

489
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,800
One of the things that I can see within you
very clearly is your determination,

490
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,160
- and it's at 100%.
- Right.

491
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,840
If this performance were in the form of an MV,
you'd knock it out of the park.

492
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,520
However, this is a stage performance.

493
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,920
As Aof has mentioned, what is lacking

494
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,840
that I also feel is

495
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
your eye contact.

496
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
Some parts of your performance
still felt like blocking.

497
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,720
It may not have turned out the best today,

498
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,080
but what is very apparent is this:
your determination.

499
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,440
And you've been improving
since the first day.

500
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,800
Today, you've proven to everyone that
you're better than you were before.

501
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm proud of you, and I'm rooting for you.

502
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,920
Tomorrow, you'll do even better, Pung.

503
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,340
Thank you so much!

504
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,440
Thank you!

505
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,600
Can I request something?

506
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,280
- Yes?
- It's your favorite pose.

507
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,940
Can you do it for all of us here today?

508
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,920
The next performance is on the way.

509
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,780
- Pung, do this...
- Yes?

510
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,520
"Mommy!" Like this.

511
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,910
- Do it one time.
- Okay.

512
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,560
Alright. Let's go.

513
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
3, 2, 1!

514
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,620
Mommy!

515
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,480
My voice...

516
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,500
- I've lost it.
- You've lost your voice?

517
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,780
I'm sorry on his behalf.

518
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,080
He put all of his effort
into the performance.

519
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,600
- Yes.
- He wasn't prepared for the "Mommy" part.

520
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,940
- We're so sorry.
- It's okay. You'll do it next time.

521
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,460
- Okay.
- Thank you.

522
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,880
- Thank you very much, Pung.
- Thank you, guys.

523
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,440
- Please give it up to him.
- Thank you.

524
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,880
You did amazing.

525
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,160
Next up is the youngest member of DOMUNDI,

526
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,760
Pete, and he'll be singing 'brother zone.'

527
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,360
♫666, Wi-Fi password of mine

528
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,240
♫It's just our birthdays combined,
yours and mine♫

529
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,880
♫Nothing so deep, nothing to hide♫

00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,520
♫I know this is kinda weird, right?♫

♫Baby, listen, alright?♫

532
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,160
♫Your shining light hits so hard,

♫Even if I love you with all my might,♫

534
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,120

♫That I can only kiss you in my fantasy♫

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,480
Please give Pete a round of applause.

587
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,320
- He was so calm.
- Right.

588
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Let's hear from the judges.

589
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,720
Instructor P. first.

590
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
- Hi, Pete.
- Hello.

591
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,360
I still love your tone and vocal texture.

592
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,640
The mix of your natural voice and technique

593
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,000
makes every performance interesting,

594
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,920
and it suits every song you sing.

595
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,840
And this song actually has many patterns,

596
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,200
with changes in parts and vocal approaches

597
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,800
since the original is sung by a group.

598
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,800
Still, you handled
every rhythmic and melodic detail

599
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,120
in each transition perfectly.

600
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,800
It flowed very smoothly.

601
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,200
That includes your dancing, too.

602
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,800
It's quite dynamic,
with a lot of movement,

603
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,160
but you made it all interesting.

604
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,160
The vibe feels youthful and bright,

605
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,120
with some moments more lively

606
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,920
and others more toned down.

607
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,280
You might need to find
a bit more balance in the overall flow,

608
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,920
and your performance
will feel even smoother.

609
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm supporting you.

610
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,160
Even if you did great today,

611
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,160
you can definitely
keep improving even more.

612
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,800
- Good luck.
- Thank you so much, Instructor P.

613
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,000
Let's hear from the older gens.

614
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
TeeTee first.

615
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,160
TeeTee...

616
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,670
Hello.

617
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,600
Whoa...

618
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,920
Hi.

619
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:30,280
I used to be the youngest member, too,

620
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,560
and I still have room to grow,

621
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,880
so I might not have much to say.

622
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,760
From my perspective,

623
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,760
you're very adorable, bright, and youthful.

624
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,280
You're really cute.

625
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,480
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

626
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,760
Yim, please.

627
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,020
Tutor and I have something coming up,

628
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,920
so we'll give our comments before we go.

629
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,360
You did an amazing job.
Your voice was beautiful,

630
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,960
and you danced really well.

631
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,440
With just a bit more balance
for a smoother flow,

632
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,900
it would be perfect.

633
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,860
- You're captivating.
- Okay.

634
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

635
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,680
You're welcome.

636
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,040
I was really surprised by your performance.

637
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,600
I think in the future,

638
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,780
you'll go very far in this industry.

639
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm cheering you on.

640
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,040
Good luck.

641
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,280
Thank you so much.

642
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,180
Yim, do you know what 'maknae' means?

643
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,280
Is it like a pimple?

644
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,440
That's 'acne.'

645
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,800
- Thank you so much, Pete.
- Oh...

646
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,720
Thank you.

647
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,640
You may leave the stage now.

648
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you, too.

649
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,770
It's like that one word.

650
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,200
- Please mute him.
- What?

651
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,040
Mute him.

652
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,880
- He can go now.
- Mak-up.

653
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,480
Maknae...

654
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,840
Oh, no. Sorry.

655
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,600
Cut.

656
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,560
Next, Porsche will be singing
'Prot Song Krai Mah Ruk Chun Tee.'

657
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,680
♫When will this loneliness leave my side?♫

658
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,640
♫How many times
till I won't have to sigh?♫

659
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,920
♫Love often came,
but always ended in goodbye♫

660
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,360
♫When will fate finally be satisfied?♫

♫Looking around, realizing I'm on my own♫

00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,560
♫But when will it come my way?♫

685
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,320
♫Please send someone to love me right♫

686
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,120
♫My heart feels too cold inside♫

687
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,400
♫I wonder what true love's like♫

688
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,440
♫Does it really exist in life?♫

689
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,600
♫Please send someone to walk with me,♫

690
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,280
♫Someone who won't leave me lonely♫

691
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,320
♫Come show me what love can be♫

692
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:14,080
♫Show me how to love someone,
let me finally see♫

693
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,200
♫Let me finally see♫

694
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,600
♫Come show me what love can be♫

695
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:36,440
♫Show me how to love someone,
let me finally see♫

696
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,920
Please give Porsche a big hand.

697
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,080
- Thank you.
- Wow.

698
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,800
That was lovely.

699
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,200
This is definitely a song
the judges know very well.

700
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,680
- Rude.
- Am I right?

701
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,280
Instructor Kla, please.

702
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,080
Honestly, I know that

703
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,080
you already have experience
in the entertainment industry.

704
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,000
You handled the performance really well.

705
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,680
You know how to entertain people.

706
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,800
The main thing to work on
might be your vocal dynamics.

707
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,520
I believe it's never too late to learn.

708
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,880
Never too late to improve.

709
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,640
This can be a fresh start
that takes you further.

710
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,240
Use all your experience to begin again.

711
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm wishing you success.

712
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,560
Good luck.

713
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
Thank you.

714
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,480
Was my comment good?

715
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,600
Very good.

716
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,230
And you look stunning.

717
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,440
Let's hear from the older gens now.

718
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,200
Ohm, please.

719
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,420
- Hi, Porsche.
- Hi.

720
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,040
I want to start by complimenting you.

721
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,400
Your performance totally reminded me
of 'Bangkok Traffic (Love) Story.'

722
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,880
From the choreography to the song choice,

723
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,840
the skytrain theme came through clearly.

724
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,160
You have great stage charisma

725
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,000
with engaging expressions
and strong eye contact

726
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,560
that capture the audience's attention.

727
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:14,760
Lastly, I hope you get your own Loong,
like Mei Li did, soon.

728
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,240
Thank you.

729
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,780
- Can we hear from another person?
- Alright.

730
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,880
Park, please say something

731
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,440
since you guys are almost the same age.

732
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,160
Okay.

733
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,520
Well...

734
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,320
The show was lovely.

735
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,800
I found myself enjoying the performance

736
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,400
without analyzing

737
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,080
or judging your vocals.

738
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,120
What stood out most to me

739
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,440
was how natural it felt

740
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,880
and how clearly...

741
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,120
you expressed yourself.

742
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,300
It really surprised me

743
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,840
because you're the oldest in this gen,

744
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,280
and adjusting to many younger members

745
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,650
hasn't been easy
since the day you entered DOMUNDI.

746
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,280
I can tell you've had to adjust a lot,

747
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,840
and that itself is one of your charms.

748
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,600
As everyone has said,

749
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,240
once you're in DOMUNDI,

750
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,600
you'll gradually grow and get better.

751
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,960
I'm proud of you,
and welcome to the DOMUNDI family.

752
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

753
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,160
Please give Porsche a round of applause.

754
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,200
You may leave now.

755
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,820
We're moving on to the next person,

756
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,200
Fifa, with the song, 'I Need a Girl.'

757
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Let's hear it.

758
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,720
♫Tired of being alone♫

759
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,480
♫Sick of being single♫

760
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,790
♫I think I need me a girl♫

761
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,880
♫I need a girl like♫

762
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:57,240
♫I want someone who can hug me, not a kid
or someone who talks without thinking, yeah♫

763
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:04,400
♫I want someone who gives me their heart,
not just because of lonely feelings♫

764
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:12,800
♫The one who is always
being asked for her number♫

765
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:21,760
♫But pulls up my picture

♫Girl, you need me, too♫

772

♫I'm just someone ordinary,
and so are you, yeah♫

773
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,560
♫But if you and I make a happy couple,
there's nothing else I'd rather do♫

774
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,680
♫Uh-huh, someone who looks youthful
no matter how long it's been♫

775
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,920
♫That's totally my type,
know what I mean?♫

776
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:02,880
♫Someone who seems shy,
but at the same time, such a risk taker, girl♫

777
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:09,720
♫Looking so cute and modest
until we're in a room together♫

778

♫Girl, I need a girl♫

800
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,080
Please give it up for Fifa.

801
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,920
Aoftion, please.

802
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,000
Alright, Fifa,

803
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,120
your effort in singing
and dancing practice really paid off.

804
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,360
Today, I've witnessed your ability
with my own two eyes.

805
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,090
I first have to admire
how smooth the show was.

806
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,070
Overall, I can tell
that you're a perfectionist

807
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,440
because everything you did

808
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,400
ended up in perfect angles.

809
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,240
There's only one thing I should mention.

810
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,320
Your energy and facial expression

811
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,600
could be shown more clearly to us.

812
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,400
This is what I think
you need to work on:

813
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,560
The expression skills
you said you wanted to learn more about here.

814
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,000
This will help you realize

815
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,880
which skills you need
to improve your expression.

816
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,160
Judging from this show, I think
you're ready to debut and perform.

817
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,360
Yes, but I do think
it will really perfect it

818
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,480
if you work on your energy

819
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,900
and your facial expression,

820
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,720
so we can sense them more.

821
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,610
Yes, sir.

822
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,920
I want you to keep going,

823
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,680
and I'll see you
on future performance stages.

824
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,680
Thank you.

825
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,480
TeeTee, please.

826
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,960
- It's Por.
- Por.

827
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,440
No, I'm asking you
to please call Por for me.

828
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,440
Oh, right. Por, here you go.

829
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,800
Give him a heads-up
before you make jokes.

830
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,360
- Please go ahead.
- Right, so...

831
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,770
I agree with Aof that

832
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,840
your expression
could be presented more,

833
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,040
but I can tell you've been working
on building your experience.

834
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,000
You have good basic skills,

835
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,440
body alignment, and body lines,

836
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,120
and I feel that you have
great control over your energy

837
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,800
since I didn't see you
lose your steam by the end.

838
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,120
I like it.

839
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,840
- Nice.
- Alright,

840
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,160
thank you.

841
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,440
Can he make it as one of the DEXX members?

842
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,000
Ooh, of course.

843
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,090
Join us as the seventh member.

844
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,200
That concludes the show for Fifa.

845
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,320
- Thank you very much, thank you.
- Right, thank you.

846
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,440
Before you leave,
please gift Aof the flower.

847
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,640
Thank you.

848
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,640
- Might as well since it's already here.
- Let's put it here.

849
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,440
Thank you.

850
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,440
Alright.

851
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,960
Before the next show begins,

852
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,930
please allow PatJi and Ryujin

853
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,000
to prepare for their partner stage

854
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,360
since they're qualified
for this competition

855
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,280
and to win, as well.

856
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,800
Therefore, let's have PatJi and Ryujin

857
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,760
prepare for their special show.

858
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,600
Please.

859
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,920
Good luck.

860
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,440
Alright, now,

861
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,680
Park, are the seats next to you empty?

862
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,880
Just leave, then,
so that the rows are aligned.

863
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,760
We'll just remove you.

864
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,600
Just kidding.

865
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,920
Alright, boys,
fill up the chairs next to him.

866
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,160
Please have a seat.

867
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,400
Here, go ahead.

868
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,640
Alright,

869
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,760
there's still a long way to go
with the comments

870
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,680
since we have two contestants left.

871
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,280
Next up,

872
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,920
Otto will deliver his performance
with a song called, 'Horogals.'

873
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
Please take a look.

874
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,880
This is it, this is it.

875
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,720
- This is it.

- Whoa...
- Thank you.

949
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,480
That was amazing.

950
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,760
Let's give him
another round of applause.

951
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,560
Now, let's hear some comments
from the judges.

952
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,520
- Instructor P.
- Thank you.

953
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,720
Hi, Otto.

954
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,360
- Hello.
- We meet again.

955
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,880
Otto, I just witnessed you

956
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,240
using different techniques
and different styles while singing.

957
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,760
This song is another one
of the group's songs,

958
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,120
so there are some verses with
different melodies, patterns, and techniques.

959
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,560
You can even rap,

960
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,240
decently, too.

961
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,200
I already know that
your vocal skills are great,

962
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,600
but with the rap part and others,
you still did an amazing job.

963
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,280
One thing I admire,

964
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,760
which people probably
don't pay attention to

965
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,160
but really helps with your singing plan,

966
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,560
is the song's musical key.

967
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,440
The song you have is sung by female singers,

968
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,360
but you changed the key, didn't you?

969
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,800
The key you picked out really suits you,

970
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,520
allowing you to show off
your head voice, falsetto, and all that.

971
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,840
There are many tones to it,

972
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,840
making the show's dynamics
and the singing itself come out well.

973
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,720
Plus, you have great emphasis
and rhythm when you sing,

974
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,640
being the reason
for your smooth performance.

975
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,400
Plus, you have that vibrancy
and emotions added to your vocals.

976
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,320
Your body alignment is good,
and the choreography is beautiful.

977
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,800
You showed new choreography
that's different from the original,

978
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,220
but it's your version.

979
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,800
That really captivates me personally.

980
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,720
It's charismatic, lively,
and has a decent amount of expression.

981
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,560
Also, you nailed the ending pose.

982
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,920
It was gorgeous. I loved it.

983
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,360
- Thank you.
- Amazing job. Gotta give you credit.

984
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
I hope you keep improving.

985
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,680
This song is not the hardest out there,

986
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,880
but also not the easiest,
but you pulled it off.

987
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,640
I look forward
to something harder in the future,

988
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,920
along with some kind of improvements.

989
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,600
Your vocals can develop even better, too.

990
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,090
Give it a try.

991
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,720
- Of course, thank you.
- Alright, I'm rooting for you.

992
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,800
Kim, please.

993
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,560
- Hello, Otto.
- Hello.

994
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,520
My brain is not braining

995
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,310
because I got enchanted by your spell.

996
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,360
I have to say that there's barely
anything to criticize about this show.

997
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,600
I agreed with Instructor P.
on how smooth the show was.

998
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,000
You surprised me with your dancing,
vocal, and rapping skills.

999
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,800
I very much enjoyed it.

1000
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,720
I don't think
this is a challenge anymore.

1001
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,120
This is almost
a performance on an actual stage.

1002
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,800
Since you joined Gen 5,
you're another one of the guys

1003
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,320
who I think has a knack for it

1004
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,600
and is ready to show it.

1005
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,760
I want you to maintain this confidence,

1006
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
and I want you to be your truest self.

1007
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,200
I know that you have
so many things to offer,

1008
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,920
and I'm another one
looking forward to those.

1009
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,400
Though I want a little more take

1010
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,840
from someone
who's performed this song before.

1011
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,280
- Ohm, what do you think?
- Me?

1012
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,000
Mm, since you were...

1013
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,760
Please give us a little something, Ohm.

1014
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,160
Alright, so...

1015
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,790
Otto, you aren't just a pretty boy.

1016
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,920
You're a pretty boy
with a great stage performance.

1017
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,110
I was wowed
by your dancing and vocal skills,

1018
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,640
and I'd like to praise
your body lines and choreography.

1019
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,520
They hit even harder
than the real stage of 'Magic Lover.'

1020
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,680
Such amazing work.
I was really wowed by it.

1021
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,800
And I'm looking forward
to other shows from you.

1022
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,120
As one of the wizards,

1023
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,240
I really approve of this stage.
I'd give it 100 out of 100.

1024
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,800
Thank you.

1025
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,880
Please give it up for Otto.

1026
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,880
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

1027
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,560
Alright, now it's time for our last member,

1028
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,120
Phupha, who will be singing 'TEEDEE TADA.'

1029
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,480
Let's welcome him.

1030
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,400
♫Wanna ask you to look in my eyes, TEEDEE TADA♫

01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,440
♫Let's dance before we say goodbye
under the moon and stars♫

1032
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,480
♫Come look into my eyes, TEEDEE TADA♫

1033
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,400
♫Don't worry, just for a while, ooh, wa-ah♫

1034
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,600
♫I'm under a spell when you look my way,♫

1035
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,640
♫Been so long since I found someone
who could be my bae♫

1036
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,680
♫Come on, what's with that gaze?♫

1037
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,480
♫Are you trying to make my heart race?♫

1038
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:36,720
♫Messing with my heart like this
is just not right,♫

1039
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:45,080
♫I don't mind it,
but are you ready to cross that line?♫

1040
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,480
♫Wanna ask you to look in my eyes, TEEDEE TADA♫

1044
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,160
♫Do you feel it now, what we started? Yeah♫

1045
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,640
♫Girl, you brought it up♫

1046
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,320
♫So let's turn it up, get it on♫

1047
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,480
♫Music flows with flashing lights,♫

1048
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,160
♫You and me, through the night♫

1049
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,520
♫Is this what you're looking for?♫

1050
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,760
♫Is there something else,
do you want more?♫

1051
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:26,880
♫Messing with my heart like this

1071
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,120
Please give Phupha a round of applause.

1072
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:07,880
That was great.

1073
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,360
- Yeah, it was.
- He did it so well.

1074
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,920
I'm surprised.

1075
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,520
Alright,
let's hear from one of the judges,

1076
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,520
who seemed stunned for a moment.

1077
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,680
Instructor Kla, please.

1078
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,680
Honestly, that was sexy.

1079
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,640
I was amazed.

1080
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,680
Thank you.

1081
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,400
You're incredibly charismatic.

1082
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,280
Just watching you,

1083
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,840
I totally forgot about
whether you could dance

1084
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,680
or sing well,

1085
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,040
since the performance felt so smooth.

1086
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:42,000
What really stands out about you
is your facial expressions.

1087
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,210
They're excellent.

1088
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,040
It's a mix of choreography

1089
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,600
and the feelings you delivered

1090
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,600
through your facial expressions.

1091
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,000
You did very well there.

1092
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:57,080
With more practice and experience in dance,

1093
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,720
your performance
will look smoother and even better.

1094
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,600
If you keep training,

1095
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,760
your skills can become fully developed.

1096
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,800
Thank you.

1097
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,500
Alright,

1098
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,160
let's hear from Ohm now.

1099
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,720
Why is it so hot in here?

1100
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,200
Well, I...

1101
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,680
You're very charismatic on stage.

1102
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,120
Your stage presence is very strong.

1103
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,440
The way you jumped down to the judges

1104
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,960
and stepped back onto the stage

1105
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,960
felt charismatic and captivating.

1106
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,480
I really wanna praise you for that.

1107
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,960
You're good-looking

1108
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
with a great build,

1109
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,520
and I admire
how you used those strengths

1110
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,360
to create such a strong performance.

1111
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,320
You did an amazing job.

1112
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,300
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1113
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,160
Alright, so Phupha performed very well.

1114
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,480
I really have to praise you.

1115
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,840
Your dancing was amazing.

1116
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,960
- Please give Phupha a big hand.
- Thank you.

1117
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,320
Alright,

1118
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,840
thank you, Phupha. You may leave now.

1119
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,000
There was a wide range of feedback.

1120
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,320
I truly believe that

1121
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,440
they can all take the judges'

1122
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,720
and experienced members' feedback

1123
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,840
and use it to develop themselves.

1124
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,160
Alright, our journey isn't over yet.

1125
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,040
We still have an important stage coming up,

1126
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,040
the Partner Stage.

1127
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,520
In this round,
we'll be looking for the Best Partners,

1128
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:36,200
and the winning pair
will play the lead roles in a DOMUNDI series.

1129
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,840
I'm sure it's a prize
many of them dream of

1130
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,750
achieving.

1131
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:45,680
Now, all 3 pairs are ready,

1132
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,040
and our first pair is set.

1133
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,520
Let's welcome North and Otto.

1134
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,920
Whoa.

1135
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,320
Aw.

1136
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,760
♫Strange but true,♫

1137
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,280
♫I never saw this coming through♫

1138
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,480
♫This sudden love hits me out of the blue,♫

1139
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,360
♫Yet every road still leads to you,♫

1140
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,360
♫The one I've been waiting for♫

1141
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,400
♫Strange but true,♫

1142
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,560
♫Tell me this is real and not a dream, too♫

1143
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,520
♫Tell me what kind of magic you used♫

1144
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,560
♫To heal a heart so worn and bruised♫

1145
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,040
♫And make it fall for you♫

1146
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,400
♫From the first time our eyes met,♫

1147
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,400
♫Before I even knew your name yet,♫

1148
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,880
♫My heart was already set♫

1149
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,240
♫Even without a word you said♫

1150
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:23,240
♫It's the first time I fell
without thinking twice,♫

1151

♫The first time I didn't care
if it's wrong or right♫

1152
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,080
♫I just want to love you night after night♫

1153
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:38,400

♫To open my heart, they sent me you,♫

1162

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,890
Please give North and Otto
a round of applause!

1185
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,800
Alright,

1186
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,440
- that was such a lovely show.
- Thank you.

1187
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,200
I was really enjoying it.

1188
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,600
How do you feel after the performance?

1189
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,280
Nervous.

1190
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,200
Me too.

1191
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,120
But I'm relieved now.

1192
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,560
- Are you?
- Yes.

1193
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,330
Okay.

1194
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,520
Many of you may not know this,

1195
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,560
but I sang this song
in a campus king competition.

1196
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,640
Oh...

1197
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,680
That's why I feel really connected to it.

1198
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,760
I got eliminated, though.

1199
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,720
I really did.

1200
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,360
But today is another story.

1201
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,560
Let's hear from our judges

1202
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,640
about this pair's performance.

1203
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,920
You can definitely perform with emotion,

1204
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,800
but don't overdo it.

1205
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,160
If the emotion becomes overwhelming,

1206
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,640
you may lose confidence
or control of your body.

1207
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,520
There's no doubt you have good chemistry,

1208
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,320
but North, once you let your guard down

1209
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,960
and expressed your feelings,

1210
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,920
you seemed to forget everything else.

1211
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,200
Still, when you're together,

1212
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,960
I think you need to find...

1213
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,720
the right chemistry

1214
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,160
that's more balanced.

1215
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,640
Understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses,

1216
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,400
and support each other.

1217
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,760
This part still needs some fine-tuning.

1218
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,160
When it doesn't work, insecurity follows.

1219
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,880
I hope we'll get to work together
in the future.

1220
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1221
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,800
If you saw my reactions,

1222
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,360
you'd know how cute it was.

1223
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,200
However,
when they performed as a pair,

1224
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:30,240
as Kla said,

1225
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,440
North's emotions went a bit too far

1226
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,560
and became difficult to control.

1227
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,920
But overall, it was very cute.

1228
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,960
Thank you, buddy.

1229
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,400
If you want advice on how to control it,

1230
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,880
you can ask TeeTee.

1231
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,840
He also struggled with it at first.

1232
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,920
Please give them a big hand.

1233
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1234
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,400
Alright,

1235
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,020
next up,

1236
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,000
let's welcome Copper and Fifa!

1237
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,840
♫They say cute ones always want it their way,♫

1238
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,360
♫They say pretty ones just love to play,♫

1239
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,800
♫So I shut myself down,
believed what they'd say,♫

1240
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,200
♫Wasn't ready for the drama headed my way♫

1241
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,280
♫The day we met,
the moment our eyes locked in place,♫

1242
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,800
♫I told myself
maybe it's worth the risk again♫

1243
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,400
♫If you wanna be my baby,♫

1244
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,200
♫If you wanna be my boy,♫

1245
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,600
♫Then promise me
you won't leave me in the end♫

1246
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,800
♫You're the only one
who can stop this lonely ache,♫

1247
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,400
♫The only one who can mend this heartbreak,♫

1248
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,640
♫If you won't try,
there's no chance I can take♫

1249
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,680
♫And this will end as just another mistake♫

1250
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,720
♫I've met too many who come and walk away,♫

1251
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,400
♫Keep falling for the cruel ones who won't stay♫

1252
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,680
♫It feels like a curse,
every love ends in pain,♫

1253
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,120
♫Still, I'm holding on,
begging love to remain♫

1254

♫The day we met,

01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,960

1277
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,240
Whoa...

1278
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,200
Please give Copper and Fifa
a round of applause!

1279
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,200
How do you feel after the performance?

1280
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,660
I'm feeling good.

1281
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:55,280
I've always wanted the chance
to perform with Fifa,

1282
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,000
and it finally happened.

1283
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,520
I feel like I went all out.

1284
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,680
Well...

1285
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:11,240
This is also my first time
doing a duo performance, so...

1286
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,640
I'm pretty nervous.

1287
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,760
Yeah.

1288
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,560
No need to be nervous anymore.
The show is over,

1289
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,760
and you both did an amazing job.
Your synchronization was excellent.

1290
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,680
Alright, now let's hear from the judges.

1291
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:30,760
Your performance felt very experienced,

1292
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,200
almost like a pair
ready to work professionally.

1293
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,960
I want to praise you for that.

1294
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,120
Since this is your first time,

1295
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:42,080
there are still a few areas

1296
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,640
that need more time to sync together

1297
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,160
in the performance,

1298
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,920
because...

1299
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,280
For me, a great partner performance

1300
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,640
isn't always about...

1301
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,280
perfect dancing or singing.

1302
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,720
It's about more than that.

1303
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,520
And I think that comes with time,

1304
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,720
as you continue to
attune yourselves to each other.

1305
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,280
Like I said, I'd love to see

1306
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,720
a version of both of you
that's even more in sync.

1307
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,160
Today's performance was lovely,

1308
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,800
but I'm looking further ahead

1309
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,960
and believe you can go very far together.

1310
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,240
Thank you.

1311
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1312
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,440
First, I want to praise both of you
for your talent.

1313
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,940
Your talent really impressed me.

1314
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:36,640
It feels like
two charming guys coming together.

1315
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,640
You may not be 100% in sync yet, though.

1316
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,560
It feels like you're planting a tree together,

1317
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,360
and it's just starting to grow roots.

1318
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,260
You can go very far

1319
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,840
because you already have the talent.

1320
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,760
Keep nurturing your tree

1321
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,760
by getting to know each other better

1322
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,160
and growing closer.

1323
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,960
Trust me, that's how you'll go far and fast.

1324
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1325
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,360
Please give them a big hand.

1326
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,270
We've made it to the final pair.

1327
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,840
It's Ryujin and PatJi!

1328
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,990
Ryujin, come help me for a second.

1329
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,840
Get off the games.

1330
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,280
Mhm.

1331
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,800
Just a second.

1332
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,600
After all these years,

1333
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,840
you haven't changed a bit.

1334
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,240
So, you want me to change?

1335
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,280
What are you talking about?

1336
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,960
Nonsense!

1337
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,560
Here, let me help.

1338
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,440
And...

1339
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,400
Do you think
our performance will turn out well?

1340
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,280
Last year, it was just the two of us
performing solo.

1341
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,240
Well, just doing this together
already feels good, doesn't it?

1342
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,980
- You're right.
- When you put your heart into something,

1343
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,440
it'll turn out fine.

1344
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,320
- Huh?
- It's already getting late.

1345
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,560
You should head home.

1346
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,520
Yeah, I should.

1347
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,960
Or else my mom's going to kill me.

1348
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,880
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1349
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,080
- Be seeing you.
- Have a safe trip home.

1350
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,130
I'm heading home now.

1351
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,040
♫It may look like nothing's really changed♫

1352
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,880
♫It may feel like every day's the same♫

1353
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:21,200
♫But deep inside,
there's something on my mind♫

1354
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:27,240
♫Look in my eyes and you'll see why♫

1355
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:33,720
♫Something has shifted,
nothing's like before♫

1356
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:39,760
♫This growing need for you,
I can't ignore♫

1357
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:45,880
♫It doesn't fade, it only amplifies♫

1358
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,920
♫Becoming more than friends should realize♫

1359
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,200
Hey!

1360
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,840
Wake up already.

1361
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,160
We're about to perform.

1362
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1363
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,440
Come on!

1364
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,120
- I'm going there without you, then.
- Just give me a second.

1365
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
Our performance
will be ruined at this point.

1366
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,360
I'm heading out.

1367
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,960
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

1368
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:23,520
♫Something has shifted,
nothing's like before♫

1369
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:29,560
♫This growing need for you,
I can't ignore♫

1370
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,680
♫It doesn't fade, it only amplifies♫

1371
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:40,720
♫Becoming more than friends should realize♫

1372
01:22:54,460 --> 01:23:00,480
♫If you ever come to know something♫

1373
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:07,480
♫That the one
who stood by you has changed♫

1374
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,480
♫I just wonder if you'd be okay♫

1375
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:19,070
♫What should I do
when my heart's not the same?♫

1376
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:24,760
- ♫Now it's you I'm falling for♫
- ♫If you ever come to know something♫

1377
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:31,720
♫That the one
who stood by you has changed♫

1378
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,920
♫I just wonder if you'd be okay♫

1379
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:43,560
♫What should I do
when my heart's not the same?♫

1380
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,800
♫Now it's you I'm falling for♫

1381
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,120
♫It's you I'm falling for♫

1382
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,480
♫It's you I'm falling for♫

1383
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,560
♫It's you I'm falling for♫

1384
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,360
Do you still think we're just friends?

1385
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,360
Isn't it obvious by now?

1386
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,780
Please give it up to Ryujin and PatJi!

1387
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,080
How are you two feeling right now?

1388
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,200
This actually isn't my first time
performing with Ryujin.

1389
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:41,520
However, it's our first time
performing together as partners.

1390
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,400
Yes.

1391
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:47,600
We really put a lot of work
into this performance.

1392
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,440
- That's right.
- And...

1393
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,600
Ryujin and I have grown a lot closer.

1394
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:58,720
We helped each other and worked together
to make this performance possible.

1395
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,320
We believe you.

1396
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,440
All of us can see that.

1397
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,160
We can also see how the two of you
are growing together.

1398
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's hear from the judges
and see what they think.

1399
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,620
Gosh, everyone's being so emotional,

1400
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:14,860
and here you are passing the mic
to someone who feels basically the same.

1401
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,320
Well...

1402
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,480
First of all, well done, you two.

1403
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,400
You came up with the plot
and everything yourselves for this performance.

1404
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:31,080
It's obvious that you've been waiting
over a year for this moment,

1405
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:38,120
excited to show us
what Ryujin and PatJi really are about.

1406
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,760
Today, we've seen it.

1407
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,760
Your journey is full of stories.

1408
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,440
I believe the fans
and your friends in the company

1409
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:57,120
can see how your relationship
has developed up to this point.

1410
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:02,440
Of course, a relationship
between people who grew up together,

1411
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,920
have known each other since childhood,
and went to school together

1412
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,680
has countless stories behind it.

1413
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,640
There's a lot more you can improve
when it comes to performance.

1414
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,880
However, for this reality show,

1415
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,520
what we seek is more than that.

1416
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,320
And...

1417
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,960
I want you two to remember this moment,

1418
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,300
your dedication,

1419
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:40,340
the effort you put into presenting this to us,
and how you proved to everyone

1420
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,540
that you are...

1421
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,440
an inseparable pair.

1422
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,820
- Don't forget this moment.
- Right.

1423
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,560
In the future,

1424
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,880
no matter what happens,
don't forget about today.

1425
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1426
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,270
Let's hear from a senior.

1427
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,920
I still remember that day a year ago.

1428
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,600
PatJi, your hands were so stiff

1429
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,280
before you went on stage.

1430
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,880
Today, however...

1431
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,480
You've become a different person.
You've improved a lot.

1432
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,840
Throughout the year,

1433
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:29,880
I know that
you two have been working very hard.

1434
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,320
Today, I've got nothing else to say
except that

1435
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,400
I'm very proud of you guys,

1436
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,640
and I've always wished you well.

1437
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,400
Last year, I once said,

1438
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,640
"I'm so proud of you,
as if you were my son."

1439
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,000
Today...

1440
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,080
I'm very proud of you, my boy.

1441
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,480
- Thank you, Mommy.
- Thank you.

1442
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,920
You know why I don't wanna cry?

1443
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,960
It'll ruin my look.

1444
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,000
Okay.

1445
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,440
Thank you so much, Kim.

1446
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,400
A round of applause
for Ryujin and PatJi, please.

1447
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,200
Alright, everyone...

1448
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:16,720
We've seen 9 individual performances

1449
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,000
and 3 duo performances.

1450
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,400
Now, it's time to leave it up to the judges

1451
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,600
to decide who will win
the Best Performance Award

1452
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,720
and the Best Partner Award.

1453
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,720
Stay tuned.

1454
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:38,600
Now, we've made it
to the most important part of this entire show.

1455
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,440
I believe that
you guys share the same goal.

1456
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,800
However, there's one thing to note.

1457
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:49,480
Rewards aren't indicators that
you're better than the others.

1458
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,400
However, they're tools
that elevate your mindset

1459
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:59,080
and guide those ready to become
full-fledged artists in the industry.

1460
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,200
Let's start with the first award:

1461
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,720
the Best Friendship Award.

1462
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:10,680
The winner of this award
is decided by your votes

1463
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,520
for who you consider your best friend.

1464
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:21,600
The winner of this award
gets to go on a trip

1465
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,840
and spend Friendship Time with a friend

1466
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,720
of your choosing.

1467
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:31,840
The winner of
the Best Friendship Award goes to...

1468
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:47,320
Congratulations to Wave!

1469
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,720
Wow!

1470
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,880
How do you feel about
winning the Best Friendship Award?

1471
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,200
Right. I feel great.

1472
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,760
I never thought
I'd get to be someone's best friend.

1473
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,770
Regardless, I'm delighted.

1474
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,280
- It's something to be proud of,
- Yes.

1475
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,050
as your friends voted for you.

1476
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,040
Yes.

1477
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,040
Who did you vote for? Was it yourself?

1478
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,840
I voted for Fifa.

1479
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,680
Oh!

1480
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:29,840
For this award, however, you're allowed
to pick a friend to go on a trip with

1481
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,920
and spend Friendship Time together.

1482
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,560
Congratulations, Wave.

1483
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,800
Thank you.

1484
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,960
Now, we've made it to the award
for today's performances:

1485
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,200
the Best Performance Award.

1486
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,200
I'm simply going to announce the winner,

1487
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,640
the one who performed the best today.

1488
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,160
Allow me to go over the prize again.

1489
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:01,600
The winner gets to release a single
under DMD MUSIC.

1490
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,080
The Best Performance Award goes to...

1491
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:17,840
Congratulations, Otto!

1492
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,760
How are you feeling?

1493
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,200
I'm extremely delighted.

1494
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,940
Well, I'm very happy.

1495
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,840
I've been waiting a long time
for the opportunity to release my own song.

1496
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,000
Yes.

1497
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,640
Thank you very much.

1498
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,280
I can't put it into words.

1499
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,000
I understand how you feel.

1500
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,000
How are you feeling, North?

1501
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,420
Oh...

1502
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,460
Right. I'm happy for him.

1503
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,100
I'm very proud of you, Otto.

1504
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,040
I always believed he would do well.

1505
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,560
I'm also proud of you, North.

1506
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,000
Alright! Congratulations, Otto.

1507
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,600
Thank you!

1508
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,760
However,
when it comes to your performances,

1509
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,280
you've all done an outstanding job.

1510
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,660
The judges have acknowledged that,

1511
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:29,280
and as a result,
three more awards will be given

1512
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,560
to those who performed well.

1513
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,600
This award is the Best Shining Star Award.

1514
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,040
The first winner of
the Best Shining Star Award goes to...

1515
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,360
Fifa!

1516
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,020
I'm speechless.

1517
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,160
My voice is so deep right now.

1518
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,680
Alright...

1519
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,720
I've done my best.

1520
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,480
Good luck.

1521
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,960
Right. Thank you!

1522
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,240
The second winner of
the Best Shining Star Award goes to...

1523
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,200
Phupha!

1524
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:43,820
I'm delighted that I won this award.

1525
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,840
I've done my very best,

1526
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,920
and I'm glad I won.

1527
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,880
- Thank you.
- Well done. You've done great.

1528
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:01,880
The third winner of
the Best Shining Star Award goes to...

1529
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:14,000
Congratulations, Pete!

1530
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,360
I'm glad I won...

1531
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,480
What's the award called again?

1532
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,120
The Best Shining Star Award.

1533
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:29,520
I'm glad I won
the Best Shining Star Award along with them.

1534
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,760
Thank you so much.

1535
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,560
These are the three winners of
the Best Shining Star Award.

1536
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,200
Stay tuned to find out

1537
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:43,400
what award the judges will give you.

1538
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,400
Thank you so much, all three of you.

1539
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,700
You may return to your spots.

1540
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,260
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you!

1541
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:53,000
Here comes the final award.

1542
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,800
May the three pairs take a step forward.

1543
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,120
I'd like the CEO
to make the announcement.

1544
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:04,610
- Aoftion.
- Okay.

1545
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:11,360
This is your training
for the DMD Friendship reality show.

1546
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,440
This is all new for you guys,

1547
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,040
and it's gone by very quickly.

1548
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,440
Today, I've seen the dedication

1549
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:27,360
of all 11 of you who performed onstage.

1550
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,000
We agreed that
each pair has their own charm.

1551
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:37,920
However, only one gets to win this award.

1552
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,720
It's...

1553
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:05,120
The pair who gets to be the lead partners
for the upcoming DOMUNDI series

1554
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,200
this year...

1555
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
are all the pairs.

1556
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,920
This opportunity is yours.

1557
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,360
However, in the end,

1558
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,480
this award is given to you guys
because I've seen your charms,

1559
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,600
and I believe you and your partners
can continue to grow

1560
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,120
and become better actors.

1561
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:40,040
However, only one pair gets to
receive the opportunity first,

1562
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,160
and we've made our final decision.

1563
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:48,520
Don't be discouraged if you didn't win this,
as your opportunity is on its way.

1564
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:56,600
The pair that wins the Best Partner Award

1565
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:02,200
in 'DMD Friendship the Reality,
The THIRD Chapter' is...

1566
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,600
Ryujin and PatJi.

1567
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:25,640
The Best Partner of this season
goes to Ryujin and PatJi!

1568
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,120
Alright.

1569
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:37,080
Congratulations to all of you
on winning the awards.

1570
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,760
Our hearts go out to
those who didn't win as well.

1571
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,920
This isn't where your journey ends.

1572
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,520
This is where your journey

1573
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,480
to reach your goals begins.

1574
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,840
I believe all of you have what it takes,

1575
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,480
as you have the skills to prove it.

1576
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,840
Keep improving yourself.

1577
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,120
Use this as your motivation.

1578
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,800
And let DOMUNDI
be the one to take care of you.

1579
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,480
So you can grow,
become more talented,

1580
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:11,000
become more mature, and turn into
experienced actors who produce quality work.

1581
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,480
I believe you all have the talent.

1582
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,360
You've got this!

1583
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,200
- We've got this!
- We can do this.

1584
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,280
Aoftion has something to add.
Please take it away.

1585
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,960
I just want to say this to you guys.

1586
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,760
This certainly isn't the end for you.

1587
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:26,440
Even if you don't have a partner,

1588
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,640
we at DOMUNDI won't leave you behind.

1589
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:32,560
More opportunities
are just around the corner.

1590
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,920
You might not get to seize one
in this show,

1591
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,120
but another may present itself
the moment the show is over.

1592
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,800
This reality show isn't the end.

1593
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,240
It's the beginning
that helps you realize your potential.

1594
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,920
Just like I told you on Day 1,
the goal is to help you improve.

1595
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,320
From this point on,
your journey will truly begin.

1596
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,760
I hope that more good opportunities
will come your way in the future.

1597
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,800
Thank you.

1598
