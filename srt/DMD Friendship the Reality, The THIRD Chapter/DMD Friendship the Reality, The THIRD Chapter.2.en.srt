1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
Welcome you all to DMD Gen 5!

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,080
Our first mission today is called

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,760
'Photography Posing Challenge.'

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,760
And the winner of the first mission is...

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,220
Copper.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,760
Who do I think Copper will go with?

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,760
I have three people in mind.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,260
Are you crazy? There's only one.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,640
He's pretty cute,

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,280
and I think...

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,520
he's such a good friend.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,400
It's so fun being around him.

13
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Hi, Copper.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,079
I'm surprised.

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,840
I actually had no idea at all

16
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,740
that he'd choose me,

17
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,920
so it kinda surprised me

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,280
when he did.

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,760
May I sit down?

20
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Yeah, sure.

21
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Why would you ask?

22
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,720
I'm very nervous
and surprised right now.

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,640
Why? 'Cause you didn't think
I'd choose you?

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeah, I had no idea at all.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
It's fun talking to you.

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,040
Oh, okay.

27
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,440
It makes me wanna keep talking to you.

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
You mean today?

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
We sat together, talking

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,980
and playing games side by side.

32
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,560
- Yeah.
- Right?

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,579
I'm usually quiet,

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
like, very quiet.

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,440
But after talking to you,
it felt like...

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,160
Just hearing you talk,

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
and maybe how you carry yourself,

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,000
made me want to know you more.

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
I mean it.

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Me, too.

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,840
I feel the same.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,360
It feels like you just...

43
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,320
give me energy when we talk,

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,660
and I wish I could absorb
at least half of your energy.

45
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,240
Have you absorbed any?

46
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,160
A bit.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
A bit? What percentage?

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,200
Maybe zero.

49
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,670
What? Why?

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,420
I don't know,

51
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,960
but it's just...

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,640
I just want to...

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,560
- get to know you better.
- Okay.

54
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,960
Me, too.

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,640
Copper is someone who...

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I don't really understand this feeling,

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,760
but I find him charming,

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,920
and there's just something about him
that reaches me

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,560
and draws me in.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,960
It makes me want to
get to know him better.

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm not very good at talking.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Neither am I.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,800
- Honestly.
- You're lying.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
- It's true.
- I don't believe that.

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm pretty awkward

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,640
around people
I'm not comfortable with.

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,700
But as I said, talking to you

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,960
makes me wanna keep talking.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really?

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, I think you're a great listener

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,800
and a good speaker.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,280
That just makes me wanna know you more.

73
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,360
If you were...

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
- the winner
- Okay.

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,600
of the mission,

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,600
who would you choose?

77
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,320
You know, if you had to.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,760
To be honest,
I've always had this person in mind,

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,400
and it was you.

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,560
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,190
I'm flustered now.

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,340
I feel like we just clicked,

83
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,640
but maybe that's just me.

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,780
- No, it's not just you.
- Like...

85
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,440
- I feel the same.
- Oh, really?

86
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,320
Thank you.

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,159
Thank you.

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,920
What kind of food do you enjoy?

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
Every kind.

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,260
Every kind?

91
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,520
How about you? Any allergies?

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
No.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,520
Wait,

94
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,370
can I say I'm allergic to you?

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,780
Sorry.

96
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,200
My intrusive thoughts just won.

97
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,360
"Can I say I'm allergic to you?"

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,040
Yeah, you can.

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,640
What? You're taking the joke?

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
- I even canceled it.
- You did.

101
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,240
Wow, more food just keeps coming.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,960
It's a lot. Can we really finish this?

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
That's a good question.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,260
- Wait, let me take a photo.
- Sure.

105
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,400
We can keep it as a reminder, you know.

106
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,400
Will it be a bad one?

107
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,320
- A good one?
- Bad...

108
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,880
A good reminder. Sorry.

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,840
Oh...

110
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,440
How do I make this look cool?

111
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,540
You can give it a try.

112
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,440
Sure.

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,159
You mean the food

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,880
- or you and the food?
- No, just the food.

115
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,159
I was just fooling around.

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm bad at this.

117
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,060
Hey, I believe in you.

118
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,200
- Here.
- I'll post it,

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,380
alright?

120
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,120
Let me take a photo of you.

121
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,320
1, 2, 3, smile.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,220
Okay.

123
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,240
Was it good?

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,440
Yeah, you look stunning.

125
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,340
Let's eat.

126
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,910
- I'll move this. It's too far.
- Okay, thanks.

127
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,640
What's in that pot?

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
This is...

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,480
- rice.
- Rice?

130
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,220
You want some?

131
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,220
Thanks, Copper.

132
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,960
There you go.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,980
I'll try the prawn first.

134
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,820
Sure. Give me a sec.

135
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,990
Is it good?

136
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,300
Perfect.

137
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I'll give you some.

138
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Just one bite, and...

139
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,120
you'll be amazed.

140
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm telling you.

141
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,159
When I...

142
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,620
When I messed up,

143
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,120
I almost cried.

144
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,659
- Really? Why?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,360
I just didn't know...

146
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,280
how I felt.

147
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,960
- When...
- I was like...

148
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,200
How losing felt...

149
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,840
But honestly, I can accept it,

150
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,680
and...

151
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,580
I almost cried because...

152
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,780
But seeing everyone get through,

153
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
part of me was like,

154
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,880
"Wow, everyone made it."

155
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,120
I was happy for them.

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
For all of them.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,880
Those...

158
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,880
I've heard this saying that...

159
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,360
those who lose are actually
the ones who are about to improve.

160
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,980
Because once you lose,

161
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,800
you know exactly where you went wrong,

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
and you won't let it happen again.

163
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,780
Yeah.

164
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,720
And I believe that

165
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,480
you might not be number one this time,

166
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,120
and next time, you still
won't be number one right away,

167
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,880
but you'll keep moving up,

168
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
from fifth to fourth,

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
then third, second...

170
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
And one day, you will beat everyone.

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,480
Okay.

172
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,200
You're already talented, like...

173
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,400
you're amazing.

174
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,380
But seeing everyone here,
I'm fired up now.

175
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,550
You know, it's the drive to...

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
- Really?
- keep going with the shoots

177
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,020
- Seriously?
- and to study more.

178
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,640
- Yahoo!
- We rarely eat together.

179
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,720
Come on.

180
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,800
What's that?

181
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,240
- You wanna try?
- Are you gonna try this first?

182
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
An appetizer.

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
Oh, it's stuck.

184
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,160
You want some?

185
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,000
I want this one.

186
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,920
- Fifa, try this.
- Wait...

187
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,000
Aren't we supposed to eat it in order?

188
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,980
- Like, from light to heavy food?
- Yeah, like...

189
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,910
What?

190
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
- The top first.
- Oh, okay.

191
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,240
He's not eating that.

192
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,040
- Stop forcing him to.
- There's pickled mango.

193
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,600
Told you.

194
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
- Oh...
- Told you.

195
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Watermelon in squid ink.

196
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
A new combination.

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
When you were a kid,

198
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,039
did you ever worry a watermelon seed
would grow in your stomach?

199
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,919
- In your stomach?
- Yeah.

200
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,960
Do you guys have any food allergies?

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't.

202
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I just don't like some food.

203
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Like what?

204
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,520
I don't like offal.

205
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,080
Me neither.

206
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
Me neither.

207
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
And I hate veggies.

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh...

209
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,880
I can eat some.

210
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
You don't eat beef, right?

211
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,580
Yeah, that's right.

212
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,320
Beef?

213
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

214
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,880
- This is good.
- Do you worship Guan Yin?

215
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
He's just a herbivore.

216
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
What?

217
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,400
- For the fish,
- Okay.

218
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,240
do you usually flip it
or remove the bones?

219
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,000
I usually flip it.

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,600
I thought it didn't have bones.

221
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,140
- It does!
- It does.

222
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,360
They mean no bones in the meat.

223
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,040
- I see.
- You're gonna flip it, right?

224
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,760
Come on, what kind of fish
doesn't have bones?

225
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,560
Then how is it supposed to swim?

226
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,920
Do eels have bones?

227
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,740
They do.

228
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,090
- Cream Dory?
- They have tons of bones.

229
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,880
Do you know what Cream Dory actually is?

230
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
It's a fish.

231
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,800
- What is it?
- Is it that thing?

232
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,960
It's Pangasius Dory.

233
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,160
Like, big catfish.

234
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,240
- It's the fish you see in ponds.
- Really?

235
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,480
- The fish that eats bread.
- Yeah.

236
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
They just gave it a nicer name.

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
Yeah.

238
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,530
- Cream Dory.
- And it's English.

239
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,970
As if it were in Shelldon.

240
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Do you know Shelldon?

241
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
You never watched it?

242
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,440
What is it?

243
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
- Shelldon...
- It's Shelldon.

244
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,280
And what is Shelldon?

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
The yellow character.

246
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
He's a shellfish.

247
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,340
- I don't know that.
- It's about underwater adventures.

248
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,320
You don't know?

249
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I don't.

250
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,120
I thought you did 'cause you laughed.

251
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,000
I did not.

252
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,760
What?

253
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
I didn't get it.

254
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,040
I thought you did 'cause you laughed.

255
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
The name is just funny.

256
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,000
- You just went along, right?
- Yeah.

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
No, actually...

258
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,080
Ryujin and PatJi,

259
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,200
are you planning to choose each other?

260
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,320
No.

261
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Where did you get that from?

262
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,820
I just think...

263
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,720
I want to know everyone better.

264
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,660
You know,

265
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,640
there may be someone better.

266
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,940
- Really?
- You're dropping it.

267
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,930
Yeah.

268
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,080
Sorry.

269
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,800
I agree with him.

270
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,720
I mean, who knows?

271
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,160
Right?

272
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,360
Well, so far, do you already...

273
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,080
have someone in mind?

274
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,840
You.

275
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
- I haven't finished yet.
- Just kidding.

276
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
- Wipe your lips.
- What?

277
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,360
There's ink on your lips.

278
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,880
Why did he choose Fifa?

279
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,500
There were three of us.

280
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,040
Why didn't he choose Wave or...

281
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,920
me?

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
- And you?
- What?

283
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
So far...

284
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400
I feel like...

285
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,460
Like?

286
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,480
I want to know more about PatJi.

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,020
Okay.

288
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,380
Yeah, 'cause...

289
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,720
we haven't talked much.

290
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
I want to know you better, too.

291
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,340
I was kinda surprised

292
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,880
that he wants to know me better
'cause I feel the same way.

293
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
It's not that I have someone in mind,

294
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,840
but I just want to know everyone better.

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,930
Me, too.

296
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,400
It's like...

297
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,480
I haven't found someone
who feels right yet.

298
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,680
But there's someone
I'm comfortable around.

299
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,770
Aw.

300
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,560
"Someone I'm comfortable around."

301
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
What?

302
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,220
Hey.

303
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
I have to go.

304
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,800
I'll be back. I have work.

305
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm going to study.

306
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,480
Yeah, it's winter.

307
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
Come on, let's get inside.

308
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,560
Does it feel more spacious
than last season?

309
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,400
Mm, I think so.

310
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
There's a pool, too.

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
- What do we have here?
- What is it?

312
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,320
"We officially welcome you, PatJi and Ryujin,
to Friendship House.

313
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,960
Your task this morning is to
wake up your friends in the three bedrooms,

314
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,240
so they're ready for today's mission."

315
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,880
- The three bedrooms?
- Which ones?

316
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
They should be upstairs, right?

317
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,440
I don't know.

318
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,600
- Should we look for them?
- We gotta explore.

319
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Mm.

320
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,380
Hello.

321
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,920
- Who's that?
- PatJi.

322
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
- Hi.
- And Ryujin.

323
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,240
We're joining you.

324
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,920
- What a surprise.
- It's time for the mission.

325
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
- The mission?
- You're here early, too.

326
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm just visiting, like...

327
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,270
Well, sorry for bothering you
in the morning.

328
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,520
- Huh?
- Come lie down.

329
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,840
Come on, PatJi, let's go to the...

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,080
- The blue room?
- No, the red.

331
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,760
What?

332
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,960
- This is the red room.
- This is the blue room.

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,920
This is the red room, though.

334
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,920
Really?

335
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,660
It's alright.

336
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,520
But we gotta get up soon.

337
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
No way. I'm going back to sleep.

338
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Hi.

339
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
It's me, Pung.

340
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,800
How did you get here?

341
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,640
And PatJi, too.

342
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,240
This is the blue room.

343
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Porsche.

344
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Porsche.

345
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,560
It's time to wake up.

346
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,970
Porsche.

347
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,320
You need to jump on him

348
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,160
- to get him up.
- Porsche, time to wake up!

349
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Whoa, why'd you open it?

350
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,080
That's messed up.

351
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
It's almost time for us to...

352
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,990
Come on, dentist,
gotta brush your teeth too.

353
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,640
Good morning, everyone.

354
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,480
- Yeah.
- Yay!

355
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
- Hi, hi.
- Hello.

356
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,680
- Wow, hello.
- Hello.

357
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,120
First of all, welcome, guys.

358
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,800
And of course,
now that I'm here to take care of you,

359
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
I also have a mission...

360
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,480
to give you for today.

361
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
Our mission for today

362
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,840
is 'Acoustic Singing Challenge.'

363
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,280
Wow!

364
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,200
I can tell just by looking at you

365
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
that you're singers.

366
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,400
I feel like I'll do better on this
than on the next ones.

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,040
I can kinda sing
since I've had some lessons.

368
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,540
I love singing,

369
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,400
but I usually do it in the bathroom.

370
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,760
I've never sung in front of anyone,

371
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,640
so I feel a bit shy and nervous.

372
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,960
But it's a shame

373
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,720
that North and Wave
are tied up with their work,

374
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,480
so they can't join this mission.

375
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,680
I feel bad that North and Wave

376
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,640
missed the chance to join this mission.

377
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,480
We'll have a special guest,

378
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,680
a vocal instructor
who'll guide your vocal lessons

379
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,160
and test your skills.

380
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,320
Just put your all into it,

381
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,180
okay?

382
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

383
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,200
Are you ready to meet
your vocal instructor?

384
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
- We're ready.
- We are.

385
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,360
How ready are you?

386
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,600
- Couldn't be more ready!
- So ready.

387
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,600
Let's hear it for Oui Nathnarong.

388
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

389
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,600
- Hello, Instructor Oui.
- Yes, hello.

390
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,600
Hello, my name is Oui,
Nathnarong Khongkhwan.

391
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,280
I am a vocal instructor

392
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,800
with 19 years of experience.

393
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm glad to be back

394
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
and help the boys

395
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
complete their mission.

396
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
Today, Instructor Oui will be guiding you
through the mission.

397
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,120
Today's challenge is pretty hard

398
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,680
because you'll be tested by
singing a song

399
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,480
called...

400
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
'Skinship.'

401
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,560
♫Let's skinship♫

402
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,359
♫This is freaking drip♫

403
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,839
♫Moving closer♫

404
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
♫I'll whisper you with my feelings♫

405
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,640
Whoa...

406
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,000
I can tell from Pung's face

407
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,079
that he needs help.

408
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,720
This song hasn't been released,

409
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
so this is top secret.

410
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,200
You guys will see the lyrics
and practice the song

411
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,000
under Instructor Oui's guidance.

412
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,720
Of course, only six of you
will make it through this round.

413
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,480
- Six of us?
- Only six of you.

414
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,920
And the tough decisions
will be up to Instructor Oui.

415
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,760
Make sure you give it your all
for this mission.

416
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
If you're ready, let's get started!

417
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,720
Let's go!

418
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

419
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,360
We'll start with a vocal warm-up.

420
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Yes, start on low notes.

421
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Go lower.

422
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,760
I think the instructor is very thorough,

423
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,780
teaching us how to handle
the notes, the melody,

424
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,880
and the pace of the song.

425
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,000
He really went in depth.

426
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,240
It was amazing.

427
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
We learned how to keep the right rhythm,

428
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,160
stress the right words,

429
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
and control our breath.

430
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,400
Knowing this was DEXX's unreleased song
left me speechless.

431
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,680
I was also amazed
when I first listened to it.

432
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,640
The beat is fast-paced, and...

433
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,890
It's different from what I'm used to.

434
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,890
I usually listen to slow-paced music.

435
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,880
Do you feel worried about anything?

436
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,840
Oh, I think...

437
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,560
I'm kind of afraid
when I have to perform this song.

438
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah, you're right.

439
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,660
The song is very catchy.

440
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,410
After a few listens,

441
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,160
I kept singing it like, "Let's skinship

442
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160
My heart's in..."

443
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,960
I think the hardest part was
keeping the rhythm

444
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,080
because of the song's beat.

445
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,560
The original was sung by six people,
and now it's just me.

446
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,600
I'm not the type to
remember the lyrics easily.

447
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,000
So I wondered if I could do it in time

448
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,080
since I have to sing it to the instructor.

449
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,760
But after I listened to it,
I found it really catchy...

450
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
and easy to remember.

451
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm gonna lose.

452
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,880
Singing is what I'm most insecure about,

453
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,680
but this is a chance to improve

454
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,840
since I'm always keen
to develop all of my skills.

455
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,480
It's not really my strong suit,

456
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,200
but seeing how skilled the boys are

457
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,920
makes me want to improve, too.

458
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,120
I heard that singing
isn't Ryujin's strong suit,

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
and when I helped him,

460
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,080
I could tell that
he was really worried about it.

461
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,800
But when I asked him to hit the note,

462
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,040
he actually could.

463
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,680
He just wasn't very confident about singing,

464
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
but he really could do it.

465
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,120
- Hello.
- Hi, Otto.

466
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
♫You know I'm not a sweet talker♫

467
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,520

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,720
♫Feeling it deep down, past beyond sights♫

♫Love is nothing you can touch♫

♫No measurement can hold this much♫

484
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
♫Let be clear, make it all clean-cut♫

485
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,920
♫It's the feeling,♫

486
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,160
♫No words of affirmation

487
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,880
♫You're waiting on me, I knew♫

♫Love it's only you♫

490
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,160
Yay.

491
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,200
Welcome again.

492
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,360
I have to say, this is the moment
I wish would never come.

493
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,120
It's the announcement
of the six qualifiers for this round.

494
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,000
I believe you gave it your absolute best.

495
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,800
Of course, I have a surprise to reveal first.

496
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,720
I told you there would be
six qualifiers, right?

497
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
It's still the same arrangement,

498
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,960
but...

499
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,480
- But...
- There's a but.

500
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,800
But...

501
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,360
The qualifiers will have to perform a duet.

502
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,440
That means those who qualify

503
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,200
will form three pairs.

504
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,960
Huh?

505
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,220
I was so stunned.

506
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,400
I really didn't expect that.

507
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
It didn't even cross my mind at all.

508
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,100
I was so shocked.

509
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,280
If you saw me, my face would look like...

510
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,560
My jaw dropped.

511
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,200
- What...
- This is shocking.

512
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,880
- Totally.
- I'm shocked.

513
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,360
- What a shock.
- This is shocking.

514
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,040
I'm shocked.

515
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,220
But you didn't have to pair up

516
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,240
because Instructor Oui...

517
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
After he coached you,
he noticed something,

518
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,880
like how your voices match each other.

519
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,550
And the first pair to qualify is...

520
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,800
The first pair to make it to the mission...

521
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,080
I'll announce the first person,

522
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,360
and that's...

523
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,560
Copper.

524
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
Copper!

525
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Thank you.

526
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,240
Congratulations.

527
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,360
I thanked everyone so much
at that point.

528
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm beyond happy.
After that, I thought...

529
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,000
"Wow, I made it through
the qualifying round."

530
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,360
Thank you, Instructor Oui,

531
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,280
and thanks to everything
that made this possible.

532
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,560
And the next qualifier to duet with Copper

533
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,720
is...

534
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,000
I was thinking it would be Fifa or Pete.

535
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,540
Phupha,

536
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,520
I think.

537
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,760
Fifa.

538
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,440
Congratulations, Fifa.

539
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,600
Personally, I've always
wanted to work with him,

540
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,080
maybe sing

541
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,520
or dance with him at least once.

542
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,760
I didn't think I'd get a chance
this early, though.

543
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,840
I think it's good.

544
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,740
Copper is good at singing.

545
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,840
Also, our voices go well together
and have a similar range,

546
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
as Instructor Oui intended.

547
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,680
Alright, the first duet is Copper and Fifa.

548
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,840
So, what about the second one,
Instructor Oui?

549
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,760
Next up, I'll announce the first person,

550
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
and that's...

551
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,320
I think it's either Phupha or Otto.

552
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,160
Phupha.

553
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,920
Phupha, congratulations.

554
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,220
I'm happy that I qualified

555
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,740
for the next round,

556
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,080
since I didn't expect I'd make it

557
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,800
or that my potential was good enough
for the instructor.

558
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Alright, the next one on the list

559
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,680
is...

560
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Otto.

561
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Pete.

562
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,600
Otto.

563
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
Otto!

564
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,120
I'm happy since I thought...

565
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Like, I...

566
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,320
I paid attention to
what Instructor Oui taught

567
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
and practiced hard.

568
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm really happy
I made it to the next round.

569
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,560
I was kinda awestruck,

570
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,640
thinking about
whether we'd get along.

571
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
But after some talking,
I realized it was okay.

572
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,280
His pick was fine,

573
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
and I thought we'd make a good duo.

574
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,680
It looked like they exchanged letters
the first day they met,

575
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,360
so I'm curious to see how my boys cook.

576
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,120
- Congratulations, Otto.
- Thank you.

577
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,120
- I'm happy for you.
- Amazing job.

578
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,280
You guys still have hope.

579
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
You have to be confident
it's gonna be you, right?

580
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

581
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,440
Let's move on to the third duo, Instructor.

582
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,080
And the first person in the third pair

583
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,540
is...

584
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,020
There were two spots left,
and I wasn't feeling very confident at the end.

585
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,920
This is bad. Am I not through?

586
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,360
Pete.

587
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Pete!

588
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
Congratulations.

589
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,400
When I heard my name, I felt at ease.

590
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,240
At least, I'll get to sing again.

591
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,720
And who's the last one qualified
for the next round

592
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,180
to duet with Pete?

593
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,840
Since there are rules for this challenge,

594
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,120
- Yes.
- I can only choose

595
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,720
one person,

596
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,840
and that's...

597
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,680
I thought it had to be...

598
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,760
Pung.

599
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,440
I listened to PatJi last season,

600
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,920
so I thought it would be him.

601
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,960
PatJi.

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,050
PatJi!

603
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
When my name was announced
as the one who'd duet with Pete,

604
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,400
I was really stunned.

605
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,160
I wonder if we'd get along
or make a great duo.

606
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
I also think that after we work together,

607
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,200
we'll click even more.

608
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,520
I was...

609
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,240
I must admit that I'm nervous.

610
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,560
This is pretty new to me

611
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,120
since I don't get to interact with him much.

612
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Congratulations to the six qualifiers,

613
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,960
making three pairs.

614
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,120
They'll perform as duets in the next round.

615
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,800
Instructor Oui,
anything you want to say to the boys?

616
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,240
You guys have great foundations.

617
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,620
With constant practice

618
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,560
and by finding what you need to work on,

619
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,160
you can definitely improve.

620
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,280
Guys, tonight,

621
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
please give me lots of support,

622
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,640
my online Mommies,
Sisters, and Grannies.

623
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,840
Mommy.

624
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,800
I promise I'll do my best.

625
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,680
And...

626
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,720
Yeah, I'll give it my all.

627
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,640
Thank you.

628
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,360
I've never heard PatJi
sing a duet with anyone else,

629
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,640
so I felt...

630
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,040
I'd like to see it.

631
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,960
If you're wondering
what song we'll sing...

632
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
stay tuned for tonight.

633
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Please root for me.

634
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,360
Phupha and I will give it our all.

635
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,720
For those who aren't here today...

636
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,440
Are they missing out on something?

637
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,520
Please root for Team Copper and Fifa.

638
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,160
Our duo will delight your ears.

639
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,400
Copper and I will go all in.

640
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,840
Copper and Fifa

641
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,120
both have a knack for this.

642
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
If they duet,

643
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,240
it's gonna be intense.

644
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,640
Honestly, I'm so happy
I got to take care of you all.

645
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Welcome, everyone, to DOMUNDI.

646
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,480
My job here has concluded.

647
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
See you next time, guys.

648
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,400
Bye.

649
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

650
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,840
I thought you sent it yesterday.

651
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,840
I have no idea about that.

652
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,280
- I was gonna send it to you.
- Really?

653
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,160
I'll send the letter today.

654
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,960
"Send the letter"?

655
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,920
Oh, he has no clue.

656
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
You'll find out soon.

657
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Sorry, Pung.

658
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
It's all good.

659
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,680
I tried, but it's...

660
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,640
Come scan this QR code.
We're creating a LINE group chat.

661
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,000
What group chat?

662
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,600
- In LINE.
- Our group chat.

663
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,480
- Our group chat?
- For us to talk.

664
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Scan it.

665
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,360
Little Chlorophyll.

666
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,480
Scan it.

667
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,840
Phupha, you too.

668
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,320
Why didn't it go through?

669
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,520
Can you join?

670
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,600
Can I see?

671
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
Hey, Otto.

672
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,480
Of course, Porsche.

673
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
The name's adorable, 'DOMUNDI Friendship.'

674
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,160
- Let me scan the QR code.
- Sure thing.

675
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,560
"Hey, bro."

676
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
Hello, everyone.

677
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,920
Welcome.

678
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,240
This way, please.

679
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,120
Wow, it's my first time seeing you all.

680
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,980
Let me introduce myself first.
I'm Bro Poppy,

681
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,440
and I've taken over Bro Park's role.

682
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,820
Your mission today is...

683
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,720
'Acoustic Singing Challenge.'

684
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,800
There's no denying that
expressing feelings through songs

685
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,470
is another very important thing.

686
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,480
Today, I've been informed by Bro Park

687
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,440
that you all have gone through

688
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,240
an evaluation already.

689
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,560
Before we learn
what songs you're gonna sing,

690
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,520
I have a question. Are you tired?

691
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
You are?

692
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,560
I'll sit down, then.

693
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,280
Now, you may take your seats.

694
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,840
Come on.

695
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,480
Please sit down.

696
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,040
For today's mission,

697
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,720
we're honored
to have an instructor joining us,

698
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,560
someone who has been with us
since Seasons 1 and 2,

699
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,320
and today, he'll be serving as a judge
in Season 3.

700
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,360
He's not someone else.

701
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,000
Please welcome...

702
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,960
Instructor P., Prapruet Tongthanee.

703
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's give him a big hand.

704
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,200
Hi, I'm P., Prapruet Tongthanee.

705
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
I'm here to be the judge
for today's singing mission.

706
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Let's greet everyone here.

707
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,600
Okay. Hi, guys.

708
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,800
Hello.

709
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
I'm happy to see you all.

710
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,640
It's our first time together as well.

711
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,840
Before we get to hear them sing,

712
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,720
would you like to give them
some encouragement?

713
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,560
- Please.
- Okay.

714
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,000
For those of you who are about to sing,

715
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,320
I just want you to give it your all.

716
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,160
I think singing
is something you all enjoy,

717
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,720
and that's why it can come out well.

718
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,320
Remember that
what you're singing for everyone

719
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,440
is something that brings you happiness,
so sing with all the joy you've got.

720
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,800
And that's a message of encouragement
from Instructor P.,

721
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,600
who has been a judge
since the first two seasons

722
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
and now returns once again this season.

723
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,880
Do your best.

724
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,840
As for the next judge,

725
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,760
he's one of the talents from DOMUNDI,

726
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,880
with experience
in both acting and singing.

727
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,800
And today, he'll be joining us
to judge this mission as well.

728
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,680
Let's welcome

729
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,520
Tommy, Sittichok Pueakpoolpol.

730
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,200
There he is.

731
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,960
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hello.

732
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,160
Good evening.

733
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,880
Hi, I'm Tommy Sittichok,

734
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,840
an artist under DMD MUSIC.

735
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm so glad to be here
to share some advice with everyone.

736
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,080
I also want to hear
their beautiful voices.

737
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,040
Hi, guys.

738
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

739
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:41,640
♫Closing my eyes
so we can meet in my dreams,♫

740
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,040
♫Where our hearts still stay♫

741
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,160
♫Under the moon and the starry beams,♫

742
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,360
♫Your shadow hasn't faded away♫

743
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,320
I was amazed by his voice,

744
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,400
like...

745
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,840
it was the first time
I'd ever heard him sing live.

746
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,280
And it's his unreleased song,

747
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
so I hadn't heard it before.

748
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,920
I was really impressed.

749
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,280
His voice was amazing.

750
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,640
He's my idol.

751
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,120
He was really cool, and you could feel
the emotion in his singing.

752
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,760
It made me want to sing like that, too.

753
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,280
♫Unforgettable, this night's the night♫

754
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,880
♫Memories of that day I walked away♫

755
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,000
♫Still missing you every single night♫

756
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,560
♫Wishing I could rewind the day,♫

757
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,520
♫I'd ask for one more chance to stay,♫

758
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,920
♫So we can be together
like the good old days♫

759
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,320
Hearing 'Dreaming'
for the first time was...

760
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,400
It's an honor to be
one of the first people to hear it.

761
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,080
It was really beautiful.
It made me melt, you know.

762
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,480
And when I looked straight at Tommy
while he was singing,

763
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,480
he was incredibly stunning.

764
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,960
His emotions
genuinely came through to everyone.

765
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,360
♫Unforgettable, this night's the night♫

766
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,679
♫Memories of that day I walked away♫

767
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,679
♫Still missing you every single night♫

768
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,239
♫Wishing I could rewind the day,♫

769
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,159
♫I'd ask for one more chance to stay,♫

770
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:40,280
♫So we can be together
like the good old days♫

771
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,760
Thank you.

772
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,570
Please give Tommy a big hand, guys.

773
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,560
Thank you.

774
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,120
That was such an exclusive show,

775
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,139
as it was the first time
this song had been sung,

776
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,920
and it's called 'Dreaming.'

777
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,320
By the time this program airs,
my song should be released.

778
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,080
So, please give 'Dreaming' some support.

779
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,440
I just want to tell you all that

780
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,720
the scariest thing is
the pressure when you're on stage.

781
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,000
Just give it your all.

782
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,840
Do it the way you practiced.

783
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,160
I know you've got this. Good luck.

784
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,840
Alright, and those are two of our judges.

785
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,640
However, we have 2 more.

786
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,520
They're not two soloists.

787
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,880
They're a duo.

788
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,960
They were on this program before.

789
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,360
It was DMD Friendship Season 1
that they were on.

790
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,640
They're your seniors.

791
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,520
Are you ready to meet them?

792
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

793
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,720
Alright, if you're ready,

794
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,110
please welcome Tle and FirstOne!

795
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,280
- Hello.
- Hi.

796
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
I'm Tle Matimun.

797
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm FirstOne Wannakorn.

798
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,560
We're here as judges

799
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,840
- Right.
- for the singing mission.

800
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
That's right.

801
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,990
Alright, hi, everyone.

802
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,600
- Hello.
- Hi.

803
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,560
Actually, today,

804
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,080
I'm just here to support FirstOne

805
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,240
during his performance.

806
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,160
He won the singing mission in Season 1,

807
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,280
so please give him some support.

808
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,720
He's also an artist under DMD MUSIC.

809
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,280
♫There once was someone
I longed to find,♫

810
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,160
♫I wondered how it'd feel
to call them mine♫

811
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,340
♫The love I dreamed of,
yet never defined,♫

812
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,320
♫Then you appeared, as if by design,♫

813
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,160
♫And the dream took form beyond my mind♫

814
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,480
♫The one who makes my dreams come true,♫

815
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,080
♫The one in my heart, baby, it's you♫

816
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,600
♫It's you I've been longing for,♫

817
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,240
♫The one I've always adored♫

818
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
♫Right by my side, it's truly you♫

819
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,120
♫Clearly, my heart beats just for you♫

820
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,960
♫It's you I want...♫

821
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,600
♫From now on, you'll be my all♫

822
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,120
I've been their fan
for such a long time now.

823
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,320
I love hearing them sing

824
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,800
'cause they have beautiful voices.

825
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,400
So I've always been
a little fan of theirs.

826
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,320
I'm really glad
to have them as our judges

827
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,880
'cause I've always been their fan.

828
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,520
I love their voices

829
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,800
and the way they harmonize.

830
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,080
What I sang today
was inspired by them as well.

831
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,240
I really like them.

832
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,540
♫The one who makes my dreams come true,♫

833
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,000
♫The one in my heart, baby, it's you♫

834
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,680
♫It's you I've been longing for,♫

835
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,240
♫The one I've always adored♫

836
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,640
♫Right by my side, it's truly you♫

837
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,040
♫Clearly, my heart beats just for you♫

838
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,040
♫It's you I want...♫

839
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,720
♫From now on, you'll be my all♫

840
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,800
Yeah, something like that.

841
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,560
- Thank you.
- That was beautiful.

842
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,120
It's a great honor
that you sang for us today.

843
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
- Thank you.
- Tommy even said that

844
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,600
the way you sang...

845
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,920
If you were one of the contestants,

846
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,240
you'd fail.

847
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
Oh, thank you.

848
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,360
However, Tle told me,

849
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,800
"But I 'fell' in love."

850
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,720
He actually said that.

851
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,840
Why are you blushing?

852
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,800
Come on now.

853
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,080
- Oh...
- Please, you're the judge.

854
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,980
- Thank you.
- Alright.

855
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,200
- Do I sit there?
- Yes, right next to Tle.

856
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Are you sure?

857
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,960
He might fall even harder.

858
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,000
Alright, and now,

859
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,520
all of our judges are here.

860
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,880
From the morning auditions,

861
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,000
only three pairs made it to this round.

862
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,720
You all already know
who they are, right?

863
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,200
Now, the prize for the winners

864
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,920
of this mission is...

865
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,340
They'll get to spend Friendship Time
with the person they choose.

866
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
It can be
the duet partner they sing with,

867
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,160
anyone,

868
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,880
or even someone who isn't here today.

869
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,600
That's a prize well worth winning.

870
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,480
So, I believe the first pair is ready.

871
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,920
Are you ready, Copper and Fifa?

872
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,640
- Yes.
- Ready?

873
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,160
Please go to your positions.

874
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
Whoa, good luck.

875
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,120
- Come on.
- Good luck, guys.

876
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,200
The first pair, Copper and Fifa,

877
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,040
will be singing 'Mantra' by Keng Harit.

878
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
Wow!

879
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,960
That was beautiful.

880
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,320
♫Dear today's breeze, drifting by,♫

881
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,960
- ♫Dear tonight's moon in the sky,♫
- That's already...

882
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,360
♫Please hear my plea, my tender cry,♫

883
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,400
♫Let me stay forever by your side,♫

884
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,440
♫Through endless time,
may our love never die♫

885
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,320
♫Please, let my prayer start,♫

886
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,680
♫May we never ever need to part♫

887
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,760
♫Please, I beg with all my heart,♫

888
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,600
♫May you never leave, never depart♫

889
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:29,560
♫Should any magic bind you to my side,♫

890
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,760
♫I'll cast the spell to keep you mine♫

891
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,920
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

892
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,960
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

893
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,920
♫Though no spell works,
I'll pour my soul, my life,♫

894
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,280
♫Only to keep you near
and hold you tight♫

895
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,680
♫Should heaven be kind,♫

896
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,520
♫May it never take away my light♫

897
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,240
♫'Cause you keep me alive♫

898
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,880
♫Please be in my life♫

899
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,960
As for Copper and Fifa,

900
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,200
their voices are very unique.

901
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,760
One has a husky tone, while the other
has a more powerful voice.

902
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,680
And when they sang together, it was like...

903
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
It was...

904
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,080
perfect.

905
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,880
Whoa.

906
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,280
They really did...

907
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,040
an incredible job.

908
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,080
They really tried their best.

909
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,160
Also, it's Keng's song.

910
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,240
Given how high the key is in Keng's song,

911
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,880
both of them handled it perfectly.

912
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,520
They wowed us all
and gave us goosebumps.

913
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,880
♫Should any magic bind you to my side,♫

914
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,280
♫I'll cast the spell to keep you mine♫

915
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,360
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

916
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,800
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

917
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,080
♫Though no spell works,
I'll pour my soul, my life,♫

918
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,520
♫Only to keep you near

919
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,960
♫Should heaven be kind,♫

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,800
♫May it never take away my light♫

♫'Cause you keep me alive♫

♫Please be in my life♫

923
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,000
Please give Copper and Fifa a big hand.

924
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,200
Wow!

925
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
Good job.

926
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
- Great job.
- Well done.

927
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,240
After hearing that,
how do you feel, judges?

928
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,240
Well...

929
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,440
Should I say I'm surprised?

930
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
What surprised me was that...

931
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,680
they sang in the original key,

932
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,320
but in their own version
with a new arrangement,

933
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,920
and they nailed it.

934
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,440
Their voices blended really well.

935
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,000
I mean, they matched.

936
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,280
They adjusted to each other well.

937
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,520
What they could add is

938
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,040
a bit more groove.

939
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,500
If, while singing,

940
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,040
you feel the rhythm has weight,

941
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,560
and that weight
is connected and consistent,

942
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,480
it adds more groove,
more flow, and more dynamics.

943
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,880
That would make the show
more interesting.

944
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,320
It was good that, toward the end,

945
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,040
they added more ad-libs and harmony.

946
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,720
I think if they add just a little more,

947
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,000
the show could be even more engaging.

948
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,240
But their voices matched really well,
and the overall show sounded very nice.

949
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

950
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,120
Alright, I actually have
a lot of comments.

951
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,800
This may take around three days.

952
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,880
- Nothing.
- Can you make it 3 minutes

953
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,880
instead of three days?

954
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,120
I didn't even write anything down

955
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,320
'cause...

956
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,680
I got carried away.

957
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,880
I actually liked it
right from the start.

958
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,640
Like, they made the song...

959
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,240
I mean, the way Keng sings it

960
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,200
sounds a little bit old.

961
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,280
You know, it sounds kinda old.

962
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,960
Old man vibes, you know.

963
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,160
But the way you sang it
made the song sound so new.

964
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,680
You know, like...

965
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,880
I mean.

966
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,890
- Can I explain it like that?
- Do you mean it sounds magical?

967
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,080
- No...
- Keng makes the song magical,

968
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,280
- like it's enchanted, right?
- Magical.

969
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,360
Oh, right. That's what I meant.

970
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,800
Right! The way Keng sings it is...

971
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,440
Magical?

972
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,280
Old.

973
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,080
Alright.

974
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,420
- It's his style, though.
- Right.

975
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,080
Anyway, he's done it well.

976
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,960
And when I heard
Copper and Fifa sing it,

977
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,560
I thought their version
was very easy to listen to.

978
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,580
Alright.

979
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,720
We've now heard
the comments from all the judges.

980
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,680
Please give Copper and Fifa
a round of applause.

981
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,240
You may now come back to your seats.

982
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,960
Next up,

983
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,240
Otto and Phupha,

984
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,500
please go to your positions.

985
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,280
The next pair, Otto and Phupha,

986
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,840
will be singing 'Rak Raek Pob'
by Tattoo Colour.

987
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,040
Let the performance begin.

988
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:50,960
♫Does love at first sight truly exist?♫

989
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:59,080
♫Just one glance, no hello,
no word, no kiss♫

990
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:05,040
♫Can strangers fall in love like this?♫

991
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:13,840
♫It's impossible for someone
to love that easily, I insist♫

992
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,880
♫It may be possible, but only in a myth♫

993
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:29,000
♫Love songs, sweet dreams, oh, you wish♫

994
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,280
♫But one day, I found you,
out of everybody♫

995
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,720
♫My heart was restless,
aching painfully♫

996
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,360
♫Like magic suddenly cast on me♫

997
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,000
♫In that moment, I loved you instantly♫

998
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,600
♫What is it like
to fall in love at first sight?♫

999
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:02,040
♫Is it you,
the one who would change my life?♫

1000
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,800
♫From that day,
my heart finally realized,♫

1001
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:14,440
♫Every dream grew clear,
every hope felt right,♫

1002
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,820
♫Now I know it's real,
this love at first sight♫

1003
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,480
Otto and Phupha?

1004
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,920
I'm so proud of them

1005
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,590
'cause I really adore Otto.

1006
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,560
I may not have talked
to Phupha much, but...

1007
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:35,600
What really stood out was the sweetness
and natural feel of Otto's live singing.

1008
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,480
Seeing that side of him,

1009
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,480
his shyness made me feel shy, too.

1010
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,690
And when Phupha sang after that,

1011
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,440
they complemented each other so well.

1012
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,680
This version of the song

1013
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,360
felt especially sweet.

1014
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,320
I could really feel
the chemistry between Phupha and Otto.

1015
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,360
Their voices blended beautifully,
with a mix of sweetness and coolness.

1016
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,800
It made me wanna move along.

1017
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,000
It was a lovely show.

1018
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,240
I really loved it.

1019
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,480
♫What is it like
to fall in love at first sight?♫

1020
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:16,920
♫Is it you,
the one who would change my life?♫

1021
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,720
♫From that day,
my heart finally realized,♫

1022
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:29,560
♫Every dream grew clear,
every hope felt right,♫

1023
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:36,480
♫Now I know it's real,
this love at first sight♫

1024
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:48,360
♫Finally realized it's real,
this love at first sight♫

1025
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,880
Please give Otto and Phupha
a round of applause.

1026
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,160
That was really touching.

1027
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,920
Alright, now let's hear from the judges.

1028
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Tommy, first.

1029
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,120
Alright, for Otto and Phupha,

1030
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,160
I'm someone who pays close attention
when people perform.

1031
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,680
I always catch all the details.

1032
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,920
I want to give a shoutout to Phupha.

1033
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,320
He has really strong stage presence.

1034
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,800
And the way he held the stage...

1035
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,200
He seemed to think,
"The show must go on."

1036
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,840
He clearly felt proud
to be out there singing,

1037
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,600
and he used his body to express himself.

1038
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,120
His body language
communicated something, you know.

1039
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,760
And so did his movements.

1040
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,280
I could really see his confidence.

1041
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,440
Toward the end,
their vocal lines blended really well.

1042
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,520
And that part with the clapping,

1043
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,160
it felt like
they were syncing with each other.

1044
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,840
Otto seemed more relaxed,

1045
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,120
and flowed along with Phupha.

1046
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,680
Overall, the performance looked...

1047
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,040
much better.

1048
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,080
From the middle to the end,

1049
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,120
the whole performance
came together really nicely.

1050
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,880
- That's it.
- Thank you.

1051
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,320
Instructor P., please.

1052
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,400
- I'll add to Tommy's comments.
- Okay.

1053
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,160
What I felt, just like Tommy,

1054
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,200
is that Otto was a little shy at first,

1055
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,000
- Right.
- while Phupha led the performance.

1056
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,560
Anyway, both had strengths

1057
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,720
that complemented each other well.

1058
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,040
Otto may have been shy at the start,

1059
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,000
but his voice conveyed strong feelings.

1060
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,200
It was soft and sweet,

1061
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,760
kind of like
he was in love or something.

1062
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,280
That's what I got from his voice.

1063
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,600
As for Phupha,
his tone is sharp, a bit monotone,

1064
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,840
and quite projecting.

1065
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,480
It may feel a little less gentle.

1066
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,520
However, the way
he conveyed his emotions

1067
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,680
and how he tried
to make the performance more enjoyable,

1068
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,590
worked really well.

1069
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,440
Both of them still have
room to grow in their singing.

1070
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,600
They can explore more vocal variety

1071
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,800
and make the song sound even better

1072
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,120
whether you're singing it together
or with someone else.

1073
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,360
I think with gradual practice,

1074
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,480
they'll be able to sing more diversely

1075
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,320
and develop other skills, too.

1076
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,000
Today's performance was excellent.

1077
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,080
Alright, let's give
Otto and Phupha a big hand.

1078
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,090
Please.

1079
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,480
- Good job.
- That was our second pair,

1080
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,800
and they've done an amazing job

1081
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,920
and even impressed the judges.

1082
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,280
And now, it's time for our last pair,

1083
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,080
and they'll be singing a song for us.

1084
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,480
One of them has already sung on stage
many times before.

1085
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,720
Let's welcome Pete and PatJi.

1086
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
Please.

1087
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,160
The last pair, Pete and PatJi,

1088
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,000
will be singing 'Time Flies'
by NONT TANONT and Jeff Satur.

1089
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,680
- Wow.
- Let the performance begin.

1090
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,880
- Good luck, our babies.
- This song is hard.

1091
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,200
♫I can't really say
what tomorrow will be♫

1092
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,000
♫Or how long
you'll still be here with me♫

1093
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,200
♫It may last just a second, briefly,♫

1094
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,840
♫Or as long as eternity♫

1095
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,200
♫And what I do may seem unnecessary♫

1096
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,120
♫But how much time do we have left,
if we do?♫

1097
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,800
♫How long it will last,
no one has a clue♫

1098
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,960
♫I'll whisper my love
as my heart feels true♫

1099
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,000
♫I'll hold you tight
as my heart longs to♫

1100
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,280
♫And treasure
every moment passing through♫

1101
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,960
♫From this moment on,♫

1102
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,120
♫I won't waste a second that goes by♫

1103
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,120
♫The quicker the hours fly,♫

1104
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,160
♫The more I learn to love you right♫

1105
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,920
♫'Cause night after night,♫

1106
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,920
♫I don't know which moment lies,♫

1107
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,160
♫Waiting to be our last goodbye♫

1108
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,920
♫I just want to be sure♫

1109
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,200
♫I leave no regrets behind♫

1110
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,920
Whoa, Pete and PatJi...

1111
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,960
They made things even more intense.

1112
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,900
The first moment
I heard Pete sing, I knew...

1113
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,160
he was something special.

1114
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,000
And PatJi is no less impressive.

1115
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,040
Both of them

1116
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,680
worked so hard to blend together.

1117
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,720
As for PatJi,

1118
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,400
I already knew he was good.

1119
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,720
I've heard him practice many times,

1120
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,640
and we've sung together before.

1121
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,120
So I've always known how good he is.

1122
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,840
Yeah, and I'm so proud of him.

1123
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,240
Even though he didn't win last season,

1124
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,160
he's grown
and become even better this season.

1125
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,400
♫I'll make
every minute from now worthwhile♫

1126
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:14,040
♫And make it beautiful
until the end of time♫

1127
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,360
♫From this moment on,♫

1128
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,480
♫I won't waste a second that goes by♫

1129
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,440
♫The quicker the hours fly,♫

1130
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,300
♫The more I learn to love you right♫

1131
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,320
♫'Cause night after night,♫

1132
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,520
♫I don't know which moment lies,♫

1133
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:44,400
♫Waiting to be our last goodbye♫

1134
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,320
♫I just want to be sure♫

1135
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,560
♫I leave no regrets behind♫

1136
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,400
♫Until the last minute of my life,♫

1137
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,320
♫No regrets behind♫

1138
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,280
♫I'll leave no regrets behind♫

1139
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,670
Well done, our babies.

1140
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Our babies...

1141
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,160
That was impressive, Pete, PatJi.

1142
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,000
Now,

1143
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,840
let's hear the comments
from the judges, shall we?

1144
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,640
Pete, you have great vocal details.

1145
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,880
The way you trilled and your techniques
are very interesting

1146
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,440
and truly unique to you.

1147
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,840
As for PatJi, it's the same.

1148
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,800
You have a very unique singing style.

1149
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,080
We can recognize your voice right away.

1150
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,880
Your voice sounds natural
and has your own accent,

1151
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,120
which is still clearly present.

1152
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,640
And your voices blended very well.

1153
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,600
I really like how you communicated
in a way that's truly you.

1154
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,600
It's this song, with this story,

1155
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,560
but expressed in a younger way.

1156
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,560
And it showed that
you understand the meaning of the song.

1157
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,360
Like, you'll do your best
with the time you have left.

1158
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,040
And that made me feel like...

1159
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,040
it really came from your hearts.

1160
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,680
I'm glad
you chose to express it this way.

1161
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,720
Well done, guys.

1162
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,920
Thank you so much.

1163
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,360
Please.

1164
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,280
Wow.

1165
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,440
Whoa...

1166
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,440
First of all, I want to praise PatJi.

1167
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,080
I've seen him since day one,

1168
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,280
and today, it feels like
he's no longer that kid anymore.

1169
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,360
He's grown so much,

1170
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,960
and his voice is truly unique.

1171
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,240
As for Pete,

1172
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,800
wow, your voice is incredibly unique.

1173
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,240
Like,

1174
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,960
the dynamics were just perfect.

1175
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,360
I have nothing else to say.
You're just amazing.

1176
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,320
I know you're talented.

1177
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,160
And when you sang together,

1178
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,960
the harmonies came in...

1179
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,560
exactly...

1180
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,320
the way I imagined them in my head.

1181
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,720
You were like...

1182
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,560
- Wow...
- They're like us.

1183
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,080
Yeah, it's like
they're the younger versions of ourselves.

1184
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,400
This song is actually very difficult,
especially since it's a song by Nont and Jeff.

1185
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,960
But you managed to reinterpret it
in your own style,

1186
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I mean...

1187
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,920
It was excellent.
I don't have much more to add.

1188
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,070
I'll probably go back,
replay this episode,

1189
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,120
and just keep replaying
your performance.

1190
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,240
It was that good.

1191
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,660
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1192
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,400
Alright then. We'll let the contestants
take a break for now,

1193
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,640
and we'll be back
to review the scores together.

1194
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,680
You may take a break now.

1195
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,480
Please give them a round of applause.

1196
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,840
Now, I'd like to invite the judges
to give a brief recap

1197
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,880
of how each pair performed
before we move on to the results.

1198
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,160
Please.

1199
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,040
For me, I'll start with Copper and Fifa.

1200
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,560
I just want to say that
I really love both of your voices.

1201
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,800
Like...

1202
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,400
Your performance was amazing.

1203
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,180
Anyway, you truly made 'Mantra'

1204
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,160
completely your own, and it was perfect.

1205
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Excellent work.

1206
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Thank you.

1207
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,520
I'd like to talk about Otto and Phupha.

1208
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,440
I actually really like them.

1209
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,440
I mean, Otto has such a sweet voice,

1210
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,760
while Phupha's voice has a lot of power.

1211
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,080
And I really like...

1212
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,160
Phupha's body language while singing.

1213
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,640
He looked relaxed and cool
at the same time.

1214
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,960
When they performed together,

1215
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,480
their chemistry worked beautifully.

1216
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,760
I really loved it.

1217
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,800
Thank you.

1218
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,840
As for me,
I'd like to talk about Pete and PatJi.

1219
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,480
Pete, I want to tell you that...

1220
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,400
even though you've been praised a lot,

1221
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,800
don't ever feel like you've hit
the ceiling of what you can do.

1222
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,240
Never stop...

1223
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,400
improving yourself.

1224
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,640
Just keep striving forward.

1225
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,760
Practice every day.

1226
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,920
Don't let this talent go to waste.

1227
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,120
I really hope you continue to improve.

1228
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,880
As for PatJi,

1229
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,960
you've improved so much
from what I saw on the first day.

1230
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,160
From your performance,
I can see that you're getting better.

1231
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,800
Like I said,

1232
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,680
don't stop improving yourself.

1233
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,200
Just keep growing.

1234
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,680
One day, it will be your day.

1235
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1236
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,800
Alright.

1237
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,800
Before announcing the results,

1238
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,080
regardless of how things turn out,

1239
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,920
I hope all of you
can be proud of yourselves.

1240
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,040
And this isn't just for the six of you,

1241
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,360
but also for the other three,

1242
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,920
Ryujin, Porsche, Pung,

1243
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,360
as well as those
who couldn't be here today, North and Wave.

1244
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,640
I know that
each of you has your own dreams.

1245
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,080
And just like Tommy said,
keep chasing those dreams.

1246
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,320
Don't give up just yet.

1247
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,760
No matter what you want to become,

1248
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,480
believe in yourself
and make it come true.

1249
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,640
Someday, your time will come.

1250
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,840
Therefore, I believe
the six of you are ready

1251
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,460
to hear the official results now.

1252
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,320
The winners
of this 'Acoustic Singing Challenge'

1253
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
are...

1254
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,560
Congratulations to...

1255
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,560
Pete and PatJi.

1256
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,760
A big hand, please.

1257
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,380
Pete and PatJi

1258
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:05,640
are the winners
of this 'Acoustic Singing Challenge.'

1259
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,080
That's my boy.

1260
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,880
- Aw!
- Aw!

1261
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,640
I'm really happy.

1262
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,760
I mean,

1263
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,760
last year, I gave it my all
in the singing mission

1264
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,200
because I just love singing.

1265
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,040
I'm totally over the moon right now.

1266
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,200
Thank you so much to Pete,
thank you...

1267
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,800
to myself,

1268
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,000
and thank you to all of the judges.

1269
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,040
I was so happy the moment I found out we won

1270
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,920
because this was one of the few missions
I felt most confident in.

1271
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,760
I'm glad I got to win with PatJi, too.

1272
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,400
They both have unique voices,
and they used their vocal skills

1273
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,280
very effectively in many aspects
that are essential for a duet.

1274
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,280
Whether it was vocal techniques
that needed to flow smoothly together,

1275
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,480
the interaction between voices
and stage performance,

1276
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,200
as well as their harmonization.

1277
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,640
These were the key reasons.

1278
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:55,440
Each pair has their own strengths.

1279
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,080
I discussed with the judges that

1280
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,120
the pair most suitable
to be selected today

1281
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,200
would be the one with the skills
and techniques required for a duet,

1282
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,640
and it's Pete and PatJi.

1283
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,840
Alright.

1284
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,880
Congratulations.

1285
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,040
The prize you've received
is Friendship Time,

1286
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,200
during which you may choose one friend
to spend time with.

1287
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,240
This can be
any of the nine participants here,

1288
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,880
or the other two who are not here.

1289
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,560
Please give them
another round of applause.

1290
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,320
Well done.

1291
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,800
And I'd like to thank all of our judges:

1292
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Instructor P.,

1293
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,760
Tommy,

1294
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,400
Tle, and FirstOne.

1295
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,040
- Please give them a big hand, guys.
- Thank you.

1296
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1297
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,720
Alright,

1298
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,720
moving on to the next step,

1299
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,000
we'll give you time
to make your own selection.

1300
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,520
This is your moment now.

1301
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,720
Congrats.

1302
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,080
Come on, let's go see them.

1303
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Good job, guys.

1304
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,720
Well done.

1305
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,400
Let's hug.

1306
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
Come on, let's hug.

1307
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,360
- I'm squished now.
- Come on.

1308
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,200
Why am I in the center?

1309
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,560
Just be there.

1310
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,720
- No.
- Please.

1311
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,880
I already talked to PatJi.

1312
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,400
There are actually a lot of them

1313
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,980
that I really want to get to know

1314
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,320
'cause I feel like...

1315
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,920
living in the same house means
I get to see them often,

1316
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,760
so I want to be close to them.

1317
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,840
However, when I talked to PatJi...

1318
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,440
Pete and I already talked
about the person we're gonna choose

1319
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
so that we wouldn't choose
the same person.

1320
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,720
I want to spend Friendship Time with...

1321
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,880
I think I'll go with...

1322
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,640
- Fifa.
- Fifa.

1323
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,280
Why would he send me this
when he doesn't even care?

1324
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,640
It's 'cause you sent him yours first.

1325
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,720
When you take a clear stance,

1326
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,600
there will naturally be people
who like you and people who don't.

1327
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,760
It makes me feel like...

1328
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,120
I don't fit in with the others.

1329
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,560
You don't see yourself
as a singer, do you?

1330
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,240
Is that why
you wanna be an actor instead?

1331
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,960
I often feel like
I'm not as good as the others.
