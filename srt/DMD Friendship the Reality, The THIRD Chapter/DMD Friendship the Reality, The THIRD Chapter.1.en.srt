00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
DOMUNDI is an entertainment company
that strives to produce excellent artists

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,680
in numerous fields
of the entertainment industry,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,080
including series, music, and more.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,280
We are back with the third season

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,120
of a reality show
where the DOMUNDI Gen 5 trainees

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
will be living under the same roof

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,560
to train and improve their skills,

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,680
as well as to find a partner
with the right chemistry.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,880
Their ultimate goal is to play
the main roles in the company's new series.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
This is 'DMD Friendship the Reality,
The THIRD Chapter.'

11
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,240
Hello.

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,920
I'm Pung, Phirunwat Promrat.

13
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm 21 years old.

14
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm currently studying at
the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,260
as a freshman.

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm also working
as an actor under DOMUNDI.

17
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
Prior to the show,

18
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,120
I was in 'Khemjira The Series,'

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,320
which ended recently.

20
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,040
I played Chayod, Paran's younger brother.

21
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,880
I became part of DOMUNDI

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,000
right after the debut of Gen 4.

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
In my eyes, it was such a shame

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,320
that I was there a bit too late.

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
However, I'm now part of Gen 5,

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
and I'll do my best

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,160
and show my fullest potential to the world.

28
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,840
As for the partner I've got in mind...

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
I know that

30
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,680
I tend not to speak my mind,

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,520
so I want a partner who understands me.

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,840
I'll try to change myself

33
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,680
and walk alongside him,

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,000
supporting each other.

35
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,000
Hi, guys.

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,200
I'm Porsche, Sitha Kanchana-alongkorn.

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,800
As for my age, it's a secret.

38
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,760
Let's just say that I was born in 1995.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,200
I'll let you guys do the math yourselves.

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,180
I graduated from the Faculty of Dentistry,

41
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,840
Chulalongkorn University.

42
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
Yeah, and I'm very nervous.

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,000
Hello.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
You're the only one before me?

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
- I'm now a DOMUNDI artist,
- Yes.

46
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,560
while also working
as a dentist here and there.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm nervous,

48
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
but it's different from what I expected.

49
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,760
Since I've always been treated

50
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,690
like a little brother in this industry.

51
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,560
But now, I'm the big bro here.

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,880
It's a bit nervous and stressful,

53
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,960
as I want to be an example
to my fellow brothers.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
I'm also not sure
if I can get along with them,

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
or if they'd want
this big bro as their partner.

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,920
What will we be doing today?

57
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,720
I don't know.

58
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm here totally clueless.

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
I want a partner
who is upfront about their feelings,

60
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,520
and I want him to see my dreams as theirs

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,480
and vice versa.

62
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,720
I truly want to achieve
the dreams together with him.

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
I believe comfort at work

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,280
can be found in any career.

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,800
Hello, guys.

66
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,640
My name is North, Chatchapon Pranothong.

67
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm 20 years old.

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm currently studying at Bangkok University,

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,520
School of Business Administration,
Digital Marketing program,

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,680
as a sophomore.

71
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Sorry, I'm a third-year student.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,880
- Hello.
- Hi, North.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
Take a seat.

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,640
I used to work on a series,

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,060
but it was just a mini-series.

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,960
I've also done modeling
and advertisement shoots.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Despite that,
a new series is coming out soon!

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,960
- Did you have to travel far to get here?
- I was doing livestreams on TikTok at one point,

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,640
and Aof got interested in me,

80
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,200
so we had a chance for a chat.

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,920
- And that's how I got here.
- How are you doing?

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,000
I think it'll be like the previous seasons,
where we'll be doing missions

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,240
before choosing a partner.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
I hope I'll get one.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,360
I hope you're doing well.

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Not so much, actually.

87
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm usually a goofy person,

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,560
but when I'm with someone lovely,

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,320
I tend to tone it down.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,760
I want myself to look good in their eyes.

91
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Please support this season of DMD Friendship

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,360
and root for me, guys.

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,360
I hope I win at least one mission,

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,120
so I can get some Friendship Time

95
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,680
with someone here on the show.

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,360
Hello!

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,520
I'm Otto, Sorranan Suksawat.

98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm 20 years old.

99
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm currently a third-year student,
studying at Srinakharinwirot University,

100
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,400
College of Social Communication Innovation.

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,320
Before joining DOMUNDI,

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,520
I competed in survival reality shows.

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Oh, hey, Otto.

104
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,680
My Sad Chicken.

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,720
I've attended events with North.

106
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,920
I think he's the first member of Gen 5 I met.

107
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,960
- What?
- Why aren't you sitting next to me?

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,880
It's to keep the couch balanced.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Okay, okay.

110
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,440
I often don't engage with people first,

111
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,280
and I think the same goes for North.

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,320
However, after getting to talk
or attending events together,

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,680
we've grown to be closer.

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,160
He's also attentive
and takes care of me well.

115
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,600
The van picked him up before me.

116
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,240
While he was in the van,
he told me, "Hey, the van's arriving soon."

117
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,120
No, I mean...

118
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
I want to get to know him.

119
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,920
That's why I texted him.

120
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,760
Aof told me to get to know
all of the Gen 5 members,

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,920
and I did just that

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,080
so that we could get closer.

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
What I hope to get from this reality show is,

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,320
first of all,
a partner I want to work with,

125
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,240
someone whose chemistry clicks with mine.

126
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,200
On top of that, the show will allow me
to get to know all of the Gen 5 members,

127
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,400
as this is the perfect opportunity
to get to know them.

128
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,400
I've actually got a few people in mind,

129
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,600
but I'm actually open to someone else,

130
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,000
as I don't want to limit my opportunities.

131
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,140
Hi.

132
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,040
I'm Thanut Osaithai.

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,280
My nickname is Fifa, and I'm 19 years old.

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm currently a student at OpenSchool.

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm a 13th-year student,

136
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,970
or a Grade 12 student.

137
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
Hello, hello!

138
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,760
Since I was in 4th grade,

139
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,760
my family has been signing me up
for modeling competitions.

140
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,000
Then I started dancing
when I was in 7th grade.

141
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,320
- After that, I got to move to South Korea.
- Hi there!

142
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,120
- Then, I returned to stay here in Thailand.
- Whoa, your bags!

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Nervous?

144
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, I'm really nervous today.

145
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,160
- I want to perform on the final stage.
- How long have you been here?

146
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,440
Maybe I'll get to do a singing
and dancing performance that I want.

147
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,120
I actually haven't thought about
having a partner that much,

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,920
as we only recently knew each other.

149
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,120
I want to grow closer to them

150
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,560
and take my time.

151
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,120
My partner will probably be
the one I'm comfortable with.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,000
Hi, guys.

153
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
I'm Copper, Phuriwat Chotiratanasak.

154
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm currently 22 years old.

155
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm a 4th-year student, my final year.

156
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,640
I'm studying
at the University of Nottingham.

157
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,240
- Here he comes!
- He's here!

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
- Hey, Copper!
- Hello!

159
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,560
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

160
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm a student, studying in England.

161
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,040
When I'm in Thailand,
I'm working as an actor.

162
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
- Pung.
- Yes?

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,960
I forgot your name.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,760
Fifa.

165
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
Fifa, hit him with this pillow.

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,200
- Whoa, calm down, Porsche!
- Porsche!

167
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,480
I can feel that
Copper is extremely energetic.

168
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,000
If I get to know him better,

169
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,000
I might become half as energetic as he is.

170
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
If there's someone I want to know more about,

171
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
it's Copper.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,650
He looks like a caring person.

173
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,680
He always asks this and that.

174
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
He's very attentive.

175
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,160
I think he's pretty sweet.

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,120
He's quiet and not very sociable.

177
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm the one striking up conversations.

178
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,310
We were on an hour-long ride,

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,120
and I was talking to him nonstop.

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I've heard that
you just returned from England.

181
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,880
Yeah.

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
- Really?
- I actually just made it back here.

183
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,040
- When?
- What date?

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
- Yesterday.
- Obviously, I'll have good friends here.

185
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,110
- We'll foster friendship here, just like the name.
- For this show?

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
Apart from that,
we'll get to improve ourselves

187
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,200
in singing, dancing,

188
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,640
acting, modeling,

189
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,080
and other new skills
that we might get to learn in this season.

190
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,320
Please root for me, guys.

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,120
Hi.

192
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
I'm Wave, Thanaphat Tansakul.

193
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm 19.

194
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,560
I'm currently studying
the Fine and Applied Arts Program

195
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,720
in Performing Arts at SWU.

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
I'm a sophomore.

197
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,960
I've never worked
in the entertainment industry before.

198
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,960
Hi.

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,680
Hey, someone's here.

200
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,640
- Hey!
- Wave.

201
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,640
- Hello.
- Hey!

202
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,080
I've never done anything
in this industry,

203
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
so I thought I'd come here
to gain some experience.

204
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,800
No matter how many activities there are,

205
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll join them all.

206
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,760
I'm ready.

207
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,000
Right now,
I want to be friends with the others

208
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
'cause we just met
for the first time today.

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,880
So, some talking would be great.

210
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,000
I bet Fifa is super mischievous.

211
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,800
He seems quiet now,

212
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,560
but from what I can see,
I'm sure he's mischievous.

213
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,480
I've actually known Wave for a while

214
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,640
'cause we've been on set together.

215
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,600
Gosh, he's literally the troublemaker.

216
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Not sure what's gonna happen,

217
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,400
so stay tuned.

218
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,240
Even if nothing happens,
you can just watch us fool around.

219
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I'm sure it'll happen, though.

220
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,040
Hi,

221
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm Chnanvichya Roongsiripasert,

222
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,400
or Pete.

223
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm 17 years old.

224
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm a Grade 11 student
at Keerapat International School.

225
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,960
I've never worked
in the entertainment industry before.

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is my first time.

227
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh...

228
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
Hi. Hello.

229
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
- Oh...
- Hey!

230
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,720
There's more?

231
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,000
- Annyeong.
- The eighth member.

232
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
I may not be very experienced,

234
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,680
but I promise
I'll complete every mission with all my heart.

235
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,840
I just want to try my best.

236
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,800
I wanna see how far I can go.

237
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,520
Oh, I'm Pete.

238
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
How old are you?

239
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I'm 17.

240
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,680
Whoa...

241
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
- It's over.
- That means...

242
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,430
- I thought I was the youngest.
- you're not the youngest.

243
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,080
No more maknae.

244
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,000
I may seem quiet at first,

245
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,360
but once we become closer,

246
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,880
I tend to talk a lot.

247
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,280
If I feel comfortable around someone,

248
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,400
I tend to get clingy.

249
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
I think there are just 8, right?

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

251
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,960
- 8 members.
- That's enough.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
I guess Bros are coming soon.

253
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,040
I think so.

254
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,160
- I think this is it.
- Where do you think Bros will show up?

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,840
- Right there.
- The air vent?

256
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,560
Right here.

257
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,200
Hello.

258
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm Phupha,

259
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,130
Siraphop Moonsarn.

260
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,560
I'm 22.

261
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm a fourth-year student
at the Faculty of Social Sciences,

262
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,960
Srinakharinwirot University.

263
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,040
- And I also work as a model.
- There's another one.

264
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,880
- Surprise.
- Hi.

265
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
- Hello.
- Hi.

266
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,960
What's your name?

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
I'm hoping to improve myself,

268
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,680
my skills, and everything

269
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,440
that will help me grow.

270
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,920
How old are you?

271
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,880
I'm 22.

272
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,480
This will allow me
to meet new people, make new friends,

273
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,440
and maybe find a partner

274
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,760
of my own choice.

275
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,720
There's actually someone who caught my eye.

276
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm not sure if I'm imagining it,

277
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,120
but I think there's something going on.

278
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,320
Our eyes met, and something like that.

279
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
He's giving Wasian vibes.

280
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,640
Like, a bad boy.

281
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,200
I think a lot of people would like him.

282
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,480
Welcome to Friendship House, everyone.

283
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,200
From this moment on,

284
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,240
all of you are
officially the 5th generation of DOMUNDI.

285
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,960
- Whoa!
- Wow!

286
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,240
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

287
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,400
- Congrats.
- Right.

288
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,000
Today, you'll get
to spend time in this house,

289
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,160
getting to know one another.

290
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,760
There's a box at the front
for drawing bedroom lots.

291
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,920
Please go ahead
and draw to choose your bedrooms.

292
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,000
Whoa.

293
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
We're drawing lots.

294
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
- That's good.
- Let's start with the newbie.

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
Let's start with the oldest.

296
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
- Who's the oldest?
- Whoa!

297
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,640
No one is.

298
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,280
Come on, Pete. You go first.

299
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,400
Come on.

300
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,400
Don't look.

301
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,560
- It's been there for a while.
- Let's draw.

302
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,560
- I thought it was nothing special.
- Place it in the center.

303
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,520
Whoa...

304
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,140
- Are you looking?
- Thought it was decor, right?

305
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,240
Yeah, right.

306
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,440
Don't tell us yet.

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
Let's do it together.

308
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,320
I haven't seen it yet.

309
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,600
From youngest to oldest?

310
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
- It's okay.
- We can do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

311
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,120
If I'm your roommate,

312
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,960
I promise I won't cause any trouble.

313
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,360
I'll stay quiet.

314
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,410
Okay.

315
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright, guys.

316
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
Let's reveal it together.

317
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,120
3,

318
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,840
2,

319
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
1...

320
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,480
3 people per room.

321
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,320
- Whoa!
- Oh...

322
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm staying with Wave and Porsche.

323
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,190
I'm staying with Pung.

324
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm with Phupha.

325
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,280
Now that your bedrooms have been assigned,

326
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,840
please move your belongings
to your own rooms.

327
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,880
For today,
please make the most of this time

328
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,720
- before we begin our first mission tomorrow.
- Yay!

329
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,560
That means no mission for today.

330
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,280
Let's go.

331
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,600
- Oh, it's red.
- Oh...

332
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,680
What?

333
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
- Are you over 23?
- I'm 19.

334
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,220
- 19?
- Yeah.

335
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,160
So I'm the oldest?

336
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
This is our room.

337
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,560
Whoa...

338
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,960
Wow.

339
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,400
It's spacious.

340
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,280
Perfect.

341
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,160
You can claim your spots first.

342
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
I'll get the last one.

343
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,160
- Oh, sure.
- Wow, for real?

344
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,359
Yeah.

345
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,240
Now what, Pete?

346
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,319
How do we pick our spots?

347
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,520
I'm fine with anything, though.

348
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Should we do odd-one-out?

349
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,079
- Odd-one-out?
- The first one out gets this spot.

350
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,640
Sure.

351
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,599
The first one out gets this spot.

352
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,560
I think...

353
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,960
Can I get this spot?

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh, so we...

355
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,800
- Sure.
- Of course.

356
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
- Can I?
- Yeah, sure.

357
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,400
I'll be on this side, then.

358
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
I'll take the middle.

359
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,600
- Okay.
- The youngest in the middle.

360
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,080
- Sure.
- Alright, I'll protect you.

361
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,640
Oh!

362
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,240
- Whoa...
- Wow.

363
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,240
Oh...

364
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Here we go.

365
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,280
I'll claim this side.

366
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,760
I volunteer for the single bed.

367
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
We haven't even done anything.

368
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,240
I'll be back.

369
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,040
Where are you going?

370
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,240
I'll go see Pung real quick.

371
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,520
Oh, okay.

372
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,160
You're messing with him, huh?

373
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
What should we do, then?

374
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
You see that side?

375
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,000
We can see through the window.

376
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,480
- Whoa, I can see Fifa.
- Annyeonghaseyo.

377
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,240
Gamsahamnida.

378
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,520
We're gonna spend nights here.

379
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
It's so cozy.

380
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,440
How's the weather down there?

381
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,880
It's nice.

382
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,560
How is it up there?

383
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,000
It's cold up here.

384
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,440
The sun's shining through your room.

385
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
Taking vitamin D, you know.

386
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,800
Look, we can see your rooms from here.

387
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,560
There's a room up there.

388
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,440
Whoa...

389
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
Hey...

390
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
- Hey!
- Hey!

391
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
That's my Sad Chicken.

392
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,320
- What are you doing?
- This room's huge.

393
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,320
Wow, it's so bright in here!

394
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Why are you here?

395
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,920
- I'm here to make trouble.
- You're spying on us?

396
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,740
I'm making some trouble.

397
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,640
- Which one is Otto's bed?
- There's even a tub.

398
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
This one.

399
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Oh, okay.

400
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,800
- And...
- Pete and Pung.

401
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,720
Pung's claimed a single bed.

402
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,120
What?

403
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,320
How about you share a room with us?

404
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
- Can I?
- Yeah.

405
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,560
It's time, North.

406
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,160
What? Where are you going?

407
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,880
I really want to get to know everyone better,

408
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,320
but there's one issue.

409
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,720
I have to attend university.

410
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,800
So I told them

411
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,040
I'll be back

412
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,240
- as soon as I'm done.
- 3, 2, 1...

413
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
Thanks, guys.

414
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Bye-bye.

415
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
It's...

416
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
It's getting dark soon.

417
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,880
Do you prefer staying at home

418
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,880
or going to sleepovers?

419
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,480
Staying at home is more convenient,

420
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,000
but this is more fun.

421
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,800
- It is fun.
- It's...

422
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,320
It's a trade-off.

423
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,280
A trade-off, you say?

424
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,600
It's fine to have
a sleepover once in a while.

425
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,080
Mm.

426
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,760
With this,
we'll be staying together for days.

427
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,280
This occasion is pretty rare to come by.

428
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,080
It's true.

429
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,520
You think they're here?

430
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,400
Oh, they are.

431
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, electric hot pots.

432
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,640
- Wow!
- Wow!!

433
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,640
There's pork.

434
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,840
Guys!

435
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,440
Today's dinner is shabu-shabu.

436
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,600
- Huh?
- Shabu-shabu?

437
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,600
Shabu-shabu?!

438
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,560
Let's go!

439
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,640
What? You're gone already?

440
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's prepare the vegetables.

441
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,260
Show me.

442
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,120
What kind of broth are we working with?

443
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
- Are these mushrooms?
- They're not!

444
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,400
Wait, they are shimeji mushrooms.

445
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
- Are these expired?
- They're not.

446
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,440
Let's organize everything.

447
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,400
When you do something difficult...

448
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,280
Hey.

449
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,520
Why are you separating them?

450
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
These are for raw pork.

451
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,320
- You need to slice it?
- Fifa, you got everything?

452
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,160
It'll be easier to eat.
The whole piece is...

453
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,960
But...

454
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,040
It's just like how the rich do it,
having several plates.

455
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,260
- Are we going to break sweats alone or as one?
- I've washed my hands.

456
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Where's the soap?

457
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,280
Let's have a seat.

458
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,160
Should we put the carrots away?

459
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
2, 4, 6, 8. Wait...

460
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
This looks so good.

461
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,640
Okay, guys.

462
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
It's our first meal together.

463
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,400
How about a toast?

464
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,860
- Then, we'll let Pete,
- Here.

465
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,240
our maknae, say something.

466
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,720
Oh, okay.

467
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

468
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Well...

469
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,820
I wish all of us

470
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,440
the best of luck with the missions
we'll have to go through.

471
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,720
This includes you, Pung.

472
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,960
I hope we stay united and have a great time.

473
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,680
- Let's do our best.
- Enjoy, guys.

474
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Let's enjoy.

475
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,600
Pour it in.

476
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
- Whoa!
- Spread it out.

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,880
Looks promising.

478
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,200
Looking great.

479
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
The shabu-shabu?

480
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Looking good.

481
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,560
Beat the eggs.

482
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Hey, yours has...

483
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
- Do you want eggs?
- Eggs?

484
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,640
- No, thanks.
- They're over there.

485
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,240
I asked you.

486
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,790
- I'll serve it in a bowl for you.
- I'm going to enjoy the food now.

487
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,560
Is it going to be tasty, then?

488
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,760
It is!

489
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,160
- Copper, are you also studying in Thailand?
- You're not going to talk to us,

490
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,520
- I'm currently studying in England.
- like asking what we like and dislike?

491
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,440
- Oh...
- Alright!

492
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,800
- I'm graduating next year, though.
- So we get to know each other.

493
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,040
- What year are you in?
- What about colors?

494
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
- I'm in my fourth year.
- What's your favorite color?

495
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
It's black, for sure.

496
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,040
It's all ready.

497
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,000
No problem.

498
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,320
- It's overcooked.
- It's cooked.

499
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,520
- Oh?
- Oh, this is...

500
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,920
There's still room.

501
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,040
- It's hot, you know?
- Like dark blue.

502
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,400
Oh, is this your bowl?

503
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
What's this room?

504
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,320
What?

505
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
What is this?

506
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,280
[Sometimes, people find it hard
to speak their minds.

507
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,080
So, we'll let you share
your feelings through letters.

508
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,880
The sender can stay anonymous.
Include the recipient's name on the front.

509
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,680
The box will be opened every night at 10 P.M.,
and the letters will be sent.]

510
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,320
Whoa.

511
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,880
North.

512
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,160
What?

513
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,960
Come and look at this.

514
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,440
I told you there's going to be
something in this room.

515
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,120
- Really?
- You didn't believe me.

516
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
Come and take a look.

517
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,480
What's that?

518
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,160
There are stickers and stuff, too.

519
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Let me read it out loud.

520
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,000
"Sometimes, people find it hard

525
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,000
I've watched the previous season.
This is where we write a letter.

526
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,400
It was also a thing back then.

527
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,240
But they had to put it under
the recipient's pillow.

528
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,520
I'll tell everyone.

529
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,360
Yeah, go and bring them here.

530
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,920
Okay, sure.

531
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,720
You're not going to write anything?

532
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
I need some time first.

533
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,400
Oh, you do?

534
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,240
Alright!

535
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,320
How's the first day been?

536
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
It's been pretty good.

537
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
Everyone here is really sweet.

538
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,800
Have you gotten close to anyone here?

539
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,520
Huh?

540
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,240
I haven't become that close
to anyone, really.

541
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,240
But getting along with everyone here
is more than enough.

542
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,200
What about you?

543
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm actually close to everybody here, but...

544
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,000
Phupha, do you...

545
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,760
- Feel...
- Do I have someone in mind?

546
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,920
Yeah, do you feel it?

547
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,440
I kind of do.

548
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,640
I've got my eye on certain people.

549
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,000
- But...
- Really?

550
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,760
I haven't made up my mind.

551
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,680
I haven't decided just yet.

552
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,680
I do have someone in particular

553
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,520
in mind and stuff,

554
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
but I'll keep it a secret for now.

555
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,680
No hints?

556
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
No hints.

557
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,720
What about you?
Do you have anyone in mind?

558
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,920
I think I do,

559
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,760
but I'm still not certain.

560
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Right, I see.

561
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
I feel you.

562
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Who knows?

563
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,640
It could be anyone.

564
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,920
If we enjoy everyone's company,
we can pair up with anyone.

565
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
If we click with someone,

566
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,720
or they click with us...

567
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,720
It's been alright.

568
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,000
You've been talking a lot more now.

569
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Come on.

570
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm not that sociable, you know?

571
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't usually talk to anyone.

572
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,520
Maybe it's that I'm always sleepy.

573
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,480
You know?

574
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,720
You're the sociable one.

575
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,520
You engage with everyone here.

576
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,360
I don't.

577
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Oh?

578
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,360
- How are you doing?
- How's it going?

579
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,320
How's the first day been?

580
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Well...

581
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,880
It's been alright, but...

582
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
I haven't talked to anyone that much.

583
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm feeling a bit exhausted today.

584
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,720
Who you're writing to...

585
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,920
Do you think
you might change your mind later?

586
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,560
It's a possibility.

587
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
I think...

588
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,480
This is our first impression, you know?

589
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,120
- Yeah.
- I think...

590
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,200
If we get to talk to each other more,

591
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,520
- I think there's a chance that...
- Our feelings might change.

592
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,040
A lot of the pairs
who wrote letters on the first day...

593
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
Really?

594
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,360
No...

595
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,360
They chose their partners
basically after writing the letter.

596
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,920
For us, we have no clue.

597
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,360
- Anything can happen, right?
- Yes, anything.

598
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, let's give it a shot.

599
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
- Give it a go first.
- Our opinions might change later.

600
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,400
Or they might not.

601
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,040
Yes, it could be someone around here.

602
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,200
Gosh, that's too soon, no?

603
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
- Who knows? It could be.
- Take your time first.

604
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,200
Let's do the dishes.

605
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Were you nervous coming to this house?

606
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,000
I was. It was like...

607
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,640
This is my first time
being on this type of show.

608
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,800
I didn't know how to act at first.

609
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,040
What about you? Were you nervous?

610
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,640
For me, this is my first time
getting to do something like this,

611
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,160
so I was kind of nervous.

612
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Fortunately, I've got to meet you guys.

613
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,400
We're lucky that we've got each other,

614
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
- Yeah.
- the Gen 5.

615
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,440
Best of luck with the missions.

616
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,720
- Likewise.
- We've got this.

617
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,800
We'll get through them together.

618
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,760
Yeah.

619
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,480
And...

620
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,280
Your dancing and singing...

621
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,520
Do you still want to keep doing it?

622
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,960
Honestly, I do.

623
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
However...

624
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,280
With the opportunity offered by DOMUNDI,

625
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,480
I want to seize it.

626
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,840
I want to gain experience.

627
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,080
No, personally...

628
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,240
I've trained in singing
and dancing for 3 years.

629
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,160
What's left is acting, which I've never done.

630
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,920
That's why I want to branch out,

631
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,600
as singing and dancing skills
are mandatory

632
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,880
for going to events or performing.

633
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,080
That's why I decided to pursue this path.

634
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,880
I'll get to utilize all of these.
They won't go to waste.

635
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,720
So you're going to be
one of the top dogs this season?

636
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,000
What? No, no, no.

637
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,840
- I'm not like that.
- You're going to be up there. I'm sure.

638
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
No, no, no.

639
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,640
About the letter...

640
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,020
How do you feel about it?

641
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,120
Wait...

642
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
It's a secret.

643
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,080
- What?
- We'll find out soon.

644
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
No hints at all?

645
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
- No, or else...
- It's that secretive?

646
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,720
You'll find out.

647
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,640
- Okay, okay.
- Or else it won't be surprising.

648
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah.

649
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
Do you have someone in mind, Fifa?

650
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,160
I do.

651
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Wow...

652
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,960
I'll look forward to that.

653
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah, you'll have to find out.

654
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
Phupha, what are you doing?

655
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,960
Huh?

656
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm arranging the board
so that it looks like a face.

657
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,360
Why?

658
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
It's nothing. I...

659
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,280
- I just want to chat and hang out.
- You want to get to know me?

660
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,160
How was your first day

661
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,600
- with
- Well...

662
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
everyone here?

663
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,680
It was nerve-wracking, really.

664
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,600
At first, I was worried
I wouldn't know what to do

665
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,320
since I'd never been
on a reality show before.

666
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,600
Are you nervous?

667
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,160
Not anymore.

668
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,560
- Not anymore?
- Yeah, yeah.

669
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,920
After getting to know you and others more,

670
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,200
it no longer feels as nerve-wracking.

671
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,800
At first, you were like...

672
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,920
- Yeah, I didn't know what to do.
- You didn't know how to act.

673
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,080
- Yeah.
- It was the same for me.

674
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm actually a fairly quiet person.

675
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm always up for a talk if I'm engaged.

676
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I can just keep going.

677
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
I actually wanted to talk to you.

678
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
But you came up to me first.

679
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,680
- Really?
- Yeah.

680
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,360
Now, we have a chance to talk to each other,

681
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,720
enjoying the vibe.

682
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,480
I've heard about the letter.

683
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,680
Do you have anyone in mind?

684
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,840
If you don't mind me asking...

685
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
You've got one?

686
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,360
No, I don't, actually.

687
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,240
I'm...

688
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
I'm hesitating.

689
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,040
Well, not really.

690
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,160
I think, like...

691
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,360
Some look interesting, you know?

692
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,160
I have a few people in mind.

693
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,560
I see.

694
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,920
Right now, I just want to get to know people.

695
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
I don't want to make a decision

696
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
and go for someone in particular.

697
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,080
I just want to try talking to them and see...

698
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,560
If someone makes me feel comfortable,
that's already enough.

699
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,840
I'll be comfortable working with him.

700
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,440
- Mm.
- Yeah.

701
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,440
Anything else aside from comfort at work?

702
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,120
What type of person do you like?

703
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,640
Do you have that in mind?

704
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,680
Well...

705
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,920
I think it's...

706
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,370
It's someone who takes care of me,

707
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,600
looking after me.

708
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,920
An attentive person, you know?

709
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
- I see.
- Yeah, yeah.

710
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,640
I get it.

711
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,080
Phupha, did you get any?

712
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,880
Yes, I got one.

713
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,600
I entered my bedroom and found it.

714
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,840
It said...

715
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,120
"I'm glad I got to know you," and stuff.

716
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,240
The handwriting was immaculate,
so I was like,

717
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,240
"Who could write
with such amazing handwriting?"

718
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,500
Then I thought,

719
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,000
it must be Porsche, Otto,

720
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,160
or...

721
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
It could be Fifa.

722
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,880
I don't know. I've got no clue, really.

723
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,520
It's impossible to guess.

724
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,800
He also wrote,
"I hope you get to smile a lot while you're here."

725
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
I talked to Phupha,

726
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
and I think he's an interesting guy.

727
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,600
He has a playful, baddie vibe.

728
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,440
Despite that, he's kind of serious.

729
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,720
After chatting with him in the living room,

730
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,960
I decided to write him a letter.

731
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,920
How many did you get?
Did you get any, North?

732
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,000
I got none.

733
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,800
- You got none?
- Yeah.

734
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,440
I actually got a letter.

735
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,280
But...

736
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,560
I told Fifa and Phupha
that I didn't get any.

737
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360
The letter I got said...

738
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
What is it again?

739
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,200
"The squid was amazing."

740
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,120
Yeah.

741
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,400
I can't tell who the sender is.

742
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Still...

743
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,120
I hope it's that person.

744
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,830
While I was washing the vegetables,

745
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,460
North was working really hard on the squid.

746
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,200
He was doing it all by himself,

747
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,880
and I liked that.

748
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,880
That's why I wrote,
"The squid was amazing."

749
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,160
He may or may not know who it was from,

750
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,920
as everybody had the squid.

751
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,800
Still...

752
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,000
If he really thinks about it,

753
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,640
I was there
when he was preparing the squid.

754
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,720
So he might know that I wrote it to him.

755
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,760
What about you, Fifa?

756
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,920
I got none.

757
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Seriously?

758
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,800
- You're lying.
- No, I got the letters.

759
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,120
- 2 of them.
- You got 2 letters?

760
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Whoa, how about that?

761
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,800
The first one that I read

762
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,200
left me clueless about who the sender was.

763
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,600
It wasn't until the last line

764
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,960
that I realized who it was from.

765
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,680
He wrote,
"You played checkers really well today."

766
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
There was only one person
who I played checkers with.

767
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,630
Fifa said,

768
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,400
"I never lose checkers to anyone.
I'm a pro at it."

769
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,920
I was like, "Sure!"

770
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,800
He was sitting by the checkerboard,

771
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
so I asked him for a match.

772
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,960
I didn't know what to write,
as I'm bad at writing letters.

773
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,960
That's why I wrote,

774
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,920
"I don't know what to write,
but I want to send you a letter.

775
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,120
Can you guess who this is from?"

776
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Then I drew an emoji in the letter.

777
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,240
Wait! I also drew a cat on the envelope.

778
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
It's a cute cat.

779
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,570
When I think of Fifa, I think of a cat.

780
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,760
My second letter...

781
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,240
I can't tell who this is from.

782
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,630
He wrote,

783
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,400
"I actually don't know what to write.

784
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,280
I was wondering
if you'd be able to fit in with others,

785
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,680
but I think you're enjoying the vibes here.

786
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,960
Maybe? I don't know.

787
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,360
I hope you have a happy time staying here,

788
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,440
even though it can get exhausting at times.

789
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,360
I have no idea what to write, really.

790
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,159
But it feels like
I've made a new friend today.

791
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,520
You're really friendly.

792
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
It's nice to meet you, my friend."

793
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,199
Yeah.

794
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,040
So much for not knowing what to write.

795
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,440
He wrote so much stuff.

796
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,639
If I have to guess, I think it's from Pete.

797
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,480
At first, I was going to write
a prank letter to North.

798
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,280
However...

799
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,000
After thinking about it for some time,

800
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,679
I think I've teased him enough.

801
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,040
So I wrote a letter to Fifa instead,

802
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,840
since he's the only person here
who's the same age as me.

803
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,440
"It's nice to meet you.

804
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,400
It's a pleasure working with you.

805
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,400
It can get exhausting at times,

806
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,270
but let's do this together."

807
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,239
It'd probably take him
forever to read it all.

808
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Hello.

809
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,320
- How's it going?
- How are things?

810
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,670
Take a guess.

811
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,600
Any letters?

812
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
I got one.

813
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,400
See? I told you.

814
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,840
I thought I wouldn't get any.

815
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,600
I thought I wouldn't get any letters

816
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,800
since some of the members
already know each other.

817
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,880
But it's my first day
meeting everyone, so...

818
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,560
I thought they'd send letters
to each other, but not to me.

819
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,560
But when I felt that
there was a letter in the box,

820
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,920
I was surprised to see that someone
had actually sent me one.

821
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,120
The letter read...

822
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,200
"You've got this, maknae," or something.

823
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,680
Who do you think wrote this?

824
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,080
- Can you figure it out?
- If I have to guess,

825
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,000
I think it's Porsche.

826
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,480
- Right.
- Mm.

827
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,720
That's my guess.

828
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,080
At first, I was hesitant
about whether I should write one,

829
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,280
but in the end, I did it.

830
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,840
I simply wrote,
"You've got this, maknae.

831
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,040
I'm rooting for you."

832
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,360
He's the youngest here, and I adore him.

833
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,200
I want him to succeed.

834
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,200
That's why I wrote him
those supportive words.

835
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,480
You got 3 letters, right?

836
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,520
- Alright.
- I didn't think I'd get this many.

837
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,360
I thought I'd get one

838
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,480
or 2 letters at most, but...

839
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Getting 3 letters is...

840
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,000
You're a popular boy here, so you got 3.

841
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Maybe it was from the younger members here.

842
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,160
I was very surprised,

843
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,320
as I didn't expect to get 3 letters.

844
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,600
I thought I'd only get 1 or 2 letters.

845
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,520
The moment I saw 3 of them,

846
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,960
I was shocked

847
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,520
and wondered who the senders were.

848
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,200
This letter mentions that I'm older,

849
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,440
so it's probably from a younger member.

850
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,000
I wasn't going to write a letter at first,

851
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,960
but as I thought about it,

852
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,760
there were 2 people I wanted to write to.

853
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
At first, those were Porsche and Copper,

854
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,040
as they talked to me a lot.

855
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,040
I also got to play games with them.

856
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,370
However, as I kept contemplating,

857
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,040
I decided to write Otto a letter

858
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,280
because he's my roommate.

859
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,880
Since I arrived here,
he was the first person

860
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
who talked to me,
since we were also sitting close to each other.

861
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,040
Also, I felt comfortable talking to him.

862
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,640
That's why I chose to write him a letter.

863
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,280
"I'd like to write you this letter

864
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,840
because you were one of the first people
I got to talk to here,

865
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,960
and you made me feel happy
and comfortable talking to you.

866
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,240
That's why I wanted
to write you this letter.

867
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,200
Thank you so much, Otto."

868
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,720
I think the sender is Pete,

869
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,800
as he's sharing the bedroom with me,

870
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,390
and I think I was one
of the first people to talk to him.

871
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,120
The second letter...

872
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
It's got an English caption.

873
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,120
"You don't have to be perfect to be loved."

874
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,040
Here.

875
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,880
It means,
"I don't have to be the best to be loved."

876
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,000
There are hearts in the letters, too.

877
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,840
This one?

878
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,440
Well, I'm actually not sure,

879
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,360
but I think this one came from North.

880
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,760
Uh...

881
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,040
I wrote one to Otto.

882
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,760
Seeing him here, I feel like...

883
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,840
I've been noticing that

884
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,680
he looks anxious and nervous,

885
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,640
and I want him to feel more comfortable

886
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,920
and feel more able to be himself.

887
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,680
"You're sweet, friendly,

888
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,160
and approachable.

889
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,560
If possible, I'd like to talk to you more."

890
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,320
I think...

891
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,960
This one's from Phupha.

892
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,280
We had a great time talking,

893
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,960
so I think he's interested in me.

894
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,120
Either that,
or he wants to talk to me more.

895
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,320
I wrote a letter to Otto,

896
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,760
saying, "You're sweet and friendly,

897
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,640
and I want to get to know you more."

898
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,040
He's lovely, and...

899
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,160
I enjoy talking to him.

900
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,840
He's cheerful and friendly.

901
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,320
That's what impresses me about him,

902
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,600
as conversations with him
are always full of life.

903
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Hello!

904
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,560
- Hey!
- How's it going?

905
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,760
Hello there.

906
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,600
- How are you doing?
- Take a guess?

907
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,280
You're walking in looking so happy...

908
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,160
If you got one, get out.

909
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,680
- My pocket feels so heavy.
- You did get one?

910
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,840
- Wait, wait...
- They want...

911
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,840
Whoa!

912
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
- Can I take a look?
- Seriously?

913
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,320
- Let's read it.
- Who is it from?

914
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,840
- Who's the sender?
- This one was just a prank.

915
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,320
- Gosh.
- It's a blank piece of paper.

916
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,680
Go back the way you came.

917
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,760
I kind of expected that I'd get

918
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,080
at least one.

919
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,400
But I got none.

920
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
It's...

921
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,440
Do I feel bad?
I feel a bit disheartened, of course.

922
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
I can't deny it.

923
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
However, this is how I see it.

924
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,200
Maybe, right now,

925
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,240
this isn't the right time
for me to get one.

926
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,520
I don't know what to do,

927
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,040
but I think I have to try
to express myself more clearly.

928
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,960
We're equal.

929
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
- It was the same for me.
- None of us got one.

930
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,280
I did the same thing when I walked in.

931
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,600
You walked in the same way?

932
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Yeah, my pocket was empty.

933
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
I'm heartbroken.

934
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,240
None of us got a letter.

935
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
How many are there?

936
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,120
None.

937
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
At first...

938
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,840
We were told
some wouldn't get any,

939
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
but I didn't think I'd be one of them.

940
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
It feels empty now.

941
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,840
It's okay.

942
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,710
- It's your destiny.
- But I think I saw this coming

943
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,320
that some would get none.

944
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,280
Yeah, but I didn't expect it
to be all of us.

945
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,240
- Maybe this is our destiny.
- I have to...

946
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,000
- Destiny?
- How do you feel?

947
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,000
I thought we'd get at least a letter or two.

948
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,840
However...

949
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
Gosh.

950
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,880
When we chatted in the living room,

951
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,640
I thought he'd pick me,

952
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,280
but he picked
the other brothers here instead.

953
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,920
I wish someone would send one to Porsche.

954
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,920
I feel like...

955
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,560
He's been friendly to everyone here
the moment we arrived here.

956
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,480
He loved talking

957
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,080
and playing with everyone.

958
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,720
Yeah.

959
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,000
He seems like he's just being himself.

960
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,520
So I wish someone would've picked him.

961
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,120
I thought someone
would definitely pick him.

962
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,210
Well, I thought all of us
would get picked, but...

963
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
Who did you write the letter to?

964
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,800
Be honest.

965
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,910
- I can't. I...
- Right.

966
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,600
I'll forget that person
for not writing me a letter.

967
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,360
- Whoa!
- Sheesh.

968
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Whoa!

969
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,320
It's okay. Let's do a group hug.

970
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
So sad.

971
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
We're the sad boys, right?

972
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,680
It's not bad, but...

973
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,320
At least I've got someone
cheering me up and being supportive.

974
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
I feel better now.

975
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,320
- Send that person a blank letter.
- Is he sleeping?

976
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,280
You should write,

977
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,280
"Aww," and make it big.

978
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,760
What's funny is that...

979
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,160
Wave also wrote his letter to Fifa.

980
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,240
- So my rival is someone close to me?
- No!

981
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,240
Are we rivals?

982
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,400
We're not.

983
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,360
We're literally sharing the same bed.

984
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,760
We always talk to each other.

985
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,080
Who would have thought?

986
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,560
But neither of us got any.

987
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,120
Now, we'll be hugging pillows to sleep.

988
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,800
- There.
- Their bedrooms are opposite ours.

989
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,560
One day, we'll get letters, too!

990
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,680
Sadhu.

991
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,760
Just you wait!

992
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,320
I sent you the letter,
but you didn't send me one.

993
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I'll remember this.

994
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
- Let's sleep.
- I'm scared of ghosts.

995
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,760
Turn the lights off!

996
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
You're such a baby.

997
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,720
Good morning, artists.

998
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,360
Please prepare yourselves to depart

999
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,080
for the location of the first mission.

1000
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,040
- Wake up.
- Whoa...

1001
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,200
Come on, go take a shower.

1002
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,920
Hurry.

1003
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
There's a mission.

1004
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,480
Your mission now is to take a shower.

1005
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,920
Go take a shower. I'll wait here.

1006
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,600
Please close the curtains.

1007
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,880
Wake up.

1008
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,240
The people in the other room are greeting us.

1009
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,020
Did you sleep well?

1010
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,000
Yes.

1011
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,400
Wanna sleep in?

1012
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,000
If we all sleep in,
no one will be at the set.

1013
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,120
You're right. Let's sleep.

1014
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,800
- Come on.
- Should we go swimming?

1015
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,920
- No.
- No?

1016
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,080
Pung's still asleep.

1017
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,520
He's not gonna shower today.

1018
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,600
He'll just change his clothes.

1019
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,080
He's an introvert.

1020
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

1021
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,320
Hi, everyone.

1022
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,060
First of all, I'd like to welcome you all

1023
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,800
to our program,

1024
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,800
DMD Friendship Season 3!

1025
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,160
Most importantly, welcome you all

1026
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,440
to DMD Gen 5!

1027
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,520
I'm really glad to be your Bro.

1028
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,120
My name's Park, and I'm from Gen 1.

1029
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,720
Hi, I'm Park,

1030
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,240
a DMD Gen 1 member.

1031
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,280
As a Bro, I'll be giving out the missions

1032
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,200
and also judging today's mission.

1033
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,360
Our first mission today is called

1034
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,960
'Photography Posing Challenge.'

1035
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,600
Basically, it's a photo shoot.

1036
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,000
For the rules of this first mission,

1037
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,480
each of you
will have 3 minutes to pose for photos

1038
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,080
on an empty set.

1039
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,240
Behind me, there will be just one set

1040
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,390
and only one chair.

1041
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,480
You can choose
whether to use the chair or not.

1042
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,200
We want you to truly express yourselves.

1043
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,060
I'm not here by myself today.

1044
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,440
I'd like to invite the judges
who will be joining us.

1045
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,320
Please welcome our first judge,

1046
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,640
Nim, Benjaporn Sapsamroum, from Praew.

1047
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,920
Hi,

1048
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,240
I'm Nim, Benjaporn Sapsamroum,

1049
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,320
a digital editor of Praew.

1050
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,520
- Hello.
- Hello, Nim.

1051
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,760
- Hi.
- Hi.

1052
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,680
As soon as a representative
from a big magazine company came in,

1053
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,000
I suddenly realized
how serious this mission is.

1054
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,680
This isn't just for fun.

1055
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,520
They actually brought in
real professionals to evaluate us.

1056
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,600
And obviously, since Nim's from Praew,

1057
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,200
the prize will be very special.

1058
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,480
The winner of this mission will be featured
on the online cover of Praew magazine.

1059
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,080
I feel like this is very serious.

1060
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,760
Being on a magazine cover means...

1061
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,080
you really have to be exceptional
to reach that level.

1062
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,000
That sure is an amazing prize.

1063
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,640
Let's meet our next judge, shall we?

1064
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,600
Please welcome Thomas, Teetut Chungmanirat.

1065
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,920
Hi,

1066
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,160
I'm Thomas, Teetut Chungmanirat,

1067
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,480
a DOMUNDI Gen 3 member.

1068
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,020
I was a bit surprised

1069
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,200
'cause I didn't expect to see him
as one of the judges.

1070
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,880
His presence was striking right away.

1071
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,120
He's stunning!

1072
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,240
Another prize for the winner is that

1073
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,640
you'll get to choose one friend
to spend Friendship Time together

1074
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,400
over dinner tonight.

1075
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,400
And joining us as well is a special guest,
our legendary photographer,

1076
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,720
PingPong, Arnakornphubet Hengsuwan.

1077
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,480
Hello.

1078
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,960
He will be our photographer today.

1079
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,800
- Today, we're counting on you
- Okay.

1080
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,520
- to make the contestants look their best.
- Sure.

1081
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,760
Thank you so much.

1082
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,840
Are you ready for your mission, guys?

1083
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

1084
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,400
Are you ready?!

1085
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,360
- Yes.
- We are!

1086
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,600
If you're ready, let's start!

1087
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,280
Alright, guys,
before we begin our mission,

1088
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,440
I think you might still be nervous.

1089
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,000
What would you say if I showed you
the example of how it's done?

1090
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,080
- Good.
- Good.

1091
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,520
There's none other than him.

1092
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,800
Thomas,

1093
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,960
please set an example for the boys.

1094
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,240
- Whoa...
- So good looking.

1095
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,160
I think we got it.

1096
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,880
Honestly, from the very first shot,
I was like,

1097
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,400
"Whoa, he's my idol.

1098
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,880
How does he make it
look so perfect?"

1099
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,470
I think it's hard.

1100
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,280
I wanna follow his footsteps.

1101
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,000
He's got tens all over his score sheet.

1102
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,560
Thomas is even more
extraordinary than my name.

1103
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,680
Thank you, Thomas.

1104
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,320
- That's incredible.
- And this is how it should be done.

1105
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,490
Be confident in this mission.

1106
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,530
Coming up next is a very crucial moment.

1107
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,760
We'll draw a name for the first person
to do the photo shoot,

1108
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,360
and the box is right there
in Thomas' hands.

1109
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,920
I'll start with Fifa.

1110
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,240
Fifa's the ninth person up.

1111
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,400
Let's move forward to North.

1112
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,260
Please go ahead.

1113
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,200
He's up eighth.

1114
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,440
Ooh!

1115
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,440
This is for Otto.
[Third]

1116
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,200
Copper.
[Fourth]

1117
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,040
Here's to our Pung.
[First]

1118
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,160
I can see happiness in his eyes.

1119
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,440
This is for Porsche.
[Second]

1120
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,680
Wave.
[Seventh]

1121
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,000
This is for Pete.
[Sixth]

1122
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,760
The last one, Phupha,

1123
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,280
got the fifth.

1124
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,600
Now that we've got our lineup straight,

1125
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,200
the first one
that will do the photo shoot is...

1126
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,440
Let's hear it for Pung.

1127
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,580
- You got this.
- Come right out, Pung.

1128
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,320
You have 3 minutes.

1129
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,480
The timer will start
as PingPong releases the first shutter.

1130
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,440
That's where we start the countdown.

1131
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,000
If you're ready, let's get to it.

1132
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,800
- Here he comes.
- Whoa...

1133
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,320
I'm not that good at posing,

1134
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,660
but I do have my ways
of expressing inner feelings,

1135
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,680
conveying them
through my face and my eyes.

1136
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,920
His eyes speak.

1137
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,320
- That eye expression is insane.
- True.

1138
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,760
Pung said, "I can't think of anything.
I'm not an expert at this stuff,"

1139
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,610
but, man, he did it like a pro.

1140
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,840
He just went, "Snap, snap, snap."

1141
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,720
5,

1142
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,000
4,

1143
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,160
- 3,
- Getting goosebumps.

1144
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,480
- He's killing it!
- 2,

1145
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,520
- Sheesh!
- Ooh!

1146
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,320
1,

1147
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,560
time!

1148
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,720
Let's continue to Porsche.

1149
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
Ready?

1150
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,000
Ready.

1151
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,400
Come on in, Porsche.

1152
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,600
Yeah!

1153
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,400
- You can do it.
- Hello.

1154
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,880
- You got this!
- Porsche.

1155
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,720
Go get 'em!

1156
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,520
Go. That's good.

1157
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,680
Looks like he's prepared some poses.

1158
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,160
- He has.
- Yep.

1159
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,680
I've had some experience
with photo shoots,

1160
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,080
but I know I'm not all that good.

1161
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,600
With one that uses facial expression,
I'm probably not as skilled as the others.

1162
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,080
They are all experienced, you know?

1163
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,760
You're doing well, Porsche.

1164
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,320
He's down on the floor.

1165
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,160
Oh, cute.

1166
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,040
That's adorable.

1167
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,920
Look at the camera.

1168
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,580
Porsche said,
"I'm not so confident about this.

1169
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,920
I'm not that skilled," and all that,

1170
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,280
but there he was, on the floor,

1171
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,050
pulling off one of
the most perfect lying-down poses ever.

1172
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,000
5,

1173
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,560
4,

1174
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,020
3,

1175
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,440
- Good!
- 2,

1176
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
- 1,
- Whoa!

1177
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,120
time!

1178
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,520
Next up,

1179
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,360
Otto.

1180
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,880
You got this, Otto.

1181
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

1182
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,200
- Go for it!
- I'm getting goosebumps!

1183
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,280
- Wow!
- Whoa!

1184
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,520
That's pretty good.

1185
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,720
Otto's photo shoot was...

1186
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,240
just lovely, yeah.

1187
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,880
It was stunning.

1188
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,000
I love every single photo that came out.

1189
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,440
He's got that confidence.

1190
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,920
He's not camera-shy at all.

1191
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,000
Amazing.

1192
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,400
Actually, when it was the others' turns,

1193
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,200
3 minutes felt so long,

1194
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,880
but when it was mine,

1195
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,080
it went by so fast.

1196
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,480
I only struck one pose,
and a minute had already passed.

1197
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,680
I think I should've switched
the poses faster.

1198
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,920
Go, Otto.

1199
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
5,

1200
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,520
4,

1201
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,200
3,

1202
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,920
2,

1203
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,640
1,

1204
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
time!

1205
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,400
Let's move forward to our fourth,

1206
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,620
Copper.

1207
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,240
Yes.

1208
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,520
- Please go ahead.
- Copper, go for it.

1209
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,080
If you're ready, you can get started!

1210
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,280
That's so cool.

1211
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,720
Good, Copper. That's amazing.

1212
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,160
Seeing how well everyone else did,

1213
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,790
I wondered
if I could be as good as them.

1214
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,200
When I went in,
I didn't think much of anything.

1215
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,920
I just went with the flow

1216
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,840
and what I felt like,

1217
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,240
standing, switching poses, and all that.

1218
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,040
Copper got so many photos

1219
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,080
out of his photo shoot.

1220
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,200
We got equal time, but I feel like
he made every minute count.

1221
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,120
He really did.

1222
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,480
After I saw how Copper did,

1223
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,670
I was like,
"Copper might just win."

1224
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,080
Amazing!

1225
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
Slay.

1226
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Whoa, that's fantastic.

1227
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,960
Good.

1228
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,840
5,

1229
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,280
- Let's go.
- 4,

1230
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,840
3,

1231
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,360
2,

1232
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,840
1,

1233
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,800
time!

1234
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,480
- He got it.
- He got it all.

1235
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,640
Next up, Phupha.

1236
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,540
Go get it.

1237
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,560
- Let's go.
- Go get it.

1238
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,160
Please go in front of the set.

1239
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,960
Good luck.

1240
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,880
Start the timer.

1241
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,240
Whoa, that's good.

1242
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,400
I've had quite a lot of experience
with photo shoots,

1243
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,210
but I still felt pretty nervous.

1244
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,000
I always feel like
I'm not good enough whenever I do it

1245
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,080
because I want to keep improving.

1246
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,280
He's shredded.

1247
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,960
During his photo shoot,

1248
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,040
I realized how experienced he is.

1249
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:27,150
It's like he knows
how to position himself to look good.

1250
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:33,360
With his tight outfit
and muscular physique,

1251
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,640
the photos looked stunning.

1252
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,360
5,

1253
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,950
4,

1254
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,120
3,

1255
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,680
2,

1256
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,800
1,

1257
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,680
time!

1258
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,380
Way to go, Phupha.

1259
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,000
Next up, Pete.

1260
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,440
- Our maknae!
- Pete!

1261
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,760
- The youngest one in Gen 5!
- Our maknae!

1262
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,360
- Please go ahead on set, Pete.
- Let's wait for the camera to set up.

1263
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,200
Whoa!

1264
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,640
In my life,
I've barely been in photo shoots.

1265
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,400
Maybe once or twice,

1266
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,250
but I've never done one
where I had to come up with all the poses.

1267
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,640
Part of me felt anxious,

1268
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,760
but it turned out
to be a positive experience.

1269
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,420
I'm glad that I at least
had the courage to do it.

1270
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,800
Good!

1271
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,040
On our first day,
I got to chat with him.

1272
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:34,810
He told me he was so stressed out
by this whole thing

1273
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,960
since he was still very new to things.

1274
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,040
In the end, he did great,

1275
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,960
and I think he's a good one.

1276
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
5,

1277
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,760
4,

1278
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,120
3,

1279
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,680
2,

1280
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,070
1,

1281
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,160
time!

1282
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,120
Amazing job, our maknae!

1283
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,360
Next up is Wave.

1284
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,790
Wow!

1285
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,680
Bravo!

1286
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,840
Wave, you got this.

1287
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,040
Bravo!

1288
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,130
At first,

1289
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,960
I was so incredibly nervous.

1290
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,280
From the moment I sat there,

1291
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,600
I could feel myself shaking
as my turn was approaching.

1292
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,560
I even teased the other guys
so much before that.

1293
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,160
Relax.

1294
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,160
I really like Wave.

1295
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,480
He's a good one.

1296
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,160
He's the type of person
whose feelings radiate from within,

1297
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,120
almost like he has
an inner voice is guiding him.

1298
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,200
It feels so natural
whenever he does this.

1299
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,990
I love it.

1300
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,150
- You got this.
- Go, Wave.

1301
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,280
5,

1302
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,760
4,

1303
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
- This one's fabulous!
- 3,

1304
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,880
2,

1305
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,240
1...

1306
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,040
Time's up!

1307
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,440
That was fantastic, Wave.

1308
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,790
- Alright, let's move on to our eighth,
- Good job.

1309
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,400
- North.
- Here he comes.

1310
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,560
Go, go, go.

1311
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,640
You can take off your shirt.

1312
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,160
You can do that, North.

1313
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,120
Personally,
I don't think I'm that good at it

1314
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,600
because I don't know how to pose

1315
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,360
or how to position my hands,

1316
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,680
no.

1317
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,160
- He has such sharp features.
- True.

1318
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,560
There you go.

1319
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,160
A little more.

1320
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,120
I felt like teasing him

1321
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,840
since he did that to me a ton
during my turn.

1322
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:52,230
As his turn was approaching,
he just went quiet,

1323
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,760
so I don't think we're much different.

1324
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,060
He was shaking.

1325
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,000
Man, you're pretty cool yourself.

1326
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,040
His headshot is looking good.

1327
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,520
5,

1328
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,000
4...

1329
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,760
There.

1330
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,640
3,

1331
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,960
- 2,
- Give us another flick.

1332
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,800
1...

1333
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:11,820
He's showing his moves.

1334
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,040
Time's up!

1335
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,800
Let's now move forward to the last one.

1336
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,600
- Fifa, please come up front.
- Fifa!

1337
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,760
Wow!

1338
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,040
Let's bring it on!

1339
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,200
If you're ready,

1340
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,660
go ahead.

1341
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,140
Great rhythm.

1342
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,200
It's a double-edged sword

1343
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,280
because the wait for my turn was long,

1344
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:45,190
and being the last one
added even more pressure.

1345
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:51,080
The good thing, though,
is I got to learn from the people before me.

1346
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,720
Whoa, that's amazing!

1347
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,840
Personally,
I liked how Fifa did it the most.

1348
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,840
It looked effortless.

1349
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,400
Whatever he did looked good.

1350
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,100
It felt classy in itself,

1351
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,440
looking snatched in every move.

1352
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,720
5,

1353
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,200
- Okay.
- 4...

1354
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,080
There.

1355
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,850
3,

1356
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,360
2,

1357
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,080
- 1...
- That's good.

1358
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,000
- Time!
- Yay!

1359
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:31,770
Right now, we've completed

1360
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,480
our solo photo shoot mission, right?

1361
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:38,070
I have to say,
the judges are having a hard time deciding

1362
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,080
since everyone did so well.

1363
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,280
But...

1364
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,570
this is not the end of it, guys.

1365
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,280
We have a buddy photo shoot
coming right up.

1366
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,080
Wow!

1367
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,040
Do we go in pairs?

1368
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,200
Please welcome,
Buddy Ryujin and Buddy PatJi!

1369
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,920
Whoa!

1370
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,320
Whoa!

1371
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,200
Alright,

1372
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,690
our next mission is a buddy photo shoot.

1373
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
Each pair gets 3 minutes.

1374
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,560
In this mission,

1375
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,800
I'll find the best photo
from Team Ryujin

1376
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,340
and the best one from Team PatJi.

1377
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,630
But what will the winners get?

1378
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,720
I'll have to keep it a secret for now.

1379
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,520
Okay?

1380
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,280
These two guys have taken a peek
during your photo shoots

1381
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,800
and have already picked
who would become their buddies.

1382
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,640
Let's hear it from them.

1383
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,560
Starting with me,

1384
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,910
many of you caught my attention.

1385
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,400
Wave was the first one,

1386
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,280
along with Pung,

1387
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,720
North, and Otto.

1388
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,920
I'll choose...

1389
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,800
Phupha, Pete,

1390
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,600
Copper,

1391
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,320
Fifa, and Porsche.

1392
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,400
Yay!

1393
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:58,310
So PatJi has chosen North,
Pung, Otto, and Wave,

1394
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:03,650
while Ryujin has chosen Phupha, Pete,
Copper, Fifa, and Porsche.

1395
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,040
Which team goes first?

1396
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,120
Your team.

1397
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,640
I can go first.

1398
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:13,310
Alright, so PatJi's first buddy is

1399
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,320
North.

1400
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,680
I'll give you a moment to get ready

1401
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,240
for the photo shoot.

1402
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,800
If you're ready,

1403
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
you may start now.

1404
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,440
North, can you move to the left

1405
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
so that your body shows more?

1406
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,770
I've never shot in pairs before.

1407
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,410
When you're alone,

1408
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,580
you don't have to worry about

1409
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,720
whether you're overshadowing
the other person

1410
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,640
or getting in each other's way.

1411
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,160
When it's two people,

1412
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,040
- the vibe has to match.
- 2 minutes left.

1413
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,720
- It needs to go together.
- They need to match up.

1414
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,240
Yeah.

1415
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,160
Personally, I wasn't that worried

1416
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,000
'cause we already knew each other.

1417
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,280
It wasn't extremely stressful,

1418
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,680
- but it was still stressful.
- That's good.

1419
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,440
When you're shooting as a pair,

1420
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:14,350
you naturally think differently.

1421
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,260
- Okay.
- That's nice.

1422
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,000
5,

1423
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,560
4,

1424
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,200
3,

1425
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:24,520
- 2...
- That's awesome.

1426
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,320
They're getting there.

1427
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,520
1...

1428
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,400
Time's up.

1429
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
Next up, Pung, please.

1430
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,440
Good luck, buddy.

1431
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,040
What would it be like
if 2 introverts had to shoot together?

1432
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,200
I'll help everyone.

1433
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,560
If you're ready,

1434
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,840
you may start now.

1435
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,840
- Wow, that's good.
- It's 'cause they talked

1436
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,360
about the poses.

1437
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,560
- That looks good.
- Whoa.

1438
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:07,530
I wasn't super tense

1439
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,260
'cause we see each other pretty often,

1440
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,680
either through work or over time.

1441
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,720
So it was like...

1442
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,600
We always talked about the poses,

1443
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,250
like, "Should we do this pose?"

1444
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,990
We'd plan it together.

1445
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,120
Pung and I are actually a bit similar
in personality.

1446
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,320
But not exactly.

1447
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:33,350
When we were together,
I suddenly went blank

1448
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,600
and couldn't communicate clearly,

1449
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,120
so there were a few awkward moments.

1450
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,560
30 seconds left.

1451
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,840
- They're looking into the camera.
- Great, both of you.

1452
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,080
5,

1453
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:52,720
4,

1454
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,560
3,

1455
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,160
2,

1456
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,720
1.

1457
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,160
Time's up.

1458
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,000
Otto, please.

1459
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,640
It's like he planned this.

1460
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,020
- Like, he knows how to pose.
- Yeah.

1461
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,080
- He knows his poses.
- Right.

1462
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,800
If you're ready,

1463
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,920
start the clock.

1464
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,170
- He's really planned this.
- He knows.

1465
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,600
- He's done some research.
- He knows.

1466
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,640
That's great.

1467
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,640
Okay, good.

1468
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,400
He knows so many poses.

1469
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,520
That's cute, sitting together.

1470
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,600
That's great.

1471
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,200
I was really impressed.

1472
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:38,750
Otto handled the composition really well
and had all the poses in his head.

1473
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,740
He has an amazing sense of composition.

1474
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,750
I was very nervous

1475
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,400
since I tend to get a little tense
around new people,

1476
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,600
so I tried to hype myself up
and tell myself

1477
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,040
to try my best and finish this.

1478
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,600
Otto really knows
how to position his body.

1479
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,280
30 seconds left.

1480
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,840
- Back to back?
- That's good.

1481
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,440
Our team is amazing.

1482
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,320
There you go.

1483
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,120
5...

1484
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,080
Come on.

1485
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:11,840
4...

1486
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,480
3...

1487
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,240
- 2...
- Good.

1488
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,040
1...

1489
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,600
Time's up!

1490
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,320
And the last one, Wave.

1491
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,160
If you're ready,

1492
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,080
you may start now.

1493
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,680
- Wow, that's good.
- Good.

1494
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,330
- They look similar.
- I know, right?

1495
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,640
We've known each other since high school,

1496
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:47,830
so it wasn't that awkward between us.

1497
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,720
If it were someone I didn't know,

1498
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,600
I would be super worried

1499
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,840
that I might ruin the photos.

1500
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,080
I felt comfortable around him.

1501
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,120
Like, I wanna play with him.

1502
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,080
Whoa...

1503
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,760
They look playful.

1504
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
Smile!

1505
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,440
There was chemistry...

1506
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And...

1507
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,840
Like, they were in sync,

1508
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,000
so the photos turned out amazing.

1509
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,160
Wave, look into the camera.

1510
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,920
- Wave's expression is good.
- That's right.

1511
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,720
- Whoa...
- Good.

1512
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,040
5,

1513
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,640
4,

1514
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,160
- That's cute.
- 3,

1515
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,040
2,

1516
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,840
1.

1517
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,680
Time's up.

1518
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,160
Ryujin, please stand by.

1519
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,520
Alright!

1520
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:56,510
Oh, careful.

1521
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,240
- Alright!
- Alright.

1522
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,080
The first person
to take photos with Ryujin is

1523
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,640
Phupha.

1524
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,520
- Yay!
- Let's go, Phupha.

1525
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,560
You've got this.

1526
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,600
Wait and see, Pung.

1527
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:11,840
Give it your all, Phupha.

1528
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,680
If you're ready,

1529
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,080
the timer starts now.

1530
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,840
Whoa!

1531
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,640
The camera's on fire at this rate.

1532
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,000
I tried to stay as relaxed as I could.

1533
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,320
It helped me stay calmer

1534
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,440
and less stressed.

1535
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,860
Pung, what do you want to have?

1536
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,920
- He seems to know the right distance.
- He does.

1537
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,480
I usually don't get to shoot in pairs,

1538
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,960
so I'm not used to it.

1539
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,800
It was also our first time
seeing each other,

1540
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,120
but I gave it my best shot.

1541
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,200
Wow!

1542
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh, that's cool.

1543
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,000
30 seconds left.

1544
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,360
Yeah, go for it.

1545
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,920
Yeah!

1546
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:15,250
5...

1547
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,080
4...

1548
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,680
3...

1549
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,359
2...

1550
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,040
1...

1551
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:26,560
Time's up.

1552
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,720
Here comes the second member
of Ryujin's team.

1553
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,319
Pete, please come onto the set.

1554
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,640
If you're ready,

1555
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,080
you may start now.

1556
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,920
There it is.

1557
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,240
He's got really long legs.

1558
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,840
Pete, can you turn your head a little?

1559
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Just angle it slightly.

1560
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:54,560
Turn your face a bit, Pete.

1561
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,960
But make sure your eyes
stay on the camera.

1562
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:58,240
For me, it's better than doing a solo shoot.

1563
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:00,880
At least this lets me
brainstorm with my partner,

1564
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,200
so we know what to do next

1565
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,859
and can work well together.

1566
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,300
Whoa, look at this.

1567
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,920
- This is great.
- It's perfect.

1568
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,399
Pete, you're on fire!

1569
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,720
You're so cool.

1570
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,200
- Slay!
- What a sweet pose.

1571
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,680
One more pose.

1572
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,880
You're amazing with this.

1573
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,200
Too much, too much.

1574
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,560
- That's alright.
- Ryujin's got it too.

1575
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,840
30 seconds left.

1576
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:31,479
- This one's cool.
- That's so fine.

1577
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,080
About Ryujin...
I also like him with Pete.

1578
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,160
I think they...

1579
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:36,830
The poses they did look new.

1580
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,479
They leaned back to back,

1581
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,680
and I liked that.

1582
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,439
- 5...
- That's great.

1583
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,560
4...

1584
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:43,960
3...

1585
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,600
- Awesome.
- 2...

1586
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,279
1...

1587
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:48,720
Time's up.

1588
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,920
The next person is Copper.

1589
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,680
I think the challenge is
coming up with poses beforehand.

1590
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,360
Yes.

1591
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,840
Because it's a shoot in pairs,

1592
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,160
you need to know your position.

1593
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,920
If you're ready...

1594
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,440
You may begin.

1595
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,230
The composition is great.
It's balanced.

1596
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,420
It sounds kind of fun.

1597
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,200
Ryujin's pretty experienced,

1598
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,840
so I think he knows the tricks
and how things work.

1599
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,880
Whoa.

1600
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,640
Oh, cool! This one's great.

1601
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,520
Excellent. It's perfect.

1602
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,720
Their poses are on point.

1603
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,720
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1604
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,480
30 seconds to go.

1605
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,240
When they did the piggyback pose,

1606
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,880
the mood got livelier.

1607
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,800
It was really lovely.

1608
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,520
- That's lovely.
- This one's sweet.

1609
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,800
They're falling over.

1610
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:03,960
5...

1611
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,520
4...

1612
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,160
3...

1613
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,760
2...

1614
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,040
1...

1615
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,400
Time's up.

1616
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,040
The next person is Fifa.

1617
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,080
Alright.

1618
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,000
What's the plan?

1619
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,840
If you're ready...

1620
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:24,210
You may begin.

1621
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:25,170
What?

1622
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,120
I think Fifa

1623
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,080
had the same energy during the shoot.

1624
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,660
Our vibes were kind of similar.

1625
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:42,050
Ryujin and I aren't that close.

1626
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,100
I still felt anxious and unconfident.

1627
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,400
However, I tried my best when I was on set.

1628
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,360
Wow!

1629
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,520
- Oh, it's kinda like a series shoot.
- This one's wonderful.

1630
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,120
- This one's lovely.
- It's like a series shoot.

1631
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:58,680
Is it giddy?

1632
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
So cute!

1633
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,400
Nice!

1634
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,080
They're like a Korean actor
and a Japanese actor.

1635
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,320
Yeah, that's the one.

1636
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,560
You can do it, Fifa.

1637
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,880
30 seconds left.

1638
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,120
Lean on each other.

1639
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,720
Good.

1640
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,440
5...

1641
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,200
4...

1642
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,280
3...

1643
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,890
2...

1644
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,720
1...

1645
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,640
That's fantastic.

1646
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,040
The last one on the team...

1647
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,080
Porsche, please stand by.

1648
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,320
He's our hope.

1649
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,240
If you're ready,

1650
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,680
you may start.

1651
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,320
- Oh!
- Wow!

1652
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,360
I admitted that serious expressions

1653
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,240
aren't what I'm good at, so I had to smile.

1654
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,430
However, I looked at Ryujin
to see if he wanted to smile,

1655
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,240
but he went with a serious look.

1656
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,040
It was a bit tough for me,

1657
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,760
but I tried keeping up with him.

1658
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,160
That's great.

1659
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,480
Since Porsche is good at
starting conversations,

1660
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,400
we've talked before.

1661
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,480
And I felt like...

1662
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,600
We felt somewhat comfortable
with each other.

1663
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,080
This made the shoot feel relaxed.

1664
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,080
Good!

1665
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,800
Oh, that's great.

1666
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,160
30 seconds remaining.

1667
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,360
5...

1668
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,040
4...

1669
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,760
3...

1670
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,600
2...

1671
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,560
Oh, he looks like Wave.

1672
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,360
1...

1673
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,680
Time's up.

1674
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,960
Alright, guys...

1675
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,680
We'll give you a short break

1676
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,800
while the judges discuss
and find the winner.

1677
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,120
In the meantime, please enjoy yourselves.

1678
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,760
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1679
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,040
Okay, the results are ready.

1680
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,440
Please let them come in.

1681
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,160
Alright.

1682
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,740
I have to say, for the first mission,

1683
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,840
the judges had a really hard time deciding.

1684
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,120
But before we get to the results,

1685
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,760
I'd like to talk about the prize again.

1686
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,440
The winner of this mission
will have their photo on the cover of Praew.

1687
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,810
If you didn't win, don't worry.

1688
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,640
Your photos will still be
featured inside the magazine.

1689
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,280
Alright, before we announce
the winner of the first mission...

1690
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,520
Thomas, can you share your thoughts
on their first mission?

1691
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,640
How did they do today?

1692
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,160
First off, you all
have a lot of potential

1693
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,200
Each of you is different.

1694
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,560
All I see is uniqueness and variety.

1695
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,660
You guys also did a great job
showing off your charisma.

1696
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,120
Give yourselves a round of applause.

1697
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,760
Nim, please.

1698
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,720
Everyone has their own strengths.

1699
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,280
Some of you are good at posing,

1700
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,240
and some know the perfect angles
for their faces.

1701
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,240
They all have different strengths.

1702
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:21,160
So it was hard to pick a winner,

1703
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:25,370
but I want to say that
all of you have a lot of potential.

1704
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,700
With just a little more training,
you'll definitely go far.

1705
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,120
Alright, it's time to announce

1706
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:41,770
the top five finalists
as decided by the three judges.

1707
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:47,210
And the announcement order
doesn't indicate your ranking.

1708
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,760
Our first finalist

1709
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,480
is...

1710
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
Otto.

1711
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,720
I'm happy my name was announced first,

1712
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,520
and I thought I might get the dinner.

1713
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,200
Our second finalist is...

1714
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,920
Fifa.

1715
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,360
I felt relieved.

1716
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,040
At least I was in the top five.

1717
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,440
I was really nervous
during the announcement.

1718
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,840
Our third finalist is...

1719
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Copper.

1720
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,470
I was like, "Really?

1721
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,320
He didn't call the wrong person, did he?”

1722
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,040
And the fourth finalist is...

1723
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,400
Wave.

1724
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,040
I was shocked.

1725
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,740
I felt shocked, and I also wanted
to be one of the finalists.

1726
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,280
I had some expectations,
but not very high,

1727
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,960
since I still see myself as a rookie.

1728
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,600
There are others
who are more experienced.

1729
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,400
And the last finalist
of this mission is...

1730
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,560
Phupha.

1731
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,320
I didn't think it would be me

1732
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,000
since I thought my performance
wasn't that great,

1733
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,480
but I did expect some others to be in there.

1734
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,420
And here are the five finalists
for the solo photoshoot.

1735
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,560
But, like I said,

1736
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,560
there can only be one winner.

1737
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,330
And the winner of the first mission is...

1738
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,360
I think Nim should take over

1739
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,800
'cause I can't handle this anymore.

1740
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,640
It's eating me up inside.

1741
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,040
It was a hard decision.

1742
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,160
- I would choose all of you if I could,
- Right.

1743
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,720
but since there can only be one winner.

1744
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,080
- Yes.
- We made a decision together.

1745
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,840
The one who will appear on
the online cover of Praew Magazine

1746
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,520
is...

1747
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,440
Congratulations,

1748
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,080
Copper.

1749
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,800
Copper!

1750
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,880
Thank you.

1751
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,000
Whoa, I really get to show my granny

1752
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,760
that I'm going to be on the magazine cover?

1753
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,040
A big thank you to Park, Thomas, and Nim

1754
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,920
for choosing me
as the winner of this mission.

1755
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:55,160
I promise I'll keep improving

1756
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:58,250
and make sure everyone can see it.

1757
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,600
He has incredible charisma and appeal,

1758
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,120
and the way he posed was very smooth.

1759
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,000
He knew which angle of his face
to show to the camera.

1760
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,480
Every photo of him looks great.

1761
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,840
Charisma and posture
needed to come into play,

1762
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,240
along with how the outfit was presented.

1763
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,200
What's apparent about him
is his charisma.

1764
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,100
His liveliness really shines through.

1765
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,840
Alright, we still have
the buddy photoshoot winners left, right?

1766
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,920
It's hard for us to make a decision, too,

1767
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,960
right, Thomas?

1768
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Sure thing, Park.

1769
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,410
- Right, Nim?
- Yes.

1770
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,360
Like I said, everyone did a great job,

1771
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:32,980
- but since you were in pairs,
- Right.

1772
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,740
we needed to see which pair
worked best together.

1773
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:38,220
Alright, for the winners
of the second mission,

1774
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,480
we'll start with Team PatJi.

1775
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,400
The person who
matched best with PatJi

1776
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,520
is...

1777
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,720
Wave.

1778
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,120
Congratulations, Wave.

1779
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:04,880
I was shocked.

1780
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,280
I mean it.

1781
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,650
I don't even know how my poses impressed them.

1782
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,840
Are they really sure about that?

1783
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:15,670
In his solo shoot,
he might've looked a little shy and playful,

1784
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,560
but when he was with PatJi,

1785
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,130
it felt like he had a friend to play with.

1786
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:23,290
He brought that cuteness
and playfulness to PatJi,

1787
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:26,330
and the photos have a really lovely vibe.

1788
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,640
It felt like they were friends.

1789
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,800
It's time to announce
the winner for Team Ryujin.

1790
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:36,320
The person who was the best match
in this buddy photoshoot

1791
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,360
is...

1792
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,480
Is...

1793
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,400
Fifa.

1794
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,480
Congratulations, Fifa!

1795
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,720
Honestly...

1796
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,640
I really didn't think I was going to win.

1797
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:03,520
After seeing the other guys' photoshoots,
I was like,

1798
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,160
"Whoa, they did an amazing job."

1799
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,120
They both looked handsome and charismatic,

1800
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,320
and their eyes gave off

1801
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,800
such positive energy.

1802
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,640
I think they looked just like brothers.

1803
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,360
They were cute and everything.

1804
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,440
Yeah.

1805
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,480
They're the two winners
of the second mission,

1806
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,360
the buddy photoshoot.

1807
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,400
And of course,

1808
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,560
there's a prize for the winners
that I haven't announced yet.

1809
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:34,670
Both winners will participate in
a group Friendship Time,

1810
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,560
which means the two of you

1811
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,400
will take the other two out
to dinner tonight.

1812
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,000
- Yay!
- Whoa...

1813
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:50,340
There's still one very important
surprise left to announce.

1814
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,840
You both

1815
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:56,360
will become contestants

1816
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:59,910
in DMD Friendship Chapter 3!

1817
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,320
- Hey!
- Whoa!

1818
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,640
Seriously?

1819
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,720
This is the biggest surprise yet.

1820
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,400
What?

1821
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:07,960
It's real.

1822
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,200
I was like, "Wait, I'm going back?"

1823
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:14,960
I was happy.

1824
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,880
I actually was

1825
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:19,490
since I really missed the atmosphere
from last year's reality show.

1826
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,880
I was late for the last one,

1827
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,240
so I felt like I spent less time
in the house than the others.

1828
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,160
Since I got in early in this one,

1829
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,800
I'll do my best.

1830
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,880
I was shocked.

1831
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:35,540
I've never thought I'd get to be back.

1832
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,160
If there's anything you're unsure of

1833
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,520
or anything I can help with,

1834
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,120
I will be right here.

1835
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,400
But as I'm also an 18-year-old,

1836
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:49,670
I'd like some help from the older guys

1837
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,120
since I'm still not that skilled.

1838
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,960
Let's see if they
know their own hearts,

1839
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,520
or if something new
will flourish from this.

1840
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,360
Meanwhile, I'll be the neighbor
peeking at these boys in secret.

1841
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,000
I think it will add more fun
to the pace of the show,

1842
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:08,270
and I believe Ryujin and PatJi
will become the factors

1843
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:11,050
that influence many of our decisions.

1844
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:15,030
Guys, we're now at the end
of today's mission,

1845
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,360
and we want to thank the judges.

1846
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,490
Thank you.

1847
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,400
- Oh, no need for that.
- No...

1848
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,560
Thank you, Nim, from Praew.

1849
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,120
It wouldn't be possible without her.

1850
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,640
As for another essential guest,

1851
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,960
thank you, Thomas,

1852
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,600
- for joining us as a judge,
- Thank you.

1853
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,240
and guiding our Gen 5 boys.

1854
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,400
Most importantly...

1855
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,800
Guys, look at every single one
of your outfits today.

1856
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,120
Gen 5,

1857
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,320
even though MERGE
didn't send in their judge,

1858
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,640
they did deliver
gorgeous clothes for you guys to match,

1859
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,910
so thank you, MERGE.

1860
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,320
Thank you.

1861
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,880
Today, I appreciate MERGE so much

1862
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,640
for sending us these stunning outfits.

1863
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,680
They really made us more confident.

1864
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,920
Of course, for the next mission,

1865
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,360
I want you guys to keep fighting

1866
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,040
and do your best.

1867
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,840
See you at the next one.

1868
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,720
Goodbye.

1869
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

1870
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,760
Who do I think Copper will go with?

1871
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,520
I have 3 people in mind:

1872
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,280
Otto,

1873
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,480
Fifa,

1874
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,800
and Phupha.

1875
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,440
You crazy? There's only one.

1876
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,720
I've known this person for...

1877
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:39,800
How do I say this?

1878
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,970
He's one of the first ones
I knew at DOMUNDI.

1879
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,920
He's pretty cute,

1880
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,320
and I think...

1881
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,780
he's such a good friend.

1882
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,560
It's so fun being around him.

1883
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,800
Our mission today is

1884
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,600
'Acoustic Singing Challenge.'

1885
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,160
Whoa!

1886
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,000
What?

1887
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,440
Singing is what I'm most insecure about.

1888
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:08,720
This is pretty right up my alley.

1889
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,920
I can kinda sing
since I've had some lessons.

1890
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,560
After receiving compliments, don't...

1891
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,040
Don't feel like you've hit
the ceiling of what you can do.

1892
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,330
What do you want to be?

1893
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,960
Believe and achieve it.

1894
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,160
Someday, your time will come.
