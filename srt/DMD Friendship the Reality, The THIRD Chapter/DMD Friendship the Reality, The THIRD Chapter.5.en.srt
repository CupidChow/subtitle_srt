1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,440
Kiss me on the head, please.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,360
What about your duty

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,360
to protect me?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,120
I want him to be my partner.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,520
I'd definitely choose you.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,520
But you hesitated, didn't you?

7
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,440
Good morning, artists.

8
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,960
Welcome to the final day
of choosing your partner.

9
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Please gather in front of the villa
within 5 minutes.

10
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
5 minutes?

11
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
Let's go wash up.

12
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
No, let's just do nothing.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,760
Argh!

14
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,480
Ouch! It's a man-eating mattress.

15
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Are you hurt?

16
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,160
What?

17
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
We have 5 minutes.

18
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,160
We need to go downstairs in 5 minutes.

19
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,880
- What?
- 5 minutes to get to the front.

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
What? I don't get it.

21
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,730
We have 5 minutes
to get to the front of the villa.

22
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Hurry up.

23
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
Oh...

24
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,240
Let's go.

25
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
What's going on?

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Oh, my gosh.

27
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
This morning, we have
a mini challenge for you all.

28
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,800
What? We have to do it right here?

29
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,080
There will be one winner

30
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,960
who gets to pick a friend
to spend Friendship Time with

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,920
and enjoy brunch together
at the cafe outside.

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh, wow.

33
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
So early in the morning.

34
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,079
The game is all about testing
how in sync you are with your friends.

35
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,120
It's called

36
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,920
Telepathy.

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,240
Here is the rule of the game.

38
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
We'll announce a pose

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,640
and count down three, two, one.

40
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,600
When the countdown ends,
everyone poses together.

41
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,159
Anyone whose pose
does not match the majority

42
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,720
will be eliminated for that round
and asked to sit down.

43
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,030
You may do this

44
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,310
while the others do this.

45
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,520
If everyone's ready, we'll start now.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
- Okay.
- Already?

47
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,000
- We can read each other's minds, can't we?
- Of course we can.

48
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,220
The first pose is...

49
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
the baby butt bread.

50
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,760
Copper has been eliminated.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
We're very sorry.

52
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,960
- Come on, that's too fast.
- No, I was gonna...

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
This is just the beginning.

54
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,640
The next pose is...

55
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,720
a cheek poke.

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,000
Phupha has been eliminated.

57
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,770
- Go.
- Oh, my God.

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,120
What's up, bro?

59
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,440
The next pose is...

60
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,670
a dinosaur.

61
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,200
- 3, 2, 1...
- What?

62
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,560
What are you doing?

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't know.

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,600
North and Otto have been eliminated.

65
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,400
I had no idea.

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,240
A heart.

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,040
A puppy. 3, 2, 1...

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,760
That's cute.

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,720
All of you have made it to the next round.

70
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Next up,

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
a bow pose.

72
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,800
Aw, Pung has a bow.

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,760
All of you have made it to the next round.

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Next up, a naga pose.

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,120
PatJi has been eliminated.

76
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,320
- Oh...
- Oh.

77
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,440
Welcome, PatJi.

78
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,100
Weren't they supposed to do this?

79
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
4 people left.

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,120
Next up, a Y2K pose.

81
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,690
Fifa has been eliminated.

82
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,440
- Welcome.
- I'm out.

83
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
A cat punch.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,720
Next, we will move on to the final round.

85
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,200
The others will also join in this round.

86
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,400
Please stand up.

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,960
The rule for this round is:

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Whoever makes a pose
that matches the most people

89
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,680
will be crowned the winner.

90
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,000
And the final pose is...

91
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
a blooming flower.

92
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,570
And the winner
of this mini challenge is...

93
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,500
Pung.

94
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,980
You're a pro.

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,520
Please choose a friend
to spend Friendship Time with

96
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,570
right now.

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,920
- Whoa.
- Pung...

98
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm so hungry.

99
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
- Pung.
- I'm hungry.

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360
My bro, I'm right here.

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,680
- We have so much food here.
- Whoa...

102
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
There's also some steak.

103
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
- Oops!
- Whoa, watch out.

104
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,010
- The weather's so nice, don't you think?
- Mm.

105
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,440
- It's giving the countryside vibe.
- Mm.

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,720
Here we are, finally at dinner.

107
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,640
This is our...

108
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,120
- Second?
- Our second time.

109
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,840
It's not exactly dinner.
It's the Friendship Time.

110
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,920
- Right.
- This is our Friendship Time.

111
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,360
How have you been?
We haven't done this for a while now.

112
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,520
I mentioned earlier
that I wanted to do this again.

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,919
Shall we? Where should we start?

114
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,159
After you.

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,480
I guess I'll start with the steak.

116
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,640
Can you reach it, Copper?

117
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,570
I can. If I...

118
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,800
No,

119
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,480
it's just...

120
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
like...

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,040
I might've done you wrong

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,640
and made you feel like this.

123
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,840
So I wanna tell you
that I'm genuinely sorry.

124
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,440
It's my fault for being torn.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey, it's completely fine.

126
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,360
Honestly, I'm also
starting to ask myself

127
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,520
what I really want.

128
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,400
Right.

129
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,890
I actually have to thank you

130
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,000
for joining the show

131
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,120
and being the reason we meet.

132
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,400
After I opened up
to you about many things,

133
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,760
I can feel the fire igniting in me.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,440
- Really?
- Yeah, it's burning up...

135
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,440
What fire, though?

136
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,540
The fire to match with someone.

137
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,260
You've heard, right?

138
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,360
After this,
we'll have to choose a partner.

139
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,890
Yes.

140
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I...

141
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,400
want to tell you what I honestly feel.

142
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,960
Well...

143
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,640
from the very first day, I...

144
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
I wanted to choose you as my partner.

145
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,900
But as of today,

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,400
after reflecting and looking back,

147
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
I feel like...

148
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm not...

149
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm not quite ready in many ways

150
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
from which...

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
I've observed myself
since the acting section.

152
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Uh...

153
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,400
you've always told me,

154
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
like...

155
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,800
- But I was...
- Pung...

156
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,120
- It's...
- Yeah, I...

157
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,480
I was too comfortable being with myself,

158
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,800
and I needed to focus more
on the person I have in front of me.

159
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,440
I feel rather...

160
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,240
thankful for you.

161
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,920
This show is the first time
I got to be close with the guys

162
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,920
and the idea of having a partner.

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
But I want to tell you that

164
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm not...

165
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm not ready to choose a partner.

166
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Well,

167
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,480
from the very start,

168
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,920
I wanted to choose you,

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,760
but as of right now,

170
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm...

171
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm just not ready.

172
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,960
Thank you, Pung.

173
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,520
The day you sent me a letter,

174
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I was so happy.

175
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,450
I was blushing like crazy.

176
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,720
I was just so happy...

177
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't know.

178
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,880
I realized
that someone saw the value in me.

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Like, someone really saw me.

180
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,360
I felt like someone saw my worth,

181
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,960
and I was so, so happy.

182
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,680
That letter...

183
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,640
gave me so much encouragement

184
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,880
while I was feeling down.

185
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,560
It was such a lovely letter,

186
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
so thank you for that.

187
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,360
I still wish you well.

188
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
I...

189
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,320
want us to be friends
for as long as we can.

190
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
I do, too.

191
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Even though...

192
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,080
we can't be partners,

193
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,520
you don't have to worry.

194
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm not going anywhere.

195
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,280
- I will always be your support.
- I know.

196
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,020
I'll be watching you from here.

197
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,660
I'm not going anywhere.

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're not?

199
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,360
Hey, don't cry. Here's a tissue.

200
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Or else,

201
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Or else, you'll get all blotchy.

202
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,880
It's just coming out.

203
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't control it.

204
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Thank you for being a part of my life.

205
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,920
I'll thrive with you,

206
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,880
even though we're not partners.

207
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Let's do it together.

208
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Let's be best bros
for a long, long time.

209
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,000
It makes me feel so bad seeing you cry.

210
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,640
Hey, don't be.

211
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,360
It's not your fault.

212
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,480
You're already good enough.

213
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
You're a really nice guy.

214
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
Stop crying now.

215
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,280
Jeez. I can't help it!

216
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,880
It's not like I don't want to.

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,000
What have we here?

218
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,080
You dressed up to the nines today.

219
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
I may have.

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,960
Just in case

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,840
someone regrets not choosing me.

222
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
Oh, so you're planning ahead.

223
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
So I gotta...

224
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
bring it up a notch.

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,200
Alright, alright.

226
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
Are you excited for today?

227
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
I am.

228
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
What about you?

229
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,080
Me too.

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,880
I'm happy that I made it to this day.

231
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
So...

232
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
are you confident in your decision?

233
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,560
Having any second thoughts?

234
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm a lot more confident,

235
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
so I'm not so hesitant anymore.

236
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,840
I just want to tell you that

237
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,120
it doesn't matter who you choose,

238
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
but it's just...

239
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,680
If you have something on your mind

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,360
or something that worries you
or overwhelms you,

241
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,880
you can talk to me.

242
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I...

243
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,800
At least,

244
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,320
I can give you good advice

245
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,080
and be a good listener.

246
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,810
Mm.

247
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,160
And... I actually want to tell you

248
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,160
not to be too hard on yourself

249
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,200
because you've been doing amazing.

250
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,400
Thank you.

251
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,680
Yeah, that's about it.

252
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,000
I do want to tell you

253
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,480
not to be too hard
on yourself or stress it.

254
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,800
You've also been doing amazing,

255
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,920
and I'm so glad to be working with you.

256
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
What are you guys talking about?

257
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Hello, Phupha.

258
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
Oh.

259
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
How's it going?

260
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,160
Pretty good. How are you guys doing?

261
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,920
Good.

262
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,120
It's going.

263
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,720
- We're just talking right now.
- It's going?

264
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,040
I just want to have a word with Otto,
so I came out here.

265
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm just asking if I'm interrupting.

266
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,360
Oh, go ahead.

267
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,760
- Alright.
- Is that okay?

268
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,720
Yeah, it's alright.

269
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,920
Do you want to talk here or over there?

270
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,800
Right, I can go over there.

271
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Okay.

272
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
It's pretty sunny out there.

273
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,360
- Okay.
- Let's go.

274
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
That works.

275
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,200
- Talk to you later.
- Wear these sunglasses.

276
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Sure.

277
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,880
I'll leave them with you

278
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
since it's really sunny.

279
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay.

280
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,960
So, how was tonight?

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
Was it fun?

282
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
It was pretty fun.

283
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,840
I got to talk more with North.

284
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,160
And...

285
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,480
the food was amazing.

286
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,720
How do you feel when you're around North?

287
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,440
Pretty good.

288
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,560
We have fun conversations.

289
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,560
Can you take off your sunglasses?

290
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,599
- I want to see...
- Sure.

291
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
your eyes.

292
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
Of course.

293
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,079
So,

294
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,440
the reason I wanted to talk to you

295
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
is about choosing partners.

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
And I feel like...

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you...

298
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,010
You have what I'm looking for.

299
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,280
So I think...

300
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,480
I'm gonna choose you,

301
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,240
and I wanna know

302
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
what you think.

303
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
For me,

304
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,680
you're also skilled
in singing and dancing,

305
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,040
so I think...

306
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,000
that's one of the reasons
I wanna work with you and I'm interested in you.

307
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,440
We share interests
in what we can do together, you know?

308
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,450
That's why I was interested
in getting to know you.

309
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,520
I think I...

310
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,960
I've become more confident in my choice.

311
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,240
Right.

312
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Yeah.

313
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,720
Actually, on this show,

314
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,040
I, like...

315
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,520
I don't have my eye on anyone else.

316
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
I think...

317
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,000
at this very moment in the show,

318
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,560
I choose you.

319
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,840
Just on the show?

320
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
How about elsewhere?

321
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
Mm... It's...

322
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,960
it's still up in the air,

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,840
but I mean, right here and right now,

324
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,480
- after we've spent time together.
- Right, just right now.

325
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,200
Oh...

326
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Where are you heading?

327
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
To Wave.

328
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,680
- Right.
- Right.

329
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,000
He seems so calm.

330
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,240
- He looks chill.
- Mm.

331
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,280
So, yeah.

332
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
Let me have the rest of the time

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,440
to process something a little further.

334
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
Choose whoever you feel
comfortable working with,

335
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,240
someone who makes you feel relaxed.

336
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,040
Mm.

337
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Oh...

338
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,480
What?

339
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,600
North just walked up there,
saying he was looking for you.

340
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,520
Upstairs.

341
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,160
- You weren't upstairs?
- You weren't?

342
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
I just came down earlier
for some chocolates.

343
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,560
- What...
- Huh?

344
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
Okay.

345
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,560
So curious.

346
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,240
I was just making conversation.

347
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Hey, North.

348
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,120
Yeah?

349
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,760
What?

350
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,600
What are you doing here alone?

351
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
Nothing, Wave.

352
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,520
What was that?

353
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,800
They said you were looking for me.

354
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,480
What? Yeah, I was.

355
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,160
You called me, didn't you?

356
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
I know you were upset.

357
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,320
What do you mean?

358
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,560
Come on,

359
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,040
we're not kids anymore.

360
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,720
If you weren't,
you wouldn't be here feeling down.

361
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,360
You're just...

362
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
It's chill, bro.

363
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,920
We're grown-ups now.

364
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,320
You gotta respect
others' choices, you know.

365
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,120
You're afraid, aren't you?

366
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,730
- What?
- Are you afraid?

367
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,480
- Of what?
- Well...

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,440
- Afraid of what?
- Isn't that why you came here?

369
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
Like, 'cause you saw something.

370
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,120
What?

371
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm just here to see you.

372
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,640
Don't worry too much.

373
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,400
I know.

374
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,040
- Come on.
- I really understand you.

375
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,120
You're the hottest here. Trust me.

376
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

377
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
You sure?

378
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,200
A hundred percent...

379
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,680
out of two hundred.

380
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,200
- You're the hottest, man.
- I see.

381
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,560
Between you and me,

382
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
who's hotter?

383
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,720
I think I am.

384
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
- Hey, come on.
- Seriously.

385
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,960
I bet that's not true.

386
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,840
It's a fact.

387
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
It's not.

388
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Look.

389
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,560
Are you sad?

390
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,920
Wanna go get some fresh air outside?

391
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Maybe not.

392
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,800
Why not?

393
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,560
The weather's not nice over there, is it?

394
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,720
No, it is.

395
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,360
It's been cold lately.

396
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,720
So cold!

397
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,160
Freezing cold.

398
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,200
If I were you,
I'd just walk over to them.

399
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,360
And?

400
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
I'd sit between them

401
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,080
and act like I didn't care.

402
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,040
Whoa! And then?

403
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,160
Once you sit between them,

404
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
what would you say?

405
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
"What are you talking about?

406
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,080
Why does it have to be just you two?

407
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,320
I'm not happy about this."

408
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Whoa!

409
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,080
Just kidding.

410
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,800
But seriously, you could've done that
and acted like you usually would.

411
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,920
What do you mean?

412
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,520
Like how you were upset...

413
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,720
the first time.

414
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
What about the second time?

415
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,960
This is it.

416
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,840
No, it's not.

417
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
This is not the second time.

418
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,600
It was that time...

419
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,320
when you did this.

420
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
We were side by side.

421
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
What was wrong with you?

422
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,280
Be honest with me. What happened?

423
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
When?

424
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,040
Why were you doing this
while they were announcing the results?

425
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Well, I just realized...

426
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,840
It wasn't your thing?

427
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
I ran into a crossroads.

428
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm kinda expecting to hug a teddy.

429
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,480
I mean, he might not be interested in me.

430
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,760
Wait, are you sad?

431
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,600
- No, I'm fine.
- Hey, Wave.

432
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
It's okay.

433
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Listen to me.

434
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,600
I can advise you on this.

435
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
It's no big deal.

436
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,160
Even if you don't get a partner,
life goes on.

437
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,890
You'll be fine.

438
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,520
- Right?
- Yeah.

439
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,440
You know that.

440
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,120
Well...

441
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,280
Why would you be sad, then?

442
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,450
Wanna hug a teddy?

443
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,280
No...

444
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,960
Honestly, I don't think
anyone would really wanna do that,

445
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,240
even if they said so.

446
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,600
No one would want to hug a teddy.

447
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,000
What about you?

448
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,090
I don't want to.

449
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,120
But?

450
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,880
- Come on.
- I do wanna hug it.

451
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,720
You're sad.

452
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,280
You're so down.

453
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,760
Really...

454
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
You're totally unhappy.

455
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,840
Tell me about it.

456
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,440
Is it one-sided love

457
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,200
- or something like that?
- No.

458
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,840
If you're the one for them,
you won't have to try so hard.

459
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,890
Wait, you're right.

460
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
You won't have to try.

461
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,080
How are you doing, our baby?

462
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,680
I'm fine.

463
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Really?

464
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,720
This is the last day.

465
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,880
How has it been the whole time?

466
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,810
I was disappointed after some missions,

467
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,440
but overall,
it's been a great experience.

468
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,320
I loved your singing
in the singing mission, though.

469
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,680
You even won.

470
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,960
Then sing with me.

471
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,280
- What?
- Sing with me.

472
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,160
Sure, when the chance comes.

473
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,130
Choose me, then.

474
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,360
I wanna sing with you, too.

475
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
You sure can.

476
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,160
I also wanna improve my skills
through more missions.

477
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,160
- Like...
- I wanna get better.

478
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
acting skills, right?

479
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
So, what do you think?

480
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,880
Have you chosen your partner?

481
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,400
Well, actually...

482
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,560
We kinda talked about this,

483
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,640
and I think I've made up my mind.

484
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,880
Can I get a hint?

485
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,320
- No.
- I'll wait, then.

486
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Keep waiting.

487
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
I actually like you.

488
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,850
I like how passionate you are.

489
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,440
I don't know. It's just that...

490
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
you're still young, I guess.

491
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,520
- I know.
- You should take more time, like...

492
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,720
Don't rush it.

493
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
Right, I also feel like...

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,360
I honestly didn't come here
to find someone,

495
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,830
so I'm kinda happy
it turned out this way.

496
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
I still need more experience

497
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,240
- 'cause this is my very first time.
- Right.

498
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,240
Yeah, but it's a good thing
that this program exists.

499
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,520
Since we're all part of Gen 5,

500
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,240
it helps us grow closer
and understand each other better.

501
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,120
Right.

502
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,220
After all, we'll be working together
for a long time.

503
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,810
Yeah, we'll get to meet often anyway.

504
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,720
Right.

505
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,440
So...

506
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,880
Honestly, I'm okay with this.

507
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,560
You know, I need more experience.

508
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,080
I'll think about this later.

509
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Whoa,

510
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,200
you've actually kept all those cards?

511
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,270
So, how are you guys?

512
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,320
I was talking to Otto today.

513
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,600
How did it go?

514
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,560
Yeah, it was okay.

515
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,660
I got to express my feelings.

516
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
What feelings?

517
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,080
What?

518
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,440
- Is it a secret?
- Yes.

519
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
- It is.
- Whoa.

520
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,680
Are you not gonna talk to anyone, Porsche?

521
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
Nope.

522
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,210
Why? You haven't found the one?

523
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
I usually don't talk much.

524
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,480
- Before...
- Green.

525
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,600
Before...

526
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,880
Why are you so serious?

527
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
I joined DOMUNDI
before this program, right?

528
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,920
- Wait, it's Porsche's turn.
- And I felt like...

529
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,800
the other gens were very close,

530
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,680
but I haven't played in any series,

531
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,400
so I'm not close to anyone.

532
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
But now that I'm here,

533
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,520
I've gotten closer to you all.

534
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,520
I feel like we love one another
in our own way.

535
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,560
I may not have found a partner,
but I'm still happy I joined this program.

536
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,490
I have too many.
You won't remember them all.

537
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,880
But after joining this,

538
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,320
- UNO.
- I feel like...

539
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,790
everyone's so sweet.

540
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
I can talk to all of you.

541
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,240
Who's the sweetest?

542
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,920
I needed to put that down.

543
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,880
- UNO.
- Putting...

544
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,400
Who's the sweetest?

545
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
Me.

546
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Just kidding.

547
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
You are. You're the sweetest.
Right, Phupha?

548
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
- You're the best.
- Yeah, he is.

549
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,200
The sweetest.

550
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,040
- How sweet, honey.
- No one is sweeter.

551
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,400
♫You're so sweet♫

552
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,080
Annyeong.

553
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,440
- Annyeonghaseyo.
- Oh...

554
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,800
- You're joining us?
- Annyeonghaseyo.

555
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm joining you.

556
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,680
- Annyeonghaseyo.
- Come on.

557
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,800
- Should we restart?
- Yeah.

558
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,680
We're the teddy hugger gang.

559
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,000
Are you sure you wanna join us?

560
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,120
Well, I'm also hugging a pillow.

561
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,480
Aren't you gonna hug someone?

562
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,000
Right, you are, aren't you?

563
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,460
- Well...
- Are you sure?

564
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,960
Are you certain?

565
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
- I guess he is.
- After talking today.

566
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,320
Let's see.

567
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,240
I guess it's certain now.

568
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,320
You'll wait until the last minute?

569
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
I'm not telling you. Just keep waiting.

570
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,880
It's a surprise.

571
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,200
Is there anyone
you might regret not choosing this year?

572
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,480
It's hard to answer that right now

573
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,520
'cause I might miss something
in the future, too.

574
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,760
You're thinking about the future, right?

575
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
Kind of, like...

576
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
I'll just take my time.

577
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,360
- Rushing might not be a good idea.
- Right.

578
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,720
There's still time.

579
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,640
- I really believe that...
- Yes?

580
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,600
sometimes, if you don't make a choice today,

581
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,120
you might thank yourself

582
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,280
next year, or even later,

583
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
when you finally meet someone...

584
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,440
you don't want to let go.

585
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,440
You just don't know
how you really feel right now.

586
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
- I know.
- Yeah.

587
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,920
- So...
- You're right.

588
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,480
Don't take it too seriously.

589
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,450
Let's leave it for the future.

590
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,480
- Don't be serious. Let's eat cereal.
- I'm not.

591
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,920
- Wait...
- Oh...

592
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,400
- Honestly...
- Cereal's good.

593
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,560
- I'm hungry.
- Just being here is already a great experience.

594
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
I got to meet everyone.

595
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,520
And make new friends.

596
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,160
That alone makes me happy.

597
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Reverse.

598
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,840
Then I'll use a reverse card, too.

599
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,840
Oh...

600
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,090
I don't have any.

601
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,440
Nine, then.

602
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,640
Do you guys enjoy acting?

603
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
You know, in the end, DOMUNDI...

604
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
- Prioritizes acting.
- produces lots of series.

605
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,160
Do matching numbers work?

606
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,400
- They're different colors.
- Yes.

607
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,520
That works.

608
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,330
- Right.
- About acting...

609
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
I actually joined this company
'cause I wanted to do that.

610
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,720
And once I did, it was actually fun.

611
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,920
It feels like something that's...

612
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,960
- How do I say it?
- Worth trying?

613
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, like...

614
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
- Something new?
- Worth learning.

615
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,960
Yeah, worth learning.

616
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,600
And it's just fun, right?

617
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,560
- Yeah.
- I mean, it is hard,

618
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,280
but everyone makes it enjoyable.

619
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,320
I get that.

620
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:56,160
Have you already got someone in mind?

621
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,320
Who will you choose?

622
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
- Oh...
- A teddy.

623
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,240
We can take our time deciding.

624
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,880
Hugging a person is better, you know.

625
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,760
- Whoa.
- No, I think...

626
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,990
There's not enough time for me
to make a decision.

627
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
What about you?

628
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,220
I...

629
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,640
If possible, I'd rather hug someone.

630
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,680
- And is that someone among us?
- Sorry?

631
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
It's a secret, you know.

632
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,560
- Yeah.
- But you already talked to him, right?

633
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,350
I did.

634
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
What about you?

635
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,640
We kinda talked.

636
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Is it my turn again?

637
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,640
It went well, so we'll see.

638
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,880
Okay. No spoilers.

639
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,960
This is a friendship program.

640
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,280
It's all about
getting to know each other.

641
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,680
- Exactly.
- Right.

642
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,560
It's to let us get to know each other.

643
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,590
UNO.

644
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,400
Already?

645
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,640
What has it been like being here?

646
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,120
This is my second time here, you know.

647
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Like...

648
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,120
it's...

649
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,520
reminding me of the last season.

650
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,840
Are you worried?

651
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,160
Not really.

652
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,330
But it's actually something to think about.

653
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,680
There have been
so many moments and feelings here.

654
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,920
Yeah.

655
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Like,

656
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,800
North, you know.

657
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,160
He's been sticking with Otto
the whole time.

658
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,640
You barely talked, right?

659
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,120
- Sorry?
- You barely talked, right?

660
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,880
Yeah, barely.

661
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,960
Wanna hug a teddy bear with me?

662
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Nah, I'm not.

663
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,520
- What?
- I already did last season.

664
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,360
So you've found someone now?

665
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,320
You have, haven't you?

666
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,680
Yeah.

667
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,240
I have.

668
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,480
How do you feel?

669
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,200
- Comfortable.
- Around him?

670
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,640
Yeah.

671
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
You're comfortable?

672
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
That's good.

673
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,040
You'll find one.

674
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,640
Find what?

675
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
A partner.

676
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,520
- What?
- A partner.

677
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh...

678
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,440
This kind of thing takes time.

679
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,280
We gotta work with them long-term.

680
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,080
If it's not right, then...

681
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,360
it's fine.

682
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Hard to say, man.

683
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,160
Hugging a teddy is the easiest choice.

684
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,640
But trust me,
no one really wants to hug a teddy.

685
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,480
They're just pretending they want to.

686
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,880
It's good that
lots of you are hugging a teddy.

687
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Last time,

688
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,200
only Ryujin and I hugged it.

689
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,600
- Two of you?
- Yeah.

690
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
It felt lonely.

691
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,800
Everyone else was...

692
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,200
I might be the only one
hugging it this time.

693
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,060
Who? You?

694
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
No, come on.

695
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,720
- Trust me.
- Who knows?

696
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
I wanna know...

697
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,440
- What?
- who you're comfortable with.

698
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,520
Who I'm comfortable with?

699
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
How are you feeling?

700
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,760
You know, it's the final day now.

701
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,360
What?

702
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,640
It's the final day, so...

703
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,800
it feels kind of heavy.

704
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,200
- Really?
- Time flies, right?

705
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,520
Yeah, it really does.

706
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,120
We have to make a choice today.

707
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,720
So, what's on your mind?

708
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,200
On my mind...

709
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,200
I do have someone.

710
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,080
How's Ryujin doing?

711
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
I didn't say it was him.
Why did you mention him?

712
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Well, I was just asking.
It was random.

713
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I mean...

714
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,960
I need to be sure now.

715
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,160
"Need to"?

716
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,880
- Are you actually hesitating?
- I'm not.

717
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,720
- Alright, that's good.
- Who would even be my other choice?

718
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,100
I don't know.

719
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,760
- No one, right?
- Yeah.

720
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
That's good.

721
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,960
And you?

722
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,280
Pete and Copper...

723
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,920
- What?
- Between them...

724
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,200
Why?

725
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,960
I mean...

726
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,440
Pete's still very young,

727
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,440
but...

728
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
- there's other stuff, too.
- Okay.

729
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,800
So,

730
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,380
what kind of person
are you comfortable around?

731
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,960
I don't know, just...

732
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,760
If it feels right, then that's it.

733
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
It's about how you feel.

734
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
Do you think...

735
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,670
you're 100% sure
about your partner now?

736
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
I am.

737
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,840
Okay.

738
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
Are you 100% sure, too?

739
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,320
Yes.

740
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Alright.

741
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,650
- Oh...
- Wait...

742
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
They're back.

743
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,080
I hope you get to...

744
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
sing, dance,

745
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
and act like you want to.

746
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,520
You, too. Like we talked about,

747
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,280
since you like singing and dancing,

748
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,280
I hope you get to do
what you want as well.

749
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
You, too.

750
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,159
We might get to do it together.

751
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,080
Okay.

752
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,120
Alright, see you. Bye-bye.

753
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,480
Bye. Good luck talking to Copper.

754
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,640
Porsche...

755
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
What?

756
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
I got you some cake.

757
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

758
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,120
I bought it from the cafe.

759
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,560
Thanks.

760
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,440
Looks like it's been through a lot.

761
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,680
- It's probably the hot weather.
- Yeah.

762
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,720
- Why does it look so sad?
- I know.

763
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
It's been through a lot.

764
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,480
Wanna try some?

765
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,600
No, I'm good. I got it just for you.

766
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,760
Really? You're not gonna try some?

767
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,840
I...

768
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Well...

769
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm not hungry.

770
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Why?

771
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,160
I mean, I'm...

772
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
Not doing well?

773
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,300
Yeah, I failed.

774
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,720
Aw...

775
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm fine, though.

776
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I'm just a little sad.

777
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
It's because...

778
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,360
of me.

779
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,080
I'm still not ready for a lot of things.

780
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,640
It's made me...

781
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
grow up, though.

782
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,800
Actually,

783
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,120
It's great that you see this as growth.

784
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,480
Once you're in this industry,

785
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,760
there will be expectations,
and sometimes you'll end up disappointed.

786
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,160
And you just have to keep growing.

787
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,240
- You never know.
- Right.

788
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,880
Maybe next year,
or even in a few months,

789
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,040
you might learn something new
and meet someone who's right for you.

790
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,600
- Right.
- Maybe even more right

791
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,840
than anyone today.

792
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,080
This is the first time
you've felt like this anyway, right?

793
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,280
That's right.

794
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
You will find them one day.

795
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,520
- That's what I believe.
- Hey, Ryujin.

796
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,080
- Wanna sit?
- Let him sit with us.

797
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,440
How was it?

798
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
- Where have you been?
- How was...

799
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,240
- Want some capybara?
- What?

800
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Did you enjoy it?

801
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,760
Did I?

802
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,520
Huh?

803
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,360
Stop.

804
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,360
Not at all.

805
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,720
Come on.

806
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
Well...

807
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
It was fine, right?

808
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,560
- Yeah.
- We're friends anyway.

809
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,880
- Give him some advice.
- Is that so?

810
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,960
Give him some advice.
You failed last season, too.

811
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,920
What do you mean?

812
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,120
I chose to be alone.

813
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,680
I mean, you didn't get a partner.

814
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Oh...

815
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,000
- Are you getting one now?
- I wouldn't say I failed.

816
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,560
We're not here
just to find a partner, you know.

817
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,760
The program's called
'Friendship the Reality.'

818
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,960
- Don't worry about it.
- No...

819
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,120
Take your time.

820
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
No, I'm not worried.

821
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,680
I already talked things out with Copper.

822
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,600
I'm happy now.

823
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,440
I'll keep moving forward.

824
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
- You're amazing.
- It's okay.

825
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,040
Right, Ryujin.

826
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,200
Have you talked with PatJi?

827
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,280
What?

828
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,200
- Have you guys talked?
- Why is it about me now?

829
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,680
Are you sure now?

830
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Yes.

831
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,720
You once told PatJi
not to get a partner yet.

832
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
Does that mean he'll have a partner, too?

833
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,040
Well,

834
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,880
I'll talk to him soon.

835
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Ryujin...

836
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,880
What? What?!

837
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Why?

838
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
I'm on your side.

839
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,520
- I'm rooting for you.
- Me, too.

840
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,680
Thanks.

841
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,240
I'm rooting for you, too.

842
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,240
You'll find the right one.

843
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,520
- Trust me.
- Okay.

844
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,240
You're right.

845
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,920
You should pray like I do.

846
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,520
When you find one,
let us check them out, too.

847
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,640
What?

848
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
- You told me last time that we'd check
- Oh...

849
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,680
- my partner.
- We'd do that together

850
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,600
'cause we're...

851
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,760
- Gen 5.
- Right.

852
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,160
And Gen 4.

853
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,080
We're the DMD Friendship Season 3 boys.

854
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah, let us check them out first.

855
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,240
Sure.

856
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,680
Like, you'll say yes or no, right?

857
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Where have you been?

858
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,680
I was talking to Fifa.

859
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,360
How have you been, Mr. Tinnapat?

860
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
What?

861
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,400
Why are you sitting here?

862
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Well...

863
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,080
I was waiting for you, Mr. Jirachart.

864
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,780
Did you get to experience
anything new this season?

865
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
Met new people.

866
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,040
Made new friends.

867
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,000
How did it go talking to Fifa?

868
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,080
It went well.

869
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,480
It was completely clear.

870
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Yeah.

871
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,720
It was clear?

872
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

873
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,080
Just check it when the program airs.

874
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,720
Have you made up your mind?

875
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Did I ever say I hesitated?

876
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,480
Seriously,

877
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
I don't know who else to choose.

878
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:15,610
I'm comfortable working with you
and being around you.

879
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,160
So, you're sure now?

880
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,720
I am sure.

881
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,720
What about you?

882
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,360
At this moment, everyone has officially
made their partner selection.

883
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,200
Next, each of you will receive a message.

884
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,560
The message will specify
a location within this villa.

885
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,680
Once you receive it, please stand up

886
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,160
and walk to the designated location.

887
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,000
Waiting there
will be the result of your partner selection.

888
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
You got the message?

889
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
- I'm just stretching.
- Why did you stand up?

890
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,000
Gosh!

891
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,680
I'm tired.

892
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,080
Okay, I get that.

893
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,220
In the meantime,
everyone can talk freely.

894
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,000
However, please do not reveal
your partner selection choices.

895
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,640
Okay.

896
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,080
- Got it.
- Understood.

897
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,320
Come on.

898
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,610
Alright.

899
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,800
Have you watched Bear Grylls's shows?

900
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,240
"Hi, I'm in the woods."

901
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,280
"Hi, I'm Bear Grylls."

902
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,640
Wow, you sounded like him.

903
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
I've watched his shows a lot.

904
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
- Wait...
- Oh.

905
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,800
- Who got it?
- Who got it?

906
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,600
- Who?
- Who?

907
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,440
Who got it?

908
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,960
- Wait, my pants are tight.
- Who?

909
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,600
- Who got it?
- I did.

910
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
- Seriously? Come on, that was too fast.
- Where are you going?

911
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I also got one.

912
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,920
- What?
- Whoa.

913
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,560
- Are you for real now?
- What are you doing?

914
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
- What?
- I need to pee.

915
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
- Oh...
- Jeez.

916
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,600
Just kidding.

917
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,840
I also got a message.

918
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,760
- Good luck.
- Are you serious?

919
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Good luck.

920
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,920
The message said

921
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,080
I should hurry,
because they put the teddy there,

922
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
and it might fall into the pond.

923
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,320
I bet.

924
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,840
Go there.

925
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,320
- What does your message say?
- Over there.

926
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,680
I'm lonely now. They're both gone.

927
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,600
- Phupha, move to him.
- You can sit with me.

928
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,000
- Sit here.
- Come closer.

929
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,120
Copper, you move to him.

930
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,120
- Come here.
- Let me sit with Phupha.

931
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,120
Exactly.

932
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,520
That way, you won't be lonely.

933
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
That's right.

934
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,320
Do you know what kind of message it was?

935
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,280
- Probably a location.
- They already told you that.

936
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,760
Easy, man.

937
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Just kidding.

938
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,080
Hey, Pung...

939
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,360
You're pretty hot-tempered.

940
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,120
- A message.
- A message...

941
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,160
Not mine.

942
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,880
- Oh...
- Not mine.

943
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,160
It's mine this time.

944
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,120
Not mine.

945
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,800
I also got one.

946
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,560
- Whoa.
- Oh...

947
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,440
- What?
- I'll be back.

948
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,000
Oh, and you're at both ends.

949
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,720
Whoa...

950
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
- This is exciting.
- 7 people left.

951
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,520
- I'm so excited.
- I know, right?

952
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,640
Excited, right?

953
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,000
- With this cold weather...
- This is exciting.

954
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,520
- It's getting colder.
- We're gonna leave soon.

955
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,600
Here we go again.

956
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,560
Still not mine.

957
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,680
All the time.

958
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,880
Bye-bye.

959
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,960
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, guys.

960
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,520
- Let's get going. Should we move to them?
- Let's move to them.

961
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,720
My beloved Popeye brother.

962
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,720
My Popeye bro.

963
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,560
This mission gives me a hard time

964
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,200
'cause I don't know
if he's gonna choose me.

965
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,640
If PatJi doesn't choose me today...

966
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,360
I'll have to hug the teddy bear
like the last time.

967
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Got you.

968
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,720
We see each other at college

969
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,960
and at work.

970
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Are you gonna be tired of me?

971
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,840
If that were the case,
I'd have felt that way a long time ago.

972
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,760
Good.

973
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,880
I can see your face every day.

974
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,760
If we were partners,

975
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,180
our college friends
would make fun of us.

976
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,040
What would you say to them?

977
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
Let them.

978
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,380
That's the truth.

979
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,160
Do you think we could do it?

980
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,320
We've got to handle
both school and work together.

981
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,920
Since we're at the same school
and work together,

982
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,680
two heads are better than one.

983
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,920
We'll do it together,

984
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,040
and it's gonna work out.

985
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,000
Are you willing to do it with me?

986
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,640
Sure.

987
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,320
Are you?

988
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,400
Of course.

989
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,640
You mean it?

990
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,600
If you are,

991
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,960
how could I not be?

992
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
I'm in.

993
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,760
I know there's still something
I'm not good at.

994
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,280
Mm.

995
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
In the future,

996
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,280
I'll try even harder to help us get places.

997
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,520
I'll also try.

998
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,120
You're better than me, PatJi.

999
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,120
That's not true.

1000
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,360
For me,

1001
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,040
I'll keep running

1002
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,720
and running after you

1003
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,400
until we're at the same pace.

1004
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,000
No one ahead, no one behind.

1005
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,940
Okay?

1006
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,560
I'm just playing.

1007
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
And I thought you were serious.

1008
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,240
How's that not serious?

1009
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,840
I'll do it with you.

1010
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,760
Just like I said in the last season,

1011
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,520
"I might find someone new

1012
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,200
or come back around
to meet someone familiar."

1013
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,400
"Just don't leave me behind
for a partner."

1014
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,840
And someone here said,

1015
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,000
"Can you stick around?"

1016
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,480
Well,

1017
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,280
you really did stick around.

1018
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,640
I believe in you, PatJi.

1019
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,080
I believe in you, too.

1020
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Got you.

1021
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,160
Didn't you say
you weren't gonna choose me?

1022
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,680
I don't regret my decision at all.
[Tinnapat]

1023
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,800
I'm confident.

1024
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,600
I've just realized
how the older gens feel now.

1025
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,600
I need to trust my partner
with my life from now on.

1026
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,160
I'm not alone anymore.

1027
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,720
From now on,

1028
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,040
please take care of me.

1029
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,480
I'll take good care of you.

1030
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,760
Take care of me, too.

1031
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,760
I just got back at you.

1032
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,720
Mm.

1033
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Let's do this together.

1034
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,240
- We got this.
- It's us against the world.

1035
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,840
I'm thankful for this reality show

1036
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,200
for letting me be 100% sure

1037
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,840
that he's the one I want by my side.

1038
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,960
After this, PatJi and I
will keep improving.

1039
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,120
Please send lots of love
to both of us.

1040
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,680
From now on, we'll try every way possible

1041
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,200
and do our best.

1042
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,800
I want to let you guys know

1043
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,760
that Ryujin and I
are officially partners.

1044
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
Thank you.

1045
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,320
Thank you for choosing me, too.

1046
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,720
From this moment on...

1047
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,720
Let's go after our dreams.

1048
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,180
Let's do this together.

1049
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,480
At first, I was completely fine,

1050
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,680
but after reading the letter,

1051
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,340
everything that had happened
came rushing back to me,

1052
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,800
like...
[Copper]

1053
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,200
the words Copper wrote,

1054
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,480
which were,

1055
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,640
"Pung, you're my best friend."

1056
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,440
Before this, Copper didn't have
many close friends in Thailand.

1057
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,080
I was one of his first.

1058
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,560
So, yeah.

1059
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,800
I was touched, and...

1060
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,330
I could still feel our sincere friendship.

1061
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,920
Thank you, Copper,

1062
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,480
for lighting a fire in me.

1063
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,600
At first, it was like...

1064
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,560
I didn't feel anything about this show.

1065
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,560
I couldn't imagine
how to approach a partnership

1066
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,900
or even begin one.

1067
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,400
Now that I've experienced it,

1068
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,840
this feels like...

1069
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,440
the very first step...

1070
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,400
This was the very first step

1071
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,160
that introduced me
to the concept of partnership.

1072
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,500
'DMD Friendship the Reality'

1073
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,850
- allowed me to...
- You, teddy.

1074
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,720
work on many skills.

1075
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
Teddy bear,

1076
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
thank you.

1077
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,160
It made me look back

1078
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,120
and realize that
I shouldn't set my expectations too high.

1079
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,660
I should focus on enjoying time
with my friends

1080
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,080
and sharing our stories and feelings.

1081
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,960
Even though I didn't win any missions,

1082
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,480
when it comes to Gen 5,

1083
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,720
seeing them win or smile

1084
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,600
makes me happy.

1085
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,680
The guys in this gen

1086
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,440
really love each other.

1087
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,400
Mommies and friends,
don't worry about me.

1088
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,920
I really enjoy this experience.

1089
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,240
Please put your mind at ease.

1090
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,560
This is, like, a chance for me
to gain experience,

1091
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,320
but I'm genuinely
not ready for a partner.

1092
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,300
So...

1093
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,840
how am I? Better than I thought I'd be,

1094
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,760
because with the limited time,

1095
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,910
it's really hard for me
to decide on a partner.

1096
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,720
After the decision, I could feel relief
wash over me.

1097
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,640
I thought about 'A Million Stars'
from 'Your Sky Series,'

1098
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,690
and it made me realize that
even if there are millions of stars,

1099
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,310
in the end, I only want one partner
to share my dream with.

1100
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,240
That's why I drew a star,

1101
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,040
hoping I'd meet someone
who wants to stay by my side.

1102
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,200
I'm blushing right now.

1103
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,480
So if anyone wants to be my star,

1104
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,160
you can contact this teddy bear,

1105
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,280
my little secretary.

1106
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,800
Fill out your applications.

1107
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,240
I don't want to be alone anymore.
Aof's always teasing me about it.

1108
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,440
Oh...

1109
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,280
Oh.

1110
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,240
How's it going?

1111
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,800
What happened?

1112
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,960
How was it?

1113
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,440
[The handsome little brother]

1114
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,960
Honestly, I didn't expect
to have a partner from the start.

1115
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,400
I've talked to many people,

1116
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,960
but I clicked the most with Fifa.

1117
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,620
Because of our similar passion
for singing and all that,

1118
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,000
we got along really well.

1119
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,490
I think he could be a good partner,

1120
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,040
but after some discussion,

1121
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,800
and since I've just joined the industry,

1122
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,680
I want to gain more experience
and prepare myself

1123
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,170
before I'm ready.

1124
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,200
So, I chose to be
with the teddy bear for now.

1125
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
That's pretty cute.

1126
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,080
Mm, right?

1127
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
Is that it?

1128
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,080
- Oh, Wave.
- Hello.

1129
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,210
How was it?

1130
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,800
Why the sad face?

1131
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
What?

1132
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
He's confused.

1133
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,720
I'm not sobbing.

1134
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,200
It's pretty refreshing, actually.

1135
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,240
To be honest,

1136
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,880
I do want a partner,

1137
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,080
but if we don't click that much,

1138
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,000
I won't rush it.

1139
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,000
I want to find someone
who truly makes me happy,

1140
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,520
and joining this show

1141
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,320
helped me realize what kind of person
I feel comfortable around.

1142
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
I would say...

1143
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,490
someone who's squeezable

1144
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,600
and easily irritated.

1145
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,400
And I also like someone...

1146
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,480
who is cute

1147
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,760
and talks nicely.

1148
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,640
Even though I didn't find a partner,

1149
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,530
this helped me realize
the kind of person I want by my side.

1150
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,040
Those are one for each of us, right?

1151
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,040
I think so.

1152
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,080
What...

1153
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,640
Oh, I thought you two were partners.

1154
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,040
- 'cause you were in this room together.
- Whoa...

1155
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,880
Whoa, Wave.

1156
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,760
Come on, there are still chances.

1157
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,840
You'll find one.

1158
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,040
No need to rush.

1159
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,880
Stay with the teddy bear.
He gives warm hugs.

1160
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:02,840
You're right.

1161
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,400
We're the No-Partner Gang.

1162
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,400
- We choose ourselves.
- There.

1163
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,040
Loving yourself never hurts.

1164
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,960
- Right?
- Mm.

1165
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,760
Don't regret not choosing me.

1166
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,960
Who is that directed at?

1167
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,160
Love that.

1168
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,520
- But you didn't choose them, either.
- Right.

1169
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,360
You chose yourself.

1170
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,440
Come on, let's go.

1171
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,560
Yeah, come on.

1172
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,040
Let's go, Wave.

1173
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,080
When I walked over there,

1174
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
I didn't see any teddy bears.

1175
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,800
Still, I was a little worried

1176
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,160
that the staff might show up with one.

1177
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,480
I'm still hoping Fifa

1178
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,560
will put my name in that letterbox.

1179
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,080
Oh, hello.

1180
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,240
- Hello.
- How long have you been waiting?

1181
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,920
- Pardon?
- How long have you been waiting?

1182
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,680
I just got here.

1183
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,840
What...

1184
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,160
I chose you, Fifa.

1185
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,320
I also chose you.

1186
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,160
For real?

1187
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,360
Look at me when you're talking.

1188
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,520
You're right.

1189
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,760
Come on, say it.

1190
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,080
I also chose you.

1191
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,200
Okay.

1192
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,960
- But why...
- It's really hot today, isn't it?

1193
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,080
You're right. How's your back doing?

1194
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,600
The sun's shining directly on it.

1195
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,160
Yeah, my back feels really hot.

1196
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,040
Let me block it.

1197
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,120
Does that help?

1198
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,440
No, you don't have to.

1199
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,960
Then I'll block it with my whole body.

1200
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,960
Okay, okay.

1201
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Wait a sec...

1202
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,320
Aren't you gonna be hot that way?

1203
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,200
Should we get inside, then?

1204
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,360
It's fine. We can stay here.

1205
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,800
There are too many people inside.

1206
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,720
What?

1207
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,680
- What?
- What?

1208
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,280
- So you don't want to be with me now?
- I do, I do.

1209
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:10,920
What...

1210
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,520
There are just a few hours left
until the decision.

1211
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,640
Do you have anyone in mind?

1212
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,360
What...

1213
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,240
I'm just making sure
in case you change your mind.

1214
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
I don't have anyone in mind.

1215
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,360
Whoa, hey...

1216
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,680
Why is that?

1217
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,720
Because he's not just in my mind.
He's right next to me.

1218
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,320
Time out. I'm blushing.

1219
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,840
Fifa...

1220
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,720
What?

1221
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,760
- You caught me off guard.
- I'm just being honest.

1222
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,880
Right.

1223
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,160
Or do you want me to choose someone else
who isn't by my side right now?

1224
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,680
- Wait, please stay with someone here.
- Right.

1225
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,720
So, why did you choose me?

1226
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,520
Well...

1227
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,080
I just feel

1228
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,280
so at ease,

1229
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,640
like, really,

1230
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,520
- when I'm with you.
- Mm.

1231
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,280
You always take care of me,

1232
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:19,760
and I can really see how determined you are
when you're working or on a mission.

1233
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,800
So I think if we work together,

1234
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,560
it'll go well.

1235
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,140
Yeah.

1236
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,760
I'm blushing a little.

1237
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,520
Huh?

1238
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,560
Wanna sit?

1239
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,920
- Okay, fine.
- Let's sit.

1240
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,560
We have confidence in each other.

1241
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,680
Did you think I would come?

1242
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,160
I was crossing my fingers.

1243
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,360
For?

1244
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,000
I guess so, if that someone were you?

1245
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,920
I was just checking to see
if anyone was coming my way.

1246
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,760
I'm here now.

1247
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,600
Yeah, I'm happy.

1248
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,640
It's official.

1249
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,480
Whoa...

1250
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,360
From now on,

1251
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,280
things are gonna change.

1252
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,720
I'm so delighted

1253
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,360
- Right.
- to have you as my first partner,

1254
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:24,940
and I hope you're the only one who...

1255
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,120
- Who?
- who...

1256
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,320
- Who?
- who will ever get to be my partner.

1257
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,280
Sadhu.

1258
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,280
I hope I can take good care of you,

1259
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,060
- and that you'll like it.
- Right.

1260
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,760
We'll take care of each other.

1261
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,560
I will take care of him

1262
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,200
and make sure he's happy.

1263
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:50,090
We promised to take good care
of each other all the way.

1264
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,960
Inhale, exhale.

1265
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,120
Don't look at me too much.
I'm blushing.

1266
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,000
What...

1267
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,100
First of all, thank you,
'DMD Friendship the Reality.'

1268
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,640
Without the show,
I wouldn't have gotten the chance to meet Gen 5,

1269
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,760
meet my friends,

1270
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,800
have a best friend like Pung,

1271
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,320
or even have a partner like Fifa.

1272
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,520
I'm really thankful for the show

1273
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,360
for giving me the chance
to make it all happen.

1274
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,720
At this point in the show,
I hope it entertains you,

1275
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,760
confuses you,

1276
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,160
stresses you out,

1277
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,200
and makes you happy.

1278
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,320
I think that's all you need.

1279
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,050
After this, please help support
Copper and me.

1280
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,760
Please give us lots of love.

1281
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Thank you.

1282
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,680
Bye-bye.

1283
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,960
- Bye-bye.
- Mm.

1284
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,240
Teddy bears give warm hugs,

1285
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,640
probably better ones,

1286
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,400
since you don't have to worry
about anyone running away.

1287
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,040
I can hug bears any time I want.

1288
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,600
Today, I got a teddy bear
and a letter from Otto.

1289
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:44,520
After this, I might find someone else

1290
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,040
outside of Gen 5.

1291
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,400
I might get to know them
and spend time with them.

1292
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,960
That sounds good.

1293
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,290
I've had all kinds of experiences,

1294
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,840
acting, singing,

1295
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,880
and being on camera,

1296
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,170
and they've all been really useful skills.

1297
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,820
I'll keep improving

1298
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:21,040
and doing my best, and I really want to
thank our company for giving me this chance.

1299
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,560
Please help support me.

1300
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,960
How are you?

1301
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,880
Well...

1302
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,890
I'm not a solo artist anymore.

1303
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,480
Well, you're part of a duo now.

1304
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,480
I was waiting for a long time,

1305
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,320
so I thought something
must have been wrong.

1306
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,080
Maybe the staff was tricking me
or something,

1307
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,440
but that's not what happened.

1308
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,360
I'm happy this day is finally here,

1309
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,480
and I've made my decision
[Boreal]

1310
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,400
just like I planned.

1311
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,600
I feel so amazing and happy

1312
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:34,760
that I've found someone
to walk this long path with me.

1313
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,840
So...

1314
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,280
I actually want to thank you, Otto,

1315
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:49,240
for trusting me
to help you reach your dream.

1316
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,160
I'm also happy.

1317
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,160
And...

1318
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
I'll also make your dream come true.

1319
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,560
I asked him
if he still wanted to be an artist,

1320
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,040
and he said that he did

1321
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,120
because he likes singing and dancing.

1322
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,400
Wherever he wants to go, I'll follow.

1323
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,680
Even if it's something I can't do,
I'll try my best to achieve it.

1324
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,960
I want him to trust that I can do it,

1325
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,600
and I really will.

1326
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,090
I'm not changing because of you, Otto,

1327
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,560
I'm changing for you.

1328
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,040
We used to talk about our dreams.

1329
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,960
So, yeah,

1330
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:41,820
he told me that he'd take me to my dream,

1331
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,320
and I was so happy to hear that.

1332
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,440
Whatever dreams
or goals North may have,

1333
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,520
I'll make them come true

1334
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,400
for him, too.

1335
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,360
Pinky promise.

1336
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,080
Mm.

1337
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,360
Let's go meet up with the boys.

1338
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,440
Let's go.

1339
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,640
I don't think we need to guess
whether the last two will be alone.

1340
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,640
There they are.

1341
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,480
How romantic.

1342
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,520
That's a big teddy bear you've got.

1343
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,680
Love is in the air.

1344
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,960
Oh, there are some marshmallows.

1345
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,000
Be sulky, you two.

1346
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Excuse me, coming through.

1347
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,840
- What are you doing?
- It's hot.

1348
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,160
It takes too long.

1349
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,920
Want some marshmallows?

1350
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,260
- Do you?
- I already ate some.

1351
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,280
Where's your stick, then?

1352
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,520
Two, three!

1353
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,200
The determination you want to
show us and everyone else,

1354
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,800
about what it took for you guys
to be together,

1355
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,000
don't forget it.

1356
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,359
Whatever happens,
remember what happened today.
