1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
If I can't decide,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,600
can I go out with both of them?

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,120
I hesitated.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,880
It'll help you grow

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,400
even more than having a partner.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm not a puppy you want, am I?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,320
The one I want to have dinner with...

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,040
Phupha.

9
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,760
- Sit down.
- Whoa, this is amazing.

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
True.

11
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,440
Who ordered these?

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
I think the staff did.

13
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,960
These are all on me, though. My treat.

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
All of these?

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Thank you.

16
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,200
Why do you think Namping chose us?

17
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,600
I think...

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
he probably saw that

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,960
we barely talk, even though
we've known each other for a while,

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,820
since we're the only two people
from Gen 4.

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,360
Ah...

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Though...

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
don't think too much
about last night's conversation.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
Not at all.

25
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm chill.

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right, and take your time,

27
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
alright?

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm taking my time.

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
No matter what happens,

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,720
I'm locked onto you now.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
You what?

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,079
I'm locked onto you now.

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Well, not exactly.

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
It's just...

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,920
Not anymore?

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Alright, I am.

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
That was a fast change of heart.

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,040
Change of heart?

39
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,160
I've always been locked onto you.

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,820
Unlike someone here.

41
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,840
Didn't you just tell me to take my time?

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,480
Oh, right, take your time.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
It's fine.

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Just kidding, just kidding.

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
No napkins for you.

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Hey...

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,960
But don't you have backup choices?

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
I just think that

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
I'd rather follow my heart

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,680
and do my best.

51
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
Then, I'll see how it pans out

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,440
as the future approaches.

53
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,240
It's actually nice
to be back on the show.

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,280
The only time we talked

55
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,720
was when we went to events with the boys.

56
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,560
- Mm.
- This way...

57
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,700
we get to spend more time together.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
At least, we got to meet all day.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,280
But you... You barely talked to me.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,520
What made you think that?

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,200
Huh...

62
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
I mean it.

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,560
I barely talked to you?

64
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,760
Then, I'll talk to you so much

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,920
that you get bored with my face, okay?

66
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,400
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm digging in.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
What are you eyeing, Otto?

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,800
I love shrimp.

70
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
Then, they're all yours.

71
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Really?

72
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,480
- Mm.
- What do you like, then?

73
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,240
I love salmon and...

74
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,080
its roe.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Go for it.

76
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
Thank you.

77
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,400
- Is it good?
- It's pretty good.

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
It's out of your reach;
let me get it for you.

79
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,600
- There.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,800
Here you go.

81
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,640
So, why did you choose me, Otto?

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Well...

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,640
After the singing session last time,

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,640
I thought that, afterward,

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
I wanted to have a meal with you

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,640
so that we could
get to know each other more.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,520
But you weren't there.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,640
So, are you more of a leader
or a follower?

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,720
I don't feel like

90
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
- I have to be a leader all the time.
- Mm.

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,200
Better pitch in efforts.

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,120
Yes, exactly.

93
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,960
Maybe I'd be better off as a follower

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,360
in something I'm not too skilled at.

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm just adapting to the flow.

96
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,920
That probably makes my life easier.

97
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Yeah, we won't get too tired

98
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,320
- of always leading.
- True.

99
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,200
It's quite a lot of pressure, too.

100
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
- Mm.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,680
I think a team effort is the way to go.

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,520
What's your type, Otto?

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,440
What kind of person do you like...

104
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,440
personality and appearance-wise?

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,400
I like people
with a good sense of humor and eloquence,

106
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
someone I can have
fun conversations with.

107
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,960
Appearance-wise,

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I like someone who's a little taller.

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't mind it, actually,

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,920
as long as they give me peace of mind
and we can laugh together

111
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,720
because I tend to be a yapper.

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,520
After getting closer, you'll see
that I'm funny.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm quite a yapper myself.

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Do you like someone with Korean vibes
or those with rugged features?

115
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
It depends.

116
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,440
I just...

117
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,640
If I like someone, then I like them.

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,120
It's not about how they look.

119
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
So you're open to all types.

120
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,640
Mm.

121
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,240
Good morning, artists.

122
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,480
This morning,
please pack all your belongings...

123
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
That's a future me problem.

124
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,800
To travel to Friendship Villa,

125
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,680
the destination for our next mission,

126
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,320
and the final stop
before you choose your partner.

127
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,440
Go lie on someone else.

128
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,000
You're doing that again.
It's time to take a shower.

129
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
- True.
- Yeah, yeah.

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
- Whoa...
- He's falling out of bed.

131
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,919
He's falling, he's falling.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,000
We gotta get a move on.

133
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,360
Let's play Rock-paper-scissors.

134
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
- Rock-paper-scissors, shoot.
- Shoot.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

136
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
- Can't we do best out of three?
- Chop-chop.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,160
Come on.

138
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,440
Whoa, that's a massive house.

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
Hey, there's a duck pedal boat.

140
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,800
I could really use a bicycle ride now.

141
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,400
That's so pretty.

142
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,120
Pung, there it is.

143
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,640
Ducky.

144
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,960
Come on, let's dive.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
- I used to play with that.
- Let's go for a dip.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
Nobody sleeps here, right?

147
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh, look at this view.

148
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
- I'd harvest the rice in those fields.
- Those birds, look at them go.

149
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
Pung, where do you think you're going?

150
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
What are you doing?

151
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,000
You get good mountain scenery here.

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,680
Wave, do you even know
how to ride a bicycle?

153
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,980
I do.

154
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,520
Whoa...

155
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,800
Whoa, man!

156
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,360
- Pick up the pace.
- Jeez, you're moving too slow.

157
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,040
- Hello.
- Hello, James.

158
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,040
Hi, hi.

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,240
Hi, I'm Pat.

160
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

161
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Hi.

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,600
Never mind him. Hello.

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,680
Hi, hi.

164
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,160
Hi, I'm James.

165
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,480
Hello, my seniors.

166
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

167
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,680
Hello, I'm James Supamongkon.

168
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm here as a Bro
for the Acting Challenge class.

169
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
Do you know
what mission you'll be taking on today?

170
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,280
- I don't.
- No.

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,360
- A dancing one?
- Right.

172
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Oh...a dancing challenge?

173
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,320
- There's none of that?
- Oh, it's not dancing?

174
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,520
- Modeling in rice fields over there?
- A rice field runway?

175
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
That's so traditionally beautiful.

176
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,720
- Maybe not.
- Maybe not?

177
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
Look at how hot it is now.

178
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,840
Okay, our mission today is

179
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,280
'Acting Challenge.'

180
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
That's right.

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,480
To be honest,
acting is an essential foundation

182
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,160
since you will eventually become actors.

183
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,400
I'll put you guys in pairs.

184
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
So right now, we have...

185
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
- How many people...
- 11 people.

186
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,520
There are 11 of you guys,

187
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
so that leaves you
with one without a pair.

188
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,040
That one person will have the privilege
of choosing two people to act with.

189
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,280
That's right.

190
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
But before we proceed,

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
please pick up a pen
and a piece of paper lying before me.

192
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,760
One piece of paper and one pen each.

193
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,840
Do we write a name?

194
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,040
I want you guys to guess a number
that I have in mind

195
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
from 1-100.

196
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,080
- Whoa...
- Whoa!

197
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,040
- Sounds easy enough.
- To 100.

198
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,640
Don't show it to your friends.

199
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
Alright, since you're all done,

200
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,000
the number that I have in mind is...

201
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,530
- Is?
- Is...

202
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,160
11.

203
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,480
- Whoa...
- Whoa!

204
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,060
- That's so far off.
- 11.

205
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,520
Alright, could you guys show me
the numbers you wrote down?

206
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,040
Okay, now that the numbers are revealed,

207
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,520
I'd like to warn you,

208
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,650
and do mark my words,

209
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,880
to make a careful decision.

210
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,880
If you're hesitating,
you can use the privilege

211
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,440
to act with two of your friends.

212
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
For those of you
who've made the decision,

213
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,440
you can skip the privilege.

214
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,920
The winners of this challenge

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,440
will be rewarded
with tonight's luxurious dinner.

216
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,040
That's right.

217
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,360
There's more.

218
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
After the dinner,

219
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,000
there will be a private room
in this villa for that pair.

220
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Yes.

221
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
Come on.

222
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,160
Let's start with Wave.

223
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Yes.

224
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
Would you like
to use the privilege I mentioned?

225
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,080
No, thank you.

226
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,520
Then, who do you choose?

227
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
Pete.

228
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,320
Okay.

229
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,920
I chose Pete because...

230
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
I barely get to talk to him.

231
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,640
I didn't think Wave would choose me.

232
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,440
I thought
he had someone in mind at first.

233
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,720
But after he did, I was like...

234
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,920
Maybe he wanted to act with me

235
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,400
and test our chemistry?

236
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,600
Next, Pung.

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,720
Yes.

238
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
Would you like the privilege?

239
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
I would not.

240
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
Then, who'd you like to choose?

241
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,880
I'll go with

242
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,120
Copper.

243
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,320
Since we are close to some extent,

244
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,160
I thought we might share
similar viewpoints.

245
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
North.

246
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,280
- Yes?
- Do you want to choose 2 members?

247
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
No.

248
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,080
Then who do you want to act with?

249
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Otto.

250
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
Otto?

251
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,720
I already figured that
if it was a paired mission,

252
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,240
I'd probably choose Otto.

253
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
Copper.

254
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Okay.

255
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,000
Pung chose you, right?

256
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,760
Yes, he did.

257
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you want to choose another member?

258
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,360
Yes, I do.

259
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,800
If so,

260
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,840
who do you want to act with?

261
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,560
I'd like to act with Fifa.

262
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Okay.

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,280
First of all,
I decided to use this privilege

264
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
to pick Fifa to join me

265
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,840
because I was torn
between Pung and Fifa,

266
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,240
so I figured this activity
would help me make the decision

267
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,760
and give me more clarity.

268
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,280
If I didn't get to act with Copper,

269
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,080
I honestly can't imagine
who I'd act with.

270
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,400
Next up, Otto.

271
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
You were chosen by North.

272
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,240
And you can no longer
choose 2 members

273
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,080
since Copper already used that privilege.

274
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,480
Pete, you were chosen by Wave.

275
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,760
So, you can't use the privilege, either.

276
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Next up, Phupha.

277
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,930
Who do you want to act with?

278
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
Can I act with you?

279
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
- With me?
- Whoa...

280
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,080
Come on.

281
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,080
Stop.

282
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
It'd be tough to play with me.

283
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,920
Oh...

284
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
I can give it a try.

285
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
This boy is something.

286
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,200
Alright, who do you want to act with?

287
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,200
I'd like to choose Porsche.

288
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,800
- Porsche?
- Yes.

289
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
You're into someone older, huh?

290
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,840
The last 2 members,

291
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,840
Ryujin and PatJi,

292
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,120
don't have any other options, so...

293
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,840
- you're acting together.
- Okay.

294
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
I was gonna choose him anyway.

295
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
What a sweet talker.

296
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Next up,

297
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,880
you'll get to choose
the dialogue for your pair.

298
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,000
And the dialogues are from
DOMUNDI successful series.

299
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,070
There are 3 of them,

300
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,760
including 'Your Sky,'

301
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,080
'The Next Prince,'

302
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,320
and...

303
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,720
'Khemjira The Series.'

304
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
Yeah.

305
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,040
However, the first person who gets to choose

306
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,400
will be the one
who chose the highest number.

307
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,520
Fifa, which one do you want?

308
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Well...

309
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
'Your Sky.'

310
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
'Your Sky.'

311
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,480
- Okay.
- Alright.

312
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,520
That means Fifa
is playing 'Your Sky' with Copper.

313
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,480
PatJi and Porsche
chose the same number, right?

314
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,000
- Do Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- Alright.

315
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
Rock, paper, scissors...

316
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

317
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
Okay.

318
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,880
- Porsche, you go first.
- You go first.

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,500
I'd choose...

320
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,920
- 'Khemjira,' by Keng and Namping.
- 'Khemjira The Series.'

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,960
Alright, PatJi, which one do you want?

322
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
What?

323
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,760
'The Next Prince.'

324
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
We'd go for 'The Next Prince.'

325
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,520
Pete, which one do you want?

326
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,000
I'd go with 'Your Sky.'

327
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,520
Alright.

328
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,840
Okay, now we only
have dialogues from 2 series,

329
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,160
'The Next Prince' and 'Khemjira.'

330
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
Otto, which one would you choose?

331
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,800
I'd choose 'Khemjira.'

332
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,880
- 'Khemjira The Series.'
- Thank you.

333
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,640
Coming to the last pair,
we've only got one dialogue left

334
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,360
from 'The Next Prince.'

335
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,360
Pung, you'll be playing this with Copper.

336
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,280
- Wow, you've got 2, huh?
- Yeah.

337
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
Now, I'll give you some time to practice,

338
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,000
so you'll be ready
for the afternoon performance.

339
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,360
Wishing you all the best.

340
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,720
- Thank you, James.
- Thank you.

341
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,880
Alright,

342
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,240
before we begin the Acting Challenge,

343
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,200
I'd like to introduce
the judges for today's mission.

344
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,120
First up is the acting coach
who's been teaching the DOMUNDI members

345
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,120
for almost every generation.

346
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,120
Please welcome Instructor Kla Nathawat.

347
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm Kla Nathawat, a director.

348
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,560
My previous projects are
'Your Sky' and 'Zomvivor.'

349
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,040
And an upcoming one titled
'Duang With You.'

350
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,160
- Hello.
- Hi.

351
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Hi, I have a question.

352
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
Am I pretty?

353
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,600
- Absolutely.
- You're the prettiest.

354
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,840
The next judge is an actress

355
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,400
with a lot of
professional experience in acting.

356
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,520
Please welcome Praew Narupornkamol.

357
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

358
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,120
Hello, I'm Praew Narupornkamol.

359
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,380
I'm here as a guest

360
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,080
and also as a judge
for the acting mission.

361
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,240
I hope you give it your all
'cause I'll be watching.

362
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,200
I want to see a new generation
that's fresh, new, bold, and wild.

363
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,040
And they need to be unique.

364
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,960
Something that impresses me.

365
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm nervous. There are a lot of them.

366
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,800
We have one more judge.

367
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
He's very talented.

368
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,840
He can sing, dance...

369
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,040
But can he act?

370
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,600
Yeah, he can.

371
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,480
He can act, too.

372
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,640
And he is...

373
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,840
James Supamongkon.

374
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,280
- Hello.
- Wow.

375
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,560
I hope you will give a warm welcome
to this judge.

376
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,880
You can expect honest, direct comments

377
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,120
and clear-cut judging...

378
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
from me.

379
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,800
Since James has made it clear

380
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,520
that he can sing, dance, and act,

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,680
who wants to see him
give a demonstration?

382
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,240
- I do.
- I do, James.

383
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,800
And who wants to do that with James?
Show me your hand.

384
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
It's getting fun.

385
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,400
Let's do this.

386
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,920
- Ones-and-twos?
- Okay, then.

387
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
- Ones-and-twos...
- Ones-and-twos...

388
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
- Oh...
- Hey...

389
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,720
- Can't be two.
- No.

390
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
Do it again.

391
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,040
- Ones-and-twos...
- Ones-and-twos...

392
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
Here we go.

393
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

394
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,080
Why did you hug him?

395
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Alright, let's give James and Phupha
some time to prepare.

396
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,000
Go get your dialogue
and come back to perform, okay?

397
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,680
For the others,
we'll be talking about your acting.

398
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,320
- Alright, let's get your dialogue.
- Let's go.

399
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,520
James, I know you're talented.

400
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,840
10 minutes, alright?

401
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,680
Okay, I guess.

402
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,680
If you're ready,

403
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,560
you may start acting in...

404
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
3,

405
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
2,

406
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
1...

407
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,560
Action.

408
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Master?

409
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,800
Am I your master again now?

410
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,360
Please don't go, Khem.

412
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,240
Be with me.

413
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
But...

414
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,440
Grandma Si,

415
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,400
Thong,

416
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
and even Ake...

417
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,120
Everyone you loved is gone
because of me.

418
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,840
Grandma Si's time had just come.

419
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,000
And Thong and Ake...

420
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,640
were meant to be reborn long ago.

421
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,640
I was making them stay.

422
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560
No, Master.

423
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,080
It's my fault.

424
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,860
I have no one left, Khem.

425
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,440
Please stay with me.

426
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,160
I have no one now.

427
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Please let me go, Master.

428
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay, cut.

429
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,320
Alright, after seeing the demonstration,

430
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
I believe you'll be able to pull this off.

431
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,560
Let the Acting Challenge begin.

432
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
Pete and Wave.

433
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Ready?

434
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
3,

435
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
2,

436
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
1,

437
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,120
and action.

438
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Are you alright?

439
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Wait...

440
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,440
Oh, you're so mean...

441
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
and rude.

442
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,320
You made me drunk.

443
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,760
I'm drunk.

444
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,700
Wait...

445
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,040
Dad...

446
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,120
Dad, my head aches.

447
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,760
Can you give me a kiss on the head?

448
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,600
Kiss me on the head, please.

449
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,120
Mom...

450
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,080
Dad won't kiss me on the head.

451
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
Kiss me on the head.

452
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Please.

453
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,880
Do it.

454
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,000
Kiss me on the head.

455
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,080
I did.

456
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,600
Yay.

457
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,320
You finally kissed me on the head, Dad.

458
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
Let's go inside.

459
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,440
Which way?

460
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
- You sure?
- Yeah.

461
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,960
Come on, get in the house.

462
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Is this my house?

463
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,120
Is it?

464
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,180
I don't think so.

465
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,320
Is it this one?

466
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,120
Come here.

467
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,400
Hey...

468
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,600
I don't think this one is, either.

469
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,120
Which one is it, then?

470
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,160
Why are you taking me to the fence?

471
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,000
Get in the house.

472
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,000
Look.

473
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,240
Cut.

474
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,680
Thank you so much, Pete and Wave.

475
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,560
You may now take a break.

476
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

477
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,920
Why would you be?

478
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
- We were enjoying it.
- It was funny.

479
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,080
It actually was.

480
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,760
You're probably thinking that

481
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,400
there was not much dialogue,

482
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,680
but it was actually about
syncing with Wave's energy

483
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
since he's my partner.

484
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,560
I had to express myself
without speaking,

485
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,920
and I personally found that...

486
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,760
pretty challenging.

487
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,320
I was really nervous before performing,

488
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
partly because it was for this program.

489
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,960
But once I started,

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,640
I felt happy the whole time.

491
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,680
- I liked Wave.
- Very much.

492
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,000
- So did I.
- He was cute.

493
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,360
You could clearly see
how Wave designed his character.

494
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
His approach is different from the others.

495
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,800
His gestures looked sweet and adorable.

496
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah, I feel that all the choices he made

497
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,840
and the movements were spot-on.

498
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,120
Very cute and lovable.

499
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,200
But Pete was actually...

500
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,440
stunned at the beginning.

501
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
- Right, because...
- Yeah.

502
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,000
- But he kept going.
- He had to.

503
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,240
They kept going.

504
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,200
Copper and Fifa, are you ready?

505
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

506
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,200
I don't think my role is that easy.

507
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,960
Because most of the dialogue is mine.

508
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,240
And I'll have to be drunk, too.

509
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm playing 'Muenfah,'

510
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,600
and he barely speaks.

511
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,960
The challenge is about
how well I can react to my partner.

512
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,240
3, 2, 1, and action.

513
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, you're so mean

514
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,800
and rude.

515
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,520
You made me drunk.

516
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,640
I'm drunk.

517
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,120
Dad...

518
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,200
My head aches.

519
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Can you give me a kiss on the head, Dad?

520
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,760
Mom,

521
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
Dad won't kiss me on the head.

522
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,960
Dad only loves Babe.

523
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
He doesn't even kiss me on the head.

524
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,360
Kiss me on the head.

525
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,560
Please give me a kiss on the head.

526
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,640
Please.

527
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Kiss me on the head.

528
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Give me a kiss on the head.

529
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
I did.

530
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Yay!

531
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,840
You finally kissed me on the head, Dad!

532
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,960
Can I have one more kiss?

533
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,680
Kiss me on the head.

534
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,840
Give me a kiss on the head.

535
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,840
Just one more kiss.

536
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,040
Get inside.

537
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
Come on.

538
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,640
Are you okay?

539
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
Cut.

540
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,640
Thank you.

541
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,880
- Thank you.
- Come on.

542
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,720
This way.

543
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,880
Copper and Fifa do have some chemistry,

544
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,240
and there were moments
when their timing just clicked.

545
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,880
But I felt there were moments
that could have been pushed further.

546
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,280
When both were confident
in expressing themselves,

547
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,560
it turned out that
they couldn't receive everything.

548
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,560
- So I feel like...
- Yeah.

549
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,960
once they get more in sync,
it should turn out much better.

550
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,200
Ryujin and PatJi, are you ready?

551
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,570
- Yes.
- Yes.

552
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,360
There are royal honorifics,

553
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,080
character work,

554
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,960
and a lot of different aspects.

555
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,200
With so little time to practice,

556
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,240
making the lines feel natural

557
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,120
is really hard.

558
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
3, 2, 1, and action.

559
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
Your Royal Highness,

560
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,920
why are you here?

561
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,000
I came to...

562
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
look around

563
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,200
and learn.

564
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Why aren't you at the palace with me?

565
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,040
Why do you have to be here?

566
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,480
You didn't answer any of my texts.

567
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,160
I'm a professor,

568
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,120
and I have been ordered by His Majesty

569
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,920
to look after the prince
from the neighboring country.

570
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Where is he, then?

571
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Where's the prince?

572
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,560
You were with Paytai, weren't you?

573
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,280
Mr. Paytai is a student
in my special class.

574
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,360
That's why you don't have time.

575
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,040
I was merely doing my duty.

576
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,920
What about your duty to protect me,
take care of me,

577
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,280
and remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins?

578
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,160
What about the vow you made?

579
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
You don't remember it now?

580
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Fine.

581
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,200
Your hand.

582
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,160
I don't think that's appropriate,
Your Royal Highness.

583
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
Are you going to disobey my order again?

584
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,360
This hand.

585
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,560
If you don't come see me
at the palace every day,

586
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,520
I'll post this
and let the whole world know

587
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,120
what we are.

588
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
And what are we,

589
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,120
Your Royal Highness?

590
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Well...

591
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
The answer...

592
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,760
might be at the palace.

593
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,640
From now on, you should come every day.

594
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

595
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
Cut.

596
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,720
Thank you so much, Ryujin, PatJi.

597
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,360
You may take a break now.

598
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,960
Today...

599
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,560
I didn't do as well as I should have.

600
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,600
I feel a bit disappointed,

601
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,650
like...

602
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I could've done better.

603
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,120
They had the same issue
with the dialogue.

604
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,040
Maybe it's because of their age,
so the lines didn't feel natural for them to say.

605
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,320
- Yeah, they're too young.
- Right?

606
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,520
PatJi struggled at first,

607
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,360
but he came back strong.

608
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
Ryujin was also very good

609
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,000
when he was relaxed.

610
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,720
Once relaxed, almost everyone did well.

611
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
They already have the talent,

612
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,240
but sometimes they're just a bit too tense.

613
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,880
Alright, Pung and Copper, are you ready?

614
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,680
I just feel that I should
do my best in my own way.

615
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,720
Before I got there,
I gave myself a pep talk.

616
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,000
That's all there was.

617
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,680
Still, I was anxious anyway.

618
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,660
Three, two, one, action.

619
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,480
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

620
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,960
I came to...

621
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,080
look around

622
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
and learn.

623
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,320
Why aren't you at the palace with me?

624
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,760
Why do you have to be here?

625
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,840
You didn't answer any of my texts.

626
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm a professor,

627
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
and I have been ordered by...

628
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
By who?

629
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,800
By His Majesty

630
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,360
to look after the prince
from the neighboring country.

631
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,240
Where is he, then?

632
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,480
You were with Paytai, weren't you?

633
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,639
Mr. Paytai is a student
in my special class.

634
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
That's why you don't have time?

635
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,600
I was merely doing my duty.

636
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,400
What about your duty to protect me,

637
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
take care of me,

638
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,800
and protect and remain loyal

639
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,800
to the Assavadevathins?

640
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,920
I, Khanin,

641
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
command you, Charan,

642
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,760
to reside in the palace every day
as my royal guard.

643
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,880
Did I make myself clear?

644
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,239
But I just informed you
that it was an order...

645
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Mr. Charan,

646
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,320
my statement wasn't a request,

647
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,320
but an order.

648
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,520
Should this be what makes you content,

649
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,480
I wouldn't dare disobey.

650
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,760
Very well.

651
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,960
If there's nothing further,

652
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,320
please excuse me.

653
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,840
Cut.

654
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,760
Good job, Pung.

655
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,960
Amazing, amazing job.

656
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,200
It seemed that
I had put so much pressure on myself

657
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,040
that things didn't come out
as great as they were supposed to.

658
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,400
Thank you.

659
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,200
Great job.

660
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,160
It was such a hard script,

661
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,160
not to mention the royal honorifics.

662
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
That was probably quite a struggle.

663
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,480
Though I could still sense
a smooth delivery.

664
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,280
As for Copper's problem-solving,

665
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,200
- Yes, Copper...
- he was good at thinking on his feet.

666
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,960
Okay, Phupha, Porsche, are you ready?

667
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Three, two, one, action.

668
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Master?

669
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,320
Am I your master again now?

670
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,440
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,650
I...

672
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
Please don't go, Khem.

673
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,040
Be with me.

674
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,760
But Grandma Si,

675
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Thong...

676
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,460
and even Ake...

677
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920
Everyone you loved

678
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,720
is gone because of me.

679
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,920
Grandma Si's time had just come.

680
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,000
And Thong and Ake...

681
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,520
were meant to be reborn long ago.

682
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,240
I was making them stay.

683
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
That's not true.

684
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,960
It's me.

685
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,840
It's my fault.

686
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,760
You know it's not true, Khem.

687
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,280
It's not your fault at all.

688
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,720
But I don't think
I can face anyone anymore.

689
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,880
I have no one left, Khem.

690
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,960
But if I stay...

691
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,080
the next one to go

692
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,040
will probably be you.

693
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,680
I'll be fine, Khem.

694
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,560
Peem...

695
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,360
I have no one left, Khem.

696
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,240
No one...

697
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
If you were to die
because of me...

698
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,520
would you still choose this?

699
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,080
If I had to die because of you,

700
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,200
I'd be happy to.

701
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,200
I don't want to be
the reason anyone is gone.

702
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,680
That won't happen anymore, Khem.

703
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,240
What did I ever do?

704
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Why does my existence

705
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,160
cost innocent people their lives?

706
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,640
It's not because of you at all.

707
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,880
Don't say such things about yourself.

708
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,800
Peem...

709
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,080
It's not your fault at all.

710
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,120
Cut.

711
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,920
Thank you, Phupha and Porsche.

712
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,520
Please, you can take some rest now.

713
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,120
I'd say that this is probably
not my expertise just yet.

714
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,320
Whatever he delivered,

715
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,120
I tried to respond

716
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,080
and deliver back as much as I could.

717
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,760
I feel like it wasn't my best,

718
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,440
but it was the best
I could do, nonetheless.

719
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,360
It wasn't 100%,

720
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,480
but in the end,
things turned out the best they could.

721
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,200
I gave my all in every challenge.

722
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,800
No matter how it plays out...

723
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
I'll be okay.

724
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,600
Onto Phupha and Porsche.

725
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,120
I think it's missing something.

726
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
For me, it's about
climbing up the scale.

727
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,360
- I see that Porsche did some research.
- Mm.

728
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,200
I think he's learned
some intensive background of his role.

729
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,160
He had clear directions
in his head and a great pace.

730
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,160
It's just that Phupha
didn't have time to grasp it.

731
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,560
There were some missed back-and-forths

732
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,080
- because of his lack of experience.
- It's a matter of experience, for sure.

733
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,400
- Porsche seems to have some of it.
- Yes.

734
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,720
Though he tried to catch up.

735
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
He didn't just freeze
due to struggles.

736
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,320
He still persevered.

737
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Alright, next up,
we have North and Otto.

738
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,560
Three, two, one,

739
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,040
action.

740
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Master?

741
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,800
Am I your master again now?

742
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,920
I...

743
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,400
Please don't go, Khem.

745
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Be with me.

746
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,920
But Grandma Si,

747
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
Thong...

748
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
and even Ake...

749
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,230
Everyone you loved

750
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,640
is gone because of me.

751
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
Grandma Si's time...

752
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,680
had just come.

753
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
And Thong and Ake...

754
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,640
were meant to be reborn long ago.

755
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,000
I was the one

756
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,780
making them stay.

757
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
No,

758
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,400
that's not true.

759
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,800
It's me.

760
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,680
It's my fault.

761
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
You know very well, Khem,

762
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,520
that it's not like that.

763
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,600
I don't think I can face anyone anymore.

764
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,440
But I have no one left, Khem.

765
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,080
Can you please stay with me?

766
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,960
What if I stay

767
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,440
and lose you?

768
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,040
That doesn't scare me.

769
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,120
Can you give me a chance?

770
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,600
Please?

771
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,930
Please don't leave me again.

772
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,520
I'm not going anywhere.

773
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,000
Cut.

774
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,880
Thank you very much, North and Otto.

775
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,880
Everything happened so fast.

776
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,140
After he said action...

777
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,040
Done.

778
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,120
At that moment,
I was so nervous that my heart pounded,

779
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,960
but I still went along with the script

780
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,640
and did my very best.

781
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.

782
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,880
I'm pretty satisfied with the result,

783
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,560
and Otto's performance was spectacular.

784
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,000
He brought out
every ounce of his emotions.

785
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,400
Let's talk about North and Otto.

786
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,760
It wasn't all perfect,

787
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,240
but as I watched them perform,
I got really invested

788
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,200
and couldn't help but follow
their storytelling.

789
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,160
They took it up step by step,

790
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,320
both of them, climbing up...

791
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,280
- together.
- They rose together.

792
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,840
Exactly, and they tried to...

793
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,680
In some moments when Otto spoke,

794
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,600
I could really see him.

795
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,040
I really felt how guilty he felt.

796
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,080
It really showed during the improvisation
where they hugged,

797
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,360
with the camera capturing them.

798
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,760
I was wowed by that particular shot.

799
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,440
I was also wowed by the hugging scene.

800
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,920
And there was a glimpse in North's eyes
that showed just how he crushed it.

801
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,120
It was extraordinary

802
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,400
- with no words spoken.
- Mm-hm.

803
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,440
Okay,

804
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,960
that's everyone we have.

805
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,800
I've made my decision.

806
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,000
You have?

807
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Instructor Kla and James.

808
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,210
- Whoa!
- To the dinner.

809
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
- Utterly dumbfounded.
- Just kidding.

810
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,960
- Let's start over.
- What in the multiverse...

811
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,880
I'm going with this one.

812
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,080
I've decided.

813
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,040
There you have it,
the Acting Challenge session.

814
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,360
Let's hear some recaps from the judges.

815
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,960
Praew, please go first.

816
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,920
I'm certainly amazed

817
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,200
by the sights of the newborn stars

818
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,320
that will surely become shining ones.

819
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,240
I'd like to thank the show
for introducing me to them first.

820
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,520
Am I the first to see them?

821
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,600
Or did everyone already witness them?

822
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,280
- The very first ones.
- Ooh, the very first ones.

823
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,800
I've witnessed them now

824
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,240
and already chosen my bias.

825
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,410
Your bias?

826
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,560
Next, let's hear from Instructor Kla.

827
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,080
Acting is actually a form of art

828
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,000
where you need to find
joy and fun in the process.

829
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,040
I don't want you to be stressed
about something that's just beginning.

830
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,520
This is only the beginning.

831
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,440
It's not gonna end here.

832
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,000
Your acting skills will keep developing

833
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,640
all the way until the day...

834
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,920
you no longer feel like acting.

835
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,500
You know?

836
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,600
It can definitely grow to that point,

837
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,440
alright?

838
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,400
Keep going.

839
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,250
Forget about today.

840
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,240
Now, let's have James give a brief recap

841
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,720
before announcing the results.

842
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Seeing each pair perform

843
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,760
made me realize how differently
everyone uses their tools,

844
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
and it's something
that would help me improve, too.

845
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,000
And I want to tell you that

846
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,080
if you think you've made mistakes today,

847
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,160
I want you to leave them behind

848
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,280
and keep moving forward.

849
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,320
This is only a small beginning.

850
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,640
There will be
many more challenges ahead,

851
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,220
harder roles,

852
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,720
and all kinds of situations.

853
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,800
It will definitely get tougher.

854
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,720
I'm not trying to scare you,

855
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,040
but I'm reminding you that
what you're facing is not that serious.

856
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,760
Yeah.

857
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,160
I wish all of you success.

858
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,520
And lastly,
don't forget the three of us.

859
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,160
I've written your names down.

860
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,280
- Why?
- I already have.

861
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,480
When you're famous,
don't forget about us.

862
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,440
- Right.
- Keep improving yourselves, guys.

863
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,040
- That's right.
- Good luck.

864
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,480
- Well done.
- Okay.

865
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

866
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,040
So it's time, James.

867
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,320
It's time.

868
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,480
We're going to announce
the winners of the Acting Challenge now.

869
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,200
The winning pair
will get a special dinner tonight.

870
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,560
And that's not all.

871
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,440
The winners will also get to stay
in a private suite at this villa.

872
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,640
Yeah, alone.

873
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,560
No, there are two.

874
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,240
- I mean only them.
- Yeah, right.

875
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,200
- Okay.
- Not with everyone else.

876
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,400
Gosh, I'm excited.

877
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,160
It's gonna be another good day.

878
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,200
I'll be super happy.

879
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Guys,

880
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,800
the winners of this mission

881
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,630
are...

882
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,560
North and Otto.

883
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
Well done, guys.

884
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,760
They understood their characters
and made it seem real,

885
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,640
and their performance flowed smoothly.

886
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,320
That's why I think
they're the most suitable to win.

887
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,160
North has eye expressions
that convey emotions very well.

888
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,680
Otto clearly understood his role

889
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,080
and clearly did his homework.

890
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,040
I mean, he's ready for the actual work.

891
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,880
I feel like they can go really far.

892
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,240
How did we win?

893
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,000
You know...

894
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm happy, though.

895
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,480
It's just that...

896
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,040
I was kinda confused
about how it happened.

897
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,120
A bit confused.

898
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,480
I was surprised that we won,

899
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,520
but I'm also happy because...

900
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,240
we were trying so hard

901
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,800
and wanted to win this mission

902
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,440
as it's the last mission.

903
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,480
You're amazing.

904
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,360
Most importantly...

905
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,400
That's not all, huh?

906
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,360
Yeah.

907
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
We figured that
having just one award is a bit odd,

908
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,400
so we came up with another award.

909
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,160
And this award is called...

910
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,680
- MVP.
- MVP.

911
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,920
That means only one person
will win this award.

912
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,400
Only one.

913
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,760
Praew will be announcing
the winner of that.

914
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,560
Right, and the only MVP is...

915
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,320
The winner is...

916
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,400
Wave, my baby.

917
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,840
You can clearly see
and remember that this is Wave.

918
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,800
In his own version,

919
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,560
he makes you believe
that he really is the character.

920
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,520
It feels like
his way of seeing the world...

921
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,040
When he acts or views things,
he sees them as art.

922
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,840
He doesn't rely on thinking too much,

923
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,600
which makes him look calm, relaxed,

924
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,120
and uniquely charismatic.

925
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,920
I feel like I could do it.

926
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
Like...

927
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,360
I'm as good as Otto and North.

928
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,400
So I'm the MVP.

929
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,600
- Let me explain where this award comes from.
- Okay.

930
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,000
We watched all the performances,

931
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,000
but in terms of standout presence,
after everything was done

932
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,920
and we closed our eyes,

933
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,880
there was one person
we instantly remembered.

934
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,720
He really stood out,

935
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,760
and that's why.

936
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,760
It doesn't mean that Wave
was far above the rest, though.

937
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,440
- We were choosing between...
- There were others, too.

938
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,800
- Not just Wave.
- We had...

939
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,680
a few choices.

940
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,520
- It's the decision that...
- There were others, too.

941
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,920
took us pretty long to make.

942
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,520
You can choose anyone to have dinner

943
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,000
and stay overnight with.

944
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,200
In case you don't want to eat alone, though.

945
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,880
But if you wanna have dinner alone,

946
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,600
you can choose someone
to spend the night with.

947
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
Wave...

948
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,620
I...

949
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,000
Can I have dinner with everyone?

950
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,520
Cheers to North and Otto.

951
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,160
Where are they?

952
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,880
We have to thank Wave

953
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,360
- for inviting us to dinner together.
- Right.

954
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,920
Thank you so much, Wave.

955
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Thank you.

956
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,240
You all did your best, though.

957
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,200
Come on.

958
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,520
- Hey...
- Is everyone in the frame?

959
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,600
I'm Popeye, man.

960
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,160
- I am Popeye.
- One...

961
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,000
two, three...

962
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,960
- Yay.
- Yay.

963
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,960
You shouldn't talk while eating.

964
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,320
- It's not good, right?
- Yeah, you shouldn't do that.

965
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,880
- It's good.
- Ready?

966
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,560
Yes. Let's do it.

967
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,360
Wait, for real?

968
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,960
Alright, who's going to eat the big prize?

969
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,120
Who's going to?

970
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,640
Why would you eat it?

971
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,800
Spit it out.

972
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,560
How was today's mission?

973
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,720
I was freaking stressed

974
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,640
and nervous.

975
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,200
I found myself funny.

976
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,960
Why is that?

977
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,000
Did you laugh at him, Pete?

978
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,720
The moment he shouted
and called his mom,

979
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,600
- I lost it.
- Oh...

980
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,160
It was so loud.

981
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,120
I wanna see that.

982
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,440
When you were playing with James,
I almost cried.

983
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,080
- I agree.
- Like...

984
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,800
I know, right?

985
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,720
Eat first before speaking.

986
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,160
Tell us how you felt.

987
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,720
Explain in detail.

988
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,240
Step by step.

989
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,640
I was super nervous.

990
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,720
I was kind of anxious at first,

991
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,800
but when he passed the emotions on to me,
I needed to relax more.

992
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,320
He's very professional.

993
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,880
It was so hard.

994
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,360
- We need to thank our MVP, though.
- Thank you.

995
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,240
Or we wouldn't be eating here.

996
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
Without Wave...

997
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,000
Guys, let's thank our MVP.

998
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,560
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

999
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,760
Thank you.

1000
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,920
Thanks to Otto, too.

1001
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,080
Otto...

1002
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,520
- Cheers to DMD Friendship.
- Cheers to DMD Friendship.

1003
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,840
- Wow.
- Wow...

1004
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,840
Wait, what's that?

1005
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,200
Can I have the salmon?

1006
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,070
Sure.

1007
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,480
It's my first time here.

1008
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,080
Right, it's my first time
having dinner with you.

1009
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,080
I see.

1010
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,920
What?

1011
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,760
But you've been here several times.

1012
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,960
That's not true.

1013
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,120
What do you mean?

1014
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,320
Not several times.

1015
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,120
Really?

1016
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,880
Yeah.

1017
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,680
Let's eat.

1018
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,560
What are you capturing?

1019
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,560
Nothing.

1020
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,240
Let's eat.

1021
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
I'll share mine with you.

1022
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,520
Thank you.

1023
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,800
Is it good?

1024
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,320
Of course it is.

1025
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,280
Because I'm with you.

1026
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,440
But believe it or not, I can do better.

1027
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,480
- Really?
- Wanna try?

1028
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,440
You can cook?

1029
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,360
Whatever you want to eat,

1030
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,320
I'm sure I can make it delicious.

1031
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,200
During your Friendship Time with Phupha,

1032
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,040
what did you talk about?

1033
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,080
Our types.

1034
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,160
People we like.

1035
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,800
So what's your type?

1036
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
I like someone...

1037
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,320
I feel comfortable around.

1038
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,000
Someone kind...

1039
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,960
and...

1040
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,720
sweet.

1041
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,160
That's nice.

1042
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,960
Yeah, a nice person.

1043
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,600
That's my type.

1044
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,360
What's your type?

1045
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,160
I like...

1046
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,360
the person in front of me, maybe?

1047
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,520
Tomorrow is the last day.

1048
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,720
Right.

1049
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,640
I feel like
things are going way too fast.

1050
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,400
But I think things are going so slowly.

1051
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,360
Each day feels strangely painful.

1052
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,240
Why?

1053
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:41,040
It's not very uplifting
knowing you went to eat with someone else.

1054
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,800
I was only making sure

1055
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,400
if what I was thinking was right.

1056
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,040
So are you sure now?

1057
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,160
Tomorrow's the last day.

1058
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,880
I am.

1059
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,160
I'm pretty sure.

1060
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,320
Why are you so far away?

1061
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,720
How close to you am I supposed to be?

1062
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,000
That doesn't matter.

1063
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,600
Hm?

1064
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Is this close enough?

1065
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,800
What?

1066
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,280
Ever shared a bed with anyone before?

1067
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,010
Yeah, with my mom.

1068
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,120
- Yeah?
- And my little brother.

1069
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,640
I see.

1070
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,120
But I've never shared a bed with anyone.

1071
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
Do you believe me?

1072
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,140
No.

1073
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,920
Why? Isn't it normal?

1074
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,000
Is this not normal?

1075
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,880
Well, it is.

1076
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
It's good, though.

1077
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,840
It's good?

1078
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,880
Yeah.

1079
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,880
Do you move a lot when you sleep?

1080
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,000
Kind of. Not every night.

1081
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,480
Do you move a lot when you sleep?

1082
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,640
Well...

1083
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,560
Kind of. Not with everyone.

1084
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,600
- What?
- Wait...

1085
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,480
Not every night.

1086
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,440
I see.

1087
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,440
Okay.

1088
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,240
Whatever. I'll just go to sleep.

1089
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,440
Are you?

1090
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,000
I'm sleepy.

1091
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,680
Are you not gonna sleep?

1092
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,470
I can't sleep...

1093
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,840
without my bolster pillow.

1094
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,080
- What should I do?
- Oh, what should you do?

1095
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,560
Do you happen to have one for me?

1096
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,400
I don't.

1097
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,040
- Oh...
- But I do have some questions.

1098
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,040
Okay.

1099
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,640
I wanna know...

1100
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,120
- Yes?
- how serious you are

1101
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,720
about choosing your partner.

1102
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Well,

1103
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,060
I'm pretty serious.

1104
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,720
If I have a partner,

1105
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,680
I just want to take care of them

1106
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,880
and keep moving forward together.

1107
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:25,120
How do you see your future
in the entertainment industry?

1108
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,580
Honestly, I never...

1109
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,760
I could never imagine myself
in the future.

1110
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,520
Then one day, I met someone.

1111
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,160
I don't know what happened to me, but...

1112
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,080
I could see the future right then.

1113
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,560
Right on the first day we met?

1114
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,400
What? Who are you talking about?

1115
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,880
The moment we walked together...

1116
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,720
- Right?
- What? Is it you?

1117
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
I didn't know that.

1118
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
I did not say it was me.

1119
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
I just feel like...

1120
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,760
I want him to be my partner.

1121
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,640
Here's your bolster pillow.

1122
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,840
What about my pillow, then?

1123
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,200
- We can share mine.
- Oh...

1124
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,600
Oops, my bolster pillow is gone.

1125
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,360
Come on, pick it up.

1126
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,320
It's gone.

1127
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,320
Pick it up.

1128
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,880
But I won't be able to sleep.

1129
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,600
North!

1130
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,360
I chose to have dinner with everyone.

1131
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,640
But spending the night...

1132
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,600
Honestly, I have no idea.

1133
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,640
Can I give up my privilege?

1134
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,920
I'll probably give it to PatJi or Ryujin.

1135
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,760
Or...

1136
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,240
Fifa.

1137
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,680
Can I draw their names?

1138
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,520
Can I do that?

1139
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,920
Alright,

1140
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,240
it's Fifa.

1141
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,360
[Fifa]

1142
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,720
Oh, it was my name that got picked?

1143
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:33,040
So I get to choose someone
to spend the night in the suite, right?

1144
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,960
Copper, then.

1145
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,880
Why did you choose me?

1146
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,080
This is the last Friendship Time.

1147
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,960
- I want to spend it with you, too.
- Okay.

1148
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,800
If I won,

1149
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:02,040
you'd be my first choice anyway.

1150
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,800
- Honestly, from the first EP until now,
- Yeah?

1151
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,440
I haven't won a single mission.

1152
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,560
- But I got to go out for dinner
- Yeah.

1153
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,240
without having the right to pick.

1154
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,760
I see.

1155
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,200
This is my first time.

1156
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,960
Well, I didn't even win this time.

1157
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,120
- It's a good chance, you know.
- I know.

1158
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,800
- You're so loved.
- Yeah.

1159
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,600
The program's ending,
but I haven't won a thing.

1160
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,440
I actually planned that
if I won another mission,

1161
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,600
I'd definitely choose you.

1162
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,600
But you hesitated, didn't you?

1163
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,440
And who made me hesitate?

1164
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,880
- What?
- You never sent me a letter.

1165
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,280
The first time, I sent it to Pete

1166
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,360
because he's the youngest.

1167
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,480
And the second time?

1168
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,080
- The second time?
- Yeah.

1169
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:45,920
PatJi.

1170
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,160
See? Do I ever cross your mind?

1171
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,600
You do now.

1172
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,720
Oh...

1173
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,360
Will you send me a letter next time
if you could?

1174
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,800
Should I write it now?

1175
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,760
Do we have it?

1176
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,360
I can write it now.

1177
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,280
The sun was so strong today,

1178
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,120
and I felt like I might be getting sick.

1179
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,640
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1180
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,120
When I was out in the sun,

1181
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,680
it felt like I might pass out.

1182
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,360
- Do you have a fever?
- I don't know.

1183
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,200
- But I'm better now.
- Let me see.

1184
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,400
Who said you're better?
You feel a bit feverish.

1185
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,760
Well, I don't know.

1186
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,240
Your body feels warm.

1187
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,920
Maybe because it's hot in here.

1188
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,480
You even sweat.

1189
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,360
'Cause I'm wearing a hoodie.

1190
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,800
And why are you wearing that?

1191
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,040
Well, we had to be out of town,

1192
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,280
so I thought it would be cold.

1193
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,560
Have you taken the medicine?

1194
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,600
No.

1195
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,560
Do you want some?

1196
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,440
I've got all kinds
of medicine in my bag.

1197
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,480
Oh, well...

1198
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,860
I can take it later.

1199
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,840
Okay.

1200
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,520
Honestly, I thought
you were upset with me.

1201
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,920
I wasn't. Why would I be?

1202
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,040
I don't know. You just seemed unhappy.

1203
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,960
As if I did something wrong.

1204
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,880
- You looked upset.
- What did you think I was upset about?

1205
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,040
- 'Cause I didn't practice with you?
- What?

1206
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,560
I mean, I was going to practice
my dialogue with you,

1207
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,800
but I ran out of time.

1208
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,000
Why didn't you come earlier?

1209
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,120
I was practicing with Pung.

1210
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,320
The lines were so hard.

1211
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,920
- Did you have fun?
- Well...

1212
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,920
If I said yes, would you be mad?

1213
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,800
No, I'm actually curious.

1214
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,920
Let's go to sleep.

1215
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
- Come on.
- Let's sleep.

1216
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,960
- Is this angle okay?
- Yeah.

1217
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,120
- Okay, let's sleep.
- Thanks.

1218
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,360
How do I turn this off?

1219
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,160
Fifa, how do I turn this off?

1220
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,320
There's a switch.

1221
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,720
Where is it? You do it.

1222
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,440
But it's not here.

1223
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,160
Oh, it's here.

1224
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,820
- Okay.
- Come back.

1225
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,080
- Whoa, look at you.
- It's mine now.

1226
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,000
No, I'm gonna sleep like this.

1227
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,600
You should find another spot.

1228
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,800
Where can I sleep?

1229
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,040
You figure that out,
but this is my spot.

1230
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,760
After receiving the message,

1231
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,800
leave the campfire

1232
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,040
and make your way
to the location mentioned in it.

1233
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,520
I want to tell you how I truly feel.

1234
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,000
So I was hesitating.

1235
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,120
Wanna hug a teddy bear with me?

1236
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,680
What are you two talking about?
