1
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:15,598
We want the accused
to receive fair judgment.

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,308
We demand the abolishment

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,561
of the Juvenile Act
that has no regard for the victims.

4
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,024
The results of the first trial
in the Yeonhwa Child Murder case

5
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,900
have been controversial.

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,652
After committing such a heinous crime,

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,738
one was sentenced to 20 years in prison

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,699
while the other received 2 years
in a juvenile reformatory due to his age.

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,908
What are your thoughts?

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:38,329
I agree with amending the law to extend
the two-year maximum sentence to five,

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,875
or raising the minimum age
for the punishment of minors.

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,001
However…

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,378
I don't agree
with the abolishment of the Juvenile Act.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,674
Without it, all crimes committed by minors
would be ruled under criminal law,

15
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,926
and that wouldn't be realistic.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,186
I just got a call
from Seong-u's public defender.

17
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,563
Seong-u's mother
has decided not to appeal.

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,648
She'll accept the results
of the first trial.

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,858
Is that so?

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,111
All right, then.

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,654
Let's talk more tomorrow.

22
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,531
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

23
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,076
Yes?

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,995
There's a student here looking for you.
What should I do?

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,664
Send the kid up.

26
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,418
ASSOCIATE JUDGES OFFICE

27
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,297
You…

28
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,635
Where's Judge Cha?

29
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,303
Judge Cha?

30
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,888
Cha Tae-ju…

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,099
Hey, kid!

32
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,767
Hey! Wake up!

33
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,810
Wake up, Yu-ri!

34
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,478
Yu-ri!

35
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,688
Judge Sim.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,857
Wake up. Wake up, Yu-ri!

37
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,318
Yu-ri! What's wrong with her?

38
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,570
-Call an ambulance. Hurry.
-Right.

39
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,032
-Here he comes!
-He's here!

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,663
The judiciary has regained
the public's trust through this trial.

41
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,123
Would you care to comment?

42
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,917
Do you agree
that the Juvenile Act should be revised?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,253
What we learned from this case is

44
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,757
that juvenile criminal cases
are no longer a personal matter.

45
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,387
It's time for our society
and the entire country to step up.

46
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,268
I was just doing what needed to be done.

47
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,269
Thank you.

48
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,229
-One more comment, please!
-One more comment!

49
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,106
-Sir!
-One more comment, please.

50
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,574
-This way.
-Please go through registration first.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,454
Judge Sim, I'll…

52
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,959
EMERGENCY ROOM REGISTRATION FORM
PATIENT NAME: SEO YU-RI

53
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,133
What's your relation to the patient?

54
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,134
Why do you ask?

55
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,178
Here they are.

56
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,476
-Judge Cha?
-Hello.

57
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,021
An assault case?

58
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,856
We see many cases like this.

59
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,526
We have to call it in if we suspect
the patient is a victim of assault.

60
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,197
We're dispatched when a report is made,

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,074
but most assault cases lead to a dead end.

62
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,368
People these days
don't want to get involved.

63
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,537
And oftentimes
the victim refuses to report it.

64
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,831
Let us know when she wakes up.

65
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,250
Thank you.

66
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,464
It's probably not domestic abuse.

67
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,050
She doesn't have that kind of guardian.

68
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,060
Her parents divorced when she was 12,

69
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,354
and her grandparents
raised her since then.

70
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,941
-Is he coming?
-Yes.

71
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,152
-Is Jun-seop coming too?
-I think so.

72
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,821
-Let's go.
-Do you have a thing for him?

73
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,950
Her grandfather is currently
hospitalized with dementia,

74
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,452
and her grandmother is sick as well.

75
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,080
Her parents have been
out of touch for a while.

76
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,040
-Hit me, asshole.
-Stop.

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,793
-You bitch!
-Hey, that's enough!

78
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,170
-Hey! What the hell!
-Hey!

79
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,672
-Fucking hit me!
-Hey!

80
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,385
What's going to happen to her now?

81
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,720
Her injuries seemed pretty severe.

82
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,889
The whole thing will
probably just blow over.

83
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,226
Taking on a juvenile case
isn't even worth it to begin with.

84
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,728
It's not like anyone will give a damn.

85
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,149
-Wake me up when we're at the station.
-Yes, sir.

86
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,241
She was under probation and admitted
to a shelter for theft and prostitution.

87
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,826
Her name is Seo Yu-ri.

88
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,161
Seo Yu-ri? She's infamous.

89
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,080
It's been a while
since she went off the grid.

90
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,500
I was going to report it to you.
You're the judge in charge, right?

91
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,879
We call her every night to check
if she's home, but she never picks up.

92
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,632
She hasn't even shown up
to the weekly attendance check.

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,302
She's not at home,
she won't pick up calls…

94
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,096
I've never seen such a troublemaker.

95
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,931
Yes. Okay.

96
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,646
You're still here?

97
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,939
Yes.

98
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,275
I tried calling her friends,

99
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,779
but they hadn't seen her
since she got a job at a hair salon.

100
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,115
She goes to work early
and ends late at night.

101
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,951
Isn't that a violation
of the Labor Standards Act?

102
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,787
I'm not quite sure.

103
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,041
I guess we'll find out when she wakes up.

104
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,711
It's getting late. You should get going.

105
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,046
You're not going?

106
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,007
Yes, I have a lot of questions
to ask her when she wakes up.

107
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,521
We'll know for sure
once the test results come in,

108
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,442
but it seems like she has a fractured rib
and a contusion on her left wrist.

109
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,404
Her inflammation levels are also high.
This isn't from a one-time incident.

110
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,781
She's been abused long-term.

111
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,787
Hey, are you awake?

112
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,167
Hold on. Let me get a doctor.

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,085
No…

114
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,589
I…

115
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,425
I must've lost my mind.

116
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,135
I'm really okay.

117
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,970
I should get going.

118
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,480
You came all the way to the courthouse
in the middle of the night

119
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,315
when you're okay?

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,655
You'd rather speak to Judge Cha, right?

121
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,159
-If you don't feel comfortable with me.
-No, I'm really okay.

122
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,087
You say you're okay,
but your injuries say otherwise.

123
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,799
If I hadn't found out,
I may have let you walk out of here.

124
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,343
But I can't let you go now.

125
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,514
I'll give you
just one day to think about it.

126
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,225
Call me if you change your mind.

127
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,979
If you don't, I'll handle it my way.

128
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,902
I took care of the hospital bill,
so get admitted.

129
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,697
Get yourself treated.

130
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,339
Finally, the US is one of the countries
that upholds human rights

131
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,843
and is very strict
when it comes to domestic violence.

132
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,804
Therefore, most judicial authorities
in the United States

133
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,975
are required to sentence the assailant
within 24 hours of the report

134
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,145
and impose strong criminal penalties
on the perpetrator.

135
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,230
Also, during the trial,

136
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,858
contact between the victim
and perpetrator is minimized

137
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,902
so that the victim's safety is ensured.

138
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,863
The victims are aided
through a lawyer support system as well.

139
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:13,743
These efforts stem from the awareness
that domestic violence is a crime.

140
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,286
That'll be all.

141
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,542
Thank you. That was Judge Lee Jeong-seok.

142
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:27,131
Would anyone like to say a few words
regarding his presentation?

143
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,557
Yes?

144
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,228
Judge Sim Eun-seok?

145
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,395
So…

146
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,023
what's the point?

147
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,402
Are you proposing that we do exactly
what they do in the States?

148
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,948
According to the statistics,

149
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,283
53.8% of Korean families
suffer from domestic violence,

150
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,870
and more than 93 people
fall victim to it every year,

151
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,415
where their lives
are threatened or even lost.

152
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,669
If we count the cases
that haven't been reported,

153
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,671
we're only scratching the surface.

154
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,924
But what's more hopeless is that

155
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,718
no one knows for sure

156
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,137
when domestic violence
will come to an end.

157
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,601
Let's say there's a girl

158
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,728
and she's a suspected victim
of domestic abuse.

159
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,898
The hospital and her school
both report it to the police.

160
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,859
But her family can say
that there was no domestic violence,

161
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,069
and that they're mistaken.

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,113
The moment they deny it,

163
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,242
the police can no longer intervene
and the investigation ends.

164
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,704
Even now,
countless domestic violence cases

165
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,164
are closed due to such reasons.

166
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,919
Given this reality, how do we minimize
contact between the assailant and victim,

167
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,380
and have the assailant
stand trial within 24 hours?

168
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,966
Is this even feasible?

169
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:58,139
We could at least revise the way in which
domestic violence cases are handled.

170
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,311
That way, things that are actually useful
could be discussed in seminars like these.

171
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,023
Does Mr. Kang not train his judges?

172
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,942
Gosh, judges these days.

173
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,944
How dare she say those things

174
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,238
when a chief judge
is giving a presentation?

175
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,073
-Gosh, that rude little…
-Gosh.

176
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,492
-The world is going to the dogs.
-Gosh.

177
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,911
What is wrong with you?

178
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,336
Don't you know how touchy
the chief judges are during a seminar?

179
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,840
Can't you tell when
and when not to share your opinion?

180
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,675
Isn't that the whole point
of these seminars?

181
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,552
Still, you were way out of line.

182
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,891
Even college kids don't give presentations
like Mr. Lee did today.

183
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,978
He just looked through some books
and did a little research online.

184
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,648
They say time is gold.

185
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,777
Gold is the same as money.
I wasted a lot of money today.

186
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,737
Eun-seok!

187
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,282
Seminars are held so that ideas
can be shared regardless of age and rank.

188
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,619
I wasn't refuting
anyone's arguments today.

189
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,996
I was merely sharing my opinion.

190
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,583
That's the problem.
Do you know what a ruckus you caused?

191
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
You see this?

192
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,797
Hey.

193
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,133
Mr. Lee! Yes.

194
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,928
Yes. Sure.

195
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,307
Judge Cha,
you should head down to the lobby.

196
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:24,975
Me?

197
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,938
Why?

198
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,823
Mom.

199
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,157
Tae-ju.

200
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,785
You should've called.

201
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,287
I packed you some food.

202
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,917
Why did you pack so much?

203
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,089
Where's Judge Cha?

204
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,050
He's in the lobby. His mother is here.

205
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,011
She packs some dishes
and visits him from time to time.

206
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,305
When Judge Cha is in a trial,
I go instead.

207
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,099
Her timing was spot on today.

208
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,436
-I see.
-You know, it's quite odd.

209
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,605
Judge Cha and his mother are very close.
Almost like friends.

210
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,151
It's unusual for sons to be
that close to their mothers.

211
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,362
I guess he grew up with a lot of love.

212
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,491
I hope I can be that close
to my son in the future too.

213
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,701
Just like Judge Cha.

214
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,748
You weren't talking about me now,
were you?

215
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,082
No.

216
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,502
My mother cooked up a storm again.
I think I should share them.

217
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,756
I was craving your mother's food.

218
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,591
Tell her I said thank you.

219
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,719
My mom made some
for you as well, Judge Sim.

220
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,182
I'm okay. Give it to someone else.

221
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,184
I don't eat at home.

222
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,856
Did I do something wrong?

223
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,816
No. What's gotten into her?

224
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,570
Oh my. This looks delicious.

225
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,997
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

226
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm from Yeonhwa District Court.

227
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,836
You know Seo Yu-ri, right?

228
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,547
Abuse?

229
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,842
I admit that our workload is intense
compared to other salons,

230
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,677
but we did not abuse her.

231
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,930
Did she say that we hit her?

232
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,892
No, I'm just checking the facts.

233
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,853
What was she like at work?

234
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,483
I told you it's 8874, not 695.

235
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,903
How many times is that?

236
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,448
Can't you even clean up properly?
These products can't be mixed up.

237
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,242
I had to keep an eye on her.

238
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,662
She made lots of mistakes,
and often showed up late and miss work.

239
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,748
The hair designers
don't regard her too highly either.

240
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,209
Things are pretty tense
at the salon because of her.

241
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,422
When does she get on and off work?

242
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,758
It depends on the shift.

243
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,680
Since she's a minor, she gets off
after seven hours according to the law.

244
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,682
Are you sure?

245
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,686
I could show you
the security footage if you'd like.

246
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,276
Wait! Excuse me!

247
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,819
I…

248
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,573
I have something to tell you.

249
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,952
-Welcome.
-Come on.

250
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,791
Some strange man
came to see Yu-ri multiple times.

251
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,963
I think he might be hitting her,

252
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,299
because I saw her face
bruised up many times.

253
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,677
Whenever she missed work,
it was because of him.

254
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,723
I switched shifts with her a few times
because she was badly hurt.

255
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,809
And he looked much older than her.

256
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,271
But he seemed a little…

257
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,650
I'm not sure if I should be saying this,

258
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,820
but it seemed like underage prostitution.

259
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,035
Sir, please turn the car around.

260
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,621
Please take me
to Yeonhwa Hospital instead of the court.

261
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,914
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,002
Yes, I'll change the disposition.
Please let me know how it goes.

263
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,296
Okay.

264
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,174
Excuse me.

265
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,886
Didn't you attend Busan Middle School?

266
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,013
Pardon?

267
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,641
Cha Tae-ju, isn't it?

268
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,936
It's me, Jeong Jin-mo!
I used to live next door to you.

269
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:43,275
I think you have the wrong person.
I didn't attend Busan Middle school.

270
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,445
My apologies. I must've been mistaken.

271
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,949
I have a friend named Cha Tae-ju
and you two look so much alike.

272
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,284
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,465
YEONHWA HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

274
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,800
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

275
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,595
Can you check if Seo Yu-ri was involved
in a sex crime since her release?

276
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,846
By tomorrow morning.

277
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,684
I'm telling you, no.

278
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,560
How many times do I have to tell you?

279
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,729
I just fell on my own. I wasn't beaten.

280
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,564
That doesn't make any sense.

281
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,193
Why would you come all the way
to the courthouse if you just fell?

282
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,029
How do you get hurt like this
from falling?

283
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,281
Please just stay out of it.

284
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,659
Who is that man anyway?

285
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,539
I heard he hit you a few times before.

286
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,916
-Did you go asking around about me?
-That's not all.

287
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,091
Just say the word.
I'll send you to a facility right away.

288
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,636
Yu-ri.

289
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,847
There you are.

290
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,183
But who are you?

291
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,436
I'm Judge Sim Eun-seok
from Yeonhwa District Court.

292
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,271
Are you Yu-ri's grandmother?

293
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,441
Oh dear. I am so ashamed.

294
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,692
My sweet Yu-ri…

295
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,989
Oh my, you should have
offered her a drink at least.

296
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,575
No, that's okay. I was about to leave.

297
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,493
About Yu-ri's injuries--

298
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,663
Yes, she fell.

299
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,168
It's just that she's such a frail girl.

300
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,211
-Pardon?
-It's true.

301
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,547
She falls all the time.

302
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,716
Right, Yu-ri?

303
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,973
-But, ma'am--
-Oh dear. What am I doing?

304
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,102
The nurse wants to see Yu-ri.

305
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,897
May we go?

306
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,817
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

307
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,653
Let's go.

308
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,074
I'm so sorry.

309
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,128
Hey, Mr. Kim.

310
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,839
I'm still at the courthouse.

311
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,466
Dinner?

312
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,261
Okay. I'll check my messages.

313
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,891
MESSAGES
HANWOOL DAILY REPORTER KIM

314
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,143
GYEONGHWAWON, 7 P.M.
RESERVATION UNDER EOM JUN-GI

315
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,154
ASSEMBLYMAN EOM JUN-GI

316
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,494
The by-elections will be held in October.

317
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,289
Your political stances are
perfect for our party,

318
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,211
so I thought I'd meet you in person
to say hello.

319
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,090
Well…

320
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,010
I've worked
in the courthouse for 22 years.

321
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,555
I feel more at home enforcing the law

322
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,890
in the courthouse

323
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,434
than enacting and revising them.

324
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,187
The courthouse

325
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,358
suits me better
than the National Assembly.

326
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,235
I see.

327
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,948
I heard something shocking recently.
Can I ask you a question?

328
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,907
Sure.

329
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,493
Of all the juvenile crimes
that take place,

330
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,705
only 1% of them
are severe enough to be aired on TV.

331
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,041
They also say 15% of them
are school violence offenses,

332
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,545
and the rest is juvenile delinquency
derived from poverty,

333
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,298
domestic violence and family trouble.
Is this correct?

334
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,552
Well, I can't say
that it's true with 100% certainty,

335
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,431
but those under less fortunate
circumstances tend to be overlooked.

336
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,769
The court is well aware of that fact.

337
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,107
Then that's even better.

338
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,319
Juvenile welfare
and the revision of the Juvenile Act

339
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,820
are duties of the National Assembly.

340
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,825
If you take into account
what can be done for our youths,

341
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,119
I think it'll be better for them

342
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,164
if you were at the National Assembly.

343
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,380
Now that 18-year-olds
have the right to vote,

344
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,884
our party desperately needs you.

345
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,764
It's time the Assembly
opened its ears to the youth.

346
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,522
Although only 1 to 2%
of the voters are 18 years old,

347
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,609
social media is practically run
by teens and those in their twenties.

348
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,402
We can't underestimate their influence.

349
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,866
"Juvenile criminal cases
are no longer a personal matter.

350
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,287
It's time for our society
and the entire country to step up."

351
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,708
It's time for our society
and the entire country to step up.

352
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,711
Please step up
like you said in your interview.

353
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,757
Not in the courthouse but in the Assembly.

354
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,969
Once you make the decision

355
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,639
we'll take care of the rest.

356
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,145
We'll make sure you're more suited
for the Assembly than the courthouse.

357
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,196
WOORI HOSPITAL
WOORI CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

358
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,782
I'm from the courts.

359
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm looking for a patient.

360
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,054
PATIENT KANG DONG-GWON

361
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,181
PATIENT CHOI BYEONG-GIL

362
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,109
PATIENT SEO GWON-CHUN

363
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,663
Can I help you?

364
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,877
We stay with the elderly all day long.

365
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,839
It's hard not to know
what's going on with their family.

366
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,427
I know what their sons do for a living

367
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,596
and all kinds of other details.

368
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,640
You're here
because of their granddaughter?

369
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,809
Yes.

370
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,186
Stop talking!

371
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,270
Yu-ri.

372
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,397
Why does it always have to be me?

373
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,191
Why should I put up with it?

374
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,862
Kids these days don't care
about their sick grandparents.

375
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,281
You know right away.

376
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,284
She has red hair, reeks of cigarettes,

377
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,288
and even yells at her grandmother.
She's so rude.

378
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,748
Okay. You're all set.

379
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,750
I've never seen anyone like her.

380
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,545
There's probably more to her than that.

381
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,257
If she was really rude,
she wouldn't have even come to visit.

382
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,719
And she wouldn't have given
her grandfather a haircut.

383
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,930
Yu-ri visits almost every day, right?

384
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,349
Well, yes.

385
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,851
I wondered why she always went home late

386
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,686
when she only works seven hours a day.

387
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,065
I think I just found my answer.

388
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,568
What about her parents?

389
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,738
Do you know anything?

390
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,781
I sure do.

391
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,617
Everyone in this hospital knows
about her dad.

392
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,703
Gosh, he has such a temper.

393
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,997
He causes a ruckus every time he comes.

394
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,751
They pay their hospital bills
with funding from the government,

395
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,586
but he keeps asking them for money.

396
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,339
He even wants their welfare funds.

397
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,299
I thought they lost contact with him.

398
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,801
No way.

399
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,554
Yu-ri hates talking about her dad.

400
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,143
Some strange man came
to see Yu-ri multiple times.

401
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,895
Yes, she fell. Right, Yu-ri?

402
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,359
It was her dad.

403
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,115
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

404
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,284
Yeonhwa Police Women and Juvenile Affairs,
Ko Gang-sik.

405
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,453
Was Seo Yu-ri discharged
from the hospital?

406
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,912
Why do you ask?

407
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,998
His father is at the station

408
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,709
and he wants to report her as a runaway.

409
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,211
What?

410
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,466
Normally, we dispatch
as soon as we get the report,

411
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,178
but something seemed a bit off.

412
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,346
Seo Yu-ri is
a victim of domestic violence.

413
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,598
Her father abuses her.

414
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,601
She cannot come in contact
with the perpetrator.

415
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,563
Do what you can
to dismiss the runaway report.

416
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,578
Where will we go once I'm discharged?

417
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,291
He's probably looking for us right now.

418
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,669
Gosh, how rude.

419
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,134
I'm sick of staying at a sauna.

420
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,678
If we're going to run, let's go far away.

421
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,972
Don't you feel bad for me?

422
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,391
I've been hospitalized because of him.

423
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,644
I do feel bad for you.

424
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:27,442
I feel so bad for you
that my heart is in pieces.

425
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,737
But, Yu-ri.

426
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,283
He's still your dad and my son.

427
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,870
Yu-ri.

428
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:45,168
Can't you just put up with him
a little longer?

429
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,381
It's not his fault he's like that.

430
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,966
Yu-ri.

431
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,218
Yu-ri.

432
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,392
How can I help you?

433
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,062
It's for Judge Cha Tae-ju,
from a juvenile reformatory in Busan.

434
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,605
-Busan?
-Yes.

435
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,567
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

436
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,068
This is Busan Juvenile Reformatory.

437
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,945
Is this the Criminal Collegiate Division?

438
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,447
Yes. You're calling
about the plant, right?

439
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,866
I'll make sure Judge Cha gets it.

440
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,744
Really? Thank you so much.

441
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,290
He's been donating money
for the kids here for over six years.

442
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,793
I wanted to repay him
but he would always refuse.

443
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,003
I see.

444
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,840
Please make sure he gets it.

445
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,091
Okay. I will.

446
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,636
Good morning.

447
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,723
Judge Cha. You have a delivery.

448
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,270
THANK YOU, JUDGE CHA TAE-JU
BUSAN JUVENILE REFORMATORY

449
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:55,614
Could you please send the plant back?
I'll call the sender and let him know.

450
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,074
He asked me to make sure you got this.

451
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,118
It's the thought that counts.

452
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,244
I can't accept this.

453
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,163
Please.

454
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,123
Okay. I'll do so.

455
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,922
These are the documents regarding
Seo Yu-ri that you asked for last night.

456
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:13,923
I see.

457
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,010
Did she have any records?

458
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,305
Nothing aside from violation of probation.

459
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,806
Take care.

460
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,809
NAME: SEO YU-RI

461
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,569
What's this? You got a new plant.

462
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,947
We didn't buy it.
It's from a juvenile reformatory in Busan.

463
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,157
Busan?

464
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,367
Why did they send it?

465
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,124
Wasn't Yu-ri hospitalized?
Why are you checking her records?

466
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,670
Things have changed.

467
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,546
She's suffering from domestic violence.

468
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,633
-Her father seems to be the abuser.
-What?

469
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,510
Did you report it?

470
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,679
Where's the father?

471
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,390
What did the police say?

472
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,143
Judge Sim.

473
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,145
Yu-ri is refusing to file a report.

474
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,314
CRIMINAL RECORD
NAME: SEO YU-RI

475
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
Then why are you checking her records?

476
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,739
Is this what I think it is?

477
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,950
VIOLATION OF PROBATION
SUBJECT OF GUIDANCE: SEO YU-RI

478
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,455
It is.

479
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,125
It's exactly what you think it is.

480
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,627
Seo Yu-ri will be separated
as a status offender.

481
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,214
What?

482
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,135
Isn't Judge Cha amazing?

483
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,887
How could he for six years?

484
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,267
But he made me send back the plant.
He said it's the thought that counts.

485
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,479
Well, that's just who he is, a good man.

486
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,481
I mean…

487
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,484
How do you raise a kid
to turn out like that?

488
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,320
Isn't it strange?

489
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,406
Why Busan of all places?

490
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,241
Think about it.

491
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,035
This was the first juvenile court
he was ever assigned to.

492
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,247
And we're only associated with
other courthouses in Seoul or Gyeonggi.

493
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,709
So why would he donate to a reformatory
in Busan for such a long time?

494
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,710
Is it his hometown?

495
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,378
-That's plausible.
-Right?

496
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,380
She's a victim.

497
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,049
Don't you care about her?
She needs to be protected.

498
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,843
I mean, how…

499
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,929
How could you think of separating her
by sentencing her?

500
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,350
She didn't do anything to deserve it.
And even if she did,

501
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,311
she needs to be protected right now.

502
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,021
If she's refusing to report, convince her.

503
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,607
Why are you cornering her like that?

504
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,611
This is my case and mine alone.

505
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,031
Isn't it within my right to sentence her?

506
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,411
Yes. But, still, this is too much.

507
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,538
I won't let this slide.

508
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,165
And if you won't?

509
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,502
Are you going to
impede on my jurisdiction?

510
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,099
This is Sim Eun-seok.

511
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,479
This is Yeonhwa Hospital.
Are you the judge in charge of Seo Yu-ri?

512
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,564
Are you with her right now?

513
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,696
I went to let her know when she'll be
discharged but she wasn't there.

514
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,448
I can't reach her guardian either.

515
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,908
Where's Miss Seo Yu-ri, Room 523?

516
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,540
We'll look for her and let you know.

517
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,043
What's going on?

518
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,504
Seo Yu-ri went missing from the hospital.

519
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,600
EUN SO-HUI
WHERE ARE YOU?

520
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,270
This is Sim Eun-seok.
I spoke to you at the convalescent home.

521
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,731
If you happen to see Seo Yu-ri today,

522
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,025
please call me as soon as possible.

523
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,071
No, it's nothing serious.

Yes. Please call me.

526
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,166
She was here
when we checked her vitals this morning.

527
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,086
I checked the security footage
and she did leave the hospital.

528
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,589
And her legal guardian?

529
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,174
She went looking for her
with the hospital security team.

530
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,509
Okay.

I'll go check the places she frequents
and call you.

Okay.

536
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,648
Is this the probation office?

537
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,484
I'm Judge Sim Eun-seok

00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,114
Her name is Seo Yu-ri.
Date of birth is December 1, 2004.

540
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,824
Please hurry.

-Sure.

-What the hell?
-I'm sorry.

546

Come on, pick up.

547
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,358
You really didn't tell anyone, right?

548
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,235
I'll just stay for a few days.

549
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,739
Of course, I brought the money.

You said there's no one here.

-Let go!
-Give me my money!

00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,291
Let me go!

567
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,813
Give it back!

00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,316
-Fuck!
-Bitch, that's not my problem.

Give me my fucking money!

How can you do this to me?

571

No one told you to fucking fall for it.

-Jackass.
-You fucking bitch.

What did you just fucking say?

Maybe Yu-ri's dad took her away.

No, I don't think so.

00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,579

Who did this to you?

00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,582
What's wrong with my life?

590
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,503
Why is my life so shitty?

591
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,383
I wanted to turn over a new leaf.

592
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,469
I wanted to get away from it…

593
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,807
but I can't.

Yu-ri.

595
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,068
Let's tell the police everything.
I'll help you.

596
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,322
What difference will that make?

597
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,159
A restraining order.
And we'll take away his parental rights.

598
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,246
We can stop him from contacting you
through any means.

599
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,083
-You can leave home and stay at a shelter.
-I don't want to.

600
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,712
I've been putting up with him.

601
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,506
So why do I have to leave?

602
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,508
I was the one who got hurt,

603
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,512
so why am I always the one
that has to run away?

604
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,520
If we put a restraining order on him,
will the police protect me at all hours?

605
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,856
They won't.

606
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:37,069
What if that bastard tries
to get revenge and hurt me?

607
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,615
I can't tell the police
because I'm scared.

608
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,535
It's not that I won't.
I can't because I'm scared.

00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,791
And what if you stay quiet?

610

What then?

611
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,007
You'll run away if he hits you again
and you'll resort to stealing

612
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,759
if you run out of money.

613
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,303
It's none of your business.

614
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,058
I'm sick of this.

615
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,187
Do you have any idea
how many people were looking for you?

616
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,689
Your attitude is seriously pissing me off.

618
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,071
Fine. I can't force her to do anything
if she doesn't want to.

619
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,324
I've done my part, right?

620
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,787

She's at the convalescent hospital.

You're in a runaway gang with them, right?

Yes, but I'm the victim here.

I didn't break any laws.

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,840
It's okay.

640
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,516
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

641
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,228
How could you do that?

642
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,023
Don't you have any compassion?

643
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,776
Yu-ri has nowhere else to go
because of her abusive father.

644
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,738
So she ran away and joined a gang.

645
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,781
Shouldn't you be asking
why she joined them

646
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,284
rather than being upset that she did?

647
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,663
Judge Sim,
I've been wondering for a while now.

648
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,957
Just out of curiosity,

649
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,127
why do you hate young offenders so much?

650
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,338
What?

651
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,798
Why do you always hurt them with words

652
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,427
and always try so hard to see
if you can find any fault in them?

653
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,012
Why are you so mad at them?

654
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,430
Because they're criminals.

655
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,643
They dared to commit a crime…

656
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,606
at such a young age.

657
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,528
Let me ask you something.

658
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,490
Is this something to be so upset about?

659
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,909
Why are you always on their side?

660
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,078
Do they have something on you?

661
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,330
-Judge Sim!
-What is it then?

662
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,334
Why do you keep butting in on my case?

663
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,798
Come on out!

664
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,512
Come out. Come out, you bastard!

665
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,515
Come out!

666
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,684
So I borrowed some money
from your teacher.

667
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,521
It's not a big deal
when you're doing business.

668
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,356
How dare you yell at me?

669
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,899
-Please, Dad.
-Come out!

670
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,567
-Come out, you bastard!
-I'm sorry!

671
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,403
-Come out!
-I'm sorry!

672
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,946
Come out! You bastard!

673
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,157
Come out!

674
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,826
Come out! You bastard!

675
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:16,205
Please, Dad. I'm sorry! Please stop!

676
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,753
Because it weighs on my mind.

677
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,591
Because I see you
keep taking the wrong path.

678
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,685
Children who suffer from domestic abuse…

679
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,855
Children like that never grow up.

680
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,566
Ten years? Twenty years?

681
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,445
Time will pass by,

682
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,866
but they're just stuck
as an abused child regardless of that.

683
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,247
Everyone criticizes juvenile offenders.

684
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,125
It's just us judges

685
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,919
who can give them a second chance.

686
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,884
That's why I think being a judge is
more meaningful and important.

687
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,142
That's why I became a judge.

688
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,738
-Trial starts in thirty minutes.
-Okay.

689
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,372
What's wrong with this?

690
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,332
The battery must be dead.

691
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,000
I'll go get new ones.

692
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,544
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

693
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,547
-You're getting sloppy.
-I'm sorry.

694
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,304
Judge Cha. Are you okay? I'm sorry.

695
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,556
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

696
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,432
-Judge Sim's the judge today, right?
-Yes.

697
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,892
Go ahead. You'll be late.

698
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,353
-Yes. I'm sorry.
-Wait…

699
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,023
Is Yu-ri on trial today?

700
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,907
The trial is now in session.

701
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,202
Wasn't Yu-ri standing trial
as a status offender?

702
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,080
Well, you're half right.

703
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,709
The reason she was separated
wasn't to punish her.

704
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,462
This trial will be held

705
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,007
along with the child protection case
against Yu-ri's father,

706
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,925
who has been taken into custody.

707
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,885
With the power vested in me by the court,

708
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,138
I order that the offender
be isolated from the child

709
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:24,727
as per the Act on Special Cases Concerning
The Punishment of Child Abuse Crimes.

710
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,230
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes.

711
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,942
Do you know why you're here?

712
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,860
Yes.

713
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,403
Why are you here?

714
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,488
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

715
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,490
Domestic violence.

716
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,783
Do you admit to the charges?

717
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,370
I had to admit it
when I was under investigation,

718
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,830
but it's preposterous.

719
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,626
I was only parenting my child,
so who are you to order me around?

720
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,628
What's the court done for me?

721
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,005
What I did was discipline her.

722
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,798
It's within my rights as her father.

723
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,436
PHOTO EVIDENCE OF SEO YU-RI'S ABUSE

724
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,528
To discipline means

725
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,365
to give intellectual, moral,
and social guidance to someone.

726
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:27,665
Is that what you call discipline?

727
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:32,294
Something that was within your rights
as her father?

728
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,099
There's only one reason
why I locked you up.

729
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,602
To make you stand trial.

730
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,314
I want to show you

731
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,817
that the abuser will be locked up,

732
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,903
not the victim.

733
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,782
The victim will get to stay home

734
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,202
and the perpetrator will be punished.

735
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,498
I will…

736
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,042
show you that.

737
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,631
I'm being set up.

738
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,175
Do you have proof I did that?

739
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,226
This is the statement Ms. Seo Yu-ri gave
at the Juvenile Classification Center.

740
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,312
In this statement, she writes that

741
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,982
she was beaten with a bat and kicked.

742
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,693
And, witness?

743
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,824
I'm Detective Ko Gang-sik from Yeonhwa PD,
Women and Juvenile Affairs.

744
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,117
POLICE STATION

745
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,202
What are you going to do with Seo Yu-ri?

746
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,289
I dismissed the runaway report, but…

747
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,624
What would you do?

748
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,127
You already stopped her
from drowning once,

749
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,838
so will you help her one more time?

750
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,298
Would I be of help?

751
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,675
Do you remember the state she was in
at the emergency room?

752
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,427
Yes.

753
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,764
I need you to accuse her father
of domestic abuse.

754
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,644
I need you
to investigate this matter personally.

755
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,861
This is a voice recording from the day
she was rushed to the ER.

756
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,489
I found it while investigating
her domestic violence case.

757
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,579
-Where's the money?
-I don't have it!

758
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,500
-I guess you need another beating then!
-Stop! Stop it!

759
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,002
-I don't have it!
-I'm not asking for a lot of money!

760
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,462
Go earn it yourself!

761
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,590
I said, go earn it yourself!

762
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,759
-Shut up!
-Stop!

763
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,719
That's enough, you jerk!

764
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,137
Where's the money?

765
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,348
-Stop it!
-I don't have any!

766
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,767
-Keep talking.
-Oh gosh! Please!

767
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,310
-Stay still!
-Please! Stop!

768
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,311
Fuck you!

769
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,522
I said, fuck you!

770
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,315
-I told you to stop!
-Stay out of this!

771
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,654
-Do you have a death wish?
-Stop it! That's enough!

772
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,197
-Stop it!
-My goodness..

773
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,657
-Grandma…
-Hey.

774
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,535
Don't get cocky for making money.
Where is it?

775
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,994
I don't have any!

776
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,121
-Give me the money or you'll get it!
-I don't have it!

777
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,123
Just kill me.

778
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,127
-Just kill me now.
-Fuck. Kill you? Fine.

779
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,879
-Just die!
-Stop it!

780
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,048
Die, you bitch!

781
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,884
-Stop it!
-Die!

782
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,388
Try talking back now! Go on!

783
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,724
-Damn it!
-Goodness, my baby.

784
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:47,906
Jeez.

785
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,450
I was going to report her
when she ran away,

786
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,327
but you stopped me from doing so.

787
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,454
You were all in on it, weren't you?

788
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,291
Who the hell are you? Are you even a cop?

789
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,543
-Are you a cop? You bastard.
-That's enough!

790
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,711
What?

791
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,255
You'd better sit down.

792
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,218
Gosh, this is nonsense.

793
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:13,140
Your Honor. You must know she's a whore.

794
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,267
She stood trial for it.

795
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,312
So I beat her a little
to bring her back to her senses.

796
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,731
I disciplined her as her father.

797
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,107
What's so wrong with that?

798
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,078
There's nothing wrong
with a little discipline.

799
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,349
But…

800
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,268
that's not discipline, is it?

801
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:09,237
There's something I wanted to know…

802
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,616
while proceeding with this trial.

803
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,452
I just don't understand it.

804
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,335
Why are you…

805
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,175
so smug?

806
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,275
It's all my fault.

807
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,031
I failed to raise my son properly.

808
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,494
Yu-ri's father, my son,

809
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,997
is just like his dad.

810
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:05,377
He was also abused at home
when he was growing up.

811
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,673
Why are you giving this to us?

812
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,009
I don't even know what that is.

813
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,555
Yu-ri prepared it
to report him to the police.

814
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,934
I asked her not to.

815
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,688
I told her not to do it.

816
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,694
How could she do that to her dad?

817
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,782
I'm to blame.

818
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,409
It's all my fault.

819
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,748
It's because I didn't raise him well.

820
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,585
I should be the one who's punished.

821
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,255
So…

822
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,884
you're the one who sold me out.

823
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,223
What are you doing?

824
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,267
-Grandma!
-Don't! Stop!

825
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,769
-You crazy bastard!
-Shut up!

826
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,978
Stop it!

827
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,273
What do you think you're doing?

828
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,067
-Let go of her!
-Shut the hell up!

829
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,277
Let go of her!

830
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,362
Please stop.

831
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,012
Judge Cha!

832
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,348
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
