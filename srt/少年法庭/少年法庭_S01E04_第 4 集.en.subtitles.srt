1
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,346
The court has made its decision.

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,475
According to Article 36, Clause 1

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,645
of the Act on Special Cases
Concerning Punishment for Child Abuse,

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:25,483
a child abuser is forbidden to approach
their family members for one year,

5
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,028
compelled to leave
the victim's home for one year,

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,781
forbidden to approach the victim
via telecommunications for one year,

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,410
divested of all parental rights
for one year,

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,457
sentenced to 200 hours
of community service and training,

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,500
ordered to undergo
treatment for alcoholism,

10
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,501
and…

11
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,963
I want to show you

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,591
that the abuser will be locked up,

13
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,218
not the victim.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,013
The victim will get to stay home

15
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,641
and the perpetrator will be punished.

16
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,268
I will

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,771
show you that.

18
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,565
And…

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,277
sentenced to one year
in a probational facility.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,489
Well, this is not right. Come on.
I only scolded my own child--

21
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,948
Under certain grounds,

22
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,576
the protective order
can be changed or extended.

23
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,622
If you don't follow the order
or accept the decision,

24
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,291
this case will be sent
to the public prosecutors' office,

25
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,460
and you may face a criminal trial.

26
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,505
Also, the state is not obligated
to bear the expenses

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,840
for alcoholism treatment.

28
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,760
You must pay them yourself.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,267
Oh, dear.

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,273
If you use violence towards your family

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,569
just because you were
a victim of abuse as well,

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,448
that is still undeniably a crime.

33
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,077
In court, everything is judged by facts.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,745
Because you're the father?

35
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,833
Because it's your child?

36
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,752
Those excuses don't work here.

37
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,588
What matters is

38
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,842
whether you used violence

39
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,345
or not.

40
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,189
This court is adjourned.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,738
Oh, Yu-ri.

42
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,206
Oh, no. Won-sik.

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,251
Won-sik.

44
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,921
Oh, no.

45
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,645
What is it?

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,648
Why didn't you tell me?

47
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,361
Your plan for Seo Yu-ri's case.

48
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,906
If I had known,
I wouldn't have said such harsh words.

49
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,283
You sound like you're blaming me.

50
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,368
No, it's not that--

51
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,787
It wasn't a division case, but mine alone.

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,498
Do I have to report
all the details to you?

53
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,086
If you're done, step aside.
You're annoying me.

54
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,761
Mr. Seo Won-sik.

55
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,680
You're under arrest
for assault during the trial.

56
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,349
Assault? What the heck?

57
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,559
There's no one who lives a fairytale life.

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,188
I can assure you as someone
who's lived to this point.

59
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,276
What makes a difference is whether or not
you overcome your limitations.

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,698
That's why there are courts
and police stations around us

61
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,911
and why people like me can make a living.

62
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,251
Don't talk back to your elders
like a rude brat.

63
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,837
Don't talk down to people
just because you're in a bad mood.

64
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,757
Don't let your emotions
dictate what you say.

65
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,177
Say hello to your elders first.

66
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,351
Even if nothing makes you smile,
try to anyway.

67
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,272
Those things will bring you luck.

68
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,866
Good job.

69
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,327
You held out well.

70
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,541
I don't like you.

71
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,169
I bad-mouthed you many times.

72
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,925
Why are you doing this to me?

73
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,679
Why are you doing this to me?

74
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,643
I really hate you.

75
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,650
BAD FAMILY SITUATION

76
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,324
MESSAGES

77
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,952
I WON'T COMMIT CRIMES ANYMORE
I'LL WORK HARD

78
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,518
One more glass, please.

79
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,572
I guess the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

80
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,826
I really hated it when my father drank.

81
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,913
So I promised myself

82
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,042
that I'd never touch alcohol.

83
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,672
But it tastes so sweet.

84
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,553
I'm sorry, Judge Sim.

85
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,306
This is what

86
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,101
I should have said first.

87
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,563
I was ashamed of myself
for saying such harsh words.

88
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,073
You know I'm an outlier, right?

89
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,786
Most judges have a degree
from SNU Law School.

90
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,707
But I only have a GED,
which is a rarity in this field.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,839
I studied really hard
to work at a juvenile court.

92
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,759
Seriously.

93
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,848
I studied so hard
that I even got blisters on my butt.

94
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,517
Why did you try so hard?

95
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,606
To help young offenders
from living like me.

96
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,534
TRANSPORT

97
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,454
Cha Tae-ju is sentenced to

98
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,747
probation number ten
for attempted patricide.

99
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,016
I hate my past.

100
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,830
I owe a lot to you…

101
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,250
for this trial.

102
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,173
Children who suffer from domestic abuse.

103
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,300
Children like that never grow up.

104
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,220
Ten years? Twenty years?

105
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,140
Time will pass by,

106
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,353
but they're stuck
as an abused child regardless of that.

107
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,816
I used what you said
to persuade Yu-ri's grandmother.

108
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,320
When she heard that, she just cried

109
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,740
without saying anything.

110
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,744
Gosh.

111
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,205
Grown-ups don't know

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,376
how much it hurts their children.

113
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,882
That's why my mother
always brings me dried squid.

114
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,974
I never touch it
because it was that jerk's favorite.

115
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,353
My father was just like…

116
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,856
Yu-ri's father.

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,984
She's a victim.

118
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,403
Don't you care about her at all?
She needs to be protected.

119
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,613
Why are you cornering her like that?

120
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,537
When I was little,

121
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,623
not the judge in charge of me,

122
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,751
there was another judge who helped me.

123
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,254
He whipped me into shape.

124
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,715
Are you nuts?

125
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,552
You turned the whole facility upside down.
You know that?

126
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,097
I also came here
right after a hearing to catch you.

127
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,392
The judge in charge of you is in a panic.

128
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,437
Think of your mother.

129
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,982
Don't you feel sorry for her?

130
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,239
If you do, get your act together.

131
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,617
Please.

132
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,916
After I passed the bar exam,

133
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,711
I was going to visit him.

134
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,630
But I couldn't.

135
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,923
I lost contact with him.

136
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm not sure if I couldn't or didn't.

137
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,932
Now that over ten years have passed,

138
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,019
I can't quite remember his face.

139
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,730
I'm…

140
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,857
I'm so regretful now.

141
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,361
I should've at least asked for his name.

142
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,366
But I think that he's probably become

143
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,077
a better judge somewhere

144
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,372
because he was born to be a judge.

145
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,128
I've worked in the courts for 22 years.

146
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,675
It's now time for a change.

147
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,225
I'll leave the court

148
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,435
and join

149
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,772
the National Assembly.

150
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,985
Oh, boy.

151
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,615
I'd have a lot to say if I saw him again.

152
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,168
Let's drink, shall we?

153
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,040
MISSED CALL

154
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,669
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING AGAIN?
DO YOU THINK I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND YOU?

155
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,673
COURT

156
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,925
-Good morning, Judge Cha.
-Good morning.

157
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,428
Have this. I bought two and got one free.

158
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,221
Thank you for the drink.

159
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,348
ASSOCIATE JUDGE'S OFFICE

160
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,064
Good morning.

161
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,357
Hi.

162
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,526
For a moment, I thought it was Monday.

163
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,654
You worked late on Friday as well.

164
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,656
I have a lot to read.

165
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,125
Well, it was "buy one, get one free."

166
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,254
I do have things to thank you for as well.

167
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,093
You listened to my story when I was drunk.

168
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,640
Actually, it was my first time
talking about myself--

169
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,099
It made me uncomfortable.

170
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,230
When my colleagues talk
about their personal lives and secrets,

171
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,274
it's pretty bothersome.

172
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,320
I don't like it when others know about me.

173
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,781
I see.

174
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,911
I missed the chance to tell you this then.

175
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,458
We're here together to work.
Then let's just work.

176
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,169
Okay.

177
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,555
Counsel. Your statement.

178
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,015
Hyeon-ji admits to the charge

179
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,643
of making a fraudulent deal
on an online thrift store

180
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,395
and regrets it deeply.

181
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,606
Her father also promised
that he'd take better care of her

182
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,067
if you impose a mild punishment on her.

183
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,611
We ask for leniency.

184
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,156
Mr. Yoo. In the previous trial,

185
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,494
the court asked you to go
to an alcoholism counseling center.

186
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,788
But you stopped going.

187
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,876
I had to work,
so I couldn't go every time.

188
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,460
But you should have still gone!

189
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,046
Hyeon-ji won't change if you don't.

190
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,465
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,888
Do you work steadily these days?

192
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,349
The economy is so bad right now…

193
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,144
-You're a day laborer, correct?
-Yes.

194
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,563
We'll send you
to a vocational counseling center.

195
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,856
Get counseling.

196
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,483
And make sure to return

197
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,738
the 60,000 won

198
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,576
you obtained fraudulently
to the victim, okay?

199
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,162
Yes, Your Honor.

200
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,082
Yoo Hyeon-ji. In the previous trials,

201
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,417
I gave you two chances.

202
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,004
But here you are in court again.

203
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,715
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,217
That's too bad.
Since it's the third time, you're out.

205
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,932
The court has reached a decision.
The court sentences Yoo Hyeon-ji

206
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,936
to one year of probation and one year
at a juvenile protection institution.

207
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,020
Your Honor.

208
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,108
Hyeon-ji.

209
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,320
Your Honor.

210
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,739
-Hyeon-ji…
-You must leave now.

211
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,660
Hyeon-ji?

212
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,455
Let's change Hyeon-ji's sentence.

213
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,540
When she's released
from the classification center,

214
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,419
send her to a juvenile care home
instead of a protection institution.

215
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,963
Not Shalom, but Pureum.

216
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,091
It weighs on your mind, doesn't it?

217
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,636
It's meaningless.

218
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,723
Yes, sir. I'll call
Pureum Home for Girls right away.

219
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,309
Also, tell them that we'll be conducting
an inspection this week.

220
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,727
Yes, sir.

221
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,023
What did he mean by that earlier?

222
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,900
Why was the sentencing meaningless?

223
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,611
How much did Hyeon-ji get
from her scam this time?

224
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,989
-Just 60,000 won.
-Exactly. Just 60,000 won.

225
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,743
We can't send her to a reformatory
just for 60,000 won, right?

226
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,869
Right.

227
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,915
But he can't send her back home.
He already gave her two chances.

228
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,876
So he was going to
put her in a protection institution,

229
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,629
but then he questioned himself

230
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,215
whether it was
an appropriate punishment for her.

231
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,468
She's 14,
so she can't even work part-time.

232
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,178
And no one in her family has an income.

233
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,349
That's why she did it.
She did it to survive.

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,854
Her alcoholic father,
who doesn't take care of his daughter,

235
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,731
is the cause of the problem.

236
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,860
So he thought it was meaningless to impose
a severe punishment on the child.

237
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,279
That's why he changed his mind

238
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,448
to send her to a juvenile care home

239
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,908
where she will be put
under the care of a foster family.

240
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,868
I see.

241
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,704
He gave her a better environment
instead of punishing her.

242
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,748
And while she's staying there,

243
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,750
her father can undergo
alcoholism treatment

244
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,462
and get job counseling to build up
the strength to raise his child again.

245
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,631
They say each court decision shows
what the judge in charge is like.

246
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,508
That's quite unexpected.

247
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,803
Unexpected?
I'll tell Mr. Kang that you said that.

248
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,890
You just don't know it.
He's actually a good person.

249
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,559
By the way, why is it always Pureum?

250
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,352
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

251
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,647
Well, it's the first juvenile care home
established by our court.

252
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,858
And, most importantly,
it's run by Ms. O Seon-ja.

253
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,234
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
O SEON-JA

254
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,072
I know this has many questions,
but take it seriously.

255
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,406
-Do it honestly.
-Jeez.

256
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,908
Write down your names.

257
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,909
PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT

258
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,870
Yu-gyeong. Are you doing okay these days?

259
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,291
-Yes.
-There are many reasons for anxiety.

260
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,628
For example, your future is uncertain.

261
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,464
Or you think your future is doomed.

262
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,051
Eun-sol got a good score on the GED

263
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,095
-and got two cooking certificates.
-Yes.

264
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,891
So I suggest that she should go
to a culinary arts school.

265
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,645
Thank you. Thank you so much.

266
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,690
Don't thank me. Eun-sol did all the work.

267
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,025
-What?
-Look at that.

268
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,485
Hey, what the…

269
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,694
Look, a hole! Hey, guys.

270
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,613
-Want some gimbap?
-Are you done?

271
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,073
We're still on it.

272
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,825
You guys made a mess.

273
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,120
-This is more delicious. Here you go.
-Okay.

274
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,872
Ms. O Seon-ja runs Pureum?

275
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,500
O Seon-ja, the star lecturer
and youth counselor?

276
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,626
Yes.

277
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,129
That's awesome.

278
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,716
But it's rumored
that she has a bad temper.

279
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,427
Hey, go out and see if you can find

280
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,389
a good-natured person among those
who deal with young offenders?

281
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,057
This concerns their lives.

282
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,018
Do you think
just anybody can stomach this work, moron?

283
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,897
You're right.
Well, the people in this court prove that.

284
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,609
And above all else,
Pureum's program is different.

285
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,070
Psychology consultation,
career counseling,

286
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,655
and even coaching for guardians.

287
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,449
As you all know,

288
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,828
we have to start inspecting
the facilities in the coming week.

289
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,955
Reformatories,
juvenile classification centers,

290
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,292
Cheonurye, the protection institution,
and the juvenile care homes.

291
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,128
The court has to inspect
all the affiliated facilities once a year

292
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,629
to check the conditions

293
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,299
and to see if they're taking
good care of young offenders

294
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,301
or if they've committed
any irregularities.

295
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,387
If a prisoner escapes from prison,

296
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,182
judges don't need to go after them.

297
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,684
But if a young offender escapes
from one of these homes,

298
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,896
juvenile judges have to either
go after them or find a way to catch them.

299
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,983
Why? Because juvenile judges
have to supervise them as well.

300
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,029
Well, I was thinking we should inspect
the juvenile care homes first.

301
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,198
Isn't this your first time?

302
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,616
Yes.

303
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,743
The previous court I was with
had no affiliations.

304
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,287
Very well. It'll be helpful
to see them yourself.

305
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,581
Judge Cha couldn't go last year.
It's his first time, too.

306
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,458
-Yes.
-Make some time tomorrow

307
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,835
and let's all go together. Okay?

308
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,466
Both of you are visiting
Pureum Home for Girls tomorrow, right?

309
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,759
-Yes.
-Then I suggest

310
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,136
you leave at eleven o'clock at the latest

311
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,972
and have lunch at a rest area.

312
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,641
Because it's located in Nonsan.

313
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,934
I see.

314
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,895
Juvenile care homes
are not state-run detainment facilities

315
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,897
but typical family homes,

316
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,066
and the state can't
properly support them financially.

317
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,152
That's why they're not
in the metropolitan area,

318
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,029
since housing costs are quite high.

319
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,115
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

320
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,828
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

321
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,334
Hello.

322
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:57,673
I'm O Seon-ja, the elderly friend
of the youth. Nice to meet you.

323
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,842
All right.
Let me ask you a question first.

324
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,638
Everyone. What's the question
that children hate to be asked the most?

325
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,931
Yes, that's right.

326
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,643
Children hate all questions
asked by grown-ups.

327
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,187
Yes, that's the correct answer.

328
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,439
There are two reasons.

329
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,068
First is because they assume
you have an ulterior motive.

330
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,237
"What is my mom trying
to nag me about this time?"

331
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,863
That's what they think.

332
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,741
The second is this. What is your dream?

333
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,372
I feel sorry
for making you do all the driving.

334
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,457
I'll drive on the way back.

335
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,920
No, sir. It's nice to be outside,
getting some fresh air.

336
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,797
I'm glad to hear that.

337
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,092
Why don't you get some sleep
on our way there?

338
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,011
We'll wake you up
when we get to a rest area.

339
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,597
No. That's not polite to the driver.

340
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,408
LIST OF GIRLS AT PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

341
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,951
A total of eight girls.

342
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,830
Prostitution, fraud, theft, assault…

343
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,666
One even received a disposition notice.

344
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,168
It's the complete package.

345
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,591
-Are the highlighted ones from our court?
-Yes. This home is only for girls.

346
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,970
Choi Yeong-na, O Yeon-ji,
and Woo Min-gyeong. It's these three.

347
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,723
Yeong-na is the girl you're in charge of.

348
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,559
She was detained at
a protection institution for prostitution.

349
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,729
Choi Yeong-na. Do you have any last words?

350
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,108
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

351
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,737
I'm in charge of Yeon-ji and Min-gyeong,

352
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,114
who were put on probation
for assault and theft.

353
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,741
It's run by a married couple?

354
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,201
Well…

355
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,911
Technically speaking, no.

356
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,663
Her husband, who works for a conglomerate,

357
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,999
was assigned to an overseas branch
two years ago,

358
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,834
so Ms. O is running it by herself now.

359
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,920
With her two young daughters.

360
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,130
She's amazing.

361
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,092
She takes care of ten children by herself?

362
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,013
Gosh, where did he go again?

363
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,640
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

364
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,142
Hello?
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

365
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,144
Yes, go ahead and speak.

366
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,483
Sorry? What are you saying?

367
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:32,077
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

368
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,870
We're from Yeonhwa District Court.

369
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,585
-Hello.
-Hello.

370
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,670
-Hello.
-Hi.

371
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,048
Hey. How have you been?

372
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,676
Hi, Ms. Joo.

373
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,388
Hi, Judge Cha. I'm calling you
because I can't get a hold of Mr. Kang.

374
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,723
Well, someone

375
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,602
just made a report to our office.

376
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,687
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

377
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,440
Are you sure of what you just said?

378
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,608
Child abuse and embezzlement
at one of the facilities?

379
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,236
If that's true,
this is a really serious matter.

380
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,780
And where is that?

381
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,659
Oh, dear. Hey, girls. Why are you out?

382
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,203
I told you not to crowd in
when we have visitors.

383
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,205
Go back in at once. Go back in.

384
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,665
-Hello.
-Hi.

385
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,001
-Are you doing well?
-Of course. Go on in, please.

386
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,963
It's Pureum. Pureum Home for Girls.

387
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,298
Did you guys say hello?

388
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,133
-Yes.
-Hurry up and go back in.

389
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,843
Go and get things ready, okay?

390
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,094
Are you sure it's Pureum?

391
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,971
Yes. I asked
several times out of disbelief.

392
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,681
It's definitely Pureum.

393
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,101
But it's only a suspicion, so just take it
for what it's worth during the inspection.

394
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,936
Okay. I'll do that.

395
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,230
Bye.

396
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,534
-Judge Cha Tae-ju?
-Yes.

397
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,371
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm O Seon-ja, I run the care home.

398
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,289
I see.

399
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,876
-My hands are dirty.
-It's okay. I'm Cha Tae-ju.

400
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,252
-Please go on in.
-Okay.

401
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,261
CONGRATULATIONS ON COMPLETING
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

402
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,933
-All right.
-Get up and greet them properly.

403
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,060
-It's been a while. Let's take a picture.
-Yes.

404
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,146
-Who can take it for us?
-I'll do it.

405
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,689
Okay.

406
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,775
-You guys, too.
-Here.

407
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,027
-Sit down.
-Hello.

408
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,862
Yeon-ji and Min-gyeong, how have you been?

409
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,073
Judge Cha. Come here
and take a picture with us.

410
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,407
Come here, girls.

411
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,575
-Hurry.
-Here.

412
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,993
Take a picture with us after this.

413
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,078
Don't worry about them.

414
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,871
-All right.
-They're my daughters.

415
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,414
I see!

416
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,209
They're better at taking photos
than being in them.

417
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,710
All right. Ready?

418
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,963
One, two, three.

419
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,924
One, two, three.

420
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,552
You should join us, Judge Cha.

421
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,719
-Good.
-Okay.

422
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,222
Well, Mr. Kang.
I have something to tell you.

423
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,265
Okay. Go ahead.

424
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,226
Now you can all go back
to what you were doing.

425
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,895
What exactly did she say?

426
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,315
She said someone reported them
for child abuse and embezzlement.

427
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,070
Was it really Pureum?

428
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,197
It's just a suspicion,
but she wants us take note of it.

429
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,574
Forget it then.

430
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,661
-Cover it up.
-Mr. Kang.

431
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,747
Try spending a day at the office.

432
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,708
They get those calls several times a day.

433
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,460
They say their kids have been abused
or were blackmailed

434
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,796
while claiming to be
the child's parent, uncle, or aunt.

435
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,089
Do you know why?

436
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,925
Because they want the court
to suspect the facilities.

437
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,845
That will get them out of there sooner.

438
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,888
No matter how many false reports we get,

439
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,183
I think it's the court's duty
to look into them.

440
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,854
Since we're the ones sending them here,
we have to be responsible.

441
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,069
Considering the seriousness of the matter,
we should look into it thoroughly, sir.

442
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,405
ASSEMBLYMAN EOM JUN-GI
DO YOU HAVE TIME? LET'S HAVE DINNER.

443
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,827
I clearly told you.

444
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,204
Don't do it.

445
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,334
Well, then…

446
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,418
The inspection…

447
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,629
You two will be fine alone, right?

448
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,630
Sorry?

449
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,132
It was the TV station.

450
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,092
I have to go now.

451
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,552
But…

452
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,554
-Wait, Mr. Kang.
-What?

453
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,514
It's our first time
doing an inspection here.

454
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,225
It's not any different from other places.

455
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,727
Just do what you usually do.

456
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,072
Yeon-ji.

457
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,323
You too, Hye-rim.

458
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,493
And then after that…

459
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,497
The books, receipts,
event photos, and bankbooks

460
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,042
that you requested are all in the office.

461
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,545
-Put the tea over there.
-Okay.

462
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,552
Since there are fewer kids here
than a protection institution,

463
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,179
I thought we'd be done soon.

464
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,308
But there's more to check than I thought.
How should we do this?

465
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,361
Should we just go home?
I'm about to be pretty annoyed.

466
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,863
I'm sorry. I was lost in thought.

467
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,534
I know how you feel,

468
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,536
but do you really think
it's the court's duty?

469
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,037
Sorry?

470
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,331
No matter how many false reports we get,

471
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,001
I think it's the court's duty
to look into them.

472
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,212
It's not just about finding out
whether it's a lie.

473
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,383
To some people,

474
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:42,137
the court's inspection could be seen
as unfair and unreasonable.

475
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,682
When the state
designates a home like this one,

476
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,809
they need to review
all those who are involved

477
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,728
and check the many requisites
they must meet.

478
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,104
Because it's closely tied

479
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,232
with government offices
and all kinds of permits.

480
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,192
It isn't just about our court.

481
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,697
That's why Mr. Kang disapproved
and why we should be discreet.

482
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,783
Yes, I'm aware of that.

483
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,496
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

484
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,165
And if your suspicion is right,

485
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,667
they'll be exposed
even if we don't do anything.

486
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,589
because children are impatient.

487
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,552
Mom.

488
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,596
Goodness, my daughter.

489
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,599
Thank you.

490
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,310
You're the best. Oh, dear.

491
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,690
This is nice.

492
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,444
Where are A-jin and the other girls?

493
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,031
She's holed up upstairs
and won't come out even if I call her.

494
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,325
That rude bitch, for God's sake.

495
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,077
Can you please stop cursing?

496
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,458
The girls on duty went to the senior home
and the rest are being questioned.

497
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,460
Questioned?

498
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,339
-What do you mean?
-I don't know. The judges called them.

499
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,299
Isn't it part of the inspection?

500
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,884
What are you saying?

501
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,928
This isn't their first visit.

502
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,971
Since when did they interview the kids?

503
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,807
Mom.

504
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,266
When did they take them?

505
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,726
A while ago.

506
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,356
She's the devil.

507
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,652
The juvenile classification center
was much better.

508
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,363
This place is shit.

509
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,991
Can you elaborate on that?

510
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,222
Let's eat.

511
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,393
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

512
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,686
It's a sin to leave leftovers.

513
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,397
If you leave any,
you're having it for dinner. Got it?

514
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,773
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

515
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,951
Ms. O.

516
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,745
This rice seems to have gone bad.

517
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,206
What are you saying? It's edible.

518
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,207
It won't kill you.

519
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,834
But still, this is…

520
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,878
Can you give us another?

521
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,633
Gosh.

522
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,554
You wouldn't have had
any better back home.

523
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,847
Why are you so picky?

524
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,100
Don't eat then. You don't deserve it.

525
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,852
I'm sorry, Ms. O.

526
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,729
I'll eat it. Please let me eat.

527
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,105
Aren't you done eating?

528
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,150
Since you're finished,
go back to your room.

529
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,235
Please forgive me.

530
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,570
Darn it!

531
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,240
Whining at the table, damn it.

532
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,409
Don't cry or I'll beat you.

533
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,329
Crying doesn't solve anything around here.

534
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,665
Go upstairs.

535
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,712
Go ahead and eat.
You have to go to school.

536
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,758
This early in the morning?

537
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,636
What a nuisance.

538
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,767
She did that to all of us.

539
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,061
She treats us like shit
because she feeds us.

540
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,313
But she gives us spoiled food.

541
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:24,067
And she makes us do laundry,
clean the house, or wash dishes.

542
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,277
We clean our neighbors' houses too

543
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,445
like bums.

544
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,659
She starves us if we don't work.

545
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,078
I was told not to tell others about this.

546
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,788
Just tell us.

547
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,499
Actually, one of the girls is
in a hospital now.

548
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,960
For God's sake!

549
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,420
Hey!

550
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,546
Come here.

551
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,300
Come here. How dare you?

552
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,095
-How dare you?
-Please forgive me!

553
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,056
-Do you want to die or what?
-Please forgive me!

554
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,643
How dare you talk back?
Do you think I'm your buddy?

555
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,105
-Damn it! Watch your mouth.
-Please, stop.

556
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,356
Her name is Do Yu-gyeong.

557
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,401
She talked back to her once and…

558
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,528
You know what happens
if you lie to us, right?

559
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,737
It's true.

560
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,467
But why is this not in the following year?

561
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,761
-Number one. Yes.
-Yes.

562
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,929
A witness, maybe…

563
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,639
Events or…

564
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,994
-Snacks.
-Yes.

565
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,120
-Groceries.
-Yes.

566
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,455
Twenty…

567
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,998
GLAMPING IN FALL
SEPTEMBER 25, 2021

568
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,000
Got it.

569
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,793
-It checks out.
-Okay.

570
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,757
You've made a difficult decision.

571
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,384
Thank you, sir.

572
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,012
It's all thanks to Mr. Eom.

573
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,349
You look much more handsome in real life.

574
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,060
You have sharp features.

575
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,144
Is that so?

576
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,231
I'm not kidding.

577
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,650
I think you'll become a great man.

578
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,654
He's the chairman of SY Chemicals.

579
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,656
-He wanted to meet you badly.
-I see.

580
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,992
Everyone in the party got help from him.

581
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,162
Don't you worry about anything, Mr. Kang.

582
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,248
As for me,
when I put my mind to something,

583
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,542
I achieve it by all means.

584
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,588
I'll make sure that you end up

585
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:55,218
wearing an assemblyman's badge
in the near future.

586
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,596
Thank you, sir.

587
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,599
I thought it'd take you quite a while
to make the decision.

588
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,518
Yes, I thought so too.

589
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,480
But your words lingered in my mind.

590
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,817
"It's time the Assembly

591
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,278
opened its ears to the youth."

592
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,537
Oh, boy. You know…

593
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,873
I can be pretty scary in the courthouse.

594
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,964
See? I'm a shrewd judge of character.

595
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,299
It's not just the dinner.

596
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,511
I've made plans for the entire night.

597
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,471
You can look forward to it.

598
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,640
All right. Let's have a drink.

599
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,599
Okay.

600
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,984
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

601
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,071
Did they say that I did that?

602
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,871
It's the court that punishes them,

603
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,999
but I'm the one
who takes care of them every day.

604
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,670
You see them only
for two to three hours when you visit,

605
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,132
but we're the ones who wrestle with them

606
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,384
on a daily basis to bring about change.

607
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,435
What's the big deal?

608
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,686
Let's eat.

609
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,231
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

610
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,566
It's a sin to leave leftovers.

611
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,610
If you leave any,
it'll be your dinner. Got it?

612
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,944
-Yes.
-Okay.

613
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,243
-It's hot.
-Ms. O.

614
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,623
I'll finish this food.
In return, would you allow us to smoke?

615
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,291
What?

616
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,544
Then I promise I'll behave.

617
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,379
-Me, too.
-Don't make me laugh.

618
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,175
-This sucks.
-I knew it wouldn't work.

619
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:04,180
Come on, this isn't an institution.
We're not here to be punished.

620
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,932
-Am I wrong, Ji-eun?
-No, not at all.

621
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,059
-You all have lots to say, don't you?
-We do.

622
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,769
Why are you so strict?

623
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,562
The other homes allow smoking.

624
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,273
Where? Which homes allow such a thing?

625
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,650
Stop talking nonsense.

626
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,069
-This place is too uptight.
-Just eat your meal.

627
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,362
Dammit.

628
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,114
Is she out of her mind?

629
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,533
What are you doing?

630
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,410
You just threw precious food.

631
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,829
"You wouldn't have had
any better back home."

632
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,665
Is that what you think?

633
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,917
Stop glaring at me.

634
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,460
There's a limit to my patience.

635
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,338
Fuck it. I won't eat.

636
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,384
Don't eat then. You don't deserve it.

637
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,678
This early in the morning?

638
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,096
What a nuisance.

639
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,305
"What a nuisance."

640
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,766
Be quiet and eat.

641
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:03,239
I seriously contemplated
whether I should let her smoke.

642
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,367
She said she'd behave if I let her.

643
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,661
She said the other homes turn a blind eye.

644
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,538
But that's not right.

645
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,623
No schools allow their students to smoke.

646
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,293
I don't allow my own children to smoke.

647
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,460
They said

648
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,007
you also made them work
at your neighbors' houses.

649
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,177
Is that what they said?

650
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,640
Judge Cha.

651
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,729
How long do you think it takes
to build a place like this in Korea?

652
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,941
-Sorry?
-I don't know. Maybe one or two years?

653
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,026
Four years.

654
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,737
It took this place four years.

655
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,990
An eyesore facility!

656
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,742
-We oppose!
-We oppose!

657
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,660
LAND RESERVED FOR PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

658
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,830
That's the time it took
to get consent from the people

659
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,666
in this neighborhood
even before construction began.

660
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,710
No matter how young the children here are,

661
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,338
they're just criminals
in the eyes of regular people.

662
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,965
-Sir.
-Stop building a facility for criminals!

663
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,092
Stop it!

664
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:15,061
So when kids come here,
the first things I teach them

665
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,937
are housework and greetings.

666
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,980
-Stop it.
-Whatever.

667
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,565
Hey, you almost got me wet.

668
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,484
Whatever the excuse may be,

669
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,570
it's true that they did wrong.

670
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,740
Then there's only one way
to overcome the prejudice against them,

671
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,909
which is to take the bull by the horns

672
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,577
and do volunteer work.

673
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,497
High-five, grandpa!

674
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,623
That was cool.

675
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,665
Shake your butt.

676
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,044
Shake your butt! Shake it!

677
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:42,755
And?

678
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,383
Have the people changed?

679
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,303
Of course. These kids, who were used to
having fingers pointed at them,

680
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,847
are now used to receiving compliments.

681
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,392
Then why did they make such statements?

682
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,352
Because they know

683
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,687
that nothing is compulsory here.

684
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,816
They came here
because they have no guardian

685
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,693
taking care of them
or they have committed crimes.

686
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,821
They know
that this is a juvenile care home,

687
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,656
different from
reformatories or institutions

688
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,492
where they are forcibly detained.

689
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,121
They're protesting
to make the rules less strict.

690
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,374
You were duped by them.

691
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,543
We know that they lied to us.

692
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,840
Yu-gyeong is in a hospital

693
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,591
because Ms. O assaulted her?

694
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,301
Yes.

695
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,435
Call the hospital where Do Yu-gyeong is.

696
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,856
Don't you know the number?

697
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,873
DAE GYEONG HOSPITAL
ORTHOPEDICS OFFICE

698
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,208
Hello? General Ward of Orthopedics.

699
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,960
This is Do Yu-gyeong's guardian.

700
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,797
How is Yu-gyeong doing?

701
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:11,260
She's a bit lazy with her rehab exercises,
but she's getting better.

702
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,638
How was she
when she arrived at the hospital?

703
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,933
Can you tell us in detail
why she underwent surgery?

704
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:18,851
Who is this?

705
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,353
We can't give out patient information
unless you're a guardian.

706
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,564
This is Judge Sim Eun-seok
from Yeonhwa District Court.

707
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,276
You must've received an official document
asking for cooperation by now.

708
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,447
We're about to initiate legal proceedings
for a case involving this patient.

709
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,406
One moment, please.

710
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,452
Yes. We've received the document.

711
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,830
She had surgery
because her femur was fractured.

712
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,957
And she testified to the police

713
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,336
that she was assaulted
by a mob of girls her age.

714
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,171
That's what it says on her record.

715
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,800
I see. Thank you.

716
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,552
Judge Sim. Let me explain.

717
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,805
It was her. She started it.

718
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,982
You fucking bitch.
I told you not to piss me off.

719
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,738
Yes.

720
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,368
You're right, Ms. O.

721
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,287
People like you play a much bigger role

722
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,373
than us judges

723
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,501
who spend only two or three hours

724
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,462
with these young offenders.

725
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,800
We're well aware of that.

726
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,013
But that's another story.

727
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,019
The court subsidies.

728
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:48,983
You're given 500,000 won
per child every month.

729
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,693
Where did you spend it?

730
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,449
These documents should tell you.

731
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,161
Visits to museums or concerts,
play therapy,

732
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,747
outdoor activities like field trips,
and food expenses.

733
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,873
You charged us

734
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,295
4.5 million more won last month,
which is much more than last year.

735
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,546
But the children claim

736
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,674
that they didn't take part
in such activities.

737
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,219
And most of the documents and receipts

738
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,346
were also missing.

739
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,734
I was looking forward to meeting you

740
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,363
since you have a clear set of values.

741
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,076
I'm disappointed.

742
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,416
I guess money does make
the world go round.

743
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,421
I just needed it briefly.

744
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,465
I was going to put it back. I mean it.

745
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,426
The problem here is
that you used the money

746
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,179
for personal use.

747
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:10,272
The inspection of Pureum Home for Girls
is over now.

748
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,108
It has disclosed details
of the group assault at the home

749
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,110
and embezzlement

750
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,614
that you didn't report to the court.

751
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,910
All of these documents will be taken
for further investigation.

752
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,205
You can expect a visit
from special investigators

753
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,459
or a summons to appear in court.

754
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:33,921
Wait…

755
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,800
Wait a minute, please.

756
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,385
Judge Sim.

757
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,890
Depending on the outcome
of the investigation,

758
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,435
the court may take steps
to annul the status of this home.

759
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,354
Furthermore,
the court may cancel all permits

760
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,815
and take criminal proceedings against you.

761
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,650
Judge Sim.

762
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,486
Wait…

763
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,120
We have to report this to Mr. Kang, right?

764
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,290
I'll do it tomorrow.

765
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,669
Are you going straight home?

766
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,421
No. To the hospital.

767
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,551
Do Yu-gyeong.
We should hear her side of the story.

768
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,595
Okay.

769
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,356
DO YU-GYEONG, AGE 16
DAE GYEONG HOSPITAL

770
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,782
She used the money…

771
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,411
for my surgery.

772
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,541
The girls' parents

773
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,169
refused to pay for the surgery.

774
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,547
They said there was no evidence.

775
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,760
And I lost contact with my mom…

776
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,431
a long time ago when she remarried.

777
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,517
My doctor said I wouldn't be able to walk

778
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,188
if I didn't have surgery right away, so…

779
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:21,445
It all happened because of me.
Can't you let this slide just this once?

780
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,281
I'll work and pay back the money.

781
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,409
While I was staying there,

782
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,704
I had decent meals and slept comfortably

783
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,373
for the first time in my life.

784
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:38,629
I was overjoyed and grateful every day.

785
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,632
And I realized

786
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,510
that being loved

787
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:50,766
is when someone
puts a side dish on my rice.

788
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,313
I promised myself
that I'd live a good life.

789
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,607
I found a new purpose

790
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,819
because I want to repay her
for her kindness.

791
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,492
But she shouldn't have
kept it from the court.

792
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,912
I asked her not to report it to the court.

793
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,664
I begged her.

794
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,757
I was afraid
that I'd be kicked out of there.

795
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,760
I can't go anywhere else.

796
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,972
I want to stay with Ms. O.

797
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,728
I was looking forward to meeting you
since you have a clear set of values.

798
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,188
I'm disappointed.

799
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,567
I guess money does make
the world go round.

800
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,507
Your call could not be connected.
Please leave a message after the tone.

801
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,550
Additional charges--

802
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,137
ENTRANCE

803
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,096
Mom.

804
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,473
-Mom.
-Kim A-jin.

805
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,684
A-jin.

806
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,312
-Judge Cha.
-What happened?

807
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,857
What should I do, Judge Cha? My mom…

808
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,191
-Let's go.
-My mom…

809
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:35,704
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

810
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,557
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

811
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,315
Ms. O.

812
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,721
Ms. O!

813
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,149
Where's Ms. O?

814
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,568
Where are the kids?

815
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,279
Where did they all go?

816
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,781
What happened?

817
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,619
Kim A-reum.

818
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,537
Mom…

819
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,249
was taken by ambulance
to the hospital a while ago.

820
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,501
She suddenly collapsed.

821
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,044
What?

822
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,135
Mom. Are you okay, Mom?

823
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,139
What's wrong? Are you okay?

824
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,267
Mom!

825
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,019
Open your eyes, Mom!

826
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,895
I thought about it.

827
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,440
It's all because of those bitches.

828
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,986
It was because of them
that Mom collapsed today.

829
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,948
And it's because of them
that I don't get to see my dad.

830
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,202
Mom said Dad can't come visit
because he was assigned overseas.

831
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,206
But that's all a lie. They got a divorce

832
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,292
because of this.

833
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,754
Because of this damn care home
that Mom wouldn't give up on!

834
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,964
Those bitches are the ones to blame.

835
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,553
A few days ago, my sister had bad cramps,

836
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,930
so she was taken to the emergency room.

837
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,016
But Mom didn't come

838
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,603
because feeding those bitches
mattered more to her than A-jin in the ER.

839
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,687
Just…

840
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,398
We were…

841
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,153
We'd always come next.

842
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,214
Shit, we were almost caught.
We could have been screwed.

843
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,091
-I know.
-Shut the fuck up.

844
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,050
Be quiet.

845
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,927
Gosh, I'm afraid that we'll get caught.

846
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,178
Shut up.

847
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,973
-Hey, go faster. It's freaking cold.
-Don't push me.

848
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,476
-How far do we have to go?
-Wait, guys.

849
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,438
So? Were you just standing there
watching them while they ran away?

850
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,942
Were you glad that they left?

851
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,110
No.

852
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,277
Then?

853
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,321
I told them to get out.

854
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,617
What?

855
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,121
I told them to get out of my house!

856
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,375
Hey.

857
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,876
-Hey!
-Hey, you fucking bitch!

858
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,254
Hey, what the fuck!
Are you on drugs or what?

859
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,006
What a crazy fucking bitch.

860
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,677
-Hey!
-You fucking bitch!

861
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,804
-Are you out of your mind?
-Stop it.

862
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,557
-Hey!
-That's enough.

863
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,687
Hey! Are you trying
to go where your mom is?

864
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,605
Hey.

865
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,732
You fucking bitch!

866
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,026
Are you nuts?

867
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,322
I'm not the one who's crazy.

868
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,033
It's you.

869
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,870
Get lost!

870
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,206
Hey, stop her!

871
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,293
Hey, you crazy fucking bitch!

872
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,088
-Let go of her!
-Let go!

873
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,216
-Hey!
-Get the fuck off!

874
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,427
Get her off me, fuck!

875
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,972
-Are you okay, Yeong-na?
-Yeong-na.

876
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,599
-Are you okay?
-She must be crazy.

877
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,143
That bitch is crazy.
What's wrong with her?

878
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,645
-What's she doing?
-What the fuck is she trying to do?

879
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,105
Seriously, what the fuck.

880
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,317
Get out!

881
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,906
It's all over now.

882
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,701
Both this home

883
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:26,912
and those bitches.

884
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,249
It's all over.

885
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,223
Mom.

886
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,557
Judge Cha.

887
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,311
Are you okay now?

888
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,940
Doctor. The patient
regained consciousness.

889
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,274
All right.

890
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,401
Yeon-ji. Wait for us.

891
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,444
Come on.

892
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,446
Gosh, what is this place?

893
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,365
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Darn it.

894
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,575
What's wrong?

895
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,787
Are you okay? You should've been careful.

896
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,627
Let's go back. We can't walk there.

897
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,088
It'll be another hour
to the train station.

898
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,382
And if we do? That bitch
will welcome us with open arms.

899
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,260
If you don't want to go then get lost,
you fucking bitch.

900
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,386
I'll go by myself.

901
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,722
-Hey, get up.
-Come on, get up.

902
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:30,642
Be careful.

903
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,396
-I can't walk anymore!
-Hey, hold on.

904
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,526
Hey. You have some money, right?

905
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,778
Hand it over.

906
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,031
I said, hand it over.

907
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,789
JUDGE CHA TAE-JU

908
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,670
Well…

909
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,173
I think it's been about three hours. No.

910
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,720
We came here for an inspection,
and someone made a report--

911
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,982
Just a second, please.

912
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,361
I'll call you back.

913
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,133
It was you.

914
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,697

54 YEONHWA-RO 9-GIL

916
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,843
Yes, I found it.

917
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,306
But I seem to have missed her.

918
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,413
The person…

919
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,792
who wants this home to be shut down.

920
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,587
The one who made the report…

921
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,092
was you.

922
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,253
