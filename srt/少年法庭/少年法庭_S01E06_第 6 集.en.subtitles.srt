1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,724
The prosecution charged the faculty
of Moonkwang High School and the parents

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,351
involved in the Exam Paper Leak Scandal
for obstruction of business

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,146
and forwarded the case
to Yeonhwa District Court.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,525
This corruption scandal
involves a special club named Descartes

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,863
whose members' parents are
in the top 3% of wealth and prestige.

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,074
The club leaked exam papers
to its members for about a year.

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,745
As the students involved
strongly denied the charge,

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,663
the case was forwarded

9
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:43,168
to the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate
Division as a criminal court case--

10
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,299
Before that,
are you involved in this case at all?

11
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,136
Why are the police at our door?

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,429
Descartes.

13
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,683
The final exams…
I left the group right after…

14
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,399
It's been a while,

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,234
Sim Eun-seok.

16
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,826
I was going to go to the courthouse, but…

17
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,662
Hey.

18
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,750
Let go.

19
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,008
Do you know how long
I've been waiting here?

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,177
I clearly told you…

21
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,474
not to show up in front of me again,

22
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,478
or that I'd kill you.

23
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,108
Your doctor called me.

24
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,362
Hello? Namgung I-hwan, speaking.

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,822
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

26
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,989
Sorry?

27
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,783
Who?

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,077
He couldn't get a hold of you.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,288
He was worried something had happened
and asked me to find you.

30
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,668
You haven't been getting
counseling for months.

31
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,091
Are you getting any sleep?

32
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,093
Are you eating well?

33
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,720
You'll die if you don't.

34
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,683
You must have forgotten.

35
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,478
I already died

36
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,439
five years ago.

37
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,363
You know that.

38
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,097
What about the police?

39
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,516
There was a hit-and-run accident
nearby today.

40
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,643
They were here to investigate that.

41
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,067
Descartes?

42
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,986
Explain.

43
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,130
I told you not to do it!

44
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,091
Sin-u.

45
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,344
Are you okay, Sin-u?

46
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,345
I'm okay.

47
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,145
It was just once.
Last semester's final exam.

48
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,481
He quit right away
because you were so strongly against it.

49
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,150
That's all.

50
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,193
Because everyone else did it!

51
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,324
Even the members themselves
don't know who else was in the club,

52
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,285
except for the teaching director
who organized it all.

53
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,997
-If we stay quiet--
-Stop talking nonsense!

54
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,957
How can I stay quiet?

55
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm…

56
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,132
I'm in charge of that case!

57
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,552
Honey.

58
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,596
That case

59
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,891
was assigned to me today.

60
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,311
Not knowing this would happen,

61
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,898
I decided to take it on.

62
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,733
What are you saying?

63
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,943
The whole country is focused on this case!

64
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,654
I can't let the people involved
get off easy!

65
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,241
Everyone knows whose father I am.

66
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,827
You think the teaching director
will stay quiet?

67
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,456
If he tries to bring me down,
irritated by my decision…

68
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,586
we're all done for.

69
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,547
Then what's going to happen to Sin-u?

70
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,801
He's in 12th grade.

71
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,683
What do we do?

72
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,356
I handed in…

73
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,652
my resignation today.

74
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,289
I've been a judge for 22 years.

75
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,960
And this is…

76
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,383
the last case

77
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,719
I'll be in charge of.

78
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,227
It can't be.

79
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,939
No. Honey.

80
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:20,982
I told you.

81
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:25,027
You should've listened to me!
Why didn't you?

82
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,075
You did it because everyone else did?

83
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,498
That's why…

84
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,085
we ended up here.

85
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,548
No! This can't be!

86
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:51,929
What do I do? Sin-u…

87
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,973
Honey, what do we do?

88
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,567
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

89
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,674
It was just once.
Last semester's final exam.

90
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,802
He quit right away
because you were so strongly against it.

91
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,970
That's all.

92
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,268
Mr. Kang.

93
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,734
Mr. Kang.

94
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,571
Yes?

95
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,699
Where were we?

96
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,869
You were talking
about the Moonkwang High School case.

97
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,912
Right.

98
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,791
The Moonkwang High School
Exam Paper Leak Scandal.

99
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,170
A total of 21 students
will be tried by this court.

100
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,966
Eighteen of them, six in each grade,
will be tried here.

101
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,426
And the other three
who were on the waiting list

102
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,637
will be handled as protection cases.

103
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,978
The presiding judge
of this criminal case will be Judge Sim.

104
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
You've checked, right?

105
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,648
Yes, I have.

106
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,192
Some of the parents involved

107
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,902
are assemblymen, ministers,

108
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,030
doctors at university hospitals,
celebrities,

109
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,410
and even judicial officers.

110
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,829
It won't be easy.

111
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,457
It may put you under more pressure
than the Yeonhwa Child Murder case.

112
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,875
I'm ready for that.

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,255
So, about the three students
who were on the waiting list.

114
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,966
To lessen the burden
of the appointed judge,

115
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,802
Judge Cha, the associate judge,
is supposed to handle them.

116
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,722
But unfortunately,
one of them is a juvenile

117
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,015
you were in charge of before.

118
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,474
Yes, that's right.

119
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,103
You have to handle both the criminal case
and the protection case.

120
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,063
Won't it be too much?

121
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,859
I'll ask the senior presiding judge
to reassign--

122
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,944
No, that's not a problem.

123
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,115
I see.

124
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,163
All right, then.

125
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,207
It's settled then.

126
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,185
-Is the meeting over?
-Yes.

128
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,436
Hi.

129
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,396
-Hi.
-Hi.

130
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,776
Are these the documents
for the Moonkwang case?

131
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,445
Yes. We have the ones
for the protection case first.

132
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,989
The three students
who were on the waiting list.

133
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,992
How should we schedule
the protection cases?

134
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,702
Well, as for me,

135
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,996
I have other cases to look into,
so I'll get back to you.

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,248
Yes, sir. What about you, Judge Sim?

137
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,961
We'll be busy
once the criminal trial begins,

138
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,797
so we should speed things up.

139
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,299
I'll set a date as soon as possible,

140
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,178
so please summon the teachers
in charge as reference witnesses.

141
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,867
PROTECTION CASE RECORDS

142
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,831
I'll turn myself in.

143
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,086
It all happened because of me.

144
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,339
Because of that scandal,

145
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,591
I have trouble sleeping,

146
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,510
and I was so stressed.

147
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,806
I'm glad this happened.

148
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,393
I'll turn myself in.

149
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,477
Sin-u.

150
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,274
What the heck is wrong with you?
What do you mean, you're glad?

151
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,901
You're a senior in high school.
What will happen if you do?

152
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,658
-Think before you speak, for God's sake!
-Honey.

153
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,453
I just can't understand you
no matter how hard I try!

154
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,748
You of all people!

155
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,542
My very own son!

156
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,678
Don't drag your innocent father
down with you.

157
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,557
If you want to die,

158
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,976
go and die on your own, you punk.

159
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,451
Mr. Kang.

160
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,121
You need to leave now to attend
the Press Arbitration Commission meeting.

161
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,331
Okay.

162
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,916
Let's go.

163
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,839
Hey, Mr. Kang!

164
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,675
I'm sad to hear the news.

165
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,887
I thought you, of all people,
would stick around longer.

166
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,098
Mr. Kang, I heard
you're going into politics.

167
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,727
Why are you so surprised?
The whole country knows now.

168
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,312
What?

169
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,273
Today, the Liberty Party
nominated Kang Won-jung,

170
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,194
a panel member of Current Events N Issues
and a judge at Yeonhwa District Court,

171
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,406
for the by-election
scheduled to be held this October.

172
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,117
The Moonkwang High School
Exam Paper Leak Scandal

173
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,578
will be his last case
at Yeonhwa District Court…

174
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,665
Judge Sim. You should see this.

175
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,835
It's about Mr. Kang.

176
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,504
-It's…
-What is it?

177
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,179
JUDGE KANG OF CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES
TO RESIGN AND GO INTO POLITICS

178
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,307
PRESIDING JUDGE KANG,
ON CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES

179
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,228
You may now start crossing.

180
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,025
JUDGE KANG OF CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES
ANNOUNCES FORAY INTO POLITICS

181
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,631
-Here he comes!
-There he is!

182
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,427
Why are you suddenly going into politics?

183
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,555
You're leaving the court after 22 years.
Please tell us how you feel.

184
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,807
Are you leaving
Current Events N Issues, too?

185
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,018
-Please say something, Mr. Kang!
-Please say a word!

186
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,311
Mr. Kang!

187
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,438
Did you watch the news?

188
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,773
Yes.

189
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,276
As you know,
our ratings have dropped as of late

190
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,487
because of
the Legislation-Judiciary Committee.

191
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,615
I knew we could count on you.

192
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,200
It's better than I expected.
The response is very positive.

193
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,370
We need to pull on the oars hard
while the tide is rising.

194
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,457
Go ahead.

195
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,544
Dad. I'm sorry.

196
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,345
The Exam Paper Leak Scandal
at Moonkwang High School.

197
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,638
You're in charge, right?

198
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,849
Yes, I am.

199
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,643
Wrap it up well.

200
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,063
And let's take this chance
to turn the tables.

201
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,398
The National Assembly
is also paying attention.

202
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,109
Educating our children
is an important issue,

203
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,279
but a member of the opposition
is involved in it.

204
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,870
Politics is all about image.

205
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,039
I know you are a man of virtue,

206
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,750
but make sure
to stay out of trouble and rumors.

207
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,418
Just keep going

208
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,380
as you always have been.

209
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,383
This is the real beginning,

210
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,010
Assemblyman Kang Won-jung.

211
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,265
All right!

212
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,751
You can't enter the ER
without an access card.

213
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,336
I'm a guardian. My son is in there!

214
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,463
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I said, my son is in there!

215
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,640
Because of you…

216
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,018
Because of you, Sin-u…

217
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,562
Sin-u…

218
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,941
What happened?

219
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,818
What happened to Sin-u?

220
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,154
YEONHWA DISTRICT EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

221
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,031
You need to tell me what happened!

222
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,410
He ran into the street on a red light.

223
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,456
At a crosswalk
in front of the police station.

224
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,782
He ran into the street on a red light.

225
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,077
At a crosswalk
in front of the police station.

226
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,791
-Honey.
-I just can't understand you

227
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,250
no matter how hard I try!

228
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,960
If you want to die,

229
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,796
go and die on your own, you punk.

230
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,219
YEONHWA DISTRICT EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

231
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,554
Are you happy now?

232
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,141
Do you feel better
after pushing him to the edge?

233
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,894
How is this my fault?

234
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,772
You shouldn't have done it
in the first place.

235
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,607
So what if he gets poor grades?

236
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,864
-Why would he…
-"So what if he gets poor grades?"

237
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,951
It was you who scolded him.

238
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,620
Why do you think he did that?

239
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,206
He wanted your approval and attention.

240
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,001
You compared him to Jeong-u on a whim
and looked down on him.

241
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,421
What?

242
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,426
Hey.

243
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,346
How can you eat after getting poor grades?

244
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,308
Your brother is only in 10th grade…

245
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,895
He got straight As.

246
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,567
You're going to be in 12th grade soon.

247
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,652
Do you even want to go to college?

248
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,115
Sin-u would have gotten straight As
if he didn't make mistakes.

249
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,950
Good students don't make mistakes.

250
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,702
You're useless.

251
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,163
What more could you ask for?

252
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,208
Can we not afford your tuition?
Do we starve you?

253
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,587
A cozy house, pocket money, cram schools,
and even private tutoring…

254
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,382
All you need to do is study
but you can't even do that?

255
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,468
Even though I grew up dirt poor,

256
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,429
I won a full scholarship, you brat.

257
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,181
That's enough, honey.

258
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,349
Law school? Seriously?

259
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,728
-Just forget it, you punk.
-For goodness' sake.

260
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,899
So is that why he joined Descartes?

261
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,693
I told him to do it.

262
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,822
Just for English where he makes mistakes.

263
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,286
That was the first and last time.

264
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,124
He did it once then quit,
saying he couldn't do it anymore.

265
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,336
You were the one who pushed Sin-u.

266
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,882
Stop getting so emotional.

267
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:23,055
If we don't get emotional about our kids,
then when do you think we should?

268
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,766
You think I don't know?

269
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,728
His grades and college entrance
are just excuses.

270
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,400
Your amazing career.

271
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,071
And the assemblyman's badge
that you've been after.

272
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,866
You pushed him
because you thought he'd ruin it for you.

273
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,828
You were worried
about your own future, not his.

274
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,127
Hey, how can you even…

275
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,224
But you know what?

276
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,269
When the police
were at our door that night,

277
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,313
the first person he called

278
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,440
was you.

279
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,906
Do you know what time he went to bed

280
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,659
and got up for over two years?

281
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,411
SURGERY IN PROGRESS
MALE, AGE 18, KANG ***-U

282
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,496
He slept less than three hours a day.

283
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,791
And he can't fall asleep
without sleeping pills.

284
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,963
He risked his life

285
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,259
for your approval.

286
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,803
And to get attention from you.

287
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,519
The police said he was just standing there

288
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,689
while the light changed several times.

289
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,151
What could have he been thinking?

290
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,154
He must have been scared.

291
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,869
He must have been so lonely.

292
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,797
Dad, are you at work?

293
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,217
Dad. I did well on my exam today.

294
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,686
Did you eat, Dad?

295
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,065
Are you coming home late, Dad?

296
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,319
Dad, are you going to be home late?

297
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,544
You were the one

298
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,838
who pushed Sin-u.

and do what Sin-u wanted.

304
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,673
He had a hard time.

305
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,470
He was so stressed
that he ran into the road.

306
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,228
Let's lay it down, honey.

CALLING
ASSEMBLYMAN EOM JUN-GI

308
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,427
Hello, sir.

309
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,597
This is Kang Won-jung.

310
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,734
Please state your name and affiliation.

311
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,361
Park Tae-su, and I'm a teacher
at Moonkwang High School.

312
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,281
I'm Lee Seok-hyeon's homeroom teacher.

313
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,867
Thank you

314
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,995
for coming to court at a time like this.

315
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,040
There were a few things
that I couldn't understand

316
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,001
while I was reviewing the records.

317
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay.

318
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,546
I won't beat around the bush.

319
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,965
What's the reason

320
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,801
for the school to do something like this?

321
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,762
Honestly, it's the college admission rate.

322
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,808
"How many students
did the school send to SNU?"

323
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,352
That's what the parents care about.

324
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,189
The number of students
decreases every year.

between schools is getting fiercer.

327
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,615
If our college admission rate drops,
a lot of parents call us to complain.

328
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,453
For many years, Moonkwang was
the number one high school

329
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,539
parents wanted to send their children to.

330
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,666
But now, it's not even in the top five.

331
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,001
Do you all want to screw up this school?

332
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,213
At this rate, we'll be in ruin

333
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,465
even though we're
a prestigious private school.

334
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,759
Last year, before the leak,
and the year before,

335
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:56,638
we only sent two students to SNU
including a student who resat the test.

336
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,015
-That's why we created Descartes.
-Then…

337
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,062
shouldn't grades be
the criteria for letting students in?

338
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,147
Grades? You're right.

339
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,442
Students with wealthy parents
get good grades.

340
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,029
Back in our day,
going to SNU wasn't that hard

341
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,906
as long as you had good grades.

342
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,700
Of course, I went to SNU myself.

343
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,536
But these days, that's far from enough.

344
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,415
If your parents can't support you
attentively and financially,

345
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,500
you can't even dream of getting in.

346
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,339
No, I'll do it.

347
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,219
Seok-hyeon. I'm 100% sure
that this question will be on the CSAT.

348
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,263
And you should be able to apply

349
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,599
the differentiability theorem
to answer why.

350
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,850
It's very important.

351
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,809
Okay.

352
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,731
Try to read all the recommended books
on the list I sent you just now.

353
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,526
And do volunteer work at a hospital
for about a year.

354
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,485
Okay.

355
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,821
A debate club
where students discuss about TED talks

356
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,615
is better than the one he's in now.

357
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,907
What's the most important…

358
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,492
To get good grades in school,

359
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,953
you need cram schools
for literature, English, and math,

360
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,998
and get private lessons
to catch up with the cram schools.

361
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,418
You also need a graduate student
to help you with your assignments.

362
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,794
That's not all.

363
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,339
You need to do volunteer work
and extracurricular activities,

364
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,176
write reports on school subjects,
participate in contests, read books,

365
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,304
attend admission briefings,
prepare a résumé, and practice interviews.

366
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,810
All of it requires money.

367
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,442
Then how come no one refused
to join the club?

368
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,820
You could do just as you always did.

369
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,530
Because it's a competition.

370
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,909
If I refuse,
someone else will take the spot.

371
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,495
Why would I? For who?

372
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:49,125
The top student can drop below tenth place
by just one or two points.

373
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,795
Would you be able to refuse
if you were in my shoes?

374
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:58,009
These kids got the exam papers
not because their grades were poor.

375
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,222
They got them because it gave them time
to focus on other things.

376
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:07,352
Those not in the know may call us crazy.

377
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,478
But you know what?

378
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,397
Your Honor.

379
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,401
We're in the middle of a bloody war.

380
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,030
School these days are merely
admission centers to get their GPA.

381
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,075
That's why the teaching director

382
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,120
only chooses the students
who have what it takes to make it.

383
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,249
By the way, when does this trial end?

384
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,462
Seok-hyeon has
a private English lesson in an hour.

385
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,215
I heard that this kind of trial
doesn't take too long.

386
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,675
Was I misinformed?

387
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,480
Have Lee Seok-hyeon's guardian
wait outside next time.

388
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,190
I have questions only for him.

389
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,734
Yes, I'll do that.

390
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,196
Oh, dear. This is freaking tough.
For God's sake.

391
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,158
Wasn't the boy's guardian pretty shocking?

392
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,118
She didn't even pretend to reflect on it.

393
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,079
I know. But on the other hand,

394
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:12,250
I doubt if I'd be able to refuse
such an offer flat out if I were a mother.

395
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,085
If my child had good grades.

396
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,047
But parents don't know how suffocating
that is for their children.

397
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,509
I may not look like it,
but I'm from the Gangnam School District.

398
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,553
Well, of course, my mom gave up on me.

399
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,555
You? You mean, you?

400
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,600
What's with that look? I'm offended.

401
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,935
I always look like this.
Got a problem with that?

402
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,771
Jeez.

403
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,691
Highest youth suicides
among OECD countries.

404
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,110
Over 20 trillion won a year
in private education.

405
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,071
70% of teenagers in Korea
take private lessons.

406
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,365
It's time for change.

407
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,284
It's been long due.

408
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:50,163
It was the same when I was growing up.
You took the CSAT, right?

409
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,707
Or was it the CEST for you guys?

410
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,169
Anyway, the result
of 12 years of education

411
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,338
was decided by that one exam,

412
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,924
so there was news
about student suicides every year.

413
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,386
So they eventually changed the system.

414
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,848
So students who did well in school
had a chance for early admission.

415
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,308
And look where it got us.

416
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,186
I doubt changing the system
will do anything.

417
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,688
Do you think that's even possible?

418
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,691
It doesn't have to change.

419
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,611
No matter what the system is,

420
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,405
people will still cheat,
and it'll still have side effects.

421
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,575
But the court can at least

422
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,619
take this chance to set standards.

423
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,330
Like what?

424
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,041
That no matter how cutthroat
the competition is,

425
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,918
everyone…

426
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,379
should be equal

427
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,340
in front of exam papers.

428
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,804
I agree.

429
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,557
What's wrong is wrong.

430
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,393
This isn't right.

431
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,854
Don't put the cart before the horse.

432
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,858
Before you withdraw from the election,

433
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,694
you need to tell me
why you want to give up.

434
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,405
We already made a press announcement.

435
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,949
You can't just say you want to quit now.

436
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,580
Well…

437
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,084
You need to tell me why so I can
either be persuaded or persuade you.

438
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,223
Descartes.

439
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,434
My son…

440
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,062
was a member of that club.

441
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,323
And?

442
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,938
A bowl of rice soup, please.

443
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,826
Are you Park Hyeon-chan, the teaching
director at Moonkwang High School?

444
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,457
Face forward and keep eating.

445
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,211
I'm here to eat too.

446
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,622
My son is going through a hard time.

447
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,460
I thought about this for a long time.

448
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,587
No matter how hard I think,

449
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,840
this is…

450
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,759
my final decision.

451
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,636
Now…

452
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,055
I'm going to

453
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,599
give everything up.

454
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,690
Is that really for the best?

455
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,900
I'll cut to the chase.

456
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,320
You still have to run for the election.

457
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,366
We've already done
all the background checks

458
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,994
and made the press announcement.
It's too late.

459
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,081
Well, then--

460
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,667
Think of it this way, Mr. Kang.

461
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,296
Let's suppose that you gave everything up
and told the truth.

462
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,298
Then what's next?

463
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:15,094
The trust you've built up over the years
being on TV,

464
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,055
and the honor you have
as a man of the law.

465
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,642
The press will criticize you,
your son, your family,

466
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:28,483
Yeonhwa District Court, and even
the judiciary your court belongs to.

467
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,152
Can you

468
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,988
deal with all of that?

469
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,034
I'll be impartial

470
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,830
in this trial more than any other judge.

471
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,459
So…

472
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,378
deny all charges.

473
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,051
When the judge
asks you a question in court,

474
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,969
just…

475
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,389
say…

476
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,392
no.

477
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,773
No more witnesses

478
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,902
and no more testimonies.

479
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,740
You mustn't say anything more.

480
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,744
Mr. Kang.

481
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,621
You protect your son.

482
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,249
I'll protect the party.

483
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,336
-Mr. Eom.
-This isn't a matter of choice.

484
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,712
It's a matter of survival.

485
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,719
We're determined to win this by-election

486
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,555
at any cost.

487
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,489
So do what you can now

488
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,199
for your son.

489
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,293
Case number 2022 GH 2577.

490
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,754
We'll begin the trial.

491
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,091
The charges against the defendants

492
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,220
are all related to the exam paper leak
at Moonkwang High School.

493
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,223
Since all the charges are
objectively related to one another

494
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,392
and all defendants are charged
as accomplices,

495
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,896
the court will merge their cases
and try them together.

496
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,288
Especially, since this case

497
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,249
is receiving much public attention,

498
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,462
we'll make this trial quick and thorough.

499
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,258
The prosecution may submit
the list of evidence and witnesses.

500
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,651
Both the prosecution and the defense

501
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,278
have submitted
their list of witnesses to summon.

502
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,198
I won't decide
who to summon at the trial today,

503
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,034
but will notify you of my decision later.

504
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,873
What do you all think about that?

505
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,436
Hello?

506
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,855
Judge Sim.
This is assisting officer, Seo Beom.

507
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,440
Mr. Kang has just finished

508
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,694
selecting the witnesses to be heard
for the Exam Paper Leak Case.

509
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,570
Have you checked it?

510
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,073
Already?

511
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,700
Yes, but…

512
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,827
it's a bit strange.

513
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,500
Come in.

514
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,091
I heard you didn't select any witnesses
from the prosecution,

515
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,884
but all from the defendants.

516
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,804
Yes, they lacked relation to the case.

517
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,264
Why do you ask?

518
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,225
Han Ji-won,
the prosecution's witness, was the first

519
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,811
to suspect the teaching director
for leaking the papers.

520
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,480
Other faculty members
are also important witnesses.

521
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,773
If you won't summon them,

522
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,359
you shouldn't take witnesses
put forward by the defense as well.

523
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:44,530
Are you suggesting
that my witness selection is biased?

524
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,074
Yes.

525
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,744
I don't understand, sir.

526
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,787
What are you going to do then?

527
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,462
What was that noise?

528
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,839
Gosh. Is your baby okay?

529
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,174
Yes, it's okay.

530
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,599
How arrogant.

531
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,769
I know I've let you have your way,

532
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,813
but there is a limit to my patience.

533
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,732
Okay?

534
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,035
Hello?

535
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,329
Honey, Sin-u regained consciousness.

536
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,456
He'll be moved to a general ward soon.

537
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,255
Okay, I'll call you again in a bit.

538
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,767
Get out.

539
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,712
Please take care of
the broken picture frame.

540
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,047
Yes, sir. See you.

541
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,257
See you.

542
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,311
I think you went too far.

543
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,313
He's been quite sensitive lately.

544
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,901
-That's more the reason to ask why.
-He probably had his reasons.

545
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,863
He can't be corrupted.

546
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,489
How do you know that?

547
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,159
You must not know.

548
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,538
He's gotten a bit softer

549
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,833
since he's now on TV
and many people recognize him,

550
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,669
but he used to be quite famous

551
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,547
for being rigid when it comes to judgment.

552
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,675
People even joked

553
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,928
that if the high-ranking officials
he put in prison are lined up,

554
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,806
they'd circle the entire courthouse.

555
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,189
I can vouch for him since I've seen him
for a year before you arrived.

556
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,818
He's fairer than anyone in the court.

557
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,404
I can assure you.

558
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,289
But why?

559
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,668
Why is he like this now?

560
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,617
What happened to Mr. Kang and Judge Sim?
They're late for work today.

561
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,787
Actually, they called me.

562
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,082
They said they'd be late today
for personal reasons.

563
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,416
I see.

564
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,001
Are they sick or something?

565
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,461
I don't know.

566
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,674
Both of them are never late.
What's going on?

567
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,658
Are you getting any sleep?

568
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,577
Are you eating well?

569
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,246
You'll die if you don't.

570
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,039
You must have forgotten.

571
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,710
I already died

572
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,796
five years ago.

573
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,409
Do you feel wronged?

574
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,578
What about?

575
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,040
It's not like I saw the leaked paper.

576
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,043
I was just on the waiting list.
Why do I have to stand trial?

577
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,212
Right.

578
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,133
Then you shouldn't have
even been on the waiting list.

579
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,844
Do whatever you want.

580
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,846
This is a protection case anyway.

581
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,849
It only sucks for the ones who got caught.

582
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,482
What?

583
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,029
Call Moonkwang High School and have them
send us a list of all enrolled students,

584
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,031
their records, and all the answer sheets

585
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,784
other than those
the prosecution presented as evidence.

586
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,036
Wait, Judge Sim. All of them?

587
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,246
Yes, all the current students.

588
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,956
-Hurry.
-Yes, ma'am.

589
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,510
PRESIDING JUDGE KANG

590
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,136
Hello, Mr. Kang.

591
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,307
The documents?

592
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,688
Yes, I checked the bookcase.
They aren't there.

593
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,857
Yes, I see.

594
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,486
Then I'll look for it again
and call you back.

595
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,446
Bye.

600
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,811
Hello, sir. Yes, I found it.

601
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,314
To General Affairs now? Okay.

602
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,498
Judge Sim. These are the lists of
enrolled students, their student records,

603
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,500
and the answer sheets you requested.

604
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,587
The school told me repeatedly
that they'd be in trouble

605
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,338
if the parents found out about this.

606
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,091
There are certain procedures
the court has to follow.

607
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,551
Okay, thank you.

608
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,052
By the way, Judge Sim.

609
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,055
I got you these because you wanted them,

610
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,974
but why do you need them?

611
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,520
Is it because
of that testimony from earlier?

What are you saying?

615
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,245
There are more students
who saw the leaked papers?

616
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,830
Exactly.

617
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,083
It only sucks for the ones who got caught.

618
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,379
What?

619
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,131
It's not 21 students.

620
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,675
There are more students
who saw those exam papers.

You can trust me and leave it to me.

623
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,099
Twenty-four.

624
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,270
Only those with good enough grades
can join Descartes.

625
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,189
I definitely heard him.

626
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:01,985
He was on the phone when I went to ask him
when my turn would come.

627
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,487
He said there were 24 students.

628
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,449
I don't know who they are,
but I'm telling you.

629
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,034
There are more kids.

630
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,995
I told the police too,
but they didn't believe me.

631
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,831
Unbelievable.

632
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,873
I know.

633
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,125
Let's see

634
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,878
if it's true or not.

635
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,130
But what can we do with these?

636
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:27,177
They're just a list
of enrolled students, student records,

637
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,595
and answer sheets.

638

The Exam Paper Leak Case
could have been just a rumor.

641
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,574
But how did it move
the Office of Education

642
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,701
and even the prosecution?

643
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,704
PERSONAL INFORMATION
HAN JI-WON

644
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,830
She is…

645
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,249
One of the witnesses
Mr. Kang refused to select.

646
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,419
The first person to suspect
Descartes of leaking exam papers.

647
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,546
Han Ji-won, an English teacher.

648
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,885
All six students
who got this question wrong

649
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,596
have the highest grades at the school.

650
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:15,142
But what's funny is the question
they all got wrong was a no-brainer.

651
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,103
They could have gotten it right
if they had read the text.

652
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,147
Of course,

653
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,483
top students
can also get easy questions wrong.

654
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,569
Anyone can make mistakes during exams.

655
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,362
But it's impossible

656
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,407
for someone to come up
with an answer like this

657
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,994
no matter what mistake they make.

658
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,204
Because the answer they gave

659
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,458
is completely unrelated to the question.

660
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,504
SHORT-ANSWER SECTION

661
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,215
Isn't it strange?

662
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:51,345
How could six students write
the exact same wrong answer?

663
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,388
SHORT-ANSWER SECTION

664
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,431
What are you…

665
00:48:56,141 --> 00:49:00,771
The exam questions had been
changed once during preparation.

666
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,566
But they forgot to change the answers.

667
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,944
It was just this question
that was changed.

668
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,196
And these six students

669
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,199
gave the answer to the question
that used to be on the test.

670
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,036
Are you saying

671
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,747
that the answers were leaked
as well as the questions?

672
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,416
No. What actually happened here was

673
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,586
that the answers were leaked,

674
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,255
not the exam questions.

675
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,467
2022 FIRST SEMESTER
MIDTERM EXAMS ANSWER SHEET ORIGINAL COPY

676
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,473
-All teaching staff. Please come here.
-Put them in.

677
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,892
The police found a hand-written list

678
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,270
of Descartes members
from the director's desk drawer

679
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,898
and found the 21 students
currently standing trial.

680
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,486
And digital forensics found the answers

681
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,197
for both multiple-choice
and short-answer questions

682
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,868
that students had saved on
their phones and laptops before the exams.

683
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,415
How are we going to find
the three hidden students?

684
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,292
What the 21 students found
by the police have in common.

685
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,752
We need to start from there.

686
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:12,300
First, those three students
are no longer in Descartes presently.

687
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:17,222
Second, they're top-ranked students.

688
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:22,227
Third, their parents are assemblymen,
ministers, university hospital doctors,

689
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,272
celebrities, or judicial officers.

690
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,609
The kids got the exam papers
not because their grades were poor.

691
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:34,072
They got them because it gave them time
to focus on other things.

692
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,367
We need to find those
who made extracurricular achievements

693
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,244
before and after the exams,

694
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:42,414
such as competition awards,
research papers, or Model UN conferences.

695
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,958
So that's why…

696
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,378
Mr. Kang's son had a big accident.

697
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,505
The news really shocked me, too.

698
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,758
I thought you should know.

699
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,555
Well…

700
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,434
What brings you here?

701
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,104
We heard that your eldest son
was in an accident.

702
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,230
It's late, but…

703
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:15,072
We'll see each other at work tomorrow.
You didn't have to come all this way.

704
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,656
We also had something to tell you.

705
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,159
We should have reported it right away,

706
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,454
but we needed to look into it first.

707
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,170
It's about the Moonkwang High School
Exam Paper Leak Case.

708
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:35,759
We've been tipped off that the prosecution
has missed a few students.

709
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,471
What?

710
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,517
We narrowed them down to eight.

711
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,270
What are the commonalities
that we've missed?

712
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,109
It's definitely one of them.

713
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,445
Who?

714
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,197
Who said such nonsense?

715
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,033
One of the boys
from the protection cases testified so.

716
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,495
Lee Seok-hyeon? Did you know
he was put on probation for fraud?

717
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,832
Yes. As far as I know,
his probation has already ended.

718
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,458
That's the problem with you.

719
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,087
You don't help young offenders
grow up to be upright people.

720
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,464
You just complicate things every time.

721
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,971
Our job is to judge, not to investigate
what the prosecution might have missed.

722
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,516
The court doesn't have the authority
to investigate or prosecute.

723
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,769
Stop crossing the line

724
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:29,688
and leave.

725
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,276
Honey.

726
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,404
Who…

727
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,114
But what if there are students

728
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,576
the prosecution missed
as Lee Seok-hyeon stated?

729
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,995
What?

730
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,663
What if there are students

731
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,293
who dropped out of Descartes
before investigations began?

732
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,009
You are talking nonsense.

733
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,346
For example…

734
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,726
Moonkwang High School, Grade 12, Class 1…

735
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,355
Kang Sin-u.

736
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,368
If you were to select
the members for Descartes,

737
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,120
what would your criteria be?

738
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,040
Sorry?

739
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,461
If it was me, I'd look far ahead.

740
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,047
To raise the school's admission rate.

741
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,967
I'll pick someone
who can make it into SNU even if they fail

742
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,137
and have to resit the exam.

743
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,475
A child who gets good grades

744
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,811
both in school and in mock exams.

745
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,944
GPA, RANK 1
MOCK EXAMS, RANK 3

746
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,655
The teaching director
is keeping his mouth sealed

747
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,032
because the students' parents
are not just wealthy.

748
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,118
What if they're people of high social rank

749
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,287
he can't bring up
or can get favors from later?

750
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,039
If that's the reason…

751
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,874
Wait a minute. Then…

752
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,002
GRADE 12 CLASS 1 KANG SIN-U

753
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,673
Wait.

754
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,300
STUDENT RECORD
GRADE 12 CLASS 1 KANG SIN-U

755
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,639
-They lacked relation to the case.
-If you won't summon them,

756
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,350
you shouldn't take witnesses
put forward by the defense as well.

757
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:34,062
Are you suggesting
that my witness selection is biased?

758
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,193
Why didn't I see it before?

759
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,612
What's wrong? Have you found something?

760
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,701
KANG SIN-U

761
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,637
Why don't you just…

762
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,599
turn yourself in, Mr. Kang?

763
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,354
No.

764
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,692
Kang Sin-u's father.

765
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:44,150
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

766
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:48,738
