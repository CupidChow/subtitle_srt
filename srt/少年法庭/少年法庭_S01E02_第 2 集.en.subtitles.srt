1
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,184
Yes, I'm in front of the court now.

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,896
Judge Cha? Why are you back?

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,565
The files from the investigation office

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,316
for the Yeonhwa Child Murder.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,653
Please bring that
to the interrogation room now.

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,282
Wait, Judge Cha.
I was actually heading home--

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,367
Han Ye-eun is
in the interrogation room right now.

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,246
-Sorry?
-Han Ye-eun is in the interrogation room!

9
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,248
Okay then. Wait, Judge Cha!

10
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,254
Judge Sim. Well…

11
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,132
Judge Sim. Your hand…

12
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,717
Don't overreact. It's nothing.

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,928
Okay.

14
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,599
Well, I couldn't get a hold
of Han Ye-eun's guardian.

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,850
But I'll try all means--

16
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,477
I already did.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,936
How?

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,730
I contacted her attorney.

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,273
Her attorney?

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,651
Both of her parents are living in the US.

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,111
Her father runs a business,

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,614
and her mother operates
a popular boutique.

23
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:16,201
For that reason, a law firm
takes care of her on their behalf.

24
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,454
You've heard of the law firm Geobo, right?

25
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,663
It's a big law firm.

26
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,626
PERSONAL INFORMATION
HAN YE-EUN, AGE 16

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,047
I wondered what kind of clueless judge
would interrogate a minor at this hour.

28
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,673
It was you, Eun-seok.

29
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,260
I heard the news
that you work in juvenile courts now.

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,597
Remember that you're here as an attorney,
Ms. Heo Chan-mi.

31
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,064
Do you think
this interrogation is some kind of joke?

32
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,448
You may refuse to give a statement
or answer the questions

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,950
I'll be asking you.

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,410
Refusing to do so won't work against you.

35
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,914
Anything you say from now on
can be used against you in a court of law.

36
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,583
And you have a right to an attorney.

37
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,212
Sign it.

38
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,680
CONFIRMATION OF RIGHT
TO REFUSE TESTIMONY AND COUNSEL

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,854
This isn't an interrogation
by an investigative body,

40
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,107
but a court investigation
just to check up on some facts.

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,316
There's no need to be scared.

42
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,820
Thank you.

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,531
Shall we get started?

44
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,699
Baek Seong-u

45
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,368
turned himself to the police.

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,496
He said he killed someone.

47
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,834
The victim attended
a nearby elementary school--

48
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,128
Just cut to the chase.

49
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,421
How do you know Baek Seong-u?

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,091
I don't know him.

51
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,551
Yet you ran away?

52
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,929
Because I was scared.
You kept following me.

53
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,394
Here.

54
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,898
Here's the call record
between the two of you.

55
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,399
Probably dialed the wrong number.

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,785
It's almost as if she was stalking him.

57
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,496
She'll remain silent.

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,666
On the day of the murder,
around the estimated time of the incident,

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,502
the only person who talked to him
on the phone was you.

60
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,881
-Do you really not know him?
-She'll remain silent.

61
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,052
On December 13th, 2021,
where were you between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.?

62
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,137
-That too--
-I'm sure she'll remain silent again.

63
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,909
Ye-eun.

64
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,085
Baek Seong-u is a young offender
under the age of 14,

65
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,003
so he can avoid criminal charges.

66
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,257
But you're different.

67
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,135
According to Articles 2 and 4
of the Act on Special Cases

68
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,346
Concerning Punishment
for Specific Violent Crimes,

69
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,308
the maximum sentence
for a juvenile is 20 years.

70
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,019
I'm sure you're well aware of it too.

71
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,234
Seong-u had his trial this afternoon.

72
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,195
Guess what he said…

73
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,199
after the trial?

74
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,294
It's midnight, the appointed time.
I think we're done here.

75
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,211
Sit down.

76
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,380
I'll ask one last question
before I wrap it up.

77
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,561
This is the security footage

78
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,439
from the elevator at the crime scene
on the day of the murder.

79
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,318
But, Han Ye-eun.

80
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,653
What are you doing there?

81
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,954
I just got on an elevator with him.

82
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,708
Is that a crime?

83
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,590
The calls between you and Seong-u
right before and after the incident,

84
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:45,178
and the CCTV footage that shows you
at the scene on the day of the murder.

85
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,598
All of this tells me
that it isn't a leap to say

86
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,516
that you're a co-conspirator

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,436
in this crime.

88
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,403
You can't hold me here without a trial
just because you're a judge.

89
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,989
It says on your record

90
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,492
that you are on a 2-year probation
from your last trial.

91
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,828
You didn't adhere to the conditions
and had an attitude problem too.

92
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,541
You were in no position
to be at an internet cafe at that hour.

93
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,629
Let go of me! Let go!

94
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,215
-Ms. Heo! Help me!
-You can't hurt her.

95
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,760
-Be careful, please.
-Let me go!

96
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,053
Can't you hear me?

97
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,105
If you were going to take her anyway,

98
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,066
you could've let her sleep
and taken her early tomorrow morning.

99
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,110
-She's still a minor.
-But…

100
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,906
Even if she's a minor…

101
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,451
someone was killed.

102
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,122
And that ruined a family.

103
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,292
So what if she loses some sleep?

104
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,507
I just did my job as a judge.

105
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,344
So you do your job

106
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,431
as her attorney.

107
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,492
Okay, I will.

108
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,620
I'll call you right away
if Mr. Kang asks for you.

109
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,164
Bye.

110
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,668
You're up.

111
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,504
I heard what happened
to Han Ye-eun last night.

112
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,590
She was taken
to the Juvenile Classification Center.

113
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,926
Don't forget to ask Judge Sim
when she comes to work

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,220
because she's the one who caught her.

115
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,723
She went through hoops to get her.

116
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,600
Her hand was scraped and bandaged.

117
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,684
No wonder.

118
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,270
Judge Sim just called
and said she'd be a little late.

119
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,771
Let her get some rest.

120
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,274
It seems
she hasn't been sleeping much lately.

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,693
-Is Mr. Kang in?
-Not yet.

122
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,029
Then please don't tell him.

123
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,867
Come on!

124
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,046
YUN JI-HU

125
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm off to work.

126
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,932
Your mother will be here later.

127
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,143
Eat something, please. Okay?

128
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,314
You have to eat to live.

129
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:41,956
Hi, it's me.

130
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,500
Can you get it?

131
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,546
No, the more cases, the better.

132
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,758
I've looked up the domestic cases.
I just need examples from abroad.

133
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,511
Mainly juvenile cases.
Just not parricides.

134
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,724
As soon as you get Han Ye-eun's records
from the Juvenile Classification Center,

135
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,517
hand them over to Judge Sim right away.

136
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes, ma'am.

137
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,480
By the way,
what on earth happened last night?

138
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,232
Don't even get me started.

139
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,692
I was on my way home,

140
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,236
and Han Ye-eun was accompanied
by her attorney.

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,904
It was no joke.

142
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,656
Gosh, that's nuts.

143
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,201
From call history to security footage,
there's solid evidence.

144
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,120
I don't think she'll find a way out.

145
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,830
Gosh, that's insane.

146
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,084
It's like we're walking on thin ice
since Judge Sim transferred to our office.

147
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,420
My gosh.

148
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,340
What are we all going to do
if Mr. Kang finds out about this?

149
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,466
Find out about what?

150
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,595
-Hello, sir.
-Jeez, look at your faces.

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,305
Find out about what?

152
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,231
Sim Eun-seok, speaking.

153
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm at the court now.

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,239
Okay, I'll be right there.

155
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,241
Cha Tae-ju!

156
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,411
Don't you know what I'm like?

157
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,331
Can't you see
that Sim Eun-seok is running wild?

158
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,125
You can't let her do that!

159
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,252
Sneaking around my back like rats!

160
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,130
You summoned a minor
without reporting to me

161
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,924
and sent her to the Classification Center.

162
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,636
For goodness' sake.
You two must have gone mad.

163
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,972
Hey! Do you think I'm a pushover?

164
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,475
Get out! I don't need any of you!

165
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,103
I was going to report it to you today.

166
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,980
What for?
Why not hold a trial behind my back?

167
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,482
I was ashamed.

168
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,566
It was…

169
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,448
They're not serial killers
or international scammers.

170
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,201
They're just juvenile offenders.

171
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,995
But they managed to fool the police
and the whole country at large.

172
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,289
The court should at least
find out the truth.

173
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
Isn't that why we're here?

174
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,550
After all the trials are over,
if they think that the law is a joke,

175
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,343
what should we do then?

176
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,886
PERSON

177
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,391
If they grow up
and create more victims like Ji-hu,

178
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,852
who's going to take responsibility then?

179
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,525
We need to show them how scary the law is!

180
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,027
We need to teach them
that there are consequences

181
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,071
when they harm others.

182
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,366
If their parents try to cover for them,

183
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,702
the government
and the court needs to step in.

184
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,290
That's why we're here.

185
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,084
Tell me.

186
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,253
What did I do wrong?

187
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,507
What made you so angry
that you threw those documents?

188
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,218
As a judge…

189
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,722
what on earth did I do wrong?

190
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,699
So, what are you planning to do?

191
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,577
I'm going to use the law to prove it…

192
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,163
mercilessly.

193
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,462
Go meet Baek Seong-u's mother.

194
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,339
Now?

195
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,133
What matters most right now is
Baek Seong-u's confession.

196
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,844
Tell her that he has an accomplice,

197
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,639
and ask her if she can persuade him.

198
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,432
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,939
I'll see you then.

200
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,419
I'm sorry, Judge.
I should have kept my mouth shut.

201
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,464
It doesn't matter. It was bound to happen.

202
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,382
Okay.

203
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,717
And…

204
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,639
this is what the Juvenile Classification
Center got during their investigation.

205
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,058
It's Seong-u's chat history
from his social media account.

206
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,977
But the contents are a bit…

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,895
I TOOK A KITTY FROM ITS MOTHER
TO PRACTICE ON IT

208
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,857
I think these two are very close.

209
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,778
Ma'am?

210
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,821
Han Ye-eun…

211
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,866
Call the Juvenile Classification Center

212
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,534
and check for other social media history.

213
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,502
THANKS, I THREW UP SO MUCH
I TOLD THEM IT'S BECAUSE I'M INSANE

214
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,380
THANK GOD. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?
ME TOO, I'LL TEXT YOU LATER

215
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,927
Ma'am. I'll see you same time next week.

216
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,555
Don't forget to finish it
by next week, Ye-chan.

217
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,640
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

218
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,766
-Bye.
-Bye.

219
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,518
Goodbye.

220
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,167
Are you trying to get me fired?

221
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,877
How did you know I was here?

222
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,838
What if rumors start to spread again?

223
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,383
The cram school
you used to work for said you quit,

224
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,594
so I contacted
the company you work for now.

225
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,929
Is that what they said?

226
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,805
That I quit?

227
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,059
It's over for me if I get fired again.

228
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,810
I have to make a living somehow.

229
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,856
This isn't the first time
that he caused trouble.

230
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,817
I'm not here to trouble you.

231
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,365
By any chance,

232
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,867
do you recognize this girl?

233
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,910
No.

234
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,745
Why?

235
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,623
I think Seong-u was with her
at the crime scene.

236
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,002
Then why…

237
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,837
Why was Seong-u…

238
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,631
I knew it.

239
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,217
He doesn't have the guts to kill someone.

240
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,260
She hasn't admitted to it yet.

241
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,641
-We need Seong-u's confession.
-And if he does?

242
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,893
His sentence can change
depending on his statement.

243
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,062
He will. I'll make him do it.

244
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,940
I can't even reach the victim's parents.

245
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,109
I can't even meet them,
let alone ask them to settle.

246
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,319
What did his public defender say?

247
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,488
"Public defender"?

248
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,620
I've been ignoring calls
from unknown numbers.

249
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,580
Here.

250
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,460
This is their number.

251
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,088
If you call this number,

252
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,217
you can learn about his public defender.

253
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,306
But you're a judge.
Why are you doing this?

254
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,767
This is all a part of the job.

255
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,895
Considering the gravity of the crime,

256
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,857
Seong-u needs to defend himself too.

257
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,445
Thank you.

258
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,283
Article 1 of the Juvenile Act says,

259
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,370
"The purpose is to ensure
sound fostering of juveniles."

260
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,498
It isn't just about who's in the wrong.

261
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,209
The goal of
the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division

262
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,504
is to ensure that the children
don't get involved in crime again.

263
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,008
Please persuade him.

264
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,878
You're back.

265
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,176
It seems you haven't been
sleeping the past few days.

266
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,011
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

267
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,400
Didn't you tell me to go home?

268
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,403
You've only just arrived,

269
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,280
but we didn't have a welcome party.

270
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,157
No, I don't do that.

271
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,536
Wow, Judge Sim.

272
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,663
You're one hard-boiled judge.

273
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,415
Mr. Seo told me you were late this morning

274
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,293
not because you overslept,
but because you were at the library.

275
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,382
I have a question for you. Mind if I ask?

276
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,349
Why here?

277
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,894
We're not a high-profile division.

278
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,231
Your experience here won't get you
a cushy job as a lawyer later.

279
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,693
Everyone avoids coming here
because of the issues and the workload.

280
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,530
You're a reputable judge.

281
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,781
So, why…

282
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,034
Why did you choose to come here?

283
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,383
You're curious?

284
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,719
Yes.

285
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,521
Enjoy your food.

286
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,191
Judge Sim.

287
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,907
We're not a high-profile division.

288
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,202
Your experience here won't get you
a cushy job as a lawyer later.

289
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,455
Everyone avoids coming here
because of the issues and the workload.

290
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,165
Why did you choose to come here?

291
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,712
I wonder that myself.

292
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,896
That's it.

293
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,107
One more thing.

294
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,693
The work in our division is one thing,

295
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,906
but the juvenile protection cases
assigned to each of you are another.

296
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,076
Those are independent trials,
so I can't intervene.

297
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,120
But you better give it your best.

298
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,580
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

299
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,791
I'm really sorry to interrupt the meeting,

300
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,501
but this is quite serious.

301
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,794
What is it?

302
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,005
Judge Sim Eun-seok

303
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,967
of the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate
Division at Yeonhwa District Court,

304
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,386
who was appointed
to handle the Yeonhwa child murder case,

305
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,222
is having her qualifications
as a judge questioned.

306
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,018
Since her days as a juvenile court judge
at Uijeongbu District Court two years ago,

307
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,562
her overbearing attitude
and aggressive mannerisms

308
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,023
have caused many controversies.

309
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,441
She didn't curse,

310
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,403
but she lashed out
at my child and yelled at him.

311
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,656
I couldn't believe
such a person was a judge.

312
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,618
Especially, during the investigation
into the Yeonhwa child murder case,

313
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,205
when a child had refused the request
to attend the hearing voluntarily,

314
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,167
she forcibly took the child
without a warrant, causing a controversy

315
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,886
No, well…

316
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,055
The article was published
without checking the facts.

317
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,268
No, she didn't forcibly take her.
She was accompanied by probation officers.

318
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,020
It was a formal investigation.

319
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,274
I didn't yell. I was just enunciating.
A formal investigation.

320
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,943
JUDGE SIM'S QUALIFICATIONS
ARE BEING QUESTIONED

321
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,415
Mr. Kang.
The Chief Judge is asking for you.

322
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,267
Look who's here.

323
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,354
What brings you here, Your Honor?

324
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,397
It was you.

325
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,193
You're the only person
who would do this kind of thing.

326
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,904
Yes, it's me. You told me

327
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,614
that I should do my job.

328
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,742
The whole world
should take this chance to learn

329
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,494
what your true colors are.

330
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,914
Your dirty tricks

331
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,293
didn't work at the training institute,
and they won't work now.

332
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,339
You lost then, and you'll lose again.

333
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,885
Han Ye-eun will receive
a summons to appear in court.

334
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,555
Bring her on time. Don't be a minute late.

335
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,934
The reporters,
that you love so much, will be there.

336
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,652
What the heck is going on now?

337
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,157
You made me get summoned
by the Chief Judge!

338
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,369
You're not even a junior judge!
You're a senior judge now!

339
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,669
Why didn't you tell me?

340
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,839
Didn't you think it'd cause problems

341
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,216
when you forcibly
interrogated her like that?

342
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,472
Tell Judge Cha to come to my office now.

343
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,489
This case.

344
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,742
I'm reassigning it to you.

345
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,415
-Mr. Kang--
-It's an order from the Chief Judge.

346
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,668
I clearly warned you
that the justice department

347
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,255
would be in the spotlight here,
so to act cautiously.

348
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,423
I helped her.

349
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,009
What?

350
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,635
I was also suspicious of

351
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,513
Han Ye-eun's whereabouts
on the day of the murder, so I--

352
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,684
-Is that true?
-No, sir.

353
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,313
I looked for Han Ye-eun alone that day.

354
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,857
It was my sole decision.

355
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,193
There's no excuse for that.

356
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,948
Judge Cha,
schedule a trial date as soon as possible.

357
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,575
And Judge Sim.

358
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,911
Assist Judge Cha.

359
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,747
Yes, sir.

360
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,671
Why did you do that?

361
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,424
I'm the one who told you
about that internet cafe.

362
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,301
I went looking for her too.

363
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,722
Why did you take all the blame?
You've worked so hard for this.

364
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,890
So what?

365
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,892
That doesn't make me innocent.

366
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,978
What they said on the news wasn't wrong.

367
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,523
It was my fault.

368
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,607
But…

369
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:31,321
despite all of that,
I wanted to catch her.

370
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,201
If the case had been reassigned
to another team, it'd be a problem.

371
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,204
But the presiding judge
being changed isn't a big deal.

372
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:44,543
We can sacrifice an arm or two
since we're after the opponent's head.

373
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,463
CASES INVOLVING SCHIZOPHRENIA

374
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,881
I found some relevant cases.

375
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,384
Stop worrying about me
and read as many as you can.

376
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,558
Judge Sim. I just got a call
from the Juvenile Classification Center.

377
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,268
Baek Seong-u wants to make a statement.

378
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:09,359
The trial for the Yeonhwa child murder,
a case that shocked the whole nation,

379
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,902
will be held today.

380
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,948
As Han, a third party caught on camera
on the day of the murder,

381
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,284
is suspected to be the real culprit,

382
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,120
the prosecution has filed
a murder charge against her.

383
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,205
The suspects for the murder…

384
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,041
…are being held today
for the two teenagers.

385
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,418
They need to be punished!

386
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,335
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

387
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,171
The court will hold
a criminal trial of Han

388
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,342
and a juvenile trial
of Baek simultaneously.

389
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,803
Everyone is eagerly awaiting
the results of the trial.

390
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,138
Do you admit to forceful arrest?

391
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,725
What does the court
have to say about the case?

392
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,102
The trial will be held
behind closed doors.

393
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,937
The Yeonhwa Child Murder…

394
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,240
Case Number 2021P2598.

395
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,993
and 2021CC2611.

396
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,454
We'll begin the trial now.

397
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,507
Han Ye-eun's attorney.

398
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,845
Is her guardian not here today?

399
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,640
Han Ye-eun's guardians were unable
to attend due to business in the US,

400
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,017
so their counsel is here on their behalf.

401
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,770
I've been a judge for 22 years,

402
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,315
but I've never seen this kind of attorney
dream team at juvenile court before.

403
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,816
We'll take it as a compliment.

404
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,740
Han Ye-eun's attorney.

405
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,910
Does she admit to murdering
and abandoning the body?

406
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,579
She admits to it partially
but not to everything.

407
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,373
As Baek Seong-u stated,

408
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,000
she admits to murdering the victim
and abandoning their body.

409
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:53,505
But it wasn't premeditated.
It's manslaughter by reason of insanity.

410
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,925
Baek's public defender.

411
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,346
Does he admit to being an accomplice?

412
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,847
He doesn't admit it, either.

413
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,019
He gave his statement
regarding the crime, didn't he?

414
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,938
He did, but he wasn't her accomplice.

415
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,898
He only abetted the murder.

416
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,108
On what basis?

417
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:17,362
Until Han Ye-eun actually committed murder
at Baek Seong-u's apartment,

418
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,949
Baek Seong-u thought
this whole ordeal was a joke.

419
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,417
Ye-eun.

420
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,753
Is your address

421
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,591
Capital Palace, unit 103, apartment 3201?

422
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,677
Sorry?

423
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,224
Is your address Capital Palace,
unit 103, apartment 3201?

424
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,143
Yes.

425
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,353
Yes, when someone asks for your address,

426
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:55,066
people normally answer yes or no
just like you did, right?

427
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,193
Yes.

428
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:01,322
And people ask this question
when they're planning to visit

429
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,076
or send something. Is that right?

430
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,829
Probably.

431
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:13,334
But why did Baek Seong-u reply with,

432
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,879
"Is he alive? Did you check the CCTV?"

433
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,679
They exchanged messages
on social media at 11:28 a.m.

434
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,775
YOUR ADDRESS IS UNIT 101,
APARTMENT 1402, RIGHT?

435
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,485
IS HE ALIVE?

436
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,739
The elevator CCTV footage
was captured at 11:29 a.m.

437
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,206
The CCTV footage
and the conversation tell us two things.

438
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,543
First, the person who lured
the victim to the crime scene

439
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,714
wasn't Baek Seong-u, but Han Ye-eun.

440
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,299
Hey.

441
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,593
Second.

442
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,930
"Is he alive? Did you check the CCTV?"

443
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,598
This reply from Baek Seong-u

444
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:15,313
shows that they conspired
to commit the crime.

445
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:22,195
Even if Han Ye-eun lured the victim
into Baek Seong-u's apartment,

446
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,282
it's difficult to tell
whether he took it as a joke or not.

447
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,828
Baek Seong-u's public defender.
What do you think?

448
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,124
I'm sure they'll claim it was accidental.

449
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,961
They can't deny abduction, murder,
and mutilation and disposal

450
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,004
because Baek Seong-u
already confessed to them.

451
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,882
For Baek Seong-u, it's whether
he's an accomplice or an abettor.

452
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,427
And, for Han Ye-eun, it's whether
it was premeditated or accidental.

453
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,723
They'll claim that it was abetted
and that it was an accident respectively.

454
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,309
Then we need to see
if their claims are legitimate

455
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,603
or if there are any holes
in their arguments.

456
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,648
Witness. How do you know Han Ye-eun?

457
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,401
I'm a psychiatrist,

458
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,612
and I've been Han Ye-eun's doctor
for about three years.

459
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,281
How's her condition?

460
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,950
WITNESS STAND

461
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:15,790
In other words,
she suffers from depressive behavior,

462
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,543
weakness of the nerves,
and persistent delusions.

463
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,297
Persistent delusions? Please elaborate.

464
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,842
Well, there are many types
of delusional disorders.

465
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,553
In Han Ye-eun's case, it was persecutory.

466
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,056
In other words, she was paranoid.

467
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,477
Persecutory delusional patients interpret

468
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,815
other people's actions as threats,
slander, or harassment,

469
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,610
and respond to them instantly.

470
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,237
Sorry.

471
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,801
Depending on their delusions,

472
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,804
they can have a hard time
controlling their anger.

473
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,224
Then is it possible
that this case happened

474
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,518
because of her persecutory
delusional disorder?

475
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,397
Whatever the case,
I can't be 100% certain.

476
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,274
What about the possibility?

477
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:27,528
If you put it that way,
then it is possible.

478
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,739
That will be all.

479
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,924
We'll resume the trial
after a one-hour recess.

480
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,354
At this rate, this can go on forever.

481
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,106
Han Ye-eun's attorney

482
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,192
seemed to be quite prepared
to claim it was accidental.

483
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,867
WITNESS STAND

484
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,495
Baek Seong-u.

485
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,581
Do you know what that is?

486
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,004
-It's the charger cable for my cell phone.
-And…

487
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,631
it was also the murder weapon
used in killing the victim, right?

488
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,050
Yes.

489
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,554
Can you tell us what happened at the time?

490
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,642
-Hey.
-As I said earlier,

491
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,812
I didn't see Han Ye-eun kill that boy

492
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,733
because I was getting changed
in another room. But…

493
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,360
How about this?

494
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:53,531
Why don't we pit Baek Seong-u
against Han Ye-eun

495
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,288
and make them reveal the truth
about each other?

496
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,876
Did you really kill him?

497
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,170
Hey, you crazy bitch! Answer me! Fuck!

498
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,967
Both of us…

499
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,179
don't have to go to jail.

500
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,765
We both…

501
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,060
can get away with this.

502
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,898
Are you saying

503
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,900
Han Ye-eun was the one who started this?

504
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,779
Yes. She said there was a way.

505
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,240
She removed her fingerprints
from the charger cable and put mine on it.

506
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,534
She said she had a plan
and I just had to follow it.

507
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,127
So, who came up with the idea
of mutilating the body?

508
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,346
Baek Seong-u.

509
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,725
He told me to do it.

510
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,771
I was distressed

511
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,898
after killing the kid.

512
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,070
Then he told me to do it.

513
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,740
He instructed me

514
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,912
on how to slice the body into pieces
from outside the bathroom.

515
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,374
And he told me to throw away the organs
in the food waste bin

516
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,503
and the body pieces

517
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,881
in the rooftop water tank.

518
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,427
-He threatened me.
-Hey, it was your idea!

519
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,263
You told me we had to avoid the cameras!

520
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,764
That's all a lie!

521
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,308
-She did it herself!
-I'm telling the truth!

522
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,687
You told me how from outside the bathroom!

523
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,021
Hey, you said you'd do it!

524
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,691
I said we should turn ourselves in,
but you said you wanted to try!

525
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,819
-When did I say that?
-Are you serious?

526
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,321
What the fuck!
You're the one who picked that ax!

527
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,241
You even danced around
after you killed him.

528
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,284
When did I do that?

529
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,745
She chopped him up with an ax
and started dancing when she saw blood!

530
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,330
She's crazy, I'm telling you!

531
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,040
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

532
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,542
Fuck, I'll kill you!

533
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,794
Please, stop!

534
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,847
Please, stop.

535
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,975
Please.

536
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,146
Honey.

537
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,981
Honey!

538
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,165
My baby! Ji-hu…

539
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,202
Due to Baek Seong-u

540
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,496
and Han Ye-eun's voluntary confession,

541
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,999
it will be meaningless
to proceed with this trial any further.

542
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,586
And, lastly, the victim…

543
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,799
Yun Ji-hu's mother.

544
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,721
So you won't have any regrets later,

545
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,182
would you care to say a few words

546
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,185
if you have anything to say?

547
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,527
Paranoia?

548
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,988
Schizophrenia?

549
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,116
I don't care about any of that.

550
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,662
What matters to me is…

551
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,083
What's clear is…

552
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,712
that my child…

553
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,383
trembled in fear…

554
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,722
without his mom in a stranger's house…

555
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,144
and left this world.

556
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,283
I still…

557
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,829
don't know…

558
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,832
why…

559
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,920
my innocent child

560
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,132
had to die like that.

561
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,224
Your Honor.

562
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,811
Please…

563
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,316
punish them severely…

564
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,904
so something like this won't happen again.

565
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,833
Whatever the reason was,

566
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,545
they committed a heinous crime.

567
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,923
We should sentence Han Ye-eun
to the maximum 20-year sentence,

568
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,718
and sentence Baek Seong-u
with the maximum sentence

569
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,596
we can give him at his age.

570
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,810
The maximum is…

571
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,313
two years at a juvenile reformatory.

572
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,527
What do you think, Judge Cha?

573
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,406
I also think we should sentence
Han Ye-eun to 20 years.

574
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,742
And for Seong-u…

575
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,746
The court has made its decision.

576
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,835
The offenders targeted
an innocent stranger for murder

577
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,714
and treated him like an object.

578
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,594
They murdered him brutally
just for the sake of killing.

579
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,473
This was an especially heinous crime

580
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,851
that shocked
and frightened parents who have

581
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,644
elementary school-aged children.

582
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,438
The court sentences Han Ye-eun
to 20 years,

583
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,732
the maximum sentence
for juvenile offenses,

584
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,446
and Baek Seong-u to two years
in the juvenile reformatory.

585
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:31,947
No!

586
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,992
-They can't do this to me!
-Don't do this.

587
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,952
-How can I get 20 years?
-Stop it!

588
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,079
Don't touch me!

589
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,750
Let me go! Don't order me around,
you lousy lawyer!

590
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,462
Let go! Let go of me, you bastards!

591
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,006
-You bastards! I'll kill you all!
-Seong-u. Don't worry.

592
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:53,761
-Let go of me! Let go! I'm innocent!
-Don't worry. Okay?

593
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,253
Baek Seong-u is pushing to appeal.
What is Miss Han going to do?

594
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,673
She won't accept the court's decision.
She'll appeal against it.

595
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,550
Is she denying all charges?

596
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,638
Wait! Wait, ma'am!

597
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,434
This is from the judge.

598
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,402
Hello, Ms. Joo?

599
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,195
I'll be right there.

600
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,826
I'm sorry. I'm quite behind with work.
Bye then.

601
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:00,911
Right.

602
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,664
It's from Judge Sim.

603
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,388
Han Ye-eun won't ever change, will she?

604
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,184
Do you think a prison sentence
is really the best for someone like her?

605
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,687
That's the role of the court.

606
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,523
Even though we're judges,

607
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,693
we can't change who she is inside.

608
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,278
I'm just worried.

609
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,907
She'll serve out her sentence
and grow into an adult.

610
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,826
What happens after that?

611
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,995
That's up to her parents.

612
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,000
If only they could make her realize
how serious her crime is.

613
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,003
But…

614
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,007
that won't happen.

615
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,430
She committed such a heinous crime,

616
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,350
but her parents
didn't even attend the trial.

617
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,687
If the parents don't make an effort,

618
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,315
their children will never change.

619
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:01,490
Can I borrow your phone?

620
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,075
I have to call my mom.

621
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,287
Mom?

622
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,949
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

623
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,371
Judge Cha!

624
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,916
You said you'd reduce the punishment.
How can you do this to me?

625
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,128
You said you'd reduce the punishment.
You told me that.

626
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,297
You even introduced me
to his public defender.

627
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,341
You said the judges weren't the enemy.

628
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,261
But why didn't you release Seong-u?

629
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,472
He wasn't the one who killed the boy!

630
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,516
What I meant was…

631
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,102
Release Seong-u! Release him right now.

632
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,271
You said you'd release him.
Why did you lock him up?

633
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,023
The boy was killed in your apartment.

634
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,026
But your son

635
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,530
didn't call the police
but rather helped her.

636
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,533
Your son

637
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,912
caused confusion to the investigation

638
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,956
and even turned himself in falsely.

639
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,835
For those reasons,

640
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,297
he has to be held responsible.

641
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,011
Judge Sim.

642
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,181
There's an old saying that goes,

643
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,392
"The pain of a mother who loses her child

644
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,480
is as severe as
that of her innards splitting."

645
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,488
What did you do for Seong-u
when he was nine?

646
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,200
When Ji-hu was nine…

647
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,621
Ji-hu's mother…

648
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,125
lost her child…

649
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,548
because of your son.

650
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,748
Judge Sim.

651
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,502
That wasn't what I meant.

652
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,549
I understand why you said that.

653
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,593
And you weren't wrong.

654
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,219
But…

655
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,681
if the guardian took your words
the wrong way,

656
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,184
you, as a judge, are the one to blame.

657
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,438
I'll be careful.

658
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,702
No matter how many I take…

659
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,291
I just can't get used to juvenile cases.

660
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,962
They always leave me feeling disturbed.

661
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,638
Go home early today. Get some rest.

662
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,475
Only then can we prepare
for the next trial.

663
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,314
Good work.

664
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,011
JI-HU'S BABY BOOK

665
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,444
Aren't you coming?

666
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,289
I wish I had kept writing this.

667
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,252
I wish I had written in it every day.

668
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,948
Is this for me?

669
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,202
Do you like it? That's from Ji-hu.

670
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,912
Say thank you to her.

671
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,749
Thank you.

672
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,962
Where's Ji-hu? I should thank him too.

673
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,928
What are you going to say to Ji-hu?

674
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,473
"Thank you, Ji-hu."

675
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,026
I wanted to hug him so badly,

676
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,321
but I couldn't.

677
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,830
I should be the one thanking you.
Thank you for welcoming his toy.

678
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,336
Thank you so much.

679
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,638
WHEN SEONG-U LOST HIS BABY TEETH

680
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,889
SEONG-U'S TALENT SHOW

681
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,666
What did you do for Seong-u
when he was nine?

682
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,377
When Ji-hu was nine,

683
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,798
Ji-hu's mother lost her child…

684
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,179
because of your son.

685
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,170
I'm sorry.

686
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,673
I'm sorry.

687
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,220
I'm the one to blame.

688
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,930
It's…

689
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,892
It's all my fault.

690
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,869
No matter how many I take…

691
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,873
I just can't get used to juvenile cases.

692
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,168
They always leave me feeling disturbed.

693
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,550
Young offenders are the ones
who get punished.

694
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,804
But, at times,

695
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,181
it's others who bear their crimes.

696
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,520
Honey.

697
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,814
Honey.

698
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,316
Honey.

699
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,994
"Did we sentence
a justified punishment today?

700
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,706
Did the punishment

701
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,543
give the victim a sense of closure?

702
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,715
Is the young offender reflecting
on themselves?"

703
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,220
It's over…

704
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,179
GED EXAM QUESTIONS

705
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,764
…but it's not really over yet.

706
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,560
That's the work we do.

707
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:28,802
COURT OF KOREA
