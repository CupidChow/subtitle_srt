1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,305
What are you talking about?
I thought you were on your way.

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,018
I was, but one of the boys I'm in charge
of got involved in an assault case.

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,853
All the night shift officers
are at the scene.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:20,770
What about us?

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,773
Even if we do go,
it'll be hard to find them.

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,109
If it's seven kids we have to look for,

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:30,238
we're going to need more manpower.
You know better than anyone

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,158
that we are each in charge
of over 100 kids.

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,578
We're short-staffed as is.

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,580
After I take care of this,

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,875
I'll check the available officers
in the jurisdiction and call you back.

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,209
Wait. Hello…

13
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,214
See?

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,759
See what you've done?

15
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,427
Why not just report to the police--

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,636
And tell them what?

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,058
You're the one who chased them away?
Should I tell them that?

18
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,316
Tell me where else they might be.

19
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,027
That's it.

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,363
This isn't Seoul.

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,076
If you haven't found them by now,
you'll never find them.

22
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,463
I see you were admitted several times
due to thyroid problems.

23
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,590
Your hormone levels are
below the normal range.

24
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,551
Have you been
under a lot of stress lately?

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,221
No, not really.

26
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,516
What about your medication?
You haven't been taking it, have you?

27
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,560
Well… I tried.

28
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,480
If you keep skipping your meds,
your health will get worse.

29
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,274
If your hormone levels drop even more,
I'm going to admit you.

30
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,029
You can go home for the day.
Make sure to get plenty of rest.

31
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,572
-Okay.
-Thank you.

32
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,576
Come on, Mom.

33
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,496
I'm okay.

34
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,124
I don't know what to say.

35
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,667
What do you mean?

36
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,086
We're the ones who are in the wrong.

37
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,963
I'm just so embarrassed.

38
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,759
I heard you used the money for surgery.

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,973
Yu-gyeong told me everything.

40
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,269
About life at the center
and the court subsidies.

41
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,650
You should have reported it to the court.

42
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,114
Yes. I know.

43
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,746
Yes, Judge Sim?

44
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,583
I called you, but you didn't pick up…

45
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,588
What?

46
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,217
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS FOUNDING CELEBRATION

47
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,856
A-reum.

48
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,859
A-reum!

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,944
Careful, A-jin.

50
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,543
A-reum.

51
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,420
A-reum!

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,640
-A-reum.
-Mom.

53
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,724
Are you okay?

54
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,604
A-reum. It's not true, is it?

55
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,942
I must have misheard. You couldn't have.

56
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,027
Why would you do that?

57
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,153
It was me.

58
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,325
I kicked those pests out.

59
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,788
And it felt good.

60
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,041
Kim A-reum.

61
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,836
Don't you remember, Mom?

62
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,382
Those bitches were using you.

63
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:21,427
That's all you get after cooking meals
for them and doing their laundry.

64
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,390
Mom, you're the one who has to wake up!

65
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,933
What are you, a pushover?

66
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,521
You even collapsed because of them,
so why are you looking for them?

67
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,691
Who cares if they're gone?

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
What's so bad about kicking them out?

69
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,488
What does it matter
if those bitches go out and die?

70
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,447
Enough!

71
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,329
I told you to watch your mouth.

72
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,416
I told you to watch what you say!

73
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,375
Mom.

74
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,168
Seriously…

75
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,962
That's enough.

76
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,924
Take your sister and go upstairs.

77
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,218
-Why should I?
-I'm not playing with you.

78
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,198
Seven kids just disappeared.

79
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,285
What will you do about this?

80
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,663
How can this happen?

81
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,710
Judge Sim, we should start looking for--

82
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,211
We won't find them.

83
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,922
We're talking about seven kids.

84
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,760
We gave them a reason to run away
and they don't want to be found.

85
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,595
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,847
-Whatever it takes--
-Yes.

87
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,766
You must find them

88
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,186
whatever it takes.

89
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,914
Min-gyeong.

90
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,791
-Min-gyeong.
-Ms. O.

91
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,002
Oh gosh. It's okay.

92
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,170
What happened?

93
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,548
We were patrolling the neighborhood
and found her crying alone.

94
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,384
She seemed to be from the center.

95
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,761
What's this? How did this happen?

96
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,012
It was…

97
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,890
Yeong-na.

98
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,893
If you don't want to go then get lost,
you fucking bitch.

99
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,686
I can't walk anymore!

100
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,690
You have some money, right?

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,943
Hand it over.

102
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,569
-Give it up.
-Ji-eun!

103
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,363
-Fuck!
-Let go of me!

104
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,156
-Let's just go!
-Let me go!

105
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,161
So, where did they go?

106
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,332
I don't know. They said
they're going to some train station.

107
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,140
If they really left the area,
they'll contact someone they're close to.

108
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,018
They don't have money
and they'll need a place to stay tonight.

109
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,562
When you get to the center,

110
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,939
call their legal guardians
and their friends.

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,734
Judge Cha and I will call the court
that appointed Pureum Home for Girls.

112
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,613
That'll be a bit difficult.

113
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,783
It's getting pretty late.

114
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,913
I'll call the kids
as soon as the sun comes up.

115
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,791
You two should be getting back.

116
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,585
You have to go to work tomorrow.

117
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,963
Yes, we have to report to Mr. Kang too.

118
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,103
Here.

119
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,690
Gosh.

120
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,743
If we give our report in the morning,
a court investigator might visit you.

121
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,163
Don't try to protect the kids
by withholding information.

122
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,080
Just be honest.

123
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,582
All right.

124
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,835
You should go get some rest. You're ill.

125
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,170
Drive safely.

126
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,671
Let's go.

127
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,219
It's okay.

128
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,054
-Bye.
-Bye.

129
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,899
We'll be able

130
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,860
to find the kids, right?

131
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,941
-Mom.
-Yes?

132
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,616
What do I do?

133
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,044
Goodness.

134
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,638
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

135
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,058
What are you talking about?
What do you mean the kids disappeared?

136
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,852
There was a fight at the center,

137
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,563
and all the kids were kicked out.

138
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,815
What?

139
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,901
A local police station found
one of the seven kids and--

140
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,362
We investigated the lead
you wanted us to bury.

141
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,741
In doing so, we found cases of assault
that were never reported

142
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,368
and found out
that court subsidies were used illicitly.

143
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,704
Well, technically it wasn't illicit.

144
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,497
It was used for a victim's surgery--

145
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,000
Hold on. Wait.

146
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,836
To sum it up,

147
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,089
you defied my order, conducted
an investigation, and this happened?

148
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,674
Is that right?

149
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,510
Yes, sir.

150
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,262
You imbeciles!

151
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,183
I told you not to, didn't I?
I made myself very clear!

152
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,978
Six kids are missing. Six!

153
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,358
What will you do about it?
How are you going to handle it?

154
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,070
Both we and the center will cooperate
with the probation office

155
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,280
and find them no matter what.

156
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,365
Find them!

157
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,659
You made this mess, so you clean it up.

158
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,496
Gosh, what…

159
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,831
How…

160
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,292
Get out! I don't want to see your faces!

161
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,592
Pureum hasn't called yet?

162
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,096
Yes. Maybe she's still making calls.

163
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,227
The longer they're on the streets,

164
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,064
the more money they will need.
And they'll succumb to temptation.

165
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,984
Juvenile crimes aren't just committed.

166
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,072
It's something they sink into.

167
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,743
You have a trial today, right?

168
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,247
You should get ready.
I'll keep thinking about it.

169
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,340
Judge Sim, I'll get going now.

170
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,974
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

171
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,278
Judge Sim, what do we do?

172
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,322
The kids…

173
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,786
The defendant apologized to the victim,
made financial compensations,

174
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,329
and is repenting deeply.

175
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,377
I hereby sentence
probation numbers one, three, and four.

176
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,171
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

177
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,797
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

178
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,048
Ma'am. This way.

179
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,009
-Okay.
-You can go that way.

180
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,261
Judge Cha.

181
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,848
We just got an urgent message.

182
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,059
Yes. I'm on my way.

183
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,853
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

184
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,313
Judge Sim!

185
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,858
I heard you got a call from Yeon-ji.

186
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,703
Hello?

187
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,374
Who is it? Yeong-na?

188
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,793
Yeon-ji?

189
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,919
Who is this?

190
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,716
If you're not going to talk,
I'm hanging up.

191
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,593
It's me, Yeon-ji.

192
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,227
Hello?

193
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,020
Hello?

194
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,522
I'm here.

195
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,566
You're alone, right?

196
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,778
I was going to hang up if it wasn't you.

197
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,615
Everyone's outside.

198
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,992
You know how Ms. O is like.

199
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:52,122
I hit you and stole your money
because of that crazy bitch Yeong-na.

200
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,583
You know what she's like
when she goes crazy.

201
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,710
I only pretended to hit you.

202
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,963
I know.

203
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,590
I didn't know when we were at the center,

204
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,426
but the girls here are totally nuts.

205
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,973
They're so on edge that they have shifts
to keep guard so no one runs away.

206
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,895
I snuck away from Yeong-na
while buying drinks to call you.

207
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,816
So what are you going to do now?

208
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,943
That's why I'm calling you.

209
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,445
Help me.

210
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,616
She went to Seoul with the kids,

211
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:33,664
and they're forcing her
into prostitution today at 6 p.m.

212
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,334
She wanted help
because she's the first to go.

213
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,919
Place?

214
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,838
I don't know the exact location.

215
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,632
She just said a motel near Seoul Station.

216
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,262
We have to save her.

217
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,682
Things have gotten way out of hand.

218
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,893
I don't know what to do.

219
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,522
When a kid on probation goes missing,
the judge in charge is also in trouble.

220
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,901
Do you know why?

221
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,696
Well, if a kid runs away--

222
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,823
Because it could lead to prostitution!

223
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,868
Because that's the only way
they can make money.

224
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,411
Because that's the easiest.

225
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,625
This is what happens to kids you kick out.

226
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,047
We can't lose her this time.

227
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,466
We'll ask the probation office
for cooperation.

228
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,179
We'll catch O Yeon-ji today,
as well as the others.

229
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,352
Yes, did you get the photo
and the report we sent?

230
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,729
There are in total six kids
we need to save.

231
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,191
O Yeon-ji, a 14-year-old girl,
is a victim of forced prostitution.

232
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,735
-What should we do with the money?
-Beef.

233
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,821
The other runaways are 15-year-olds,
Ko Hye-rim, Yeo Ji-eun

234
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,117
Han Min-ju, and Yun Eun-jeong.

235
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,373
And their de facto leader
is 16-year-old Choi Yeong-na.

236
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,546
We have to save them no matter what.

237
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,384
Yes, this is Sim Eun-seok.

238
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,511
Can you do me a favor?

239
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,536
Damn.

240
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,265
Should I shower first?

241
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,559
Well…

242
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,061
Sure, I guess.

243
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,417
What are you doing? Why…

244
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,549
Too many girls
just run away with my money.

245
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,515
MOTEL

246
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,230
Welcome.

247
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,691
A Juvenile Protection Act
violation was reported.

248
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,193
We need your security footage.

249
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,322
Of course.

250
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,406
Go ahead.

251
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,371
Can we check the view of the street?

252
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,165
-This street?
-Yes.

253
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,965
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

254
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,343
Have you seen a bunch
of high school girls? This is them.

255
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,427
No, I haven't.

256
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,555
MOTEL

257
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,773
We're headed towards where the motels are.

258
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,627
HOTEL

259
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,509
MOTEL

260
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,108
Want something to drink?

261
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,277
Ms. O will be here soon.

262
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,242
Ms. Joo, what are you doing here?

263
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,661
Just… No reason.

264
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,342
-Nothing.
-Let's move on.

265
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,804
Yes, Judge Sim?

266
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:45,726
We checked all the security cameras
in the area but found nothing.

267
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,852
What about you?

268
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,229
There are a few motels left to check,

269
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,732
but nothing so far.

270
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,152
We're going across
towards the old motel strip.

271
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,030
We'll keep looking and let you know.

272
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,073
This is so much fun, right?

273
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:00,991
Hey!

274
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:01,950
-What?
-Come on.

275
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,243
What is it?

276
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,786
What's your deal, bitch?

277
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,122
-It's the judge.
-What judge?

278
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,374
The guy judge we saw at Pureum, moron.

279
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,834
He just passed by.

280
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,630
Looks like a cop next to him.

281
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,341
Damn it! How did he know we were here?

282
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,759
That's what I'm saying.

283
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,010
-Hey.
-What?

284
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,138
Shit. Does he know
Ko Hye-rim and Yeo Ji-eun?

285
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,561
Hye-rim.

286
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,647
Ji-eun.

287
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,525
Are you kids okay?

288
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,363
You shouldn't be doing this.

289
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,740
You shouldn't be here.

290
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,741
No.

291
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,161
If we get caught now…

292
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,955
Come with me.

293
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,831
Run!

294
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,209
Hye-rim!

295
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,295
Move!

296
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,380
Hye-rim!

297
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,423
No!

298
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,341
Damn.

299
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,928
No!

300
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,960
What?

301
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,336
Fuck.

302
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,902
Fuck.

303
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,782
-Hye-rim!
-Hey! Move!

304
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,075
Move!

305
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,411
-No.
-Let go of me!

306
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,334
Hye-rim.

307
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,419
No.

308
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,420
Hye-rim.

309
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,672
-No.
-Let go of me!

310
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,923
Damn!

311
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,009
Come on!

312
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,969
Seriously!

313
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,140
Hye-rim.

314
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,393
Where's Yeon-ji?

315
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,820
You bitch. Are you playing with me?

316
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,364
You playing with me?

317
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,324
Come here!

318
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,035
How dare you…

319
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,039
You bitch! You think this is a joke?

320
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,463
I'd like to see a list of rooms
that are currently occupied.

321
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,221
Sorry.

322
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,348
Thank you.

323
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,650
Take another step. I dare you.

324
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,695
The moment you do, I'm going to
kill myself and you're going to jail.

325
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,157
You fucking bitch. Put that down.

326
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,575
Don't give me that bullshit.

327
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,953
Go right ahead.
Go ahead and stab yourself.

328
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,456
We're from Yeonhwa Police Station.

329
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,918
We received a report of violation
of the Juvenile Protection Act.

330
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,378
Help me!

331
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,714
Shut up!

332
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,509
Open the door! Yeon-ji!

333
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,719
O Yeon-ji!

334
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,388
Shut up!

335
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,722
O Yeon-ji!

336
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,183
Yeon-ji, are you in there?

337
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,651
Yeon-ji!

338
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,028
Open the door!

339
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,281
Stay quiet.

340
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,757
Get down!

341
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,677
Let go!

342
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,849
You're under arrest for violation
of the Juvenile Protection Act.

343
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:36,766
No!

344
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,061
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

345
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,439
Refusing to make a statement
won't be used against you.

346
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,817
But anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

347
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,050
This is why we live by the law.

348
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,220
For your own good.

349
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,226
I really thought I was going to die.

350
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,073
We don't have a lot of time.
Get dressed and come out.

351
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,710
You must be tired.

352
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,715
I just talked to Judge Sim.
They found the kids.

353
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,175
Thank goodness.

354
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,719
They found them.

355
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,682
Great work.

356
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,850
Judge Sim. I'll see you there.

357
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,729
Yeon-ji.

358
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,108
It's okay. Don't worry.

359
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,365
Hye-rim. Eun-jeong.

360
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,828
Sir. Let's go.

361
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,204
Ko Gang-sik.

362
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,164
-I thought you're buying drinks.
-Be right there!

363
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,589
Thank you for helping us on your day off.

364
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,924
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.

365
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,801
I mean, you helped us last time,

366
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,304
but it's not like
you were interested in juvenile cases.

367
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,346
I know.

368
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,349
You give me
nothing but trouble, Judge Sim.

369
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,393
Great work today.

370
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,440
And from now on, just call me once.

371
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:53,987
Let's go.

372
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,160
What's going to happen to the kids?

373
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,038
Yeon-ji will be placed
in a juvenile classification center.

374
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,373
Getting therapy should come first.

375
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,336
The rest of the kids
will be investigated by the police.

376
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,382
I haven't seen Yeong-na yet.

377
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,884
I know.

378
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,223
A-reum gave her statement
while we were chasing the kids.

379
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,809
She told us where Yeong-na is.

380
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,897
How did A-reum know…

381
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,775
There's a very talented judicial mediator
in our court.

382
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,277
I asked for her help in advance.

383
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,529
You must've been shocked.

384
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,742
You don't have to worry about your mom.

385
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,078
I've been working here for ten years.

386
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,373
I can tell right away
that this is not a big deal.

387
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,793
I'm saying it's nothing. It's okay.

388
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,256
-Put that away.
-Okay.

389
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,593
And this isn't an official investigation.

390
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,973
We're just checking the facts
so there's no need to feel pressured.

391
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,268
But the result will be reported
to Judge Sim and Judge Cha.

392
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,854
So if you feel like
you'll be put at a disadvantage

393
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,315
or if you don't want to talk,
you don't have to.

394
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,529
So can you tell me
what happened at the center

395
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,406
that day?

396
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,493
Wait.

397
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,873
Are you saying
that A-reum covered for Yeong-na?

398
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,836
She's the one who kicked her out.
Why would she?

399
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,256
Then how did she know?

400
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,508
She called.

401
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,136
I need help.

402
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,054
Where are you?

403
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,556
Are you alone?

404
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,932
Hey.

405
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,353
Fuck. Who are you calling?

406
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,938
No. It's not what it looks like.

407
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,190
-Hello?
-You fucking bitch.

408
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,067
Yeon-ji, are you okay?

409
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,236
Yeon-ji, that moron

410
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,948
got caught by Yeong-na when she called.

411
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,577
And Min-gyeong wasn't of much help,

412
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,789
so I just took the phone
and convinced her.

413
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,833
Convinced her?

414
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,837
Or was it a threat?

415
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,965
I know her weakness.

416
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,550
Her mom.

417
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,263
She loves her mom to bits,

418
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,475
but her mom left a year ago.

419
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:33,021
A while back,
her mom called telling us she was sick.

420
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,942
So Yeong-na should go
to her uncle's house when she gets out.

421
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,987
So, I used that.

422
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,114
Do you want to fucking die?

423
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,410
Hey, say that again.

424
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,165
What about my mom?

425
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,588
So go find your mom, you crazy bitch.

426
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,882
Pimping isn't what's important.

427
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,219
Your mom might die any day now.

428
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,057
Yeong-na probably went to find her mom.

429
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,768
Her mom who's always been unwell.

430
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,609
But wait, Judge Sim.

431
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:24,989
Yes, Yeong-na's mom was
the only one who didn't pick up.

432
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,076
So we have to find Yeong-na.

433
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,454
Whatever it takes.

434
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,415
No matter what.

435
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,396
Who are you?

436
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,231
We're from Yeonhwa District Court.

437
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,026
Are you Choi Yeong-na's mother?

438
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,404
-Who?
-Yeong-na.

439
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,447
Choi Yeong-na.

440
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,201
No. I don't have a child by that name.

441
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,664
Maybe the girl from before?

442
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,750
Some girl came here.

443
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,184
Oh my.

444
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,271
Choi Yeong-na.

445
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,565
Yeong-na.

446
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,487
Oh, my. What's going on?

447
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,616
What happened?

448
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,243
What are you doing here?

449
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,624
Did you meet your mom?

450
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,086
My mom?

451
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,132
Who is it?

452
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,103
Mom.

453
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,859
Honey, who is it?

454
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,736
No one.

455
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,328
Some kid came to the wrong house.

456
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,143
She wasn't sick.

457
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,814
She lied so she could abandon me.

458
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,525
Fuck.

459
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,820
My mom…

460
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,198
What kind of mom…

461
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,291
It's okay, Yeong-na.

462
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,698
It's okay. You can cry.

463
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,660
Yes, Judge Sim. Where's Yeong-na?

464
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,038
I turned her over
to the juvenile classification center.

465
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,915
Both her physical
and mental state is a mess.

466
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,209
Come to the courthouse.

467
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,377
Okay, I will.

468
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,215
Are you worried?

469
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,343
You must know well that

470
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,138
most kids who get sent to us

471
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,766
don't have a good family background.

472
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,354
I thought I'd be used to it by now,

473
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,690
but it's hard every time.

474
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,443
I am especially worried

475
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,863
about what will happen to Yeong-na.

476
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,872
-Here. Let me get that.
-Okay.

477
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,374
If you meet a guy like your dad,
you'll be in trouble.

478
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,292
Really?

479
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,671
-Gosh, Mom.
-Thank you.

480
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,048
-Bye.
-Bye.

481
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,341
It's cold.

482
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,028
Open the door. Open the fucking door!

483
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,446
You bitch!

484
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,659
Open the fucking door!

485
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,079
Fucking open it!

486
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,083
Hey, who the hell are you?

487
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,836
-Why are you causing such a ruckus?
-You fucking bitch! Get out here!

488
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,712
What the hell? Piss off.

489
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,299
-Get out of my way. Get out!
-Hey!

490
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,254
Kids who get hurt at home
tend to self-harm.

491
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,179
They would commit crimes
they normally wouldn't

492
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,264
or fall in with the wrong crowd.

493
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,060
They know it themselves
that it's a wrong thing to do.

494
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,937
But they do it anyway.

495
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,026
They hope hurting themselves

496
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,446
will somehow hurt their families as well.

497
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,907
I want to report corruption.

498
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,995
Pureum Home for Girls.

499
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,919
They want to be noticed.

500
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,880
They want others to know

501
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,258
they're having a hard time.

502
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,309
The start of most misconduct
is the family.

503
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,022
I didn't intend to kick them out at first.

504
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,943
I just wanted the center to go bankrupt.

505
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
If it went out of business,

506
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,866
my dad could come back.

507
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,620
Mom. Wake up. Mom!

508
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,122
Mom, wake up.
Mom, what's wrong? Are you okay?

509
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,043
Hey! A-jin! Get out here!

510
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,880
But I had no idea my mom would collapse.

511
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,801
If something happens to her because of me…

512
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,804
It's…

513
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,848
It was…

514
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,644
so scary.

515
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,777
Yes, you must've been startled.

516
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,659
But why did you kick out the kids?

517
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,251
It's okay. You can tell me.

518
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,840
Are you at the hospital? What about Mom?

519
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,968
A-jin, what did the doctors say?

520
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,679
Is Mom okay?

521
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,308
A-jin, is Mom okay?

522
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,187
Fuck. This is hilarious.

523
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,899
This drink is good.

524
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,609
-I'm doing this because…
-Oh, my God.

525
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,777
I guess your life sucks.

526
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,904
Fuck. What do you know about life?

527
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,364
What about you? Do you know?

528
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,575
-Awesome.
-I don't know. It hits the spot.

529
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,202
Look at me. I'm Ms. O.

530
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,621
"If you don't clean your plate,
it is a sin."

531
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,248
-You're doing it wrong.
-No, I'm not.

532
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,292
-What are you talking about?
-Listen.

533
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,878
-"If you don't clean your plate…"
-I got it.

534
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,463
-Stop.
-What the hell?

535
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,466
Gosh, since Ms. O isn't here
this place is actually decent.

536
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,259
You know, she might die soon.

537
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,595
For real? I hope she just dies!

538
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,514
Hey, girls!

539
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,891
-Die!
-Die!

540
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,687
What about A-reum and A-jin?
They don't have a mom or a dad.

541
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,605
What a pity.

542
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,959
When we visited for the inspection,

543
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,215
someone reported Pureum to the courthouse

544
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,386
for child abuse and illicit use of funds.

545
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,225
Do you know who made the report?

546
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,521
Kim A-reum.

547
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,817
Your daughter.

548
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,027
What…

549
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,739
Why would A-reum do that?

550
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,241
That's…

551
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,869
for you to find out.

552
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,666
She probably knew she shouldn't have,
but did it anyway.

553
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,586
She probably wanted to be noticed.

554
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,005
That she wants you to know…

555
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,384
she's having a hard time.

556
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,572
So…

557
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,909
make sure you're not too late

558
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,414
like Yeong-na's mother.

559
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,011
We're going to get going then.

560
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,222
I'm terribly sorry for everything.

561
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,477
It's okay. You must be tired.
You should get some rest.

562
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,145
Take care.

563
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,023
Take care, A-reum.

564
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:24,982
Bye.

565
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,594
I'll hold the bag.

566
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,970
It's okay.

567
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,306
Give it.

568
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,028
Why aren't you coming?

569
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,531
I'm coming.

570
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,910
A-reum said

571
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,871
you started the Pureum Home for Girls

572
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,582
after suffering a huge heartbreak.

573
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,630
I can't hear the baby's heartbeat.
One second.

574
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,653
She said you think of every girl at Pureum

575
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,615
as the daughter
you had to let go of that day.

576
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,541
She wants you to stop hurting.

577
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,168
She wants her mom

578
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,589
to be happy.

579
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,862
I'm so embarrassed.

580
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:41,452
I'm a youth counseling instructor and…

581
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,206
You're not an instructor.

582
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,380
You're a mother

583
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,842
to A-reum.

584
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,501
-Hey, A-reum.
-What?

585
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:33,879
Wait for me.

586
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,881
What's with you?

587
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,426
What? Are you embarrassed of your own mom?

588
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,014
I'm tired. Give me a piggyback ride.

589
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,974
What, a piggyback ride?

590
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,434
Gosh, you're so heavy.

591
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,645
-Gosh, you can't even carry me?
-Seriously.

592
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,272
I'm just tired.

593
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,357
You're tired?

594
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,275
Gosh, I hate you.

595
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,194
Well, I love you.

596
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,659
I thought about canceling

597
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,662
the appointment of Pureum Home for Girls,

598
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,665
but after thinking about it,

599
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,376
I decided to let it slide.

600
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,922
We found all the girls who ran away.

601
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:21,009
Strictly speaking, it's hard to say
that court subsidies were used illicitly.

602
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,723
So the head of the center will make
weekly reports and that'll be it.

603
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,393
But the prostitution case

604
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,020
and past group assault cases

605
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,148
can't be overlooked.

606
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,234
Yes, I know.

607
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:38,944
Yes, sir.

608
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,571
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE RECORDS

609
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,989
Thank goodness.

610
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,453
I was worried Pureum would get shut down.

611
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:51,165
Even Mr. Kang didn't have a choice.

612
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,753
Lacking facilities as is,
they can't afford to shut her down.

613
00:45:56,503 --> 00:46:00,215
The kids and the court
would take the brunt of it.

614
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,512
In other words, it means that the state is

615
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,350
relying solely on individual sacrifices.

616
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,357
In a sense, the court is guilty.

617
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,069
You're right.

618
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,865
So when are the people
from Daejeon District Court coming?

619
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,160
Thank you for coming all the way here.

620
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:32,456
As I said on the phone,
the reason I asked you to come here

621
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,293
is because of the appointment
of the Pureum Home for Girls.

622
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:40,339
The court that entrusted the kids
to the Pureum Home for Girls

623
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,967
is Daejeon, where you are,
and here, Yeonhwa.

624
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:48,472
If judges give different rulings
to similar cases,

625
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,933
it won't be fair.

626
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,520
So we were thinking the trial
should be handled by a single judge,

627
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:58,941
while we discussed the criteria
of the sentencing together.

628
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,152
Yes, I guess that's one way to do it.

629
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:06,323
So, who will be the judge for the trial?

630
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,955
The sentencing is as follows.

631
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,707
Choi Yeong-na, probation number ten.

632
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,793
Ko Hye-rim, probation number nine.

633
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,753
Yeo Ji-eun, probation number nine.

634
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,757
Han Min-ju, probation number nine.
Yun Eun-jeong, number nine.

635
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,262
O Yeon-ji and Woo Min-gyeong,
probation number six.

636
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,805
But I'm a victim!

637
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,641
Why am I sentenced to probation six
when I was dragged to that motel?

638
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,352
Joint assault and bodily injury
of Do Yu-gyeong.

639
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,438
Sexual exploitation, blackmailing minors,

640
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,733
and arrangement of prostitution!

641
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,569
Well…

642
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,238
shall I go on?

They want others to know
they're having a hard time.

The start of most misconduct
is the family.

MOTHER CUT CONTACT AFTER ABANDONING HOME

653
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,890
It's true that children are affected

654
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,018
by their surroundings,
including their family.

655
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,938
But it's the children themselves
who choose to commit the crime

656
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,523
in the end.

657
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,236
Not everyone resorts to crime
when push comes to shove.

658
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,866
So, to all the legal guardians
who are present today,

659
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,035
I order you to receive guardian education.

660
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,411
Especially…

661
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,498
Choi Yeong-na's legal guardian?

662
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:20,958
Yes?

663
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,418
You're her uncle, right?

664
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,045
Yes.

665
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,048
Make sure to tell her mother
to attend the course.

666
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,300
Okay.

667
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,767
You will be educated at the facilities
your children will be staying at.

668
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,396
Make sure to attend the course
and visit your children

669
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,108
and see how your children live.

670
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,363
Children do not grow up alone.

671
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,283
Today, the children have been punished,

672
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,161
but the legal guardians must

673
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,667
feel the weight of their crimes as well.

674
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,729
The trial…

675
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,898
is now closed.

676
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,152
Please forgive me. Just this once.

677
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,737
Mom. Dad.

678
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,280
Dad.

679
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,158
Eun-jeong.

680
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,129
Legal guardians, this way.

681
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,470
Ji-eun!

682
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,389
Ji-eun!

683
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,938
-Oh dear. What do I do?
-Gosh.

684
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,067
-Legal guardians, this way.
-Please, one moment.

685
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,256
You know, I'm relieved now
that the Pureum case is over.

686
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,469
Ms. O was at the hospital
and all the girls had disappeared.

687
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:41,264
Gosh, it felt as if my mind went blank.

688
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,059
Oh, right…

689
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,604
I heard that Ms. O started a new blog.

690
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,397
She's counseling new kids

691
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,400
and made visits to Yeong-na,
Yeon-ji, and Min-gyeong.

692
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,489
I'm going with her this weekend.

693
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,200
You should also…

694
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,040
I'm going to visit the girls
on the weekend.

695
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,583
You should come too.

696
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,003
How are your kids?

697
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,173
Are they doing well in school?

698
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,093
I'm not sure.

699
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:23,014
At least it seems like they are trying…

700
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,018
You said one of them's in 10th grade
and the other's in 12th grade?

701
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,603
Moonkwang High School, was it?

702
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,148
Yes, sir.

703
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,819
A prestigious private high school
with a hundred years of tradition.

704
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,240
So you must know about this case.

705
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,584
MOONKWANG HIGH EXAM PAPER LEAK
SUSPICIONS CONFIRMED TRUE

706
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:55,672
Active congressmen, ministers, doctors,
judicial officers, and even celebrities.

707
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,967
A case where test papers were leaked

708
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,097
to a group of students, whose parents'
wealth and honor are in the top 3%.

709
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,518
The prosecution's investigation
will be over soon.

710
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:13,607
And the only juvenile criminal department
in the district will take the case,

711
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,150
which is yours.

712
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,280
Before that,
are you involved in this case at all?

713
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,957
The name of that group is

714
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,752
Descartes.

715
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,338
They actually did make me an offer,
but I refused.

716
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,051
It shouldn't be a problem
for my team to take the case.

717
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,678
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

718
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,850
But…

719
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:52,979
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

720
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,106
I will hand over my work

721
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,401
and resign after this case.

722
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,363
There's something
I've been dreaming of doing,

723
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,449
and I don't think
I should delay it any further.

724
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,497
Have a good day.

725
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,800
KANG WON-JUNG
COURT OF KOREA

726
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,070
FIRST SON, SIN-U

727
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,391
It's been a while,

728
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:13,768
Sim Eun-seok.

729
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,417
We're from Yeonhwa Police Station.

730
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,961
-What do I do? I'm alone and…
-We're investigating a case.

731
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,087
Please cooperate.

732
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,298
Why are the police at our door?

733
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,466
Descartes.

734
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,177
-Open the door. Please cooperate.
-The final exams…

735
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,970
-I left the group right after…
-Excuse me.

736
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,430
Is anyone home?

737
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,146
What?

738
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,553
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
