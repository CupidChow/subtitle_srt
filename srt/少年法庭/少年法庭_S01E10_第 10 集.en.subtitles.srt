00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,139
-Hello.
-Hello.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,934
Hello.

LAW FIRM GEOBO

00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,738
MOTION TO RECUSE
DEFENDANT: HWANG IN-JUN

00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
JUDGE IN CHARGE IS PARENT
OF VICTIM IN DEFENDANT'S PRIOR CASE

SEARCH RULING
HWANG IN-JUN

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,710
CASE 2017P2027

8
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,086
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
DISPOSITION

9
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,672
CASE 2017P2027, MANSLAUGHTER

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,382
1. PARENTAL CARE
2. SHORT-TERM PROBATION

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,262
Judge Sim was the victim's parent?

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,723
So, it's you.

13
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,853
You're the whistleblower
who kicked her own boss out.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,651
She must have recognized me.

15
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,708
A motion to recuse?

16
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,087
Yes, Ms. Na is in a bad mood
because of that.

17
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,297
Where is Judge Sim?

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,466
Does she know about this?

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,553
You knew from the moment we met.

20
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,474
You knew I was the judge in charge then.

21
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,893
Yes.

22
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:47,649
Despite that, you asked me
to reassign the case to you.

23
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,110
Yes.

24
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,782
What were you thinking?

25
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,871
Were you going to punish them
on behalf of your dead son?

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,000
I had to be the one to end it.

27
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,133
Because it started off on the wrong foot…

28
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,677
Don't you agree?

29
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,973
I find that very offensive.

30
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,768
It sounds like you're blaming me

31
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,354
for making the wrong decision
in that case.

32
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,564
Didn't you?

33
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,358
Look here, Judge Sim--

34
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,943
They learned

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,863
from your decision

36
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,322
in that courtroom.

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,704
"Oh, the law is a joke."

38
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,667
That's what they learned.

39
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,845
Who are you two back there?

40
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,222
Why are you attending this trial?

41
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,141
We're the victim's parents.

42
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,268
Who told you you could come here?

43
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,063
Why are they in my courtroom?

44
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,983
Article 25, section 2 of the Juvenile Act

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,612
guarantees victims the right to state
their opinion in a protection case.

46
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,449
You've already submitted
a written statement.

47
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,867
VICTIM'S STATEMENT OF OPINION

48
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,868
I have, but--

49
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,329
Yes, I'll take it into account.

50
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,875
Trials for protection cases are
held behind closed doors,

51
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,168
so please leave the courtroom.

52
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,878
What?

53
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,518
Hwang In-jun. Baek Do-hyeon.

54
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,610
They were first-time offenders
and only 11 years old.

55
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,405
They said it was a mistake
and regretted what they had done.

56
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,701
You think other judges
would have been any different?

57
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,703
There was nothing wrong with my decision!

58
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,038
Sure.

59
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,122
You always believe

60
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,042
that you've made the right decision.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,505
It was only three minutes.

62
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,634
The time it took…

63
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,807
for them to stand trial
after taking someone's life.

64
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,979
What do you think they learned from that?

65
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,027
"The law doesn't protect all victims."

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,154
"I see."

67
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,491
"The law is so simple."

68
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,912
"It only takes three minutes…

69
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,041
for a trial to end."

70
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,967
Five years ago…

71
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,555
when they first stood trial,

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,018
you should've taught them

73
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,521
how the brick they threw

74
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,149
just for fun…

75
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,362
destroyed a family…

76
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,491
and ruined their lives.

77
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,997
Neither their families nor their schools

78
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,292
scolded them or made them realize that.

79
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,253
Then at least the court

80
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,089
should've scolded them

81
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,051
and taught them.

82
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,680
Because that is our job.

83
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,811
Good job.

84
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,940
Already? How?

85
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,503
Hey, let's go eat tteokbokki.

86
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,555
That's just how the law is.

87
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,976
You know that.

88
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,199
Juvenile cases are all about speed?

89
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,243
That's why they turned out like that!

90
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,704
Why do you handle cases so hastily?

91
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,499
What about those who can't keep up
and are left behind?

92
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,001
What about the victims?

93
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,463
Who's responsible for them?

94
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,800
That's not being efficient.

95
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,885
It's being irresponsible.

96
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,807
Why…

97
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,102
don't you

98
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,439
have a sense of duty?

99
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,748
I learned a lot from you today.

100
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,002
For such an honorable judge,

101
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,754
you sure like to break the rules
regarding conflict of interest.

102
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,427
Will you be able to speak so eloquently
in front of the disciplinary committee?

103
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,053
I'll be looking forward to it.

104
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,307
And one more thing.

105
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,892
From this point on,

106
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,269
you're taken off
Hwang In-jun's protection case

107
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,563
and the criminal cases
of the Yeonhwa gang rape incident

108
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,399
for Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su.

109
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,030
Not that I needed to tell you that
since you're so smart.

110
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,376
Judge Sim.

111
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,836
PRESIDING JUDGE'S OFFICE

112
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,423
The victim Kang Seon-a
is here with her sister.

113
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,008
What would you like to do?

114
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
Kang Seon-a?

115
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
Hwang In-jun.

116
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,190
I heard he didn't admit
to being an accomplice.

117
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,193
Is that true?

118
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,330
Why me of all people?

119
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,962
I think about that every day.

120
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
"Why me?"

121
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,885
"What did I do wrong?"

122
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,555
"Why only me?"

123
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,892
I was just chatting online.

124
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,021
Hwang In-jun said he was a student
in the chat room.

125
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,818
He gave me advice when I talked
about my problems and my mom.

126
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,697
I was stressed that day
since I fought with a friend.

127
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,367
He suggested
that we meet and talk for a bit.

128
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,912
That's why I went out.

129
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,960
But I shouldn't have.
Because of me, even my dad…

130
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,505
Do you think

131
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,551
Hwang In-jun will just get away with it?

132
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,284
You mentioned Baek Do-hyeon yesterday.

133
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,995
What was that about?

134
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,915
There may be four boys, not three.

135
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
Seo Dong-gyun, O Gyeong-su, Hwang In-jun,

136
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,212
and Baek Do-hyeon.

137
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,468
Cha Tae-ju.

138
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,846
You're no longer in charge of the case.

139
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,223
You'll get into serious trouble.

140
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,228
I know that

141
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,314
I shouldn't be doing this.

142
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,650
But isn't it horrible?

143
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,235
They've become more evil…

144
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,447
than they were five years ago.

145
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,204
I'm not insisting
that I should handle the case.

146
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,040
But if the case gets closed like this,

147
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,751
we may never get the chance

148
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,462
to sentence them properly.

149
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,219
One of the kids I'm in charge of

150
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,722
ran away from home and committed theft.

151
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,937
Hello, this is Cha Tae-ju.

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,356
Judge Cha. This is
the juvenile classification center.

153
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,273
Yes, hello.

154
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,317
This is about Baek Ha-rin,
the girl you sent to us.

155
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,112
We just got the results
from her physical examination.

156
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,073
Well…

157
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,367
We believe she's pregnant.

158
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,868
"Pregnant"?

159
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,498
I'm really worried about you.

160
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,626
Did you tell your father?

161
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,088
Fuck if I know.

162
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,674
What are you going to do now?

163
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,680
The gang rape case
posted on the National Petition.

164
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,099
Who the fuck do you think
is the ring leader?

165
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,934
Don't change the subject.

166
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,146
Fucking hell.
It was them who did this to me.

167
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,816
I got pregnant
when I was in their runaway gang.

168
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,819
Baek Do-hyeon, that bastard.

169
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,156
What? Who?

170
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,450
Baek Do-hyeon.

171
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,871
He belongs to the same runaway gang
as the other three.

172
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,207
They're already notorious among
motel owners for their prostitution scam.

173
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,296
My fucking sister is in Room 302 now.

174
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,674
-Hurry up and open the door.
-Who are you?

175
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,719
She's a fucking minor.

176
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,847
-Should I call the cops?
-For fuck's sake!

177
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,931
Man, where's the key?

178
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,767
-Open it right now!
-Open the fucking door!

179
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,518
-All right. Here.
-Shit.

180
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,063
Who are you? What the hell are you--

181
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,067
What's this?

182
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,653
You fucking bastard!

183
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,491
-You're rich, man!
-That's right.

184
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,581
-Fuck.
-Why are you doing this?

185
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,957
I'm her brother.

186
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,417
What? Her brother?

187
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,422
I'll send this to your bitch

188
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,299
and upload it
to your kid's school website.

189
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,052
No. I'm sorry.

190
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,055
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck.

191
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,724
You crazy bastard.

192
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,895
This fucking bastard has a death wish.
Keep going.

193
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,778
Good job.

194
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,240
Hey, In-jun.

195
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,826
All right.

196
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,661
-Fucking thanks.
-Hey.

197
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,831
-Here.
-What the fuck is this?

198
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,541
Thanks, Do-hyeon.

199
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,210
-You fucking joker.
-What should we get for dinner?

200
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,170
-How about some chicken?
-Hey.

201
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,464
What about me?

202
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,341
I told you to fucking wait.

203
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,510
You and that mouth of yours…

204
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,054
Hey. Didn't you say
you wanted to buy some shoes?

205
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,305
Come here.

206
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,978
They got five to six million won per job.

207
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,771
Sometimes as much as 10 to 20 million won.

208
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,107
They made so much money,

209
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,442
but they never shared it with the girl.

210
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,152
That's why she ran away from them.

211
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,739
The ring leader is Baek Do-hyeon.

212
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,783
No one dares to touch him.

213
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,744
When he goes apeshit and grabs a knife,
he's a total psycho.

214
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,746
He just stabs anyone.

215
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,498
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su…

216
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,083
Those morons.

217
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,545
They're older than him,
but they're just idiots.

218
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,548
Do you think those dumbasses could
do something like that without Do-hyeon?

219
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,466
Fucking hell.

220
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,260
That's fucking hilarious.

221
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,095
No, that can't be true.

222
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,724
Only three of them were
in the dashcam footage.

223
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,559
Baek Do-hyeon wasn't there.

224
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,187
Yes, I know. But that's what she said.

225
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,194
Whichever is true,

226
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,156
this case will be taken care of somehow,
even without you.

227
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,911
So please stop stressing over it.

228
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,164
What if you get sent
to the disciplinary committee?

229
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,540
Is that what scares you?

230
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,378
I'm more scared of how they'll turn out
once they become adults.

231
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,510
"Whichever is true,

232
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,347
this case will be taken care of somehow."

233
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,935
That's why they turned out like that.

234
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,730
Because of judges like us.

235
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,241
They're really notorious.

236
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,577
Every motel owner in the area
knows about them.

237
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,247
They won't talk since they're afraid
they might lose customers,

238
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,458
but I'll text you an address now.

239
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,210
It's where the latest victim stayed.

240
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,215
I think

241
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,510
about four or five of them barged in.

242
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,430
They threatened
to put my motel in trouble.

243
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,724
-Here they are.
-What the fuck! Come out!

244
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,185
-Come out!
-My sister is here. My sister.

245
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,269
-My sister.
-Listen, lady.

246
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,855
-Nothing like that is going on here.
-Fuck, my sister is…

247
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,484
Hey, open up.

248
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,487
An old man and a young girl came, right?
She's my sister. Give it now.

249
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,155
-Do as we say.
-Room 301.

250
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,491
Open the fucking door right now!

251
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,201
This is Sim Eun-seok, Mr. Seo.

252
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,705
Can you send me a list of the runaways
our court is in charge of?

253
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,747
Yes, girls.

254
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,291
Cases from the past six months.
As soon as possible.

255
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,460
I don't know Hwang In-jun,

256
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,753
but I've heard of

257
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,506
Baek Do-hyeon.

258
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,385
But I've heard terrible rumors
about his gang,

259
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,303
so I've never met him.

260
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,892
Well, I've heard
that he exploits the girls he's with.

261
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,603
Can you tell me about it in detail?

262
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,313
Why should I?

263
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,692
I don't want to know,
and know nothing anyway.

264
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,277
I'm not about that life now.

265
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,695
Really?

266
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,078
Why don't we see
whether you really turned over a new leaf

267
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,123
at court?

268
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,171
VIOLATION: DID NOT ANSWER CALL IN DUE TIME

269
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,385
I don't know Baek Do-hyeon,
but I know his girlfriend.

270
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
We once shared a room at a facility.

271
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,683
Well, I don't know
if she's still dating him.

272
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,268
Shit.

273
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,562
That fucking son of a bitch.

274
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,359
Ask away.

275
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,362
I'll tell you everything I know.

276
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:02,039
WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE REDEVELOPMENT

277
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,625
There's this really old place.

278
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,086
The second floor
of Daeho Inn at Baeksa-dong.

279
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,643
Baek Do-hyeon is
a total pervert and a piece of trash.

280
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
You know about
his prostitution scam, right?.

281
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,856
But that's not all.

282
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
Those bastards

283
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,656
rape girls and make a profit off that.

284
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,908
Hey, look here. Look at this.

285
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,453
Gosh, this is so funny.
This dude is crazy.

286
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,794
They would rape girls and film it.

287
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,047
Then use the videos to blackmail them

288
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,799
to work for prostitution scams
or brothels.

289
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,592
Look at these horny bastards.

290
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,679
And they sell those fucking videos.

291
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,597
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

292
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,141
All right. Bye.

293
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,012
Who the hell are you?

294
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,019
Are you a cop?

295
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,028
It's no use.

296
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,865
There's nothing on that computer.

297
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,126
Baek Do-hyeon?

298
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,678
You fucking bitch!

299
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,055
Fuck!

300
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,518
You fucking bitch!

301
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,479
You fucking bastard!

302
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,772
Get up, bitch.

303
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,489
Do you know how much
that fucking thing costs?

304
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,202
This is fun.

305
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,829
Hey, bitch. Get up.

306
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,087
Even if the others lived like this,
you shouldn't have.

307
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,216
You should've lived right
when you were given a chance.

308
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,844
At least one of you two should have!

309
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,346
Why…

310
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,850
Why is this the best you can do?

311
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,184
Why?

312
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,229
"Why?"

313
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,692
What the hell are you saying, bitch?

314
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,031
There's something I'm dying to know.

315
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,115
Just who the fuck

316
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,117
are you?

317
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,787
Answer.

318
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,293
Answer me, you fucking bitch!

319
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,060
Damn it…

320
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,980
Fuck!

321
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,570
Shit!

322
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,993
PHOTO EVIDENCE 1

323
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,631
It's you.

324
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,716
Shit.

325
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,095
The Yeonhwa Gang Rape Case.

326
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,640
You,

327
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,393
Baek Do-hyeon…

328
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,231
were there at the scene too.

329
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,444
Fuck.

330
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,824
Fuck!

331
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,159
This bitch is ridiculous.

332
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,661
She keeps babbling on.

333
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,247
You're right.

334
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,459
I was there.

335
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,838
So what?

336
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,052
You fucking bitch. Get up.

337
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,472
Die. Die!

338
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:57,853
Die! It's okay to die, you fucking bitch!

339
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,316
Die, you fucking bitch! Die!

340
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,611
Die!

341
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,993
Fuck!

342
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,036
You fucking bitch!

343
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,831
Fuck!

344
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,403
Judge Sim!

345
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,073
What happened? Can you walk?

346
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,160
Wait. This way.

347
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,541
I only gave you first aid,
so go to a hospital now.

348
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,126
Who's in charge of

349
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,129
Hwang In-jun's case?

350
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,134
There's something I have to tell you
regarding the case.

351
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,428
I'll be handling it.

352
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,097
And I'll deal with it
according to the law.

353
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,476
Leave if you're going to talk about that.
I don't want to hear it.

354
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,395
There's more to it than gang rape, Ms. Na.

355
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,856
That's only a part of it.

356
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,359
They threatened the victims--

357
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,401
This is not…

358
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,947
We aren't investigators.

359
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,532
Judges have the duty

360
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,161
to find out the truth behind a case
according to proper procedures.

361
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,789
So this isn't revenge?

362
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,086
If you keep mixing
your personal feelings with this case,

363
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,922
I'll no longer sit back and watch.

364
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,007
If this really was personal,

365
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,803
I would have sent Hwang In-jun

366
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,682
to the Prosecutors' Office
in the first trial.

367
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,353
This case

368
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,481
is only the tip of the iceberg.

369
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,485
They blackmailed the victims

370
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,571
and used the victims to…

371
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,072
Get out now.

372
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,324
Hurry to a hospital before I call 911.

373
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,576
Ms. Na.

374
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,872
This is the most I can do for you.

375
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,807
If you keep mixing your personal feelings
with this case,

376
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,268
I'll no longer sit back and watch.

377
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,062
Please stop, Judge Sim.

378
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,148
You're no longer in charge of the case.

379
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,900
You'll get into serious trouble.

380
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,153
That's just how the law is.

381
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,530
You know that.

382
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,834
You're right. I was there.

383
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,004
So what?

384
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,840
JUDICIAL CULTURE AWARD
PROSECUTOR NA GEUN-HEE

385
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,758
ACHIEVEMENT PLAQUE

386
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,552
APPRECIATION PLAQUE
JUDGE NA GEUN-HEE

387
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,658
The trial will begin soon.

388
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,619
Are you really not going to attend?

389
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,665
No.

390
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,292
You go ahead.

391
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,687
Case number 2022P3409.

392
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,691
The court has accepted
the motion to recuse.

393
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,485
So the judge in charge has changed.

394
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,614
If you want to raise objections
or have something to say

395
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,951
about the documents you submitted
in the previous trial, do so now.

396
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,369
We have none.

397
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,538
Then the trial will begin.

398
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,459
Dashcam footage was presented

399
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,755
to suggest the possibility
of Hwang In-jun's involvement.

400
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,298
But this is not true.

401
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:27,015
He used to be an ordinary student.
Who was diligent and polite.

402
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,894
But Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su,
who he first met at a facility,

403
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,189
blackmailed and coerced him
into taking part in their crimes.

404
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,026
The master-servant relationship
between them tormented him a great deal.

405
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,531
As a result, he gave false testimony
during the police interrogation

406
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,201
because he was scared.

407
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,037
Because of their threats,

408
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,164
he had no choice
but to take the victim, Kang Seon-a,

409
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,290
to the construction site.

410
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,083
That was all.

411
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,548
Hwang In-jun's DNA wasn't found
on the victim's body.

412
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,135
The allegation that he's an accomplice
simply does not stand to reason.

413
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,723
This case is only the tip of the iceberg.

414
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,893
They blackmailed the victims

415
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,103
and used the victims to…

416
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,149
Okay, I got it.

417
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,154
The reference witness
is here today, right?

418
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,617
I'd like to hear what reference witness,
Baek Do-hyeon, has to say.

419
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:30,829
Baek Do-hyeon.

420
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,714
You know I'm here to defend you, right?

421
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,924
Get out soon.

422
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,927
I'll put you in deep shit, you punk.

423
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,474
Hello.

424
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,438
I heard that you've been friends
with Hwang In-jun since childhood.

425
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,483
Yes, we were classmates
in elementary school.

426
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,443
We've been friends ever since.

427
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,698
Then were you aware
that Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su

428
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,994
had threatened and assaulted him
for quite some time?

429
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes. In-jun had a rough time
because of that.

430
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,092
-Do you have evidence of this?
-Yes.

431
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,345
We have photos
that we submitted in the previous trial.

432
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,057
These photos were shot after
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su assaulted--

433
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,142
No.

434
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,979
Not just photos. Evidence of intimidation
like text messages

435
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,939
or recorded phone conversations.

436
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,482
Well…

437
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,569
The reason I'm asking this question
is very simple.

438
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,155
Your testimony is not consistent

439
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,116
with that of Seo Dong-gyun and
O Gyeong-su, who are currently detained.

440
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:51,910
Sorry?

441
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,122
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su claimed

442
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,416
that there were
four main culprits in this case.

443
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:03,463
That includes
the reference witness, Baek Do-hyeon.

444
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,017
Hwang In-jun's trial is set for next week.

445
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,688
And I've been ordered
to talk to you two before the trial.

446
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,316
Of course, whatever you say here

447
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,153
won't affect your criminal trial.

448
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,114
We just want to hear your opinions.

449
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,991
But…

450
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:37,956
this will be your last chance
to talk about Hwang In-jun's case.

451
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,044
Is Hwang In-jun really not an accomplice?

452
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,047
Did you threaten him?

453
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,177
If you have nothing to say,
you can say so.

454
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,098
Yes, we have nothing to say.

455
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,182
Very well.

456
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,937
Then it can't be helped.

457
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,627
You can choose to remain silent.

458
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:30,008
But if you give false testimony,

459
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,927
it may work against you.

460
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,222
I'll say it once again.

461
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,892
This will be your last chance
to make a statement about it.

462
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,603
Sign here.

463
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,669
Judge Sim. Are you okay?

464
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,879
Yes, I am.

465
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,505
We should've come faster.

466
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,423
No.

467
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,092
You came right on time.

468
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,094
My doubts have been cleared.

469
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,973
Please investigate the evidence here.

470
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,683
Please be discreet.

471
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,478
Okay. Before that,
you need to get to a hospital.

472
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,362
Actually, it wasn't three people.

473
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,615
It was four.

474
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,658
Just fucking tell him.

475
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:43,206
Me, him, Hwang In-jun, and Baek Do-hyeon
were in it together.

476
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,917
We fucked girls like Kang Seon-a
and filmed it.

477
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,878
Using that, we blackmailed them
and prostituted them out.

478
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,131
-And did prostitution scams too.
-We sold the videos too.

479
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,300
A lot of people like that kind of stuff.

480
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,303
But we really didn't know Kang Seon-a
went to a hospital to get checked.

481
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,347
Kang Seon-a, that bitch.

482
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,558
Jeez, girls usually keep quiet.

483
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,519
-Don't they usually?
-Yes.

484
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,564
But Baek Do-hyeon made us do it.

485
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,067
If we don't listen to him, he stabs us.

486
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,735
He got stabbed.

487
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,655
When I first met him,
I thought he was jack shit.

488
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,741
But he stabbed me here
and laughed like crazy.

489
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,577
I'm even older than him,
that son of a bitch.

490
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,329
He's a lunatic.

491
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,540
What are they saying?

492
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,458
Those fucking bastards.

493
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,604
Wait.

494
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,273
You fucking bitch!

495
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,860
Even if the others lived like this,

496
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,028
you shouldn't have.

497
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,658
You should've lived right
when you were given a chance.

498
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,039
They learned.

499
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,294
"The law doesn't protect all victims."

500
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,464
"The law is so simple."

501
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,175
"It only takes three minutes…

502
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,512
for a trial to end."

503
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,518
Why do you handle cases so hastily?

504
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,271
What about those who can't keep up
and are left behind?

505
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,772
What about the victims?

506
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,691
Who's responsible for them?

507
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,863
We haven't found all the victims yet.

508
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,073
So I suggest you report
Baek Do-hyeon in court

509
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,825
when Hwang In-jun's trial is over.

510
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,494
And there was a computer at his hideout.

511
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,164
It's likely that he used it
to distribute the videos he took,

512
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,708
but it was empty.

513
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,962
Based on the victims' statements,
he must have a secret phone.

514
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,548
But we haven't found it yet either.

515
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,091
A secret phone?

516
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,928
Yes. I'm sure it has the evidence
proving that he's an accomplice.

517
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,263
Objection, Your Honor.

518
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,641
These are just statements
of Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su.

519
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,226
There's no direct evidence

520
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,561
to prove Hwang In-jun and Baek Do-hyeon
were accomplices.

521
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,314
The evidence
that we're about to show you now

522
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,858
is from Baek Do-hyeon's secret phone

523
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,653
that Hwang In-jun brought
to the crime scene.

524
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:26,327
THREESOME GIRL
YEONHWA SEX CLUB

525
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,787
BITCHES WITH HUGE TITS

526
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,297
Seon-a. Please pat me on the head.

527
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,926
Hey, show that bitch's face to the camera.

528
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,886
-Fucking bitch.
-Smile.

529
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,179
One, two, three.

530
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,108
I don't believe it. How I…

531
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,695
I clearly… Fuck.

532
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,572
I told you not to touch that bitch.

533
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,075
I told you not to do anything
unless they're a runaway.

534
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,327
Stop making a fuss, moron.

535
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,955
I deleted all the files on the computer.

536
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,290
I got rid of it all.

537
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,209
Bullshit. Give me another 20 million won.

538
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,342
Well, who's a big boy now?

539
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,386
Jeez, you punk.

540
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,972
I said I'll defend you, you moron.

541
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,640
If you fuck it up…

542
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,936
If anything goes wrong,
I'll tell them about you, you bastard.

543
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,193
Hey.

544
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,155
You fucking bastard!

545
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,117
You fucking crazy bastard!

546
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,120
Fuck. You fucking moron!

547
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,585
Fuck!

548
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,836
Fuck them all to hell!

549
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,219
Are you happy now?

550
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,597
I said I'll save you.

551
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,725
You damn coward.

552
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,727
Baek Do-hyeon's dad called us.

553
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,690
We're the ones
being interrogated by the police.

554
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,318
They even had our DNA, so we're done for.

555
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,195
He told us to keep quiet about Do-hyeon.

556
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,405
Then he'd hire us
an attorney to defend us.

557
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,867
He even said he'd pay us
50 million won each after we did our time.

558
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,580
Those fucking bastards!

559
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,749
Be quiet.

560
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,959
Your Honor.
Baek Do-hyeon put me up to all this.

561
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,753
Shut up, you cunt.

562
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,630
I had no choice
because I was scared of him.

563
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,548
-Be quiet.
-You said she looked fucking tasty.

564
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,425
You said she'd be worth
quite a bit of money!

565
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,052
But you took all the money in the end!

566
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,054
That's why those bastards
are snitching, got it?

567
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,222
-Be quiet!
-You bastard.

568
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,016
Did you think we were friends
because we were nice to you?

569
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,727
You bastard! You fucking bastard!

570
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,938
Stop it! Stop!

571
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,106
Do I look like a pushover?

572
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,401
-Go fuck yourself, you punk!
-Execute that jerk! Fuck!

573
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,736
I'd like to see you try. Go fuck yourself!

574
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,363
-Fuck you!
-I said, stop! Baek Do-hyeon!

575
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,365
-Judge. That bastard is the same.
-I'll kill you!

576
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,699
He kept egging me on.

577
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,370
-Come over here, you son of a bitch!
-You love having sex, you moron!

578
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,372
-You shoe-fetish pervert!
-Be quiet, both of you!

579
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,541
-Hey, you bastard! Let go of me!
-I said, stop!

580
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,751
I need to kill that bastard!

581
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,836
Stop!

582
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,170
Let go of me!

583
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,048
-Are you fucking crazy?
-I said, stop!

584
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,843
Do-hyeon probably still has no idea.

585
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,595
There's a secret phone
he always carries with him. Right?

586
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,513
Yes.

587
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,099
I secretly linked that phone to my cloud.

588
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,100
For insurance.

589
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,103
Cloud? You mean an online storage drive?

590
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,399
Baek Do-hyeon, that bastard.
That fucking snob really pissed me off.

591
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,151
Fuck him. I don't care about him.

592
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,572
That jerk Baek Do-hyeon
is actually from a wealthy family.

593
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,699
He left home because of his stepmother.

594
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,910
We wouldn't have listened to him
if he hadn't given us money.

595
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,621
My stupid dad always beats up people
when he's drunk.

596
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,206
My mom left home because of that.

597
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,877
This guy's uncle is the same.

598
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,297
If we had good parents,
we wouldn't be living like this.

599
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,215
Don't you think so?

600
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,595
People put all the fucking blame on us.

601
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,973
But to be honest,
I don't think we did anything wrong.

602
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,684
What?

603
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,854
To be honest, aren't the johns to blame
for the underage prostitution?

604
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,315
If they didn't want it in the first place,

605
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,692
then we wouldn't have done it either.
Am I wrong?

606
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,110
Then what about the victims?

607
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,532
Why should Kang Seon-a suffer?

608
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,127
This proves
that Baek Do-hyeon and Hwang In-jun

609
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,087
were also at the crime scene

610
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,174
and that they conspired
with Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su

611
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,843
to commit rape and other crimes.

612
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,640
Well…

613
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,226
The victim must have watched all this

614
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,395
from the court interrogation room.

615
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,484
It must be hard for you,

616
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,321
but I'm sure you don't want
to leave this court with any regrets.

617
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,033
If you have any last words,
please go ahead and say them.

618
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,268
You know that I slit my wrist, right?

619
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,353
My sister thought

620
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:49,024
I did it because the school
asked me to drop out.

621
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,026
But that wasn't it.

622
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,907
I have this best friend.

623
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,036
I texted her and called her

624
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,999
because I couldn't get a hold of her.

625
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,211
And after a long while,
she texted me back.

626
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,425
I thought she had been busy.

627
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,885
I checked the text…

628
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,058
and it said her mom told her
not to hang out with me.

629
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,605
I'm the victim.

630
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,191
But why am I the one getting ostracized?

631
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,946
When can I go back to my old life?

632
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,075
Can I even go back?

633
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:52,338
There's one absolute truth
I realized while working at the court.

634
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,383
Anyone can be a victim.

635
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,057
It's such a given, but no one realizes it.

636
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:09,855
Kang Seon-a.

637
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,694
If you go to court over this case,

638
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,156
keep this one thing in mind.

639
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,872
It's not your fault.

640
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,209
Raise your head.

641
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,296
Be confident.

642
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,014
Please…

643
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,394
turn my life back to the way it was.

644
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:26,432
The four boys conspired together
to sexually assault the victim.

645
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,685
Thus they are co-perpetrators.

646
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,273
Therefore,
this protection case is now closed.

647
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,236
This case will be sent back
to the Prosecutors' Office.

648
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,489
And if the prosecution files charges,

649
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,785
a criminal case could be opened
against you.

650
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,835
Your Honor. What does that mean?

651
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,255
Come on, you should tell me.

652
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,980
URGENT TRANSPORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

653
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,277
Larceny, battery,

654
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,991
soliciting prostitution,
prostitution scam…

655
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,119
and sexual assault.

656
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,043
How did those children end up this way?

657
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,962
They say it takes

658
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,174
an entire village to raise a child.

659
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,302
In other words,

660
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,638
a child's life could be ruined

661
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,682
if the entire village neglects the child.

662
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,396
Do you think those kids…

663
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,359
are the only perpetrators

664
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,070
who made Kang Seon-a a victim?

665
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,950
No one has the right to criticize them.

666
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,661
Everyone is a perpetrator.

667
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,349
I feel relieved though
now that everything has been revealed.

668
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:38,021
The victim and her guardian
can finally sleep comfortably

669
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,731
since it's all over.

670
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,151
Who said it's over?

671
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,572
I mean, at the trial--

672
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,074
There's no end for rape victims.

673
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,618
It doesn't matter how much time passes.

674
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,621
They're scarred for life.

675
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,583
That's why it's so cruel for them.

676
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,378
There's one rule

677
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,841
that I follow as a judge.

678
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,345
That is

679
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,932
to set aside my personal feelings
in the courtroom.

680
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,312
I thought that was the only way

681
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,273
to make fair judgments.

682
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,573
But I've realized

683
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,619
that I shouldn't have done that

684
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,875
at least in juvenile court.

685
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,421
For that reason,

686
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:32,219
I'd like to say a word

687
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,724
to all those who I may have hurt.

688
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,527
I apologize

689
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,863
as an adult.

690
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,621
-Ms. Joo.
-Yes?

691
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,667
The disciplinary committee
for Judge Sim is today, right?

692
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,503
Yes.

693
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,547
I hope she won't be punished severely.

694
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,633
I hope so too.

695
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,807
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

696
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,107
What brings you here, Ms. Na?

697
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,652
Judge Cha told me

698
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:17,032
what's been happening at the courthouse.

699
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,451
And?

700
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,372
Well, at the disciplinary hearing…

701
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,752
defend…

702
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,547
my junior colleague.

703
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,884
Why should I?

704
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,013
A junior in the field is just trying
to do her job as best as she can.

705
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,851
You shouldn't block her path.

706
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,653
Don't you agree,

707
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,031
Geun-hee?

708
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,810
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

709
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,911
Put it there.
I told you to get back to work.

710
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,872
But I'm worried.

711
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,124
There's nothing to worry about.

712
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,798
COURT

713
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,472
So this is what it feels like

714
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,974
to be standing down here.

715
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:56,566
The bench has been lowered a lot
to make judges look less authoritative.

716
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,153
But from here,
it still looks overwhelming.

717
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,239
Do you think the kids know

718
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,284
that the judges who sit up there
carry a heavy responsibility?

719
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,788
Of course not. They shouldn't.

720
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,000
It's meant to be lonely up there.

721
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:17,045
COURT

722
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,436
I'm sorry, Judge Sim.

723
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:42,487
I just wanted to tell you this.

724
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,785
The Elementary School Student
Brick Manslaughter Case,

725
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,288
Presiding Judge Na Geun-hee,

726
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,083
Hwang In-jun, and Baek Do-hyeon…

727
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,503
When I learned the details of the case,

728
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,924
I was actually very disappointed in you.

729
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,139
What happened to Mr. Kang
was already distressful, and you…

730
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,685
I was very disappointed

731
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,771
and angry.

732
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,485
But after some time had passed…

733
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,115
I could finally understand.

734
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,122
All the sentencing you gave out

735
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,501
and all the things you said…

736
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,296
Because they're criminals.

737
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,424
They dared to commit a crime…

738
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,511
at such a young age.

739
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,180
This is why

740
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,807
I despise the likes of you.

741
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,145
Because you

742
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,314
never change.

743
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,442
If you make false statements again
during the next trial

744
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:07,530
or if circumstances reveal that he was
an accomplice in the sexual assault,

745
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,741
this case…

746
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,703
could be sent to the prosecution.

747
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,709
You weren't swayed by your emotions.

748
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,757
You just acted on your conviction.

749
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:54,285
NAMGUNG CHAN

750
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,422
NAMGUNG CHAN

751
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,132
I LOVE YOU, MOM

752
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,649
DECEASED, NAMGUNG CHAN
DIED MAY 8, 2017

753
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,028
Chan.

754
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,867
Mommy's here.

755
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,691
Goodbye…

756
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,737
my son.

757
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,007
JUVENILE CRIMES HAVE RISEN
BY 31.9% IN 2001 COMPARED TO 1992

758
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,304
Judge Sim Eun-seok.

759
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,932
If you have any final words,
go ahead and say them.

760
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,644
I admit to all my wrongdoings.

761
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,650
I have damaged the judiciary's
impartiality, independence,

762
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,653
and honor.

763
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,366
I will gladly accept any punishment.

764
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,785
Not about your remorse.

765
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:31,372
Your attitude and thoughts as a judge.

766
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,629
Being at the Supreme Court…

767
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,761
reminded me of
when I was first appointed as a judge.

768
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,891
The way I treat young offenders

769
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,518
has to change for sure.

770
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,438
But…

771
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,902
I won't say all the sentences
I imposed on them were wrong.

772
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:07,742
As a judge, I'll be impartial

773
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,621
and won't disgrace myself again.

774
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:19,420
I detest young offenders.

775
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,676
Some may criticize
my attitude towards them,

776
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,139
and some may be hurt by it.

777
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,476
"Detest."

778
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,063
It means

779
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:42,527
to hate or despise.

780
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,781
Though I hate and despise young offenders,

781
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,617
I'll do my best

782
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,578
when I deal with them.

783
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,332
Though I hate and despise young offenders,

784
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,044
I'll stay coolheaded
when I impose sentences.

785
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,298
Though I hate and despise young offenders,

786
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:09,679
I won't look down on them with prejudice.

787
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,850
In other words,

788
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,187
I will remain the same
as I always had been…

789
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,566
but also

790
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,863
be different from then.

791
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,203
COURT

792
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,869
In a different way from then…

793
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,331
I…

794
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,750
detest…

795
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,753
young offenders.

796
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,792
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

797
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,838
