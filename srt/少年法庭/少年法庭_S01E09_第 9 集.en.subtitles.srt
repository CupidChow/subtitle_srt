1
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,884
Ma'am, are you awake?
This is the emergency room.

2
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,512
One moment, please.
I'll call your guardian and your doctor.

3
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,567
Yes, Ms. Na. They're done running tests,

4
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,904
and we're just waiting for the results.

5
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,073
About that…

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,493
I looked into it too.

7
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,707
There was no information on her family.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,084
NAME: SIM EUN-SEOK

9
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,169
There's no emergency contact and…

10
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,256
she's never really
talked about her family.

11
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,801
-Ms. Sim Eun-seok's guardian?
-Yes.

12
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,427
She just woke up.

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,515
I'll call you right back. Okay.

14
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,394
How did you endure it all this time?

15
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,021
It could have been far worse.

16
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,566
-Are you her guardian?
-Yes, I am.

17
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:53,113
Have you ever heard of burnout syndrome?
She burned out due to exhaustion.

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:58,076
She's suffering from malnutrition,
sleep deprivation, and high stress levels.

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,329
She pushed herself
to the point of collapsing.

20
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,124
Looking at these results,
I can't discharge her today.

21
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,085
I'd like to keep her in the hospital
for a few days for observation.

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,593
What happened?

23
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,888
I should be the one asking you that.

24
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,932
What happened?

25
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:25,562
You just passed out
and gave everyone quite a scare.

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,188
I did?

27
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,446
YEONHWA POLICE STATION
HWANG IN-JUN

28
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,497
I see. You must've been shocked.

29
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,003
Judge Cha, could you please
call the nurse for me?

30
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,797
Judge Sim.

31
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,924
Judge Sim!

32
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,803
Didn't you hear the doctor?
You can't go home.

33
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,180
You're going to get sick.

34
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,556
I know my own body.

35
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,100
I'll be fine.

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,268
But…

37
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,940
See? You need to get some rest.

38
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,192
Please…

39
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,573
I'll rest at the judges' quarters.

40
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,230
You should get going.
Thanks for everything.

41
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,732
You need to take your meds.

42
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,983
Wait here.

43
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,194
I'll go get some water.

44
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,182
Check your front door.

45
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,457
Hello, Judge Cha.

46
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,750
Hello.

47
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,837
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

48
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,936
Judge Sim, you need to rest.

49
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,856
Are you feeling better?

50
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,442
Yes.

51
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,821
There's something I needed to check.

52
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,576
YEONHWA GANG RAPE CASE

53
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
VICTIM, AGE 16, KANG SEON-A

54
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,580
MISSING PERSON
NAME: KANG SEON-A

55
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,583
We'll go on patrol right after
a few questions, so don't worry.

56
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,503
What was your daughter last wearing?

57
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,091
-It's done, let's go!
-I haven't taken a photo in so long.

58
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,346
Seon-a.

59
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,348
I'm a truck driver.

60
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:18,354
I normally drive freight trucks
to the countryside,

61
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,941
so I leave the house for days at a time.

62
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,569
Since I'm a single parent, I…

63
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,945
Where did she go?

64
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,075
When was the last time you talked to her?

65
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,286
What?

66
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,501
Do you know where she hangs out
or who she's friends with?

67
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,173
You're sure she showed up
to school today, right?

68
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,342
Yes, I reported it to the police.

69
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,638
Is there anyone we can call?

70
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,892
That is…

71
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,979
Well, I…

72
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,487
MISSING PERSON
NAME: KANG SEON-A, AGE 16

73
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,738
What do I do?

74
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,500
Gosh, this again? I told them not to.

75
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,568
What? Damn it.

76
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,321
Damn it.

77
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
Hello? I need an ambulance.

78
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,952
There's someone passed out here.

79
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,790
The defendants are both minors
aged 16 and 17.

80
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,544
They met the victim online
and forced her to drink with them.

81
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,756
It's a textbook example of gang rape.

82
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,591
But…

83
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,011
the last time you gave us
your statement, you said

84
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,139
there were three people. Hwang In-jun,
Seo Dong-gyun, and O Gyeong-su.

85
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,100
Now you're saying there's one more?

86
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,770
Well, back then…

87
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:27,525
She was just confused
because they forced her to drink!

88
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,653
She's sure that there was
one more person there.

89
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,488
Seon-a.

90
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,491
Try to think carefully.

91
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,911
If your statement isn't consistent,
it could work against you.

92
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,586
The victim, Kang Seon-a,
was intoxicated that day,

93
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,338
so she has no memory of the assault.

94
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,301
And there were no security cameras
near the construction site,

95
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,386
so we don't have any hard evidence.

96
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,097
In the end, the prosecution only indicted

97
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,058
Seo Dong-gyun, O Gyeong-su,
and Hwang In-jun.

98
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,354
Fortunately, the victim was taken
to the hospital right after the assault

99
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,692
and received a full checkup,
so they were able to get evidence.

100
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,113
DNA of Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su,
who were drinking with her, was found.

101
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,781
Thanks to that, we got their confessions.

102
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,994
The problem is Hwang In-jun,
who was there at the scene.

103
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,666
I didn't know they were going to rape her.

104
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,586
I only found out
after we were done drinking.

105
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,256
And I didn't even enter
the construction site.

106
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,468
That's right. I even tried to stop them.

107
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,638
I swear I did.

108
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,098
The forensic results
and the DNA analysis gave weight

109
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,602
to Hwang In-jun's claim
that he didn't take part in the assault.

110
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,854
So his case was transferred here
as a protection case.

111
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,108
His only charges are illegally purchasing
alcohol and forcing the victim to drink,

112
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,486
for violating the Resident
Registration Act and coercion…

113
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,658
The victim's father
reported this case early on,

114
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,035
but the police delayed the investigation.

115
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,331
As far as I know, it was only
after he made a national petition

116
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,792
that the Yeonhwa Police Station
began investigating the case.

117
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,793
That's right.

118
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
I saw this case was
assigned to you, Judge Sim.

119
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,092
Will you be okay?
You just got back from the hospital.

120
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,178
Yes, it's fine.

121
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,098
Judge Cha is in charge
of Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su's case.

122
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,266
-Make sure to look over it thoroughly.
-Yes, ma'am.

123
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,043
Wait, I…

124
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,505
I was just worried.
You didn't seem well back there.

125
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,424
Just come out with it.

126
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,092
No need to walk on eggshells.

127
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,137
You probably won't like my question.

128
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,683
Do you have any family?

129
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,898
Well…

130
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,610
I was a bit perplexed at the hospital.

131
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,362
I looked at your records,

132
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,408
but your family
or emergency contacts were all blank.

133
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,453
And when I thought about it,

134
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,082
I realized I knew nothing about you.

135
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,712
I don't have any family.

136
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,840
I abandoned them.

137
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,269
Yes, this is Cha Tae-ju.

138
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,981
Yes, Judge Lee.

139
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,823
COUNSELING REPORT
HWANG IN-JUN, MALE

140
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,409
FATHER: HWANG U-JIN, 45
MOTHER: YANG MYEONG-IN, 40

141
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,412
NOT IN CONTACT WITH PARENTS
SINCE THEIR DIVORCE AT THE AGE OF 10

142
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,586
SIX PRIOR PROTECTION CASES
SHOWS NO REMORSE

143
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,759
THE VICTIM, KANG SEON-A, WAS ASSAULTED
PHYSICALLY AND SEXUALLY

144
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,306
VICTIM, AGE 16, KANG SEON-A

145
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,143
Judge Sim Eun-seok?

146
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,436
I know her well.

147
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,939
You do?

148
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,483
We shared an office for a year or so.

149
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,528
She was very talented.

150
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,156
She took a leave of absence
not long after I transferred to Uijeongbu.

151
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,784
That was five years ago.

152
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,542
We weren't working at the same court,
so I'm not sure,

153
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,502
but I heard there was
some kind of an incident.

154
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,129
She ended up
divorcing her husband because of that.

155
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,381
A divorce?

156
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,093
Yes, I heard he's a prosecutor.

157
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,056
I don't have any family.

158
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,225
I abandoned them.

159
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,876
How's the victim
of the Yeonhwa Gang Rape case doing?

160
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,919
The victim Kang Seon-a

161
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,048
has been receiving treatment
at an orthopedics clinic and an OBGYN.

162
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,970
She's also been receiving therapy
for psychological trauma.

163
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,598
And?

164
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,392
Yes, and well…

165
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,187
We have a self-harm patient.

166
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,482
The information about the victim
had been released online.

167
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,611
She was suffering
due to social media posts and texts…

168
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,280
I heard the school pressured
the victim to drop out.

169
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,573
Eventually she…

170
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,160
Thankfully, her surgery was successful.

171
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,414
VICTIM, AGE 16, KANG SEON-A

172
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,832
Hwang In-jun…

173
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,878
Let's hurry and set up a date.

174
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,673
Contact his legal guardian too.

175
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,639
I would like to let you know

176
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,893
that we will give this case
our utmost attention and make it quick

177
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,355
since it has been gathering
a lot of attention from the public.

178
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,982
We will now begin the trial.

179
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,235
Prosecutors, please submit your evidence.

180
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,153
Yes, Your Honor.

181
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,953
Has the defense checked the evidence?

182
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,454
We have, Your Honor.

183
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,125
Please share your opinion on the evidence.

184
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,340
Yes?

185
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,803
Ms. Na is looking for both of you.

186
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,391
Have a seat.

187
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,398
After looking at the evidence list
and the testimonies,

188
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,525
I have a lot on my mind.

189
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,488
Since this case is a serious issue,

190
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,491
I thought it'd be better
if Judge Sim was the main judge

191
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,951
since she has more experience.

192
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,077
What do you think?

193
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,539
-Well--
-I don't mind.

194
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,041
Just tell me if you're not feeling well.

195
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,793
I'm not inflexible here.

196
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,877
No, it's all right.

197
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:49,508
Then you can hand over
the protection case to Judge Cha.

198
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,639
-What?
-It'll be too much for you to handle both.

199
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,182
No, I can do both.

200
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,810
I'll take the protection case too.

201
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,603
It'll be too much.

202
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,938
Yes?

203
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,275
Ms. Na, it's time
for your committee schedule.

204
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,735
Is it time already?

205
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,780
Judge Cha will handle Hwang In-jun's case.
I made myself clear.

206
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,949
Wait, Ms. Na!

207
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,000
There's no need for you
to handle the protection case.

208
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,710
I'll take care of it.

209
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,171
I'll convince Ms. Na.

210
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,341
Ms. Na isn't wrong.
If you overwork yourself--

211
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,801
I said I'll do it!

212
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,018
I'll do it.

213
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,230
Is there a reason you're so adamant?

214
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,319
I don't mind if you take this case,

215
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,863
but you seem quite sensitive over it.

216
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,073
Not at all.

217
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,784
A case is a case.

218
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,008
YEONHWA POLICE STATION
NAME: HWANG IN-JUN

219
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,930
MAY 29, 2017, MANSLAUGHTER

220
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,108
MANSLAUGHTER
DISPOSITION

221
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,738
DROPPED A BRICK FROM THE ROOFTOP
WHILE WORKING ON A SCIENCE PROJECT

222
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,495
He killed someone?

223
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:07,062
THE VICTIM SUFFERED A BLOW TO THE SKULL
KILLING HIM INSTANTLY

224
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,778
The judge in charge…

225
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:19,324
JUDGE NA GEUN-HEE

226
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,204
Are you getting off work now?

227
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,959
It's pretty late.
I wanted to take some files with me.

228
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,712
Can you…

229
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,883
give me five minutes of your time?

230
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,138
Juvenile cases are all about speed.

231
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,640
Is this

232
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,143
what you still think?

233
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,313
I think juvenile cases
are all about speed.

234
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,149
Do you know how many unsolved cases
there are in our department alone?

235
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,613
Then please let me handle

236
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,532
Hwang In-jun's case.

237
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,618
I was very clear--

238
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,079
I'll close the case
and send it back to the prosecution.

239
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,665
Send it back?

240
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,919
The main reason why the prosecution
didn't indict Hwang In-jun

241
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,130
is because they weren't able to find
his DNA on the victim's body.

242
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,800
But there was also the fact that
the victim couldn't recall the event,

243
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,348
and that there wasn't any evidence
that the assault was planned beforehand.

244
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,060
But now we have that evidence.

245
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,441
The protection case
will be due in a few days.

246
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,321
I will announce at court
that we're sending back the case then.

247
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,989
Since it was me who started it…

248
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,035
I want to be the one to end it.

249
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,958
Please, Ms. Na.

250
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,213
I don't want to let you.

251
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,968
Didn't I tell you before?

252
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,346
I can put up with dumb associate judges,

253
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,807
but not arrogant ones.

254
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,353
Are you the presiding judge?

255
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,651
No, I'm not.

256
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,071
That's why…

257
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,867
I'm asking you.

258
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,703
You don't ask for a case back,

259
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,872
you discuss it.

260
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,084
You thought it all through yourself,

261
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,919
and now demand it back?

262
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,549
Is this how you usually handle things?

263
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,431
This conversation never happened.

264
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,031
JUDGE CHA TAE-JU

265
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
What is it about that case?

266
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,668
It's because of the case
involving the brick, isn't it?

267
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,132
You think this happened
because they were given

268
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,134
a second chance as juvenile offenders.

269
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,889
You think those kids
will assume they are above the law.

270
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:34,269
That's why you're so desperate
to take this case, right?

271
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,360
But what if that's just our assumption?

272
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,822
What if it's just us who believe that
they're expecting they'll get off easy?

273
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,994
If we look at this case independently
from their priors…

274
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,246
What if he just got roped into it?

275
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,752
We have to keep all possibilities open.

276
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,171
-We're judges--
-That's all the more reason

277
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,257
I need to take this case.

278
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,902
It's a recording the police sent us.

279
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,238
There was a recording?

280
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,282
Those guys made me call Seon-a.

281
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,784
So I did.

282
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,454
We just had a few drinks together
and she just came on to us.

283
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:39,668
They weren't planning on
getting her drunk and raping her.

284
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,879
But drinking puts you in a good mood.

285
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,007
They were going to ask for her consent,

286
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:51,221
but she just passed out,
so we really didn't have to ask.

287
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,223
That isn't…

288
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,935
consent.

289
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,356
"Consent"?

290
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,902
You're right. I guess not.

291
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,241
Mister, can I go home now?

292
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,577
My parents will be worried.

293
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,704
No, you can't.

294
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,001
-Fuck, this is going to be good.
-I bet she tastes like ice cream.

295
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,337
-Sex!
-Sex!

296
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:29,134
We were going to do it there at first,
but it was too exposed.

297
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,013
People could show up from anywhere.

298
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,724
So we took her to the construction site.

299
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,644
-Fuck, this is going to be good.
-What do you mean by, "do it there"?

300
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,604
What?

301
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,230
What you just said.

302
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,068
"We were going to do it there,
but people could show up."

303
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,572
I meant if we had sex there.

304
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,543
We played rock-paper-scissors
to decide who will go first.

305
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,671
So they went first
and then it was my turn.

306
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,590
I was all prepared.

307
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,844
I took off her clothes
and felt her breasts.

308
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,557
But, damn…
Maybe it was because I was drunk.

309
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,435
I couldn't get my dick up.

310
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,317
You bastard.

311
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,610
No, for real.

312
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:33,198
The others were having a great time,

313
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,409
but my dick wouldn't get hard,
so I couldn't fuck her.

314
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,373
Is this all a joke to you?

315
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,461
-You're laughing?
-Mister, do you know how that feels?

316
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,172
Maybe you don't since she's your daughter.

317
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,174
Is this a joke to you, you bastard!

318
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,345
Tell me, you bastard!

319
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,182
Is this a joke to you! Is it?

320
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,186
How is this…

321
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,604
Did he just get roped into it?

322
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,482
Why is this a protection case
when we have this recording?

323
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,150
It wasn't accepted as evidence.

324
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,653
He was forced to confess.

325
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:19,119
The victim's father couldn't hold back
his anger and assaulted the boy,

326
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,037
and his lawyer sued.

327
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,373
Thanks to that,
the victim's father is in custody.

328
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:27,794
While the victim is being taken care of
by her sister living in Seoul.

329
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,713
But this is what I don't understand.

330
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,092
Why would he confess
when it could land him in jail?

331
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,385
It's one of two things.

332
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,096
That confession could've been planned

333
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,765
to put the victim at a disadvantage…

334
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,686
Or he just has nothing to fear.

335
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,443
He has seven priors already.

336
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,779
Manslaughter…

337
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,618
assault, theft…

338
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:05,415
He's not afraid of the police
or the court after all that.

339
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:10,211
He's got nothing to fear
even if he lands himself in a reformatory.

340
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,425
Even if the statement can't be accepted
as evidence since it wasn't voluntary,

341
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,846
we have to work
to make this a criminal case.

342
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,484
It started off on the wrong foot.

343
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:42,369
If only he was sentenced properly
five years ago…

344
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,461
when he was put on trial the first time.

345
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:58,134
It's because no one made him realize

346
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,013
how much damage he had done to the victim…

347
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,520
and how he ruined the victim's life.

348
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,690
That's why.

349
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,559
"Juvenile cases are all about speed."

350
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,145
That does not mean

351
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,524
you should cause a ruckus
by making a big deal out of it.

352
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,737
It means the case should be handled
quickly and quietly.

353
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,491
I was in charge of
his case five years ago,

354
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,368
but I don't even remember him.

355
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,751
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

356
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,046
If it's an acceptable reason,
I'll reassign it to you.

357
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,009
I detest

358
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,595
young offenders.

359
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,233
Go for it.

360
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,905
I'm curious as to
how you will handle this.

361
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,951
I'm off to Senior presiding judge's office

362
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,913
to report the reassignment.

363
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,748
Okay.

364
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,542
Just wait and see

365
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,253
how I handle this case.

366
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,432
Her mother ran away five years ago,

367
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,560
and I've been
raising her alone ever since.

368
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,773
And when she hit puberty, it got harder.

369
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,403
If you give me another chance,
I will do my best to raise my daughter.

370
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,989
Like hell.

371
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,537
Ha-rin.

372
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,665
Why do you think you're here?

373
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,293
Because I stole cigarettes from a store.
Two cartons.

374
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,129
Well…

375
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,591
-I'd like to talk to her father alone.
-Okay.

376
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,636
-Can you please escort Ha-rin out?
-Okay.

377
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,721
Could her legal advisor also leave?

378
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,821
Sir, how long has it been
since Ha-rin ran away from home?

379
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,948
Pardon?

380
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,951
Your answer will be extremely important.

381
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,581
Hiding it won't make it go away.

382
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,709
About two months.

383
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,755
But it's all because of me.

384
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:28,011
It's all my fault.
My daughter has done nothing wrong.

385
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:35,101
Her mother ran away
when Ha-rin was in elementary school.

386
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,856
I should've taken better care of her.

387
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,277
I was always drunk
because I was having a hard time.

388
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,739
When I got calls saying she got in trouble

389
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,451
I only blamed her and told her

390
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,245
she was just like her mom.

391
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,664
I had done nothing for her.

392
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,460
When I finally decided to do right by her,

393
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,629
she had already grown up.

394
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,216
She wouldn't even respond
when I call her name.

395
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,888
But when she just disappeared,

396
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,349
I got scared.

397
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,979
Sir, please try to calm down.

398
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,401
I couldn't find her
no matter what I tried.

399
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,198
Then I saw the court attendance notice

400
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:35,036
and thought maybe I could meet her here.

401
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,417
If you forgive us,

402
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,337
I'll do everything I can.

403
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,590
I have a younger brother in Gangwon-do.
We'll move there

404
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,009
and I'll cook for her,

405
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,428
send her to school,

406
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,430
and get a new job.

407
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,933
Yes.

408
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,144
I understand what you're saying.

409
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,690
But…

410
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:09,237
I don't think Ha-rin can go home tonight.

411
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,406
What?

412
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,367
She'll go
to a juvenile classification center

413
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,160
to be investigated.

414
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,664
I'll decide on the sentence after that.

415
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,416
No, Your Honor!

416
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,503
Sir, please. For runaway kids,

417
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,714
it's highly likely they'll run away again

418
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,383
if I just send them back.

419
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,764
I believe if Ha-rin runs away again,
it'll be even more difficult to find her.

420
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:42,353
It will be better for her emotionally

421
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,232
if she goes
to a juvenile classification center

422
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,985
instead of home
to get a physical exam and even therapy.

423
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,739
We need to look into
where she got the money when she ran away,

424
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,616
who she was with, why she ran away,

425
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,746
and other pertinent details.

426
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,045
This is Sim Eun-seok.

427
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,090
Who?

428
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,603
I clearly told you…

429
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,731
Follow me.

430
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,867
Are you out of your mind?

431
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,994
What are you doing here?

432
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,246
Why do you think I came all the way here?

433
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,042
Hwang In-jun.
Why are you in charge of his case?

434

MISSED CALL

436
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,771
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IGNORING ME?
FINE, LET'S SEE HOW THIS ENDS

437
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,981
"When a judge is someone
who has a relationship

438
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,025
with the defendant,
the victim, or their family,

439
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,402
they will be recused
from their execution of duties."

440
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,531
You fit those grounds.

441
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,329
Why do you care what case I handle?

442
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,456
Why now?

443
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,833
Why wouldn't I care?

444
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,086
I'm Chan's father!

445
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,715
Why?

446
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,051
Is this some kind of revenge?

447
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,555
Will that change anything?

448
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,182
You'll only end up hurting yourself.
Why can't you see that?

449
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,517
I don't care.

450
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,270
I've already made up my mind.

451
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:51,524
Apply for recusal
before things get out of hand.

452
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,111
Or I'll call the court myself.

453
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,863
Back then…

454
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,618
He shouldn't have gotten out like that.

455
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,873
My son…

456
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,252
ended up like that because of him.

457
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,879
Why?

458
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,551
Eun-seok.

459
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,348
Just wait and see…

460
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,060
how I handle…

00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,981
Hwang In-jun.

Hey, Judge Sim…

Counsel.

464
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,596
You just said the same thing.

465
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,432
You can't keep making claims
without any evidence.

466
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,433
Prosecution--

467

484
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,066
-Please give me a ride!
-Are you crazy?

485
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,943
-Let go!
-I have to get to my kid.

486
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:41,944
Sir!

487
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,320
Chan.

488
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,774
COURT

489
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,305
I'll show him

490
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,350
how scary the law is.

491
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,185
I will teach him.

492
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,856
I'll show him that

493
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,193
there are consequences to harming others.

494
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,906
Just wait and see.

495
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,161
I will make sure
he gets sentenced properly.

496
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:14,013
COURT

497
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,813
Everyone, please sit.

498
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,994
Case number 2022 P3409.

499
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,580
The trial is now in session.

500
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,755
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

501
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,386
Hwang In-jun.

502
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,431
Why are you here?

503
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,479
Violation of the Resident Registration Act
and coercion.

504
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,696
You bought alcohol
at a convenience store with a fake ID

505
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,450
and threatened the victim that
you wouldn't let her go unless she drank.

506
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:21,080
and that you would spread rumors
on social media that she slept with you.

507
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,249
You threatened her.

508
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,463
Did you repent?

509
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,758
Yes.

510
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,847
This case happened because of
the power dynamics in their group.

511
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,725
He met Seo Dong-gyun
and O Gyeong-su at a juvenile facility.

512
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:46,397
They have been making him buy alcohol
and cigarettes for a long time.

513
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,650
They would beat him if he refused.

514
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,576
This incident happened
because he was afraid of being beaten up

515
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,287
and he is deeply reflecting on himself.

516
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,166
You did it
because you were afraid of them?

517
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,210
Yes.

518
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,841
Are you Hwang In-jun's legal guardian?

519
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,011
Did you really not know?

520
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,724
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

521
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,353
Okay, I got it.

522
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,899
I'm going to ask you one more question.

523
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,195
Depending on that answer, I'll decide
if we'll set another date for a trial

524
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,781
or if I'll just sentence you today.

525
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,792
There's something I'm curious about.

526
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,799
You were loyal to them
because you were afraid of them,

527
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,844
so how were you able to
defy them this time?

528
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,018
According to the records,

529
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,563
you didn't even enter the crime scene
and you tried to stop them.

530
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:16,028
You did everything they asked
because you were afraid of them,

531
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,031
so how did you…

532
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,160
refuse this time?

533
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,959
He was indeed afraid of their abuse--

534
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,461
Because it was preposterous.

535
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,798
I just couldn't see…

536
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,012
how anyone could do such a thing…

537
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,225
to another human being.

538
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,536
You do know what happens
if you lie in court, right?

539
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,956
I'll ask you one last time.

540
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,791
Counsel, do not answer for him.

541
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,422
Hwang In-jun.

542
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,884
Did you really not enter the crime scene?

543
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,470
No.

544
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,348
And did you really stop them?

545
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,683
Yes.

546
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,106
Witness.

547
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,528
I'm Detective Ko Gang-sik
of Women & Juvenile Affairs

548
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,030
at Yeonhwa Police Station,
and I'm in charge of this case.

549
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,578
I heard you're in charge of
the Yeonhwa Gang Rape case.

550
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,704
That's right.

551
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,665
About the recording
the victim's father submitted…

552
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,501
I can't get it off my mind.

553
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,836
Well…

554
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,088
I heard it can't be accepted as evidence.

555
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,131
I know.

556
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,552
What if there was evidence

557
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,346
other than the DNA?

558
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,156
-Do it again.
-Again.

559
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,491
Again. Rock-paper-scissors!

560
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,617
Okay! Drink!

561
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,535
You suck at rock-paper-scissors.

562
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,370
Seriously.

563
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,873
You lost, so drink.

564
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,125
-Who wants to go first?
-She's heavy.

565
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,503
Go up. Up.

566
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,630
That way.

567
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,342
Fuck.

568
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,306
Damn it.

569
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,267
-She's out.
-She's out?

570
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,936
Fuck.

571
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,229
Rock-paper-scissors, you idiot.

572
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,480
Let's do this!

573
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,940
Rock-paper-scissors.

574
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,149
Fuck! Damn it!

575
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,776
Hurry!

576
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,403
In-jun, did you get this?

577
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,050
Can I ask you a few things? Do you
park here every day around this hour?

578
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,885
I'd like to submit

579
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,262
the dashcam footage of the car

580
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,597
that was parked
near the construction site as evidence.

581
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,607
Again. Rock-paper-scissor!

582
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,235
Fucking drink already.

583
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,236
Drink.

584
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,654
Hurry up and drink.

585
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:50,450
Dashcam footage was retrieved
from a taxi that was parked nearby

586
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,246
but it was omitted in the investigation
as the taxi was operating at the time.

587
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,622
Drink up.

588
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,332
Fuck. Drink it all at once.

589
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,417
Yes, let's drink!

590
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,127
Gosh, you okay?

591
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,254
-Drink.
-You lunatic.

592
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,755
Fuck, why…

593
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,132
Hey.

594
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,216
Are you drunk?

595
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,177
She got fucking drunk from that?
That won't do.

596
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,804
-How could she pass out?
-Seon-a!

597
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,847
Move it.

598
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,808
-Hey, Seon-a.
-Fuck!

599
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,185
-Push.
-Seon-a!

600
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,353
What the fuck?

601
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,730
You shouldn't.

602
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,608
You idiot. We came too far to stop now.

603
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,902
Then I tried to stop you, right? Fuck.

604
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,535
Fuck.

605
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,537
The footage could have been tampered with.

606
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,373
That's the National Forensic Service
video analysis team's letter.

607
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,043
It states that
the footage wasn't tampered with.

608
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,216
WE VERIFY THAT THE DASHCAM FOOTAGE
HAS NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH

609
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,137
I warned you

610
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,641
that lying will only make things worse.

611
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,066
This proves that

612
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,655
Hwang In-jun's statement
saying that he tried to stop

613
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,033
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su
and that he never entered the crime scene

614
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,869
is a lie.

615
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:22,417
So this raises the possibility
that all of his statements could be a lie.

616
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,505
As you saw in the footage,
it's possible that Hwang In-jun,

617
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,509
who entered the construction site,
could be an accomplice.

618
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,929
Starting now, Hwang In-jun will be sent to

619
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,265
a juvenile classification center
for additional investigation.

620
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,977
The next trial will be in three weeks.

621
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,146
If you make false statements again
during the next trial

622
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:50,028
or if circumstances reveal that he was
an accomplice in the sexual assault,

623
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,239
this case…

624
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,326
can be sent to the prosecution.

625
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,996
Fuck.

626
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,418
Court…

627
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,714
will be adjourned.

628
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,904
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

629
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,656
Yes, that's right.

630
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,367
What?

631
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,039
One second please.
I'll check and let you know.

632
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,082
Don't send her up just yet.

633
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,882
Is Judge Sim here yet?

634
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,135
Someone's waiting for her in the lobby.

635
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,804
But is Judge Sim married?

636
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,431
Married?

637
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,772
-Judge Sim.
-Yes?

638
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,065
What's going on?

639
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,650
The Yeonhwa Gang Rape.

640
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,154
What Seon-a said might be true.

641
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,201
-What?
-There may be four boys, not three.

642
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,037
Seo Dong-gyun, O Gyeong-su, Hwang In-jun,

643
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,831
and Baek Do-hyeon.

644
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,546
The kid who was with Hwang In-jun

645
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,424
when he threw the brick five years ago.

646
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,053
That Baek Do-hyeon.

647
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,241
Judge Sim!

648
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,410
Why are you ignoring my texts?

649
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,870
I warned you

650
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,456
that I would find you.

651
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,542
You can't hide forever.

652
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,881
This is a courthouse.

653
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,260
Let's go and talk outside.

654
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,387
Can't you see?

655
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,681
I came here to cause a scene.

656
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,809
If you got a divorce,
that should be the end of it.

657
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,980
Why do you keep meeting my son
who finally got over you?

658
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,026
Let's go.

659
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,362
-We'll talk outside.
-Let go of me!

660
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,325
I told you a million times to quit,
and that a child needs his mother.

661
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,871
But you still put him
under the care of others.

662
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:49,249
That's why he died.

663
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,418
Because of some brick
that fell out of the sky!

664
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,714
My son had a blind date
and finally set a date to get remarried.

665
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,757
Even that went down the drain
because of you!

666
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,473
-This is why you should be careful!
-Please stop. Let's talk outside.

667
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,143
-I didn't like you from the start.
-Ma'am.

668
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,687
-Calm down.
-You cursed our family!

669
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,315
-You should have been the one who died!
-Please, stop.

670
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,817
What the hell did we do that was so wrong?

671
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,945
What did we ever do to deserve this?

672
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,406
Ma'am, please come this way.

673
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,005
-Ms. Joo.
-What?

674
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,758
Did you hear? Judge Sim's mother-in-law…

675
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,927
Mother-in-law? What are you talking about?

676
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,846
I just heard. She caused
a huge scene in the lobby.

677
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,889
Did you know?

678
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:49,100
-I didn't even know she was married.
-What?

679
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:53,396
Anyway, her mother-in-law came
to the lobby

680
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,774
-and slapped Judge Sim in the face.
-What?

681
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,693
She was talking about divorce
and whatnot. It was a mess.

682
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,404
Is Judge Sim okay?

683
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,075
I don't know. Anyway,
the whole court is talking about this.

684
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:09,079
Gosh, she did a great job at the trial,
and now this? What a mess.

685
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:13,083
Ms. Na is out of the office all day
because of the seminar, right?

686
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,620
Eun-seok.

687
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,832
I don't want to hear a word.

688
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,753
I'll apologize for what my mom did.

689
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,881
I'll make sure
nothing like this happens again.

690
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,092
How?

691
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,470
How are you going to do that?

692
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,058
This isn't the first time.

693
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,647
The problem isn't your mother.

694
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,690
It's you.

695
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,488
Why is it…

696
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,451
that your worries…

697
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,581
always make me so miserable?

698
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,174
Don't ever come here again.

699
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,636
Don't ever show yourself
in front of me. Please.

700
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,411
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
