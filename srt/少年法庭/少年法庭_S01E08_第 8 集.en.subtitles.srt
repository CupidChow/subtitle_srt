1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,471
A vegetative state?

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,932
Are you sure?

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,226
Our assistant went
to the hospital in person.

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:19,936
I'm sure.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,564
Then what about my daughter?

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,067
What if the blame gets shifted to us?

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,485
To be honest,

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,573
his physical condition
won't affect anything.

9
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,908
It's still a protection case,

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,162
and the one who drove the car
is Kwak Do-seok, not them.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,997
The problem is the abetting charge.

12
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,710
But there's a way to get around it,
so you don't need to worry.

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,964
Then what should we do first?

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,052
Start by keeping the children in check.

15
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,649
It's New Year's Day.

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,401
I'd like to give you a New Year's bow.

17
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,695
Happy New Year.

18
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,030
Hey, Do-seok. Hey.

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,949
Okay.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
Thank you.

21
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,080
Sit down.

22
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,831
All right. Happy New Year.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,625
Yes. And I picked this up

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,753
on the way here.

25
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,839
You said you use pencils at work,

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,299
so I got this for you.

27
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,094
I picked it out myself.

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,608
Thanks.

29
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,444
I'll make good use of them.

30
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,071
Okay.

31
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,865
It's a promise then.

32
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,992
You won't stand on trial again.

33
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,410
Yes.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,499
I'll make sure that won't happen again.

35
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,190
I really didn't know anything.

36
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,567
He just told me to get in the car,
so I did.

37
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,653
It's his way or the highway.

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,407
They're all lying.

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,036
They would call him out
in the middle of the night.

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,665
I tried reasoning with them,
scolding them,

41
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,500
but they kept coming to our house.

42
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,461
Do-seok rented the car?

43
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,758
He was driving? He probably did.
So he wouldn't get beaten.

44
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,019
Isn't the new presiding judge
coming today?

45
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,103
Yes.

46
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,855
One of my colleagues told me

47
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,316
that she came here last night.

48
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,943
She took a look around the court

49
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,361
and looked over some records.

50
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,904
I see.

51
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,822
Ms. Joo.

52
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,866
-Yes?
-Have you heard anything about her?

53
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,535
Like her personality or idiosyncrasies.

54
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,621
-I have.
-What is it?

55
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,624
I've heard she's a tough cookie.

56
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,709
I see.

57
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,845
Let's be democratic about it.

58
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,181
I'm not that strict.

59
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,059
You can have lunch on your own,

60
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,396
and you don't have to come to my office
to me when you're clocking in or out.

61
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,565
That's annoying for me, too.

62
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,028
What about the days
for individual and collegiate trials

63
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,572
and the submission of rulings--

64
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,199
As you're used to.

65
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,035
Is there anything else?

66
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,537
We're good for now.

67
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,166
If anything new comes up,
we can decide it then.

68
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,711
Then let's wrap up this meeting.

69
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,177
There is one thing that gets on my nerves.

70
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,222
I can put up with dumb associate judges,

71
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,766
but not with arrogant ones.

72
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,149
Think about it. I'm the presiding judge.

73
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,693
There's a clear line between us.
Don't you agree?

74
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,864
Especially you. You better be careful.

75
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,617
I've heard a lot about you.

76
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,745
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,416
Let's try to get along.

78
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,597
I think I got on her bad side.

79
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,268
Well, I can't do anything about it.

80
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,854
Judge Sim. So I was wondering--

81
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,106
-No.
-You don't know what I'm going to say.

82
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,191
You're trying to interfere in the case.

83
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,610
The underage traffic accident case.

84
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,615
I know you feel bad about Kwak Do-seok.

85
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,951
But that's where it ends.

86
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,496
I hate to repeat myself.
Don't cross the line.

87
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,299
Is this Kwak Do-seok's probation officer?

88
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,510
I had some questions
while going through his records.

89
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:54,849
He answered your calls
diligently at first.

90
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,603
But after a month or two,
he started skipping lectures

91
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,521
and even ignored your calls.

92
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,648
What's the reason?

93
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,904
We made a few house visits
and met his mom because of that.

94
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,200
What other reason is there?
He just got lazy and didn't want to.

95
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,163
In his case,
his mother is his only guardian,

96
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,790
but she's too busy making a living.

97
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,878
But that doesn't mean
we can just dwell on him for so long.

98
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,258
There was a claim
that he was harassed for a long time.

99
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,010
That was from his mother, right?

100
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,388
You probably already know this,

101
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,058
but he's a Taekwondo blackbelt
and over 180cm.

102
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,269
His past offenses are
for assault and extortion,

103
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,480
so I don't really believe her.

104
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,869
That was months ago and I already told
the detectives everything.

105
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,204
Yes, I know.

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,209
But the minor who was driving at the time

107
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,504
will be hospitalized for a long time.

108
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,676
I'm sorry, but can I meet
the employee who was in charge then?

109
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,719
Jeez, I don't know.

110
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,764
She was assigned
to another branch last month.

111
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:22,687
Then can I get her contact information
or which branch she was assigned to?

112
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,276
Working this job, I've seen lots of kids
turn themselves around and get better.

113
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,778
But there are also
a lot of kids that don't.

114
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,746
You asked for me, Judge Sim?

115
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,542
Kwak Do-seok
won't be sentenced in this case.

116
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,296
So please summon all the other children
to attend the next trial.

117
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,505
And for that trial,

118
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,383
have their guardians
and attorneys wait outside.

119
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,801
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,844
And…

121
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,598
when you have time,
please check their social media

122
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,641
to see if there's anything problematic.

123
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,393
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,187
SECOND CRIME, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY

125
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,573
Why can't you take charge
of your fellow judge?

126
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:20,661
Who's in charge of
the underage traffic accident case?

127
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,747
It's me.

128
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,665
If he's not in charge,

129
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,668
why is he going to the rental shop
and poking around there?

130
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,046
The Civil Service Office is in chaos.

131
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,465
The store called and threw a fit.

132
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,801
That it happened months ago
and they suffered serious losses over it.

133
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,220
I got a call
from the senior presiding judge.

134
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,180
This is ridiculous!

135
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,850
Tell him to come to my office now.

136
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,311
I'll handle it myself…

137
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,483
and warn him properly.

138
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,446
Make sure you handle him right.

139
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,718
What were you thinking?

140
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,474
I specifically told you to stop
and not to cross the line.

141
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,642
Are you really

142
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,020
going to end it like this?

143
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,772
What?

144
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,066
Mr. Seo told me everything.

145
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,153
That Do-seok's mother filed a petition.

146
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,533
And that she feels wronged.

147
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,702
That's why I had to look into it.

148
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,705
-This isn't your case!
-There was one more person.

149
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,839
When Kwak Do-seok was there
to rent the car,

150
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,800
he was with someone.

151
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,136
Hey, wait.

152
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,057
-Hye-jeong!
-Yes?

153
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,441
Hello, do you already have a booking?

154
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,443
Well, no.

155
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,069
Have a seat here.

156
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,571
Okay.

157
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,450
When the police were investigating,

158
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,202
she was too flustered
that she forgot about the girl.

159
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,831
She went to the police later, but the case
was already sent to the prosecution.

160
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,919
It was from a distance,
so she wasn't sure.

161
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,967
But she thinks
it was one of the girls riding the car.

162
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,061
She may be the key to this case.

163
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,855
We need to look into it further.

164
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,942
Judge Sim!

165
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,907
I said Kwak Do-seok
wouldn't be prosecuted,

166
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,203
not that I'd half-ass this case.

167
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,123
His guardian filed a petition,

168
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,334
and since I have knowledge of that,

169
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,587
I need to find out
what exactly happened at the time

170
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,340
and who's accountable for what.

171
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,384
Finding out the truth comes first.

172
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,348
And following the proper procedures
is also a judge's duty.

173
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,392
You don't have to
go poking around everywhere.

174
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,397
I'm also doing my best

175
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,650
as the judge in charge.

176
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
Okay, I understand.

177
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,375
Hello, Judge Sim. This is Seo Beom.

178
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,543
What is it?

179
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,337
I checked their social media
as you requested.

180
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,214
Their attorney must have told them to.

181
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,967
All their photos and videos
have been deleted.

182
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,177
Their accounts have been
completely deleted.

183
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,805
Their public group account
has also been deleted.

184
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,891
What should we do now?

185
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,771
There was one more person.

186
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,983
When Kwak Do-seok
was there to rent the car,

187
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,861
he was with someone.

188
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,364
She may be the key to this case.

189
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,074
We need to look into it further.

190
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,087
All of them had alibis
for when the car was rented.

191
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,965
Lee Nam-gyeong and Kang Tae-hun
were at an Internet cafe,

192
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,468
and Kim I-seon and Baek Mi-ju
went home early to rest.

193
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,220
Was anyone else with them at home?

194
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,347
They both said they were home alone.

195
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,269
ICU VISITING HOURS
YEONHWA HOSPITAL

196
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,564
4:40 P.M.

197
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
Are you okay?

198
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,671
You're…

199
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,841
Wait.

200
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,312
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

201
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,401
-Excuse me.
-Yes, Lieutenant?

202
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,237
Some girl left this.

203
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,614
What is it?

204
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,951
I don't know exactly,
but I think it's a USB stick.

205
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,536
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
KWAK DO-SEOK CASE

206
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,081
I'm supposed to discard it,
but I kept it just in case.

207
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,044
This was handed to you today?

208
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,547
She came to the court
and gave it to the bailiff.

209
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,217
I checked the security footage
and I couldn't see her face.

210
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,511
But she seemed about Kwak Do-seok's age.

211
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,680
Her handwriting seems so too.

212
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,684
For security reasons,

213
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,855
I'm supposed to discard it immediately
instead of handing it to judges.

214
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,276
But I saw it just in case,
and was shocked.

215
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,051
What about the sound?

216
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,137
-Is there no sound?
-No.

217
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,015
It seems to have been recorded
on a cell phone,

218
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,433
but there's no sound.

219
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,143
If this actually happened,

220
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,397
Kwak Do-seok's guardian's claims are true.

221
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,985
But why isn't he fighting back?

222
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,946
He used to be an athlete, didn't he?

223
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,996
Judge Cha.

224
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,748
Judge Cha.

225
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,625
Judge Cha.

226
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,135
Others may not know,
but I know how much Do-seok has changed.

227
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,931
It may look like

228
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,226
he was being helplessly beaten, but no.

229
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,520
He held back.

230
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,690
He knew that he'd stand trial again
if he fought back,

231
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,568
so he just put up with it.

232
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,905
He has no reason to forge an ID

233
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,325
and illegally rent a car
to drive without a license.

234
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,703
And the passengers
were those who beat him up.

235
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,664
This doesn't make any sense.

236
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,376
No, it doesn't.

237
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:48,961
But…

238
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,340
even if those kids assaulted him
or threatened him,

239
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,717
it doesn't change the fact

240
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:01,598
that a man is in critical condition
because of his driving

241
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,104
and that he himself
rented the car illegally.

242
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,901
We don't even know
where the video came from.

243
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,195
We need to stay level-headed,

244
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,032
especially at a time like this.

245
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,805
This is Sim Eun-seok.

246
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,725
Please take the original copy of the video

247
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,227
and have it checked to see
if it's been fabricated.

248
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,354
And please make a copy of it as well.

249
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,630
What on earth are they saying?

250
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,639
I'm sorry, Judge Sim. I was in a rush…

251
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
It's fine.
What about the video of the assault?

252
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,603
Yes, the video.
I got a response from the analyst.

253
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,564
He said it wasn't edited or fabricated.

254
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,482
But…

255
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,068
MULTIMEDIA ANALYSIS, AUDIO RESTORED

256
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,570
-Good job.
-Sure.

257
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:43,450
Huh? Gosh, you motherfucker.
Hey, you bastard. You son of bitch!

258
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,161
Did you just dodge, you bastard? Did you?

259
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,455
You said you'd delete the photos.

260
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,832
-What?
-You said you'd delete the photos.

261
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,875
I will.

262
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,502
What?

263
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,338
-Hey.
-Don't talk to me like that, you bitch.

264
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,714
What the fuck…

265
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,386
-What?
-You said you'd delete the photos.

266
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,137
I will.

267
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,097
Delete?

268
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,266
What the fuck?
Do you actually like that bitch?

269
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,230
This is Sim Eun-seok.

270
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,484
Are the children
all attending the trial this afternoon?

271
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,863
Come on in.

272
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,290
What is it?

273
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,710
I apologize, Ms. Na.

274
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,214
I heard you were summoned
by the senior presiding judge

275
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
a few days ago because of me.

276
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,012
I'll be careful from now on.

277
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,890
She said she'd teach you a lesson.
I guess she did a good job.

278
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:51,977
You may leave.

279
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,731
Wait.

280
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,943
Yes?

281
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,196
I reprimanded two people.
Why did you come alone?

282
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,907
Well, actually…

283
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,868
Judge Sim Eun-seok is…

284
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,040
I reject your apology.

285
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,293
You should apologize properly.

286
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,213
I don't want to accept
a half-assed apology.

287
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,183
I feel bad about that.

288
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,393
I see.

289
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,937
You feel bad about that?

290
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
I'm a victim, too.

291
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,403
A victim?

292
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,916
-What?
-You said you'd delete the photos.

293
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,167
I will.

294
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,003
-Hey.
-You son of bitch.

295
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,922
-Don't talk to me like that, you bitch.
-Hey.

296
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,256
You motherfucker.

297
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,592
What do you think you're doing, fucker?

298
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,302
You bastard.

299
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,888
-For God's sake. You bastard.
-Stop.

300
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,891
Are you sure you aren't an assailant?

301
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,149
According to the petition
filed by Kwak Do-seok's guardian,

302
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,236
"Kwak Do-seok is a victim."

303
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,947
"He was forced to illegally rent

304
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,408
and drive a car."

305
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,286
"He's been assaulted and threatened
for a long time."

306
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,373
Are you sure you're a victim?

307
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,549
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
KWAK DO-SEOK CASE

308
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,094
You remember that, right?

309
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,597
If you don't,

310
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,643
I'll show you the security footage
that shows you bringing it here.

311
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,147
Was it a crime to hand it to you?

312
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,481
No, it's not.

313
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,859
But…

314
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,570
I'm worried.

315
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,368
You have something to do with that video
of Kwak Do-seok being assaulted.

316
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,665
That's probably why
you removed the audio and handed it

317
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,085
to a court officer in secret.

318
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,970
From now on, whatever you say here

319
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,097
will hold no weight legally.

320
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,057
We'll stop recording.

321
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,393
Your friends won't know about it.

322
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,645
So…

323
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,690
feel free to tell me everything.

324
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,451
A spy cam.

325
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,040
Do you know what it feels like…

326
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,504
to be recorded unknowingly?

327
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,430
Let's go here. It's good.

328
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,557
-We should order extra.
-Gosh, I'm so hungry.

329
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,561
Where do you want us to send these?

330
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,272
How would the kids from school react?

331
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,316
Should we send them to your mom?

332
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,985
Why aren't you answering?

333
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,780
This whore is ignoring us.

334
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,907
Mi-ju. What are you doing?

335
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,284
Come on, let's go.

336
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,869
I'm hungry.

337
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,456
Baek Mi-ju.

338
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,381
My mind completely crumbled.

339
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,260
They asked me to join
an overnight trip to the beach.

340
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,387
It happened while I was asleep.

341
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,891
I asked them to delete the photos,

342
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,227
but they said they would
if I did what they said.

343
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,271
What about Kwak Do-seok?

344
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,856
Later.

345
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,902
He got involved after I told him
what had happened.

346
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,237
Because of the photos?

347
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,948
To delete them for you?

348
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,285
But…

349
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,330
they began to harass him

350
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,876
and it became more and more severe.

351
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,175
Why those…

352
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,223
At the rental shop.

353
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,393
Were you there to stop him?

354
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,020
Yes.

355
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,942
A forged ID and driving without a license.

356
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,903
It was way too crazy.

357
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,196
Hey, Kwak Do-seok!

358
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,745
Do you know what you're doing?
You're done for if you get caught.

359
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,331
-They said this was the last time.
-And you believe them?

360
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,418
Don't worry too much.

361
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,671
I'll make them delete
your photos no matter what.

362
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,131
I'll be back. Wait out there.

363
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,175
Hey!

364
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,180
The photos were deleted eventually,

365
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,183
thanks to Do-seok.

366
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,318
But he ended up the way he is now

367
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,238
because of it.

368
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,702
I'll try persuading her.

369
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,872
If Baek Mi-ju testifies,

370
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,085
we can take it into consideration,
though it was him who drove the car.

371
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,336
He'd feel less wronged.

372
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,047
Judge Sim.

373
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,590
But don't expect too much.

374
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,302
For teenagers, their peer groups
are more important than their lives.

375
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,431
She won't confess
unless she's ready to cut ties with them.

376
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,060
It won't be easy.

377
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,771
Okay.

378
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,817
But is it really right for you

379
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,319
to keep remaining silent?

380
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,453
Baek Mi-ju.

381
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,417
This is your decision to make.

382
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,131
-Judge Sim.
-What is it?

383
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,812
Tell the children and their guardians
and attorney in the waiting room

384
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,064
to come into the courtroom.

385
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,153
I hereby inform you
that this protection case

386
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,571
has been concluded.

387
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,449
-Concluded? All of a sudden?
-Has the case been closed?

388
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,409
-Please be quiet.
-Isn't it a good thing then?

389
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,578
What's the reason?

390
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,331
The victim O Gyu-sang has died.

391
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,083
He died?

392
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,168
Gosh, unbelievable.

393
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,419
Gyu-sang.

394
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,880
What will we do now?

395
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,552
What do I do?

396
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,346
Since Mr. O Gyu-sang,
the car accident victim, has died,

397
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,141
this case will be sent back
to the Prosecutors' Office

398
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,518
tomorrow morning.

399
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,730
If the prosecution presses charges,

400
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,066
a criminal case may be opened against you.

401
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,568
A criminal case?

402
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,986
Please sit down.

403
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,113
This trial is over.

404
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,161
-What's going to happen now?
-It's fine.

405
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,623
Do we need to explain it?

406
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,541
Hey, it's okay.

407
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,418
All right. Let's talk outside.

408
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,377
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

409
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,005
What are you saying?
A juvenile criminal case?

410
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,882
The victim, Mr. O Gyu-sang, has died.

411
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,510
Since the victim has died,

412
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,804
the case has to be
sent back to the prosecution.

413
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,305
What about their confession?

414
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,226
They barely confessed
when it was a protection case.

415
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,686
Won't it be harder now?

416
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,813
Cha Tae-ju.

417
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,357
That's enough.

418
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,153
-Sorry?
-You're obsessed with this case

419
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,823
because of your guilt.

420
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,830
PROBATION CARD
KWAK DO-SEOK

421
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,250
The boy changed as he promised you.

422
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,043
STUDYING HARD WITH THE WORKBOOK
YOU GOT ME

423
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,461
He turned over a new leaf.

424
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,798
But this is how he ended up.

425
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,884
You're being stubborn

426
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,763
because there's nothing more
you can do for him now.

427
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,398
If that boy did everything
he could do to change

428
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,316
and become a better person,

429
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,070
you should do so too.

430
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,241
You shouldn't just cover for him
and side with him.

431
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,034
You should see what he did wrong

432
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,745
and approach the case with a cool head.

433
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,918
Because of the crime they committed,

434
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,630
a boy has been hospitalized
for the rest of his life,

435
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,675
and an innocent family man lost his life.

436
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,553
But no one's willing
to take responsibility.

437
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,682
Everyone is a perpetrator
and they all claim they were wronged.

438
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,559
Doesn't that say anything?

439
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,063
Can't you see
what you really need to do now?

440
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,334
The case that was sent back to
the prosecution due to the victim's death.

441
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,463
Judge Sim, that was your underage
traffic accident case, wasn't it?

442
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,380
Yes.

443
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,468
The prosecution needs
to investigate it further.

444
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,469
What do you mean?

445
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,012
Driver Kwak Do-seok's guardian

446
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,473
and the passengers are making
conflicting statements.

447
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,434
The passengers are suspected of abetting

448
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,354
driving without a license, forgery,
exercising counterfeit documents,

449
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,857
and the violation
of the Resident Registration Act.

450
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,109
The Act on Cases
for Settlement of Traffic Accidents

451
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,903
can also be applied.

452
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,989
We also need to see
how we can help compensate

453
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,201
the dead victim's family and Kwak Do-seok,

454
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,786
who's in a vegetative state.

455
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,746
What do you think, Judge Cha?

456
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,457
I agree with Judge Sim.

457
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,461
Because of this accident, one person died,

458
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,172
and another has to be hospitalized
for the rest of his life.

459
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,800
Their families have the right to know

460
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,762
why, how, and by who this happened.

461
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,810
I think judges have a duty
to uncover the truth.

462
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,480
Considering that,
we have too many cold cases.

463
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,442
Uncovering the truth is important.

464
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,820
But if delayed, it isn't justice.

465
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,699
I think juvenile cases
are all about speed.

466
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,078
Do you know how many unsolved cases
there are in our department alone?

467
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:21,040
Our division has piles of cold cases
because you're like this.

468
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,252
Let's not waste our energy
on trivial cases from now on.

469
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,546
Please pay particular attention
to the unsolved ones.

470
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,839
That's it for today.

471
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,869
I thought a lot about
what you said yesterday.

472
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,205
You were right

473
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,750
about everything.

474
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:11,174
Do-seok reminded me of myself
when I was a teenager,

475
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,512
so the fact that I can no longer
do anything for him…

476
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,184
really tortured me.

477
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,980
Approaching the case with a cool head

478
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,274
and making the right decision

479
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:33,154
is what I need to do
for Do-seok and the victim.

480
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,201
But I think I was too emotional.

481
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,619
I'm sorry, Judge Sim.

482
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,665
Okay.

483
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,254
What should we do now?

484
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,513
It's one hurdle after another.

485
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:23,454
Case number 2022 GH 4012.

486
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,373
The trial begins now.

487
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,416
Attorney.

488
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,710
The prosecution charged
for the abetment of

489
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,463
driving without a license,
violation of the Act on Special Cases

490
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,133
Concerning the Settlement
of Traffic Accidents,

491
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,509
the Resident Registration Act,

492
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,511
forgery and the exercise
of counterfeit documents.

493
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,971
Do they admit to the charges?

494
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,057
No, my clients do not.

495
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,893
On what grounds?

496
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,020
They admit
that they were in the car with him,

497
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,108
but they thought Kwak had rented the car
after getting a driver’s license

498
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,696
and didn't aid him
in any of the above charges.

499
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,245
Defendant Lee Nam-gyeong claims
that the driver rented the car,

500
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,582
and when Kang Tae-hun, Kim I-seon,
Baek Mi-ju, and he were together,

501
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,334
he boasted about it
and offered them a ride.

502
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,379
But offering rides to others

503
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:17,133
implies that the involved parties
know each other or are close.

504
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,264
Hey, you motherfucker! What the fuck!

505
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,933
What are you trying to do, you bastard?

506
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,771
Fuck, get up now. Get up.
Get up, you son of bitch.

507
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,399
Gosh, you motherfucker. Hey, you bastard.

508
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,693
-Hey, you motherfucker!
-Fuck.

509
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,779
The defendants
have already seen this video.

510
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,239
The defendants acted violently

511
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,451
in a fit of rage due to a disagreement
between the two parties.

512
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,953
They are regretting it deeply.

513
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,748
Then what about this?

514
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:52,126
It's the petition Kwak's guardian
submitted to the court

515
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,420
enclosed with photos
put forward as evidence.

516
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,755
Prosecution.

517
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,133
Decide whether you'll submit them
as evidence.

518
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,469
Yes, I'll submit all of them as evidence.

519
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,346
We'll accept them as evidence.

520
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,853
PHOTO EVIDENCE
OF ASSAULT ON KWAK DO-SEOK

521
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,688
The medical staff also stated

522
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:17,693
that these kinds of wounds
and bruises can only be seen

523
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,864
when someone has been assaulted severely
and over a long period of time.

524
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,201
According to the evidence,

525
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,744
it seems to be more appropriate

526
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:31,207
to see their relationship
as one of power rather than friendship.

527
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,379
Therefore, the claim
that they were offered a ride as a favor

528
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,923
is not very convincing.

529
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,427
What are your thoughts?

530
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,266
What we need to focus on
is the children's relationship.

531
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,602
There's only one thing
their attorney claims.

532
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,521
"They knew nothing, and weren't involved."

533
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,481
"They were offered a ride,
so they got in."

534
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,025
But there's no evidence that shows

535
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,321
whether Kwak Do-seok was close enough
to offer them a ride.

536
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:09,662
All we need to see is
whether their claim is reasonable.

537
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,753
All the security footage
from the rental shop shows

538
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,214
that the defendants weren't there.

539
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,010
It was Kwak Do-seok
who presented a forged ID, chose a car,

540
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,762
and signed the contract.

541
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,692
Call Baek Mi-ju to the witness stand.

542
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,986
I know we shouldn't,

543
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,196
but I'll meet her
and persuade her somehow.

544
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,032
-No.
-Judge Sim.

545
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,118
That meeting was so that
we could hear her honest thoughts.

546
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,122
We stopped recording,

547
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,623
and I told her

548
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,461
what she said there would not hold
any weight in a court of law.

549
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,090
Yes, uncovering the truth is important.

550
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,425
But if things go wrong,

551
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,471
the court could end up
creating another victim.

552
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,807
Witness.

553
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,810
Please state your name and affiliation.

554
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,606
I'm Sergeant Kim Tae-hwan from
the Traffic Control Division in Gangnam.

555
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,859
I stopped the defendants
while cracking down on drunk drivers.

556
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,737
Can you tell us exactly what happened?

557
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,626
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

558
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,710
May I see your ID?

559
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,505
Yes, just a second.

560
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,883
Is something wrong?

561
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,846
The car didn't smell of alcohol
and he passed the breathalyzer test.

562
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,723
But, oddly, the driver was very tense.

563
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,767
The passengers looked young, too.

564
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,646
How did the others in the car react?

565
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,147
Were they nervous, too?

566
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,776
Yes, all four of them seemed nervous.

567
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,569
Especially the girls.

568
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,530
Are you sure?

569
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,739
Yes, I am.

570
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,206
The court will be adjourned
for about an hour.

571
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,511
What's the point of
proceeding with this trial?

572
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,390
Neither side has any clear evidence.

573
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,142
Everything is circumstantial.

574
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,145
Let's wrap it up and draw a conclusion.

575
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,315
Ms. Na. It's too early to draw--

576
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,818
It depends on how you look at it.

577
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,783
We can't end the trial like this.

578
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,079
As you said,
an innocent person was killed.

579
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,374
Then somebody
must be held accountable for that.

580
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,630
The court has come to a decision.

581
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,384
Because of the crime
the defendants committed,

582
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,637
an innocent family man has died,

583
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,392
and the driver is in a vegetative state.

584
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,855
It has caused two casualties,
which is a dreadful consequence.

585
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,735
However, the defendants
still deny the charges

586
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,782
and do not regret what they've done.

587
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,497
They're first-time offenders

588
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,166
and are accountable
for death and injuries.

589
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,043
Neither was it settled out of court.

590
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,462
The penalty for violating
the Traffic Accidents Act

591
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,922
is up to five years imprisonment,

592
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,507
so I think one year at the least

593
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,092
and two and a half years
at the longest is appropriate.

594
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,137
Who said you could apply
the Traffic Accident Act?

595
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,599
Abetting unlicensed driving,
forgery, and counterfeiting,

596
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,893
and the violation
of the Resident Registration Act

597
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,812
would be enough,
so we can turn it into a protection case.

598
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,147
You made a mess of things

599
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,150
by sending the case back
to the prosecution and now what?

600
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,862
You'll apply the Traffic Accident Act?
My goodness.

601
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,323
Do you think our job
is to make convicts of people?

602
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,745
However…

603
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,207
regarding the Act
on Settlement of Traffic Accidents,

604
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:29,505
there's no causal link
between the accident and the defendants.

605
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,840
We declare them innocent.

606
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,886
They're guilty of abetting
unlicensed driving,

607
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,307
forgery, exercise
of counterfeit documents,

608
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,309
and violating
the Resident Registration Act.

609
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,771
But considering their ages, past records,

610
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,732
and the cause of the accident,

611
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,777
we decided that this case should be
handled as a juvenile protection case.

612
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,322
The case will be forwarded
to the juvenile court.

613
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,240
Yes.

614
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,283
Gosh.

615
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,742
-Hey.
-Yes.

616
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,287
-This is awesome.
-Remain silent, please.

617
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,871
My gosh.

618
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,748
We're good now.

619
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,918
-That was a close one.
-Thank you.

620
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,045
It'll be forwarded to the juvenile court?

621
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,258
How can you turn this
into a protection case?

622
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,759
If there's insufficient evidence,

623
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,470
we can schedule another trial
for additional evidence.

624
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,139
What if we do?

625
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,516
Will we be getting new evidence?

626
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,354
For the Traffic Accidents Act
to be applied to the passengers,

627
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,190
we have to consider the passengers
as the perpetrators too.

628
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,860
How are we going to prove that now?

629
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:38,657
You should know that such cases are rare.
What's wrong with you?

630
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,660
Still, this isn't a protection case.

631
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,496
There are two victims in this case.

632
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,665
Somebody must be held accountable.

633
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,542
And that's not for us to decide.

634
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,796
Let's just put them on probation.

635
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,007
That'd be better for the children

636
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,926
than setting a date again
and giving them a criminal record.

637
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,476
Is it really for the children?

638
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,855
Or is it because…

639
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,734
juvenile cases are all about speed?

640
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,705
-The trial is now--
-Excuse me.

641
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,166
Can I say something?

642
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,710
Who are you?

643
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,128
I'm…

644
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,926
the victim O Gyu-sang's wife.

645
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,469
The victim?

646
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,931
No, you can't.

647
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,016
The trial is over.

648
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,852
No. You can't finish it like this.

649
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,648
Then who killed my husband?

650
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,151
You didn't talk about my husband at all.

651
00:44:56,235 --> 00:45:01,031
My husband was killed wrongfully.
Who's responsible for that?

652
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,866
-Please stop.
-No, I mean…

653
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,994
-You can't just leave like this.
-Aren't you coming?

654
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,746
If you end it like this…

655
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,165
What of my husband then?

656
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,670
Please, Your Honor!

657
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,172
How can you?

658
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,094
What is this?

659
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,631
Thank you.

660
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,759
I'm fine.

661
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,512
Do you remember my voice?

662
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,057
I called you a few times,

663
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,144
but you hung up on me.

664
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,862
Do you think

665
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,908
those children know
what this ruling means?

666
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,244
I felt suffocated at that moment.

667
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,955
It felt so wrong.

668
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,088
They shouldn't be cheering like that.

669
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,091
Do you think…

670
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,220
the ruling was a mistake?

671
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,889
Isn't it?

672
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,565
Excuse me, Judge Cha.

673
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,860
You received a delivery.

674
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,545
Goodbye.

675
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,936
All of you.

676
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,772
You got away with it this time,
but it won't work next time.

677
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,900
Think about what you did wrong. All right?

678
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,867
When there's a car accident…

679
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,292
the driver unconsciously

680
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,004
turns the steering wheel
away from himself.

681
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,175
To avoid being injured
as much as possible.

682
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,806
But what's different about this case was
the direction of the steering wheel.

683
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,393
Unlike most cases,

684
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,271
Kwak Do-seok turned the wheel

685
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,982
towards himself…

686
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,695
receiving most of the impact.

687
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,132
Step on it! I said, step on it, you idiot!

688
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,175
What a wimp.

689
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,594
Speed up, you punk!

690
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,596
-Fuck! Oh, gosh!
-Hey, Do-seok.

691
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,058
If we get caught,
we'll kill you first, motherfucker!

692
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,602
-Hell, yes.
-Fuck!

693
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:02,457
But we can still laugh, cheer,

694
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,085
and stand here at court.

695
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,222
Because we're alive.

696
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,310
I won't tell you
not to forget what happened.

697
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,647
But you should at least know,

698
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,151
regardless of the results of the trial,

699
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,656
how many lives…

700
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,704
you've sacrificed…

701
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,667
to be standing here today.

702
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,994
I'm sorry.

703
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,374
I came here to tell you this.

704
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,174
No, forget it. I don't need it.

705
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,261
Wait, after my son ended up like that,

706
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,597
I finally realized then

707
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,059
what he had done.

708
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,062
How and why…

709
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,651
For some people,
it may just be a story in the paper.

710
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,697
We'll be just defendants
and victims to them.

711
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:44,578
But, for us, they're a husband and a son.

712
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,208
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

713
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,086
I will never forget what my son did wrong

714
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,922
for the rest of my life.

715
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,180
I'll reflect on it
for the rest of my life.

716
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,932
I'm sorry.

717
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,560
I'm sorry.

718
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,356
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't apologize!

719
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,109
What's the point of all this now?

720
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,739
So what if he got beat up a little?

721
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,491
You can still go and see your son's face!

722
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,452
I can't see my husband anymore!

723
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,164
He's already dead!

724
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,626
Give me back my husband!

725
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,503
Bring my poor husband back to life!

726
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,509
Bring him back to life!
What did we do wrong?

727
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,940
I feel so bad for my kids.

728
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,403
What should I do? How do I go on living?

729

732
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,795
What is this?

733
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,048
That's my favorite book.

734
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,010
I underlined some of the passages,

735
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,178
so try reading those at least.

736
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,181
MY TEACHER'S DIARY BY KANG TAE-SOO

737
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,141
Thank you.

738
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,936
This is Do-seok's mom.

739
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:20,442
Do-seok wrapped this himself
to return it to you.

740
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,445
I'm finally returning it to you.

741
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,366
Thank you for everything.

742
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,377
"And Paul said,

743
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,296

I still have many things to teach you.'"

745

"What's important in life is a comma,
not a period.

746
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,518
So you don't need to be anxious."

747
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,231
"Anyone can make mistakes.

748
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,277
Mistakes

749
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,614
do not mean you've failed.

750
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,786
You can start over again at any time."

751
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,559
Do you think the ruling was a mistake?

752
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,979
Isn't it?

753
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,570
That's just how the law is.

754
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:34,075
The law doesn't protect every victim.

755
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,538
The law only makes judgments
based on evidence.

756
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,040
That's just how the law is.

757
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,917
You know that.

758
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,896
That's right.

759
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,524
That's just how

760
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,360
the law is.

761
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,257
You have many records to go over today.

762
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,677
You should go over this one quickly.

763
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,387
It's a gang rape case.

764
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,766
The case has been divided
into criminal and protection cases.

765
