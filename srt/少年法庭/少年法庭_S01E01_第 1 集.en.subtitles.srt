HANMI PHARMACY

00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,636
CAN WE MEET? UNDERAGE?
HOW'S 200,000 WON FOR THREE HOURS?

4
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,081
-Excuse me.
-My gosh…

5
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,792
I'm really sorry,
but can I borrow your phone?

6
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,043
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,923
Hi, I've lost my phone and--

8
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,591
Sorry, my phone is dead…

9
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,575
I'll be there soon. Yes.

10
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,953
I have to go.

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,580
Hey, kid.

12
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,707
Hold up.

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,298
What is this?

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,301
Is this blood?

15
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,971
No, it isn't…

16
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,347
I think it is.

17
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,641
What's your name?
What school do you go to?

18
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,185
Let's talk inside the police station.

19
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,231
I should take you to the hospital first.

20
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,316
Snap out of it.
You need to talk to me so I can help.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,359
No, I…

22
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,070
It's not that…

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,160
I got it! The roof of building 101!

24
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,494
Send in the task force!

25
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,037
We're on our way!

26
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,304
I killed someone…

27
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,434
What?

28
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,564
…with this.

29
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,119
ABOLISH THE JUVENILE ACT
AND SERVE MURDERERS JUSTICE

30
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,079
RAISE THE LEGAL THRESHOLD
FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS

31
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,167
The assailant who murdered
and mutilated an eight-year-old

32
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,171
has turned himself in
eight hours after committing the crime.

33
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,758
The culprit, Baek,
turned out to be a 13-year-old

34
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,011
who lived in the same apartment complex
as the victim.

35
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,598
Baek has already
been investigated by the police.

36
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,184
However, being under 14 years of age,

37
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,270
he is not subject
to the same laws as an adult.

38
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,689
There is growing controversy
surrounding his punishment.

39
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,191
You're not even human, you asshole!

40
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,957
There are 3,300 judges in Korea,

41
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,794
but only 20 of them work
in the juvenile court.

42
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,920
COURT

43
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:19,467
Those 20 judges meet
30,000 young offenders every year.

44
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:25,556
There are no prosecutors
in juvenile court, only assistants.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,351
The judge questions
the young offenders themselves

46
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,561
to decide the kind of probation
they will be put under.

47
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,190
And that's when their work really starts.

48
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,237
They need to see
if the young offender is adjusting well.

49
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,325
They need to make sure the young offender
doesn't run away or commit another crime.

50
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,329
The judge in charge needs
to constantly manage and supervise them.

51
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,831
That's strange.

52
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,709
Why does the judge do that
when the trial is over?

53
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,670
The purpose of the Juvenile Act is

54
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,090
to provide the proper environment
in which anti-social juveniles

55
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,175
can correct their behavior.

56
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:07,098
So it's the judge's duty
to manage and supervise them.

57
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,769
So the purpose of juvenile court
isn't to punish them?

58
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,941
Okay, we'll wrap up the interview
after one final question.

59
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,153
Why did you choose
to be a juvenile court judge?

60
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,620
There's only one reason.

61
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,041
Hatred.

62
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,251
Pardon?

63
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,922
I…

64
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,928
detest young offenders.

65
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,704
When will I get feedback on this?

66
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,457
-Is this what you wanted?
-Yes.

67
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,711
Being at a juvenile classification center
doesn't mean he'll have a criminal record.

68
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,046
It's not a prison, ma'am.

69
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,424
Most people think it's a detention center,

70
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,134
but it also counts as school attendance,

71
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,346
and they investigate the case further
and provide therapy…

00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,603
What? Which police station?

75
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,858
Yes, hello.
How can I help you this morning?

76
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,987
What?

77

00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,001
JUDGE'S CHAMBERS

79
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,466
Judge Sim Eun-seok?

80
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,804
Hello, I'm Woo Su-mi. I'm a manager here.

81
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,473
You're here earlier than expected.

82
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,683
This way, please.

83
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,734
You were informed that you'll be sharing
the room with another judge, right?

84
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,779
He's a male judge
by the name of Cha Tae-ju.

85
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,075
He spent all night
writing out his rulings.

86
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,744
He just went to go freshen up.

87
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,999
What about Mr. Kang?

88
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,710
Is he inside?

89
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,879
-Great work.
-Thank you.

90
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
-Good job.
-Great work.

91
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,673
Thanks.

92
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,384
Next week's shoot
has been postponed a week, right?

93
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,220
Yes. Today's footage should be enough
for the next two weeks.

94
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,973
Gosh, one of the associate judges
quit out of the blue.

95
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,392
We have cases coming in,
but not enough people.

96
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,518
It's driving me crazy.

97
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,856
You're going on air, judging trials,
and even volunteering.

98
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,774
I respect you, Judge Kang.

99
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,401
JUDGE KANG WHO GIVES AND VOLUNTEERS

100
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,030
Gosh. What a guy.

101
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,531
Sir!

102
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,826
The court called.
They need you right away.

103
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,622
Abolish the Juvenile Act!

104
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,707
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

105
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,501
Abolish the Juvenile Act!

106
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,294
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

107
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:27,256
Enforce harsher punishment
for young violent offenders!

108
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,299
-Enforce!
-Enforce!

109
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,634
Yes, sir.

110
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,053
Again?

111
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,515
How bad is the injury?

112
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,685
Yes, I understand.

113
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,357
Yes, he should be treated first.
Let me know when it's over. Thank you.

114
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,900
Okay.

115
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,735
JUVENILE CRIMINAL COLLEGIATE DIVISION

116
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,364
Excuse me.

117
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,991
Who are you?

118
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,787
Well, the thing is…

119
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,998
This isn't a place
where people can just come and go.

120
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,793
Who are you here to meet?

121
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,422
-The new associate judge coming in today.
-Do you mean Judge Sim Eun-seok?

122
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,841
Did you meet her?

123
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,719
I heard she was running a little late

124
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,888
because the transfer came out of the blue.

125
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,141
Did you have an appointment with her?

126
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,851
I don't need an appointment.

127
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,437
I am…

128
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,524
Sim Eun-seok.

129
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,946
I'm your senior,
so I can talk casually, right?

130
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,746
-Hey!
-My goodness.

131
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,872
What's wrong with you?

132
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,375
I told you not to call the TV station!

133
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,296
Didn't I tell you you'll jinx everything
if you keep calling from the court?

134
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,924
I'm walking on eggshells over there as is.

135
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,470
Are you going to take responsibility
if I get fired?

136
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,514
Mr. Kang. I told him to call you.

137
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,057
We received an urgent case.

138
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,684
What is it?

139
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,687
The Yeonhwa Child Murder Case
has come to us.

140
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,693
I'll tell the new associate judge
and Judge Tae-ju to gather in your room.

141
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,534
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE

142
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,714
Sir, you have a meeting
with the press arbitration commission

143
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,133
after this meeting.
What would you like to do for lunch?

144
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,354
You know about
the Yeonhwa Child Murder Case, right?

145
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,815
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

146
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,401
Ji-hu!

147
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,071
Ji-hu!

148
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,744
Ji-hu!

149
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,416
Ji-hu borrowed a phone from some older kid

150
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,294
because he needed to call his mom.

151
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,463
But the guy said he needed

152
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,674
to go home to charge it,

153
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,134
so Ji-hu followed him there.

154
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,811
The culprit is a 13-year-old minor

155
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,689
who lives in the same apartment complex
as the victim.

156
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
He has a small frame
with a height around 160 cm,

157
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,403
but he managed to strangle
the eight-year-old to death,

158
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:40,324
mutilated the body with a hatchet,
and disposed of the body.

159
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,245
He disposed some of the organs
and body parts in the food waste bin,

160
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,373
so they had to hold the funeral
without the body.

161
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,256
He had no resentment
and didn't even know the victim.

162
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,425
It happened in broad daylight

163
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,803
at an apartment complex near
a police station and an elementary school.

164
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,893
This is what juvenile crimes
are like these days.

165
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:15,025
Kidnapping, murder,
body mutilation, and disposal.

166
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,696
But the culprit is a young offender.

167
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,409
Even the maximum 20-year sentence
would cause an uproar.

168
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,829
Yet we can only sentence him
to two years in a juvenile reformatory

169
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,916
all because he's under the age of 14.

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,668
NAME: BAEK SEONG-U
13 YEARS OLD

171
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,379
We're definitely going to come under fire.

172
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,888
I've heard about you
since you were a trainee.

173
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,893
You surpassed all your male classmates
and entered the Central District Court.

174
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,854
And you even went overseas
for further training on top of that.

175
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,148
Seems like you're one of the elites.

176
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,109
Good luck on this case

177
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,862
since you were assigned as the judge.

178
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,156
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,455
The result may have already been decided,

180
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,209
but all eyes will be on us.

181
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,462
We have to be careful.

182
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,762
As you may have noticed,
things are different here

183
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,807
than they were
at the juvenile court you're from.

184
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,644
You were only in charge
of juvenile protection cases, right?

185
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,729
Here, at the Juvenile Criminal
Collegiate Division,

186
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,650
we do juvenile protection cases
as well as juvenile criminal cases.

187
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,570
The associate judge must read
about 80 cases per week,

188
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,949
so that's about 300 cases a month,
give or take.

189
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,912
Juvenile criminal cases
go through the collegial court

190
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,122
and the rulings are delivered to Mr. Kang.

191
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,668
Protection cases are done individually
according to the day of the week.

192
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,837
There are more unsolved cases
than I thought.

193
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,131
And here's the data you asked for.

194
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,804
And I'm sorry about earlier.

195
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,973
When I heard your name,

196
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,725
I was expecting a male judge.

197
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,478
Are you sure you're not disappointed
because I'm not a man?

198
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,730
Pardon?

199
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,149
Of course not.

200
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,360
Yes?

201
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,077
Nice to meet you.

202
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,746
I'm Joo Yeong-sil, a judicial mediator.

203
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,666
I'm Seo Beom, the assisting officer.

204
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,084
Okay.

205
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,677
Is this all
for the Yeonhwa Child Murder case?

206
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,554
Yes, it's quite a lot.

207
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,181
-The culprit's name's Baek Seong-u, right?
-Yes.

208
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,934
Let's book a date for the trial
as soon as possible.

209
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,146
It's not an ordinary case,
so contact the victim's family.

210
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,522
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,068
It's almost MJ time.

212
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,863
Mr. Kang won't be joining us
since he has other plans.

213
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,200
It's a tradition at our courthouse.

214
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,119
It's short for, "meal with the judges."

215
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,040
The kids who have been released,
the judge in charge,

216
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,709
and the staff all gather
to have lunch together.

217
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,503
We have a meal with the kids
and listen to their problems.

218
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,380
It has quite a positive effect on them.

219
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,090
Okay. Go ahead.

220
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,260
You have to come too.

221
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,554
The lunch will be meaningless

222
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,056
if you and Mr. Kang aren't there.

223
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,808
It's not like I sentenced the kids.

224
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,062
Caring for the kids after their release

225
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,481
is also one of the duties
of a Juvenile Court judge.

226
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,780
You may not have judged their trials,
but they're still your responsibility.

227
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,823
They'll be looking forward to it.

228
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,123
Do I have to go?

229
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,378
Are you giving up
on taekwondo for good, Do-seok?

230
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,879
Yes.

231
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,675
But I'm still looking
into becoming a security guard.

232
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,844
I already got a license
and passed the GED at the facility.

233
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,305
-I'm proud of you.
-Thank you.

234
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,017
Yu-ri. How's your grandmother?

235
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,104
She's doing a lot better.

236
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:24,358
I'm getting my paycheck soon.

237
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,070
I'll pay you back for the medicine
you bought for my grandma.

238
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,574
I heard you're going
to start training soon.

239
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,201
You don't need to pay me back.

240
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,036
Just give me a haircut someday.

241
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,162
Me?

242
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,415
Make me look like BTS.
You can do it, right?

243
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,291
I need to know how good you are, right?

244
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,672
You know, the director at the facility
has been complimenting you,

245
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,173
saying you turned over a new leaf.

246
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,594
Since you're now officially released,
how about we have a toast?

247
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,512
Okay.

248
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,471
Congratulations.

249
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,973
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

250
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,019
-I have to use the restroom.
-Sure.

251
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,314
He really adores them, doesn't he?

252
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,193
I think the kids know that.
They are very fond of him as well.

253
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,825
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure.

254
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,869
-Come with me.
-Thank you for the food.

255
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,247
Excuse me. Could you hold on a second?

256
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,838
I didn't do it! How many times
have I told you? It wasn't me!

257
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,425
You bumped into me in the bathroom.
That's when you stole my purse.

258
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,766
I did bump into you,
but I didn't steal it.

259
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,142
I swear!

260
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,104
It's fine.

262
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,357
I was willing to let it go
if you apologized.

263
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,359
This won't do.

264
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,488
I overheard
that you have criminal records.

265
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,117
-Call the police, now!
-Please just calm down, ma'am.

266
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,118
The police…

267
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,829
They do have criminal records, don't they?

268
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,539
Fuck.

269
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,957
"Fuck"?

270
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,875
Seol-ah.

271
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,418
I swear it wasn't me.

272
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,004
I didn't do it!

273
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,926
Please…

274
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,970
Please believe me. I didn't do it.

275
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,557
Let's just call the police.
This is a waste of time.

276
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,230
Judge Sim, she was released
just a few hours ago.

277
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,356
Exactly.

278
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,318
It's only been a few hours.

279
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
How dare she.

280
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,118
I won't go to the police station!
It wasn't me!

281
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,453
-It wasn't me!
-Seol-ah.

282
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,789
-I swear I didn't do it!
-Seol-ah, wait.

283
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,958
-I won't repeat myself.
-Calm down.

284
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,669
-Send her to the police station.
-It wasn't me!

285
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,929
Judge Sim.

286
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,889
Judge Sim!

287
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
Everyone's innocent until proven guilty.

288
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,604
What you did just now
disregarded her right to defend herself.

289
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,150
You could've heard her out.

290
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,569
Don't you care about her feelings?

291
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,987
Why should I?

292
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,324
How could she possibly prove
that she's innocent?

293
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,034
They'll assume she's guilty--

294
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,035
Could she…

295
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,496
really be innocent?

296
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,623
Judge Sim!

297
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,001
They found the wallet.

298
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,087
It was under the table next to them.
She must've dropped it.

299
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,926
Let's go. You can see for yourself.

300
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,891
You must have been upset.

301
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,856
Are you okay?

302
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,441
I'm so sorry, sir.

303
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,445
We should've looked more thoroughly.

304
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,779
I'm really sorry.

305
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,072
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

306
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,491
I told you it wasn't me.

307
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,124
I swore it wasn't me.

308
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,009
Apologize.

309
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,764
Apologize for suspecting me.

310
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,767
Apologize!

311
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,063
I don't think so.

312
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,774
Because…

313
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,652
I saw everything.

314
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,780
Left pocket.

315
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,415
You didn't do it, right?

316
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,876
It's okay. Just say so.

317
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,755
I didn't do it.

318
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,468
-Ms. Joo.
-Seol-ah.

319
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,262
Show us your pocket.

320
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,513
-I didn't do it!
-I know.

321
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,348
-I didn't do it!
-Seol-ah.

322
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,058
It wasn't me!

323
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,786
That's…

324
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,545
This is why I despise the likes of you.

325
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,010
Because you never change.

326
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,521
Turn her over to the police.

327
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,316
See you at the courthouse.

328
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,787
-Did you see Judge Sim's face?
-Yes.

329
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,498
Thank God we met as co-workers.

330
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,918
If I met her as a young offender,
I would've balled my eyes out.

331
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,338
No wonder they call her "Judge Max."

332
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,089
I'm sorry? "Judge Max"?

333
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,424
Yes, "Judge Max."

334
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,218
When she was the only judge
at the juvenile division,

335
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,637
she would give out
maximum sentences to young offenders.

336
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,889
Hence the nickname.

337
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,599
Kids these days are even saying,

338
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,518
"No matter what happens, avoid Judge Max."

339
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,023
According to the rumors, she always works
overtime and on the weekends.

340
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,609
Even the court's labor union
has its eyes on her.

341
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,611
In other words, we're totally screwed.

342
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,571
Gosh.

343
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,906
Get to work.

344
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,823
Okay.

345
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,501
I just came from the police station.

346
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,837
Don't trust the kids too much.
They're lying half of the time.

347
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,594
You shouldn't have cornered her like that
in front of all those people.

348
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,429
They're also human and they have rights.

349
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,932
Rights, my ass.

350
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,477
You think you're a good adult?

351
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,065
Kids like you and they open up to you.

352
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,528
But do you think
those kids also think you're a good adult?

353
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,072
I'm dying to know.

354
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,917
MIDDLE SCHOOL OR LOWER

355
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,043
ABSENT FOR OVER A WEEK

356
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,636
BROKEN FAMILY
PARENTS DIVORCED

357
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,012
SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLD

358
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,975
FIRST OFFENSE:
13 YEARS OLD, MURDER

359
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,603
DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA

360
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,021
HOSPITALIZED
MEDICINAL TREATMENT

361
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,363
I'm going to call it a day.

362
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,699
Okay.

363
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,326
I have to finish this up.

364
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,078
You go ahead.

365
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,041
I know what you said isn't wrong.

366
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,252
But I don't think…

367
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,047
I'm wrong either.

368
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,719
I'll see you tomorrow.

369
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,147
COURT IN SESSION

370
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,339
Name and date of birth.

371
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,093
Baek Seong-u. Born on November 30, 2008.

372
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,636
Where is his legal guardian?

373
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,263
Aren't they here?

374
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,806
She said she called.

375
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,808
Oh…

376
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,353
I got a call.
She said she's going to be late.

377
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,572
Well…

378
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,116
Tell me what happened.

379
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,245
Everything that happened
on the day of the murder.

380
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,539
If I'm being totally honest,

381
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,167
I was

382
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,294
seriously pissed that day.

383
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,552
I took my meds but I kept hearing voices.

384
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:19,846
Hey.

385
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,309
Can I borrow your phone?

386
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,644
I have to call my mom.

387
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,146
My phone's dead.

388
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,565
It'll only take a minute.

389
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,700
I took him home
using the phone as an excuse,

390
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,994
but once we got there,
the voices were gone.

391
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,538
I was going to send him home
because I felt bad for him.

392
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,082
But…

393
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,583
Hey!

394
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,671
This is a new game, right?

395
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,714
Can I please play this?

396
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,842
Can I try this VR game?

397
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,388
Goal!

398
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,973
I told him to go home,
but he kept blabbering on!

399
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,976
The voices were back
and I had a splitting headache.

400
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,235
We're going to play hide-and-seek.

401
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,779
Don't come out until I find you, okay?

402
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,658
If you don't, I will kill you.

403
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,536
Got it?

404
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,163
And at home?

405
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,749
Wasn't anyone there?

406
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,459
I'm usually home alone.

407
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,544
FAMILY RELATIONS

408
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,254
Mom's busy teaching at the academy.

409
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,470
Would you like to hear something funny?

410
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,278
Guess where that kid was hiding?

411
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,160
Ji-hu.

412
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,874
Ji-hu.

413
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,215
Ji-hu.

414
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,828
I found you.

415
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,336
You had to see his face.

416
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,966
That fucking asshole…

417
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,859
I heard kids under 14

418
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,612
don't go to prison
even if they kill someone.

419
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,989
Is that true?

420
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,330
That's awesome.

421
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,005
Where…

422
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,260
Court's dismissed.

423
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,136
-Ma'am.
-Your Honor.

424
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,888
What happened to Seong-u?

425
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,599
Where is he?

426
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,686
Are you Seong-u's mother?

427
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,603
Yes.

428
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,855
You're late.

429
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,816
Yes, I had to work.

430
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,193
Work?

431
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,490
I heard on the news
that he won't have to go to prison.

432
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,660
How long will he be staying
at the Juvenile Classification Center?

433
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,080
Have you met the victim's family?

434
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,208
No.

435
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,254
Apologize to them.

436
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,433
What a difficult case.
Both the kid and his mom.

437
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,562
People tend to show
their true nature when they're cornered.

438
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,899
That's why humans are evil.

439
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,368
Judge Sim, Ji-hu's mom is here.

440
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,000
I heard he's a young offender.

441
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,003
Is it true

442
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,589
that he won't go to prison?

443
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,385
How is someone so young

444
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,971
capable of murder?

445
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,432
How can someone

446
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,478
cut off another person's limbs?

447
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,065
But how come

448
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,567
he won't go to prison for it?

449
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,325
Ma'am.

450
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,870
Ji-hu keeps appearing in my dreams.

451
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,706
And he just cries.

452
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,043
He doesn't say anything.

453
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,546
He just cries, Your Honor.

454
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:55,014
At Ji-hu's first birthday party,
he grabbed the yarn.

455
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,809
But that yarn…

456
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,229
was a hand-me-down from his older brother.

457
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,648
So it was a little worn out.

458
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,320
Could it be because of that?

459
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,451
Was that the reason why poor Ji-hu…

460
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,373
It's all my fault.

461
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,168
It's all my fault.

462
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,516
These are Ji-hu's favorite dishes.

463
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,728
I heard you can't accept anything else.

464
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:06,961
Thank you.

465
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,721
HANWOOL DAILY
REPORTER KIM HYEONG-JUN

466
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,808
I think that's enough for the interview.

467
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,145
Gosh, this is too much.

468
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,481
You're making me uneasy, Mr. Kim.

469
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,523
Gosh.

470
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,110
You made time for us
during your busy schedule.

471
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,362
Of course we should treat you
to something nice.

472
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,740
-Thanks.
-You'll be hearing good news soon.

473
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,243
Good news?

474
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,996
Maybe I shouldn't have.

475
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,207
Should I tell you?

476
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,754
I heard this from a colleague
who's a political correspondent.

477
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,300
The Liberty Party is looking for
a new candidate for the upcoming election

478
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,844
and they have you in mind.

479
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,515
You're pretty well-known

480
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,934
since you're on TV,
and now in charge of a big case.

481
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,603
Just make sure
to wrap this case up quietly.

482
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,480
I'll set up a meeting.

483
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,560
YUN JI-HU

484
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,275
These are Ji-hu's favorite dishes.

485
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,694
I heard you can't accept anything else.

486
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,861
YUN JI-HU

487
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,063
Enforce harsher punishment
for young violent offenders!

488
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,232
-Enforce!
-Enforce!

489
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,651
Abolish the Juvenile Act!

490
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,070
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

491
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,072
You sent the file?

492
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,866
Okay. I'll relay it
to Judge Sim right away.

493
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,993
Okay.

494
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,956
Baek Seong-u is already undergoing
his second therapy session.

495
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,083
Judge Sim wanted me to find her a file.

496
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,627
It's information
on the Yeonhwa Child Murder case.

497
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,971
So you're saying you're still
suffering from schizophrenia?

498
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,015
Yes.

499
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,184
Lying will only make things worse.

500
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,270
I know.

501
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,107
So the motive for your crime
was schizophrenia?

502
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,109
Yes.

503
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:44,071
You admit luring the boy to your house,
murdering him

504
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,948
and mutilating his body?

505
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,491
Yes.

506
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,953
Why'd you turn yourself in?

507
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,499
Because you're a young offender?

508
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
Goddamnit.

509
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,088
Yes!

510
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,468
Here.

511
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,568
SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER
ANXIETY, NEUROSIS

512
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,119
You…

513
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,752
didn't do it, did you?

514
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,222
There are many symptoms of schizophrenia.

515
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,601
Some believe
there's someone trying to hurt them.

516
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:59,146
Others hear things, see things,
smell things and even feel things.

517
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,400
The problem is
the symptoms are different for everyone.

518
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,110
But what they all have in common is

519
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,905
there's no cure for schizophrenia.

520
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,077
It's hard for them to concentrate
on something for long periods of time.

521
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,831
But…

522
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,293
if they commit murder?

523
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,799
Schizophrenics usually get caught
red-handed without cleaning up the scene.

524
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,345
Cleaning up a crime scene
requires high concentration

525
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,556
so it causes a lot of stress.

526
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,392
But not only
did you clean the crime scene,

527
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:40,438
you lured the kid, planned the murder,
mutilated, and disposed of the corpse!

528
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,190
And you say
that schizophrenia made you do it.

529
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,027
Did you get any better?

530
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,280
ADDITIONAL PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS ADMINISTERED

531
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,951
There are two reasons
why criminals hide their motives.

532
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,413
One is when things are unfavorable to them

533
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,583
and the other is when there's…

534
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,378
another perpetrator involved in the crime.

535
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,551
But you're using
the Juvenile Act as a shield.

536
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,262
Everything seems favorable to you.

537
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,223
Then it has to be the other reason.

538
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,018
Damn it.

539
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,979
There's another perpetrator…

540
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,234
who's involved in this crime.

541
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,530
Can I borrow your phone?
I have to call my mom.

542
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,380
No!

543
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,424
Not her!

544
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,635
She has nothing to do with this.

545
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,261
I'm telling you.

546
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,388
She has nothing to do with this.

547
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,849
I knew something was off.

548
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,269
Why would the victim
follow a stranger to their house

549
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,481
even if he had to use the phone urgently?

550
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,901
And if you were going to turn yourself in,

551
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,904
why would you dispose of the body?

552
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,823
-Murder, body mutilation, and disposal!
-Baek Seong-u.

553
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,369
You haven't done any of it.

554
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,876
Judge Sim. The information you wanted.

555
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,056
HAN YE-EUN
MOM

556
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,061
It's her, isn't it?

557
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,626
I told you

558
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,795
lying would only…

559
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,339
make things worse.

560
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,551
Call his legal guardian

561
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,014
and send him back
to the Juvenile Classification Center.

562
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,849
Fuck!

563
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,891
No!

564
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,728
She has nothing to do with this!

565
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,813
I want to go home!

566
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,981
Fuck!

567
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,319
What do you mean?

568
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,655
Just quit if you're going to
spew such nonsense.

569
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,992
Do you think we're the police?
Why are you stepping over the line?

570
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,869
Everything fits.

571
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,662
We need to check.

572
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,706
Do you think the police are stupid?

573
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,666
Handing over the case
without looking into it?

574
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,834
He turned himself in.

575
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,004
He had the murder weapon
and was suffering from schizophrenia.

576
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,798
They trusted his confession.

577
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,384
But they're wrong.

578
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,511
There's an accomplice.

579
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,016
Baek Seong-u couldn't have done this alone
because of his schizophrenia.

580
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,225
Do you have proof?

581
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,227
Phone and text records
around the time of murder.

582
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,812
Elevator footage of the victim

583
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,690
and someone with the same school uniform
as Baek Seong-u.

584
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,067
Baek Seong-u's doctor's referral.

585
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
Do you need more?

586
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,911
So you want to send the case
back to the police?

587
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,704
The whole nation is focused on this case.

588
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,790
The press already has
all their stories out.

589
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,125
Do you really think
the police will admit their own fault?

590
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,961
I'll go catch her myself.

591
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,004
You're a judge!

592
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,924
It is also a judge's duty
to get to the bottom of a case

593
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,133
through due process.

594
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,469
It might be
a juvenile protection case right now,

595
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,263
but if there's an accomplice
over the age of 14,

596
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,600
it's becomes a juvenile criminal case.

597
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,727
As the only juvenile
criminal court with jurisdiction,

598
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,937
you want to cover it up?

599
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,357
And what if you're wrong?
What if you screw everything up?

600
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,358
I'll be responsibe.

601
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,984
Like shit you will! What the hell…

602
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,948
Just shut up
and proceed with the trial by the book.

603
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,118
-Sir!
-We can't afford to make such a scene!

604
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,953
Do you understand? I'm…

605
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,748
I'm giving you a direct order.

606
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,173
Leave. Get out of my sight.

607
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,262
Get out!

608
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,652
What the hell…

609
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,489
WILL SEVERELY PUNISH
YEONHWA CHILD MURDER CASE CULPRIT

610
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,700
ACCORDING TO YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
JUDGE KANG WON-JUNG

611
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,618
You're pretty well-known

612
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,455
since you're on TV,
and now in charge of a big case.

613
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,834
Just make sure
to wrap this case up quietly.

614
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,754
Damn it.

615
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,348
I agree with Mr. Kang.

616
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,935
It's just too risky.

617
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,228
If this gets out,

618
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,856
Han Ye-eun's personal information
will be all over the place.

619
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,608
But what if she didn't do it?

620
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,403
The court will be destroying her family.

621
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,741
Proceed with Baek Seong-u's trial first.

622
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,785
-Then investigate later--
-Later when?

623
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,245
After the victim's parents are dead?

624
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,331
Should we do it then?

625
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,583
-Judge Sim.
-Please.

626
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,504
Let's earn our keep.

627
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,436
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE

628
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,982
YUN JI-HU

629
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,249
COURT

630
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,005
And what if you're wrong?
What if you screw everything up?

631
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,092
The court will be destroying her family.

632
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,939
What are you doing here?

633
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,109
I've been looking for you all over.

634
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,372
Let's catch the accomplice.

635
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,878
We need proof to convince Mr. Kang.

636
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,881
What's with you all of a sudden?

637
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,923
Because…

638
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,302
I found some confidence.

639
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,639
Thank you.

640
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,391
Detective Ko.

641
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:16,852
Hello.

642
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,812
Hello, Mr. Cha.

643
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,565
I was hoping to ask you
some questions about Baek Seong-u.

644
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,525
Oh, Baek Seong-u?

645
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,071
Could you tell me what happened
when he turned himself in?

646
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,243
The first time I saw him was
in front of the police station.

647
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,871
He seemed very nervous.

648
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,122
Let's talk inside.

649
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,042
He didn't seem like
he was going to turn himself in at first.

650
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,251
But, how do I say this…

651
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,296
It's like he changed all of a sudden.

652
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,841
I killed someone.

653
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,219
His expression changed
in the blink of an eye.

654
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,013
Wait.

655
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,932
-Sorry?
-There.

656
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,187
What is he looking at?

657
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,482
Is it possible to see
the footage from the other side?

658
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,880
To be honest,
I'll never understand the way

659
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,675
you treat young offenders.

660
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,346
But if a trial is held in our court

661
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,890
only for that boy

662
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,142
when there's an accomplice,

663
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,145
that's an insult to our court.

664
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,356
Which is a whole other issue.

665
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,405
I'll help you.

666
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,909
I'm also an associate judge after all.

667
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,502
It won't be easy for you to do this alone.

668
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:10,298
You don't know where the kids are from
or what kind of networks they have formed.

669
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,844
Han Ye-eun dropped out
of Yeonju Girls' High as a freshman.

670
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:18,724
Then who else went to Yeonju Girls' High
among the cases we handled?

671
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:24,021
WOO SEOL-AH
ADMITTED: DEC 21, 2021

672
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,897
You never know, right?

673
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,484
How things turn out, I mean.

674
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,945
I don't want to.

675
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,197
I won't help.

676
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,741
Please, Seol-ah.

677
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,162
Have I ever asked you for anything before?

678
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,247
Just this once.

679
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,046
Han Ye-eun frequents
an internet cafe on Juseong-ro.

680
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,505
You have a driver's license, right?

681
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,801
I'm still making payments on it…

682
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,512
I'll head over to Han Ye-eun's place.

683
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,057
She's probably be waiting
for Baek Seong-u to message her.

684
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,550
Are you out of your mind?

685
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,094
What do you think you're doing?

686
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,305
Please let my Seong-u go. Please.

687
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,848
Please let him go.

688
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,393
I gave birth to him.
I know him better than anyone.

689
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,271
Every parent who comes here
says the exact same thing.

690
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,782
Please let him go!

691
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,244
Move.

692
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,912
I won't ask again!

693
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,377
Please let him go.

694
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,838
So get out of the way!

695
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,975
-Who the hell are you?
-Sorry.

696
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,607
What do you think you're doing?

697
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,359
We received a tip that a young offender
we're looking for is here.

698
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,528
-Please cooperate.
-Are you with the police?

699
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,532
You can call them if you want.

700
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,121
You do know that it's illegal
to have minors here after 10 p.m., right?

701
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,459
You could be sentenced up to two years
in prison and fined up to 20 million won.

702
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,170
It's up to you.

703
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,380
You just need to catch the kid, right?

704
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,677
Do judges go looking for kids these days?

705
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,273
Call the probation office.

706
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,776
Did you find her? Is Han Ye-eun there?

707
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,487
I Sens Internet Cafe on Juseong-ro.
Come now.

708
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,794
You know Baek Seong-u, right?

709
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,965
Who are you?

710
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,050
I'm the judge in charge of his trial.

711
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,429
I could call the police and make a scene,

712
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,099
but I'm doing you a favor.

713
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,310
Come quietly.

714
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,028
-Are you okay?
-What the hell?

715
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,155
Who the hell was that?

716
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,459
My goodness!

717
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,461
It's all ruined!

718
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,812
-Mister, go! Go now!
-What the hell?

719
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,189
-Go!
-This taxi has been reserved!

720
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,135
Move it!

721
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,551
I…

722
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,137
detest…

723
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,683
young offenders.

724
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,503
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

725
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:37,050
