1
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:21,396
For example,
Moonkwang High School, Grade 12, Class 1.

2
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,231
Kang Sin-u.

3
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,120
Why don't you just…

4
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,166
turn yourself in, Mr. Kang.

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,127
No.

6
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,421
Kang Sin-u's father.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
Honey.

8
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,517
You should go.

9
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,145
I'd prefer to talk

10
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,898
tomorrow at work.

11
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,540
Okay.

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,169
I'll talk to you at the office.

13
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,993
You should report it yourself

14
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,453
to the chief judge.

15
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,623
STUDENT RECORD
GRADE 12 CLASS 1 KANG SIN-U

16
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,973
We must be wrong.

17
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,769
There must be something
we don't know about.

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,438
If this is all true,

19
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,901
Mr. Kang wouldn't have been chosen
for this case to begin with.

20
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,820
Didn't you see how flustered he was?

21
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,114
Defending him won't help.

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,366
I'm just saying we need to be careful.

23
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,118
Are you sure you're not in denial?

24
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,705
But the trial tomorrow--

25
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,125
There won't be a trial.

26
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,212
It'll be assigned to another department.

27
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,254
Judge Sim.

28
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,798
I get where you're going with this,
but please!

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,596
I want some silence.

30
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,786
Where's Mr. Kang?

31
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,081
I think he came to work, but I'm not…

32
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,050
Judge Sim, the trial schedule
still hasn't changed.

33
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,301
What?

34
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,387
It can't be…

35
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,601
10:00, OBSTRUCTION OF BUSINESS, ROOM 201
KANG WON-JUNG, SIM EUN-SEOK, CHA TAE-JU

36
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,852
Come in.

37
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,650
You're not dressed yet.
I thought the trial was at ten today.

38
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,862
Well, today's trial could be postponed.

39
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,073
Mr. Kang has already
changed into his robes.

40
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,491
What?

41
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,369
Come in.

42
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,964
Yes. What's going on?

43
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,258
I should be asking you that.

44
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,052
Have you not told the Chief Judge yet?

45
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,472
Gosh, you're so straitlaced.

46
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,059
There are 18 juveniles.

47
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,439
There are over 40 people
including guardians and witnesses.

48
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:20,194
These people had to take
a day off from work to be here.

49
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,904
So…

50
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,949
how can we just cancel the trial?

51
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,746
The case will be assigned
to another justice department.

52
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,709
I think telling them as soon as possible
would be more considerate.

53
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,920
Didn't you cross enough lines

54
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,924
at the hospital already?

55
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,974
Change into your robes.

56
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,037
During the last trial, I announced
that we will be quick and thorough

57
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,373
as this case is receiving
much public attention.

58
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,792
Today's trial will also be quick.

59
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,587
Mr. Kang.

60
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,173
Prosecution, please go ahead.

61
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,719
Under Article 18, Section 1,
Clause 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act,

62
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,554
we demand
a different collegiate for trial.

63
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,435
Your reasoning?

64
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,938
The prosecution requested
Ms. Han Ji-won, an important witness

65
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,358
who first suspected that the papers
were leaked by the teaching director.

66
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,570
However, the court refused
to accept any faculty members,

67
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,490
including Ms. Han Ji-won,
as witnesses without reasonable cause.

68
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,411
Therefore, we challenge the fairness
of the current collegiate.

69
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,084
The prosecution's challenge
seems to be made

70
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,002
with the purpose
of delaying the trial process

71
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,504
without any special reason.

72
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,298
It's dismissed according to
Article 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

73
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,093
Your Honor!
We were just saying the witness--

74
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,136
Dismissed.

75
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,560
Prosecution, please go ahead.

76
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,570
-Prosecution, can't you hear me?
-Court will be adjourned for an hour.

77
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,908
-Judge Sim.
-Silence!

78
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,620
The court will be adjourned for an hour
as the trial is not proceeding smoothly.

79
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,669
Are you out of your mind?

80
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,715
You're just an associate judge!

81
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,927
You should be disciplined for this!

82
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,057
How dare you adjourn
the court without my permission?

83
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,351
This trial is being rushed.

84
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,064
What did you say?

85
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,775
The reason for the prosecution's challenge
was convincing.

86
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,571
Our court is obligated to explain
the reasons for the witness selection.

87
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,782
Why are you rushing the trial?

88
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,910
What gives you the right?

89
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,247
Have you forgotten what I told you

90
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,751
at the hospital?

91
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,878
Judge Sim!

92
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,046
I can't let you…

93
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,424
hold such a rushed trial.

94
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,303
I'm reporting this to the chief judge.

95
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Do you have proof?

96
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,728
Was my son's name
on the teaching director's list

97
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,775
that the prosecution submitted?

98
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,069
Or…

99
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,574
do you have proof
that my son was a part of Descartes?

100
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,995
Not circumstantial evidence.

101
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,540
Real hard evidence

102
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,125
that my son was involved

103
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,212
or a witness.

104
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,218
You don't, do you?

105
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,817
Go.

106
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,988
Go and report it to him.

107
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,242
I will…

108
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,956
end you.

109
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,677
There are things

110
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,764
I've been planning for a long time.

111
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,354
If you want to stop me,

112
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,274
bring me a reliable witness…

113
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,737
or some hard evidence.

114
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,913
I doubt that you'll find any.

115
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,477
Judge Sim, are you--

116
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,177
I thought you went home.

117
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,012
No, I just…

118
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,187
I've been…

119
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,901
thinking about it.

120
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,200
Why don't we just stop here?

121
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,375
Frankly, everything Mr. Kang said is true.

122
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,130
Our job is to judge, not to investigate
what the prosecution might have missed.

123
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,717
The court doesn't have the authority
to investigate or prosecute.

124
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,555
Besides…

125
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,434
we don't have any hard evidence.

126
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:12,148
And he's still our colleague and boss.

127
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,777
We shouldn't be doubting him…

128
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,825
and digging for information.

129
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,580
It makes me uncomfortable.

130
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,217
Right.

131
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,307
I guess you could feel that way.

132
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,814
You can quit the trial then.

133
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,528
-I think that's the right thing to do.
-What about you?

134
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,240
I'll take care of myself.

135
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,651
MOONKWANG HIGH ALLOWS STUDENTS
INVOLVED IN EXAM LEAK TO DROP OUT

136
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,487
Do not allow students to drop out!

137
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,322
-Do not allow!
-Do not allow!

138
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,991
Apologize to the students who suffered!

139
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,827
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

140
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,954
They shouldn't be allowed to drop out!

141
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:50,996
Moonkwang High?

142
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,082
It's such a shame.

143
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,882
Only kids with outstanding grades are
in the A level of our academy.

144
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,636
As you can see,
all the boys here are from Moonkwang High.

145
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,265
It's a miracle that a regular high school
sends 30 to 40 students

146
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,724
to prestigious colleges every year.

147
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,269
That's what makes this even sadder.

148
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,231
The 18 children who received
the leaked papers dropped out yesterday.

149
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
Allow me to explain.

150
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,445
These are the students.

151
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,157
Your grades drop to zero
if you're expelled,

152
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,450
so you have a lot to lose.

153
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,244
But dropping out is different.

154
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,706
All your extracurricular grades
are still intact when you leave.

155
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,623
I see.

156
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,375
The necessary grades for early admission

157
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,168
can be replaced with top GED scores.

158
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,671
And if you add
the extracurricular grades to that,

159
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,007
you'll be at an advantage
if you're aiming for SNU.

160
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,928
So they're not losing anything
despite receiving the exam answer sheets.

161
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,180
But do you know
what the biggest problem is?

162
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,517
Right here. The students that are left.

163
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,312
Students who get good grades,
but come from poor families.

164
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,980
Because of the recent events,

165
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,566
all the students
will be retaking the exams.

166
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,819
The total number of students
have decreased because of the dropouts,

167
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,488
and the exams are evaluated relatively.

168
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,574
What the hell, man?

169
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,075
So the remaining students need to

170
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,829
put their lives on the line and compete
with each other again to get on top.

171
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,542
Students who are well off can get
tutoring and prepare for the test,

172
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,628
but what about those who can't afford it?

173
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,297
Early admissions will be open soon,

174
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,966
so they're busy preparing
their personal statements and interviews.

175
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,093
But now they have to retake the test too.

176
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,720
It's a bolt out of the blue.

177
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:34,141
Everything they prepared for will go down
the drain because of those other kids.

178
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,061
But still,

179
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,564
The school shouldn't be allowing this.

180
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:47,237
STUDY CAFE, MATH ACADEMY,
STUDY ROOMS, ENGLISH ACADEMY

181
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,449
This isn't just a matter of ethics.

182
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,162
These children's futures are being
trampled on by the selfishness of adults.

183
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,334
That darn school…

184
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,295
They allowed the students
who cheated to drop out.

185
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,090
What's the point
in retaking the exams now?

186
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,925
The trust in the public education system

187
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,136
and fairness weren't the only problems.

188
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,143
The kids who dropped out
will have a leg up getting into college.

189
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:23,524
While the innocent students are the ones
who have been affected by this.

190
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,695
The trial has already lost all fairness.

191
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,990
The perpetrator and the children involved
weren't even mentioned.

192
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,994
Everything's a mess.

193
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,162
Should we…

194
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,541
still stop?

195
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,300
How's the trial? Is it going well?

196
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,888
I think it'll end well, thanks to you.

197
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,977
What did I tell you?

198
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,854
I told you everything will be fine.

199
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,774
Well, the teaching director
kept it under wraps in the first place,

200
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,569
and my son got out
before it became a problem,

201
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,448
so there's no proof against him.

202
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,868
It's just their grades.
They're making such a big deal out of it.

203
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,494
It's the press that's the problem.

204
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,788
If this isn't sensationalizing,
I don't know what is.

205
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,956
Gosh.

206
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,586
You're right.

207
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,668
But there's no other way.

208
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,712
We don't have any proof or witnesses.

209
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,049
Proof.

210
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,759
Witness.

211
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,845
Do we really have nothing?

212
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,223
Nothing at all?

213
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,609
I had a great time being on this show.

214
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,860
CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES

215
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,278
It's such a shame.

216
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,738
Though I'll be leaving,

217
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,952
I hope you continue to watch
Current Events N Issues.

218
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,122
Yes, thank you for everything, Mr. Kang.

219
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,540
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

220
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,000
And that's it for today's
Current Events N Issues.

221
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,918
Thank you.

222
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,711
Great work, everyone.

223
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,754
Thank you!

224
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,713
Great job.

225
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,382
-Great work.
-Good job.

226
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,384
-Great work, everyone.
-You too.

227
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,219
A job well done!

228
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,096
-Great work!
-Great work!

229
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,226
It was such an honor, Mr. Kang.

230
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,186
Gosh, you didn't have to…

231
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,897
Thank you for being with us
for over two years.

232
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,940
Thank you.

233
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,368
Our director made a reservation
at a fancy restaurant.

234
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,536
Come with us, Mr. Kang.

235
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,455
The second round will be on me then.

236
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,751
Give him a round of applause!
You heard him.

237
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,920
-Let's clean up quickly, okay?
-Yes, sir.

238
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,714
Yes. We're having meat!

239
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,635
ASSISTING OFFICER SEO

240
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,682
Hey. What is it?

241
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,453
I heard you wanted to see me.

242
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,664
Is it true?

243
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,297
As per Lee Seok-hyeon's claim,
we've managed to--

244
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,798
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

245
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,639
Didn't I make myself clear?

246
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,600
We do not investigate.

247
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,519
I told you to drop it.

248
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,942
How dare you bring this
to the chief judge?

249
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,984
Mr. Kang.

250
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,070
She even came to the hospital!

251
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,490
On top of my son being hospitalized,

252
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,492
she tells me, her superior,
to turn myself in.

253
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,994
She came to me
solely based on what some kid said.

254
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,288
She doesn't have any proof or witnesses!

255
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,959
I do…

256
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,878
have proof.

257
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,134
I have proof.

258
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,476
Look here, Judge Sim.

259
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,938
I've checked the files we have
on that case a million times,

260
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,856
including the ones from the prosecution.

261
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,277
No matter what record you look at…

262
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,989
there's no proof or witnesses.

263
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,865
Of course, there isn't.

264
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,202
Because it's a confession.

265
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,707
Moonkwang High, class 1, senior…

266
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,210
Kang Sin-u.

267
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,800
He confessed today.

268
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,810
If this is your first time,
you'll be a first-time offender.

269
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,563
And if you confess,

270
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,692
the prosecution will handle it
as a protection case.

271
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,403
I can guarantee that.

272
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,031
Just because you're taking
a detour for a year or two,

273
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,033
doesn't mean your life is over.

274
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,701
I know.

275
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,413
So I was going to confess, but…

276
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,414
But?

277
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,752
Because of your dad?

278
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:21,423
I'd be betraying him.

279
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,758
Think again.

280
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,970
You won't be betraying your dad.

281
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,057
It's your friends.

282
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,518
Everyone makes mistakes.

283
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,356
But the most important thing…

284
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,859
is what happens after.

285
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,362
What you do after that

286
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,990
will determine who you'll become.

287
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,993
Think about it.

288
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,997
Think about who you want to be
with this decision.

289
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,458
Sim Eun-seok!

290
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,005
This is a load of nonsense.

291
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,553
You've been disgracing me
since the last trial, and now this?

292
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:14,101
Chief, I'm terribly sorry about this.
It's all my fault.

293
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,812
Hey. Come out right now.

294
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,022
That's enough.

295
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,941
Chief.

296
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,110
Chief, it's…

297
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,578
Just give me a day.

298
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,750
I need some time to think.

299
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,463
Okay.

300
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:54,057
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
CHIEF JUDGE'S OFFICE

301
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,646
Why are you doing this?

302
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,151
Why?

303
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,738
Go ahead.

304
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,259
Just once.

305
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,681
It was just once.

306
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,144
There was something I had to do.

307
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,270
I know.

308
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
JUVENILE ACT REVISION BOARD
PRESIDING JUDGE KANG WON-JUNG

309
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,497
STUDY ON REVISING AND IMPROVING
THE JUVENILE ACT

310
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:04,085
I heard you've been preparing to revise
the Juvenile Act for the past five years.

311
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,131
You worked on it harder than anyone.

312
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,928
That's why you want to join
the National Assembly.

313
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,348
You're even giving up being a judge.

314
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,815
Stop denying it
and at least take a look at the data.

315
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,109
Look at the ratio of violent crimes
from young offenders.

316
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,445
They should be met
with harsher punishment.

317
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,573
Our priority is to raise
the quality of the protection they receive

318
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,950
with increased resources.

319
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,620
That way, we can prevent crimes
and prevent repeat offenders.

320
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,374
Do you know how many kids
a single probation officer handles?

321
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,543
It's over 100 kids.

322
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:50,924
Juvenile crimes are
being portrayed as violent by the press.

323
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,802
Society has no concrete plans.

324
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,846
They just keep insisting
that we abolish the Juvenile Act.

325
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,850
Law isn't the problem. It's the system.

326
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,104
Out of all the developed countries,

327
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,899
we have the least amount
of resources and facilities.

328
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,110
So if someone has to do it,

329
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,322
it has to be someone who knows
the ins and outs of the Juvenile Act.

330
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,241
There's even a study
from the US that shows

331
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,660
that the rate of repeat offenses
among juveniles have risen

332
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,078
despite a harsher punishment.

333
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,665
The thing we should focus on
with juvenile offenders is rehabilitation!

334
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,670
Five years.

335
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,173
I prepared for over five years.

336
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,929
I was confident I'd do well.

337
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,313
But…

338
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,612
you screwed it up.

339
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,626
Who was the Juvenile Act made for?

340
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,671
For the children, of course.

341
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,715
What about the victims of Moonkwang High?

342
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,143
How could you trample on those children

343
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,064
to revise a law that was made for them?

344
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,235
Do you even know

345
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,364
what the students at Moonkwang High

346
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,700
are going through

347
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,536
right now?

348
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,919
Should we still stop?

349
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,547
No, we shouldn't.

350
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,346
Juvenile judges deal with children.

351
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,435
If we remain in denial of our roles,
it's them who are affected.

352
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,649
Even if everyone else stops, we shouldn't.

353
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,652
We are…

354
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,032
the last line of defense for those kids.

355
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,830
They say you shouldn't steal a candle
to read the Bible.

356
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,833
If the means are corrupt,

357
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,837
its purpose is also tainted.

358
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,635
Judge Cha once asked me…

359
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,974
if I keep a case journal.

360
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,730
He said that you do

361
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,775
and that not only
do you write about the case,

362
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,737
you also write
what you regret about the trial.

363
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,574
You record over
300 cases a month in your journal

364
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,703
and reflect back on them.

365
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,833
And you probably decided
to revise the Juvenile Act

366
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,336
when you were writing your journal.

367
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,676
But…

368
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,014
Mr. Kang.

369
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,978
In that journal
you've been keeping for 22 years…

370
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,566
what will you write…

371
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,031
about your last case?

372
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,837
So just admit it.

373
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,302
You should be punished
for what you did wrong.

374
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,390
Whether it's a child…

375
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,062
or a judge.

376
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,917
NO ACCESS OUTSIDE VISITING HOURS

377
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,110
Chief.

378
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,865
It's me, Kang Won-jung.

379
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,787
JUVENILE CRIMINAL COLLEGIATE DIVISION

380
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,623
May I ask who you are?

381
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,375
We're from the Ethics Committee.

382
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,919
We have consent from Mr. Kang.
Did he call you?

383
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,629
Hold on.

384
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,092
Wait. Hold on!

385
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,969
This incident caused
great shock, anger, and distrust

386
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,471
to students who studied hard

387
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,224
and the parents who supported them.

388
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,477
However, he did not participate
in the leak continuously,

389
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,605
and he showed an attitude
of reflection by confessing,

390
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,399
so the disposition is as follows.

391
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,987
The public is enraged
after the confession of

392
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,198
Presiding Judge Kang Won-jung
of Yeonhwa District Court

393
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,659
regarding the Moonkwang
Exam Paper Leak Scandal.

394
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,873
The Liberty Party excluded
Judge Kang Won-jung from the by-election.

395
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,459
Many civil groups have filed a complaint

396
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,588
and a disciplinary committee will be held
at the Supreme Court this afternoon.

397
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,064
SUPREME COURT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

398
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,627
Isn't Mr. Kang coming to the courthouse
today to pack up his belongings?

399
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,506
-I think he said two o'clock.
-Yes.

400
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,509
Shouldn't we go and say goodbye?

401
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,885
We should.

402
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,430
Judge Sim told me we should.

403
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,349
She asked us to see him off

404
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,352
since she has a trial today.

405
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,686
Right, she's busy.

406
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,357
What was the result
of the disciplinary action?

407
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,817
The disposition is as follows.

408
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,655
Regarding the grading of students
that should have been conducted fairly,

409
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,033
you deprived students
of the opportunity to compete fairly.

410
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,953
Not only did you interfere
with the exam process,

411
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,414
but you also destroyed the public's trust
in public education.

412
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:30,211
But you only attempted
to obtain the exam papers,

413
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,171
but never actually did.

414
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,424
Repenting for what you've done
will also be taken into account.

415
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,761
Lee Seok-hyeon, you will do
120 hours of volunteer work

416
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,849
and will be on long term probation
for two years.

417
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,935
I hereby sentence probations
one, three, and five.

418
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,609
-It's over, Seok-hyeon. Let's go.
-This way.

419
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,744
Okay. Let's part ways here.

420
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,205
-Head back inside.
-Mr. Kang.

421
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,082
We should still walk you to your car.

422
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,458
Take care, sir.

423
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,670
-Take care.
-Thank you.

424
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,381
Goodbye, sir.

425
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,388
Thank you for everything.

426
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,765
For putting up
with such an ill-tempered boss.

427
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,392
-No, of course not.
-No.

428
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,310
Bye.

429
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,871
How many cases do we have left?

430
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,331
We have quite a bit today.

431
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,167
We still have eight more to go.

432
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,799
Mr. Kang!

433
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,426
Mr. Kang.

434
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,596
-Let me hold that for you.
-It's okay.

435
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,264
Please. I insist.

436
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,352
-Are you parked in your usual spot?
-Yes.

437
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:24,116
You knew I used to be
at a reformatory, right?

438
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,547
Well…

439
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,387
I've been looking for the judge

440
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,223
who helped me long ago.

441
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,939
But no matter how hard I looked,
I couldn't find him.

442
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,110
But…

443
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,529
BUSAN JUVENILE REFORMATORY

444
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,614
Hello.

445
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,366
Hello, Judge Cha!

446
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,535
-Gosh, it's been a while.
-It has.

447
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,830
I'm calling
because we still have your records

448
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,916
from when you were young.

449
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,043
Would you like us to send them to you?

450
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,693
What are you doing in this photo?

451
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,508
Hello.

452
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,304
I will be joining Yeonhwa District Court's
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

453
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,638
My name is Cha Tae-ju.

454
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,629
For someone trying to make a fresh start…

455
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,800
their past can be a wound at times.

456
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,431
I recognized you right away.

457
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,227
I was grateful

458
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,856
to see how you turned out.

459
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,043
Mr. Kang.

460
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,767
Gosh, you and your temper.

461
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,147
You never say thank you, do you?

462
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,447
You promised me, okay?

463
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,116
Never to stand trial again.

464
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,165
Thank you so much…

465
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,086
for scolding me…

466
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,385
and taking my side.

467
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,474
You've already paid me back
for everything…

468
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,392
At the court,

469
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,480
to all the children
who stood trial before you.

470
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,027
So, go.

471
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,572
Get back to work.

472
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,159
Don't ever

473
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,496
follow in my footsteps.

474
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,524
I have nothing against you.

475
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,111
You were right.

476
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,364
Take care

477
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:42,953
and I hope to see you again.

478
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,710
I heard you were good
since you were a trainee.

479
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,923
You surpassed all your male classmates
and entered the Central District Court.

480
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,093
And you even went overseas
for further training on top of that.

481
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,943
What are you talking about?

482
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,987
Just quit if you're going to
spew such nonsense.

483
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,324
Do you think we're the police?
Why are you stepping over the line?

484
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,076
You imbeciles!

485
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,371
I told you not to, didn't I?
I made myself very clear!

486
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,778
Hello, Judge Cha.

487
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,863
Hello.

488
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,750
Hello.

489
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,795
You're still here?

490
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,424
Did you pull an all-nighter?

491
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,926
No, I just couldn't sleep.

492
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,306
Me neither.

493
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,688
Gosh.

494
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,153
Come with me for a second.

495
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,030
We need to talk.

496
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,581
A lot of things are going to change

497
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,502
a little bit at a time.

498
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,925
Things will get uncomfortable.

499
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,970
WHAT HORRIBLE ASSOCIATE JUDGES
INVESTIGATING THEIR OWN BOSS LIKE THAT

500
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,889
But it's something

501
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,059
that had to be done.

502
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,185
THOSE MESSED UP ASSOCIATES

503
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:58,357
And I believe we were the ones who did it.

504
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,362
What about you?

505
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,579
Me too.

506
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,833
Okay, then.

507
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,510
-Hey!
-Hey!

508
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,224
Vehicle 4558! Stop the car!

509
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,059
I repeat, stop the car!

510
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,813
Vehicle 4558! Stop the car!

511
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,532
Vehicle 4558! Stop!

512
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,710
Do you remember
the underage traffic accident case?

513
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:04,548
Seventeen-year-old minors
rented a SUV with fake IDs

514
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:08,302
and caused an accident
while running away after being caught.

515
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,845
Stop the car!

516
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:10,888
That son of a…

517
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,857
-Stop! Stop, you lunatic!
-It hurts!

518
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,735
You're going to get us killed.

519
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,028
Just shut the fuck up!

520
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,696
-Hey.
-Damn it.

521
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,032
If we get caught, we're dead either way.

522
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,825
So just shut up.

523
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,706
-You're going to hit someone!
-Stop the car!

524
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,082
Hey, stop it!

525
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,467
Damn it.

526
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,635
My gosh.

527
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,847
Stop the car!

528
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,068
The victim's name is O Gyu-sang.

529
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,987
He's a 30-year-old breadwinner
and has a temp job as an engineer.

530
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,114
He works at a repair shop during the day

531
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,660
and part-times as a delivery man at night,
which is when he got in the accident.

532
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,244
Wait a minute.

533
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,247
-He's bleeding too much.
-You have to give them space.

534
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,292
-I want to see daddy.
-Ye-ji, come here. It's okay.

535
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,669
How's he doing?

536
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,255
Mr. O and the SUV driver are
in critical condition

537
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,841
and the rest just suffered minor injuries.

538
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,802
Let's discuss it
with Mr. Kang's replacement.

539
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,429
His replacement will be
coming two days later, not today.

540
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,515
They're wrapping up a previous case.

541
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,559
You'll have to handle this case alone

542
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,062
since it's a protection case,
not a criminal case.

543
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,147
I just took a brief look.

544
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,985
Forgery, exercising counterfeit documents,
violation of the Resident Registration Act

545
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,320
and the Act on Special Cases
concerning Traffic Accidents.

546
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,447
The victim is also
in critical condition, so why…

547
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,909
YEONHWA POLICE STATION
NAME: KWAK DO-SEOK

548
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,162
Wait.

549
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,290
The kid who was driving…

550
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,335
Are you giving up
on taekwondo for good, Do-seok?

551
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,838
I'm looking into becoming
a security guard.

552
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,966
I already got a license
and passed the GED at the facility.

553
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,843
This kid…

554
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,395
What's Do-seok's file doing there?

555
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,522
Tell me.

556
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,818
Tell us why this is a protection case.

557
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,861
Well, the thing is…

558
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,112
Mr. Seo…

559
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,322
Please, tell me.

560
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,285
Do-seok had hung out
with delinquents for a while in the past,

561
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,495
and seems to have been
in touch with them recently.

562
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,039
And as for the prosecution--

563
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,458
A former-official?
An assistant chief prosecutor?

564
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,959
It's just speculation.

565
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,046
Right now, all eyes are on us.

566
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,881
Whether it's special treatment or not,

567
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,759
you can't blow things
out of proportion, Judge Sim.

568
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,139
Okay.

569
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,892
I'll keep that in mind.

570
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,736
It's not like him to do that.

571
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,616
Even when he did
something wrong, he had his limits.

572
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:21,495
He was even aiming
to become a security guard.

573
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,663
Are you saying
that the records were forged?

574
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,375
Are you saying that
since Kwak Do-seok has limits…

575
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,506
Or are you saying that he's a victim
since he's also in a critical state?

576
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,926
No, it's not that--

577
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,428
Kwak Do-seok isn't
what's important right now.

578
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,680
Because of him and his group,

579
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,809
an innocent man is in critical condition.

580
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:26,143
DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
ASSAULT AND EXTORTION

581
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,064
SINGLE-PARENT HOUSEHOLD
TAEKWONDO, HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT

582
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,693
UNDERAGE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT CASE
SCENE PHOTOS

583
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,830
You should go home for today.

584
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,001
Go and get some rest.

585
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,088
Nothing's getting in your head anyway.

586
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,759
I'll do that.

587
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,110
I'll get going then.

588
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,906
Judge Cha.

589
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,743
Go straight home.

590
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,274
Are you sure

591
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,568
that you didn't know anything?

592
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,363
Yes, if you take a look
at the rental car dashcam footage--

593
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,448
I was asking the children.

594
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,496
-Yes, but as their counsel--
-This is a juvenile protection case.

595
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,792
I have to hear it from them.

596
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,468
I really didn't know anything.

597
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,762
He just told me to get in the car,
so I did.

598
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,597
And no one doubted him?

599
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:29,766
Well?

600
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,018
When he brought a car out of nowhere?

601
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,562
I thought he got a license
since it was past his birthday.

602
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,149
And he throws a fit
if we don't listen to him.

603
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,155
She's right.

604
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,255
You guys are underage, right?

605
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,426
-Stop the car! Stop!
-Catch them!

606
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,511
Vehicle 4558 is on the run.

607
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,138
White vehicle, 4558, is on the run.

608
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,514
Requesting support from…

609
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,266
It's his way or the highway.

610
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,643
We shouldn't have hung out with him
in the first place.

611
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,438
As you've just heard,
this isn't aiding and abetting.

612
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,066
They got in the car because
they thought he had a valid license.

613
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,902
They have nothing to do with
forgery, exercising counterfeit documents,

614
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,614
and the violation
of the Resident Registration Act.

615
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,242
It's quite opposite of
what Kwak Do-seok's guardian is claiming.

616
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,162
A petition was filed today,

617
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:36,333
that states that everything was done
under the coercion of Lee Nam-gyeong.

618
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:41,796
So the two sides of the story
don't match up, do they?

619
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,513
This case isn't as easy as
I thought it would be.

620
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:54,309
They won't admit to the crime
and are busy blaming each other.

621
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,187
I know, right? Gosh.

622
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,780
Judge Sim. Mr. O's wife is here.

623
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,457
My due date is nearing.

624
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,878
I'm just having a really hard time.

625
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,131
I was hoping

626
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,635
you could end the trial
as quickly as possible.

627
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,139
I just came to say that.

628
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,396
She has childhood depression.

629
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,650
I wasn't the only one having a hard time.

630
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,653
She knew…

631
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,364
She knew everything.

632
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,578
I just want my husband to recover

633
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,247
so that our family can go back…

634
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,127
to the way we used to be.

635
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,423
All the perpetrators

636
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,510
are refusing to admit to the crime.

637
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,889
You have the right to know

638
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,643
why and how your husband…

639
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,982
got in that accident.

640
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,367
Yes.

641
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,748
I know.

642
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,628
I heard they are all underage.

643
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:55,388
How could they be so brazen
at such a young age?

644
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,990
Is that what they said?

645
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,326
Gosh, how ridiculous.

646
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,369
They're wrong, Judge Sim.

647
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,123
This is so unfair. They're all lying.

648
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,588
Look. Does this look like
they're repenting right now?

649
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,301
They would call him out
in the middle of the night.

650
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,346
I tried reasoning with them,
scolding them,

651
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,181
but they kept coming to our house.

652
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,560
RIGHT BEFORE GOING TO TRIAL
I'M GOING TO CRY UP A STORM

653
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,479
NAME: KWAK **-SEOK, MALE, AGE 17

654
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,483
Do-seok rented the car?

655
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,610
He was driving?

656
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,737
He probably did.

657
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,656
So he wouldn't get beaten.

658
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,243
My son is big.

659
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,245
He used to be an athlete.

660
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,792
And because he has a record,
everyone is pointing their fingers at him.

661
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,087
But I swear it wasn't him.

662
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,432
Are you okay?

663
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,517
Hold on.

664
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,981
Yes, I need an ambulance
to Yeonhwa District Court.

665
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,241
Mr. Kwak, can you hear me?

666
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,118
Mr. Kwak.

667
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,870
-Call Dr. Kim. Now.
-Okay.

668
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,163
-Hold him down.
-Okay.

669
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,084
Judge Sim?

670
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,722
Who are you?

671
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,266
So, it's you.

672
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:08,313
You're the whistleblower
who kicked her own boss out.

673
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,566
Who…

674
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,943
Who told them they could be here?

675
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,487
What are they doing in my court?

676
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,621
I'm Na Geun-hee.

677
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,915
I'm the new Juvenile Criminal Collegiate
Division presiding judge.

678
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,465
Things have gotten a lot easier, right?

679
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:39,135
I hope we get along.

680
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,664
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

681
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,874
Something happened, Judge Sim.

682
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,766
PRAYING FOR THE VICTIM
#GROWING #ITWASKWAKDOSEOK

683
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,703
Do-seok, no…

684
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,876
Do-seok… Don't go…

685
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:55,753
No!

686
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,226
Do-seok!

687
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,943
What should we do now?

688
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:22,739
Judge Sim?

689
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,743
We should…

690
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,164
prepare for the trial.

691
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,083
What about Judge Cha?

692
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,630
I'll let him know.

693
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,883
Good work.

694
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,860
You haven't gone home yet?

695
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,908
What…

696
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,660
What's wrong?

697
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:16,542
There's something you should know.

698
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,589
The driver
of the underage traffic accident case,

699
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,883
Kwak Do-seok.

700
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,261
He just

701
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,182
went into a vegetative state.

702
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,969
THE CHARACTERS, EVENTS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

703
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:54,557
