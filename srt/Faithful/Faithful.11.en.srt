1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,039
Ms. Huang, it's been a long time.
Hope you've been well.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,280
(7 years ago)
Yeah, it's been too long, Ms. Chen.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,359
Please come in.
Mr. Wu has been waiting for you.

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,719
Ms. Chen, you look well.
Has your pay risen again?

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,960
You're always the first to know.

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,240
How's your silk business?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,880
When my husband had trouble back then,

8
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,240
I thought our shop would fall with him.

9
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,119
Thank goodness, we managed to hold on.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,000
You're capable.

11
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,359
I have to.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,240
My whole family
makes a living from the shop.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,119
Thank you for your care.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,280
Mr. Wu is highly meticulous
in embroidery.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,600
He's very demanding of silk threads.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,799
It is the quality of your products
that makes him choose your shop.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm not boasting,

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,519
but in terms of fineness,
our shop doesn't lose

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,239
to any other ones in the capital.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,519
Thread from other shops
can only be separated into 32 strands.

21
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,480
Ours can double that.

22
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
Alright. You'll be known
as Silk Thread Huang in the future.

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,359
Silk Thread Huang, that's a great name.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,680
Right, Ms. Chen, you mentioned last time

25
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,799
that Mr. Wu's new embroidery pattern
had purple Corydalis on it.

26
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,079
I wonder which shop
supplied that purple thread.

27
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,280
That purple is not the color
that any thread shop can dye.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,959
Several thread shops
in Huaizhou Prefecture have tried,

29
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,120
but Mr. Wu was never satisfied.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
After I went back last time,

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,920
I just tried it.
The color is all very good

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,280
with various shades.

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,799
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me show it to Mr. Wu?

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,640
Alright, I was worrying about this.

35
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,439
Follow me to Mr. Wu's study.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,879
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

37
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,039
What does Mr. Wu think?

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
You're in luck.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,280
We are sending a batch
of embroidery to the capital,

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,759
but we lack purple thread.

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,599
Mr. Wu said you would
provide the thread this time.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,280
But it is different this time.
Large quantity, tight deadline.

43
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,120
Can your shop handle it?

44
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,759
Sure, we can.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,560
Mr. Wu also said if the thread was good,

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,039
all the silk thread
would be supplied by you in the future.

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
You can trust us.

48
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,400
We will provide you
with the best silk thread this time.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,479
Alright, let's go to the warehouse.

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
Ms. Huang, how's it?

51
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,360
It's settled.

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,240
(Yunniang, the Manager)
Great.

53
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,800
Take this order seriously, and we will

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
become the only thread supplier
of the Yanyu Tower in the future.

55
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,159
No worries
about business growth by then.

56
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,599
Mi Nan,

57
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,639
leave us.

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,800
But Wu Lian and his Yanyu Tower
are currently in a public image crisis.

59
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,919
It has nothing to do with us.
Right now, the urgent task

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,439
is to rush out the batch of silk thread.

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,800
We're only given ten days.

62
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,719
I've calculated it on my way back.

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,319
If all of us can work day and night,

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,280
we can make it.

65
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,039
Even if it means paying more wages...

66
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,639
Yes, whatever it takes,

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
you just arrange it.

68
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,560
It's not the time
to do the accounting now.

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

70
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,360
Ms. Huang, do you remember

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,080
the cousin on my mother's side
who I mentioned to you before?

72
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,080
The one whose husband got tuberculosis
right after they got married?

73
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,840
Yes, her mother-in-law is cruel,

74
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,520
not willing to support
a non-working person,

75
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,159
and kicked her out.

76
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
Her parents can't
accommodate her either.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
She's really at her wit's end,

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,279
so she came to me
and asked if we needed some people.

79
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,399
Can she spin thread?

80
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,720
Well.

81
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,879
I'm not running a charity here.

82
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:58,504
=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

83
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:02,680
=Episode 11, Chapter 6, Part 1=
(Zhao the Lawyer Sets a Trap in Court)

84
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:07,064
I'll go get them back.

85
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,334
Stop.

86
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,894
Mother, Father, are you really going
to marry Rulan into the Wu family?

87
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,334
It's Wu Lian who put her
where she is now.

88
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,294
But your sister needs to live on.

89
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:19,935
I can support her for a lifetime.

90
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:22,854
You support her for a lifetime.

91
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:25,055
You want her
to stay unmarried and lonely

92
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:27,255
with no children for a lifetime?

93
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,214
That's the life you want her
to live in the future?

94
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,654
Father, you...

95
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:57,294
Mother, are these the betrothal gifts
sent by the Wu family again?

96
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,094
Father.

97
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:16,654
Why are these things in our house?
Why didn't you throw them away?

98
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,935
Rulan, we are doing this for your good.

99
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,894
What Mrs. Wu said makes sense.

100
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:27,495
We fought with Wu Lian in court.

101
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:31,414
Even if we win in the end,
your life will be ruined.

102
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:32,575
I don't care.

103
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:35,454
Mother.

104
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,294
Father.

105
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:57,015
Lang, you said you'd support me

106
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:58,654
no matter what I did, right?

107
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,454
Return these things for me.

108
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:03,214
I won't. I don't want to marry him.

109
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:12,495
Rulan, I...

110
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:14,654
Lang.

111
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,815
Rulan.

112
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,464
Rulan.

113
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,054
Why don't even my parents

114
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,534
understand what I really care about?

115
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:08,095
I do. Now we have a lawyer.

116
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,174
As long as we find
new witnesses and evidence,

117
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:11,654
we can reopen the case.

118
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:15,654
Once we win the case,
Wu Lian will be arrested.

119
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:20,174
Your father naturally will dismiss
the idea of marrying you to him.

120
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:25,455
So we will win, right?

121
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,735
The carriage is here. Hurry up
and load these onto the carriage.

122
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,832
Alright.

123
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,054
Did you hear the rumors?

124
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,615
What rumors?

125
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,615
The case of the Yanyu Tower.

126
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,894
They're gossiping about the young lady
who visited that time.

127
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,574
Why do you care about it?

128
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:15,054
I don't believe a word they say.

129
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:20,015
That young lady is just like our Ru.

130
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:24,894
They're both ruined by that Yanyu Tower.

131
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:32,135
Ru is gone. Don't think
about these anymore.

132
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:34,934
We will set off early tomorrow.

133
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,255
From then on, Huaizhou Prefecture

134
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:39,654
will have nothing to do with us.

135
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,015
This handkerchief

136
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,855
was found at the back
of the dressing table

137
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,215
when we were cleaning up

138
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:14,455
after Ru died.

139
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:18,615
It records what that brute did to her

140
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:23,135
at the Yanyu Tower.

141
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,054
Without this handkerchief,

142
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:29,694
I'm afraid I would never know

143
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:34,455
what my Ru went through in her life.

144
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,694
Have you really thought about it?

145
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:43,455
If I bring out this in court,

146
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:46,574
I'm afraid...

147
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:51,455
I can't stand by and watch you

148
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:53,294
end up like Ru.

149
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:58,294
You also have a mother.

150
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:07,934
Trust me.

151
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:12,414
I will make Wu Lian pay

152
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:14,534
for what he has done.

153
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:23,335
Girl, live well.

154
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,774
Life matters most.

155
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:47,455
Wan.

156
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,934
Mother.

157
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,615
You went to bed so early today.

158
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,975
I'm a bit tired today.

159
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,774
I made you a few new sets of clothes.

160
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:02,414
Remember to change into them
the next time you see Cheng.

161
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,894
Where did you get the money?

162
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,375
Living with a man like your father,

163
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:13,135
I've had to save some money
over the years.

164
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,135
But don't let your father know.

165
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,654
I've already sent a letter
to your maternal grandmother,

166
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:22,414
asking her to help with your marriage.

167
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:27,174
Mother, I'm really tired today.

168
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,335
Alright, alright. Sleep well.

169
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,135
Why do you want to reopen the case?

170
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,455
I have new evidence.

171
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:13,455
If that's the case,
you can present it now.

172
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,375
I will have someone judge impartially.

173
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:19,894
If I bring it out now,

174
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:24,255
I'm afraid it may not last
until the court hearing.

175
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,534
You're really bold.

176
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:28,855
As long as I can seek justice,

177
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:30,814
I've already put everything on the line.

178
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,215
If you refuse to reopen it,

179
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,774
I can only go and beat that drum again.

180
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:49,975
I can reopen it,

181
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:57,375
but if this time,
there is still no conclusive evidence,

182
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:02,414
then I will dismiss this case.

183
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:05,615
There is, this time.

184
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,534
Madam, Prefect Chen
just sent someone to inform us

185
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:19,375
that Mr. Wu's case would be reopened.

186
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:22,654
You can leave.

187
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:23,975
Yes.

188
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,814
That young lady is quite capable.

189
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:33,735
She can even pressure
Prefect Chen like that.

190
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,814
Seems that it won't end easily, Madam.

191
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,095
Should we...

192
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:40,054
Even if we should,

193
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:44,215
it should be Wu Lian
who comes to ask me for help.

194
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,495
You're right.

195
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,054
Go out with me.

196
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,735
I've already slipped some money
to influential people in the capital,

197
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,335
so there's a great chance
that Yanyu Embroidery

198
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:05,015
will be on the gift list
for the national tribute.

199
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:09,975
How could I let something bad happen
to Wu Lian at this time?

200
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:14,495
But it's good for him
to suffer a little setback.

201
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,615
Then he'll know that if he wants to gain
a foothold in Huaizhou Prefecture,

202
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,015
he can't do without our protection.

203
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,975
But the matter of the national tribute
is of great importance.

204
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,774
If people find out
that we've interfered in this,

205
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,735
won't it invite gossip?

206
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,294
You think I don't know?

207
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,174
But if we don't be aggressive,

208
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:47,135
our family might have lost long ago.

209
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,015
My husband passed away early.

210
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,455
In fact, all the officials in Huaizhou

211
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,574
are astute.

212
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,215
And Prefect Chen.

213
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:07,294
He even didn't come to celebrate
my birthday three years ago.

214
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,455
But he has become smarter lately.

215
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:14,655
No matter what happens
in Huaizhou Prefecture,

216
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:17,054
he has someone report it to me.

217
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:19,574
Do you know why?

218
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:29,735
In this world,
if you don't fight, you will lose.

219
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,015
And that's the word I hate most.

220
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:44,455
Wan, you look thinner and not good.

221
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:47,294
I sold my treasured hairpin

222
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,695
and bought you some invigorating herbs.

223
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,854
I'm fine, Mother.

224
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,495
I gotta go out.
I'll take it after I'm back.

225
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,455
The medicine will be cold then.

226
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:58,935
These are all good medicinal herbs.
Take it while it's hot.

227
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:08,215
I'm leaving.

228
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:10,255
Wan, are you going to the Yamen?

229
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:13,935
It's rumored that the case
is going to be reopened.

230
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,574
I know I can't stop you.

231
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,175
If you want to go, just go.

232
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,455
But your clothes are flamboyant.

233
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:25,334
It's not suitable for court.
Change them before you go.

234
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:41,976
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)

235
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:47,416
(Nourish the People with Grace)

236
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,854
Who are you? State your name.

237
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:12,735
I'm Zhao Yucheng,
the litigator of Lin Rulan.

238
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:17,175
How come I didn't know
that you hired a litigator?

239
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,975
Miss Lin seldom goes out

240
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:21,134
and knows little about the law.

241
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:23,574
I'll tell the truth

242
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,975
on behalf of her.

243
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,854
Wu Lian claimed the other day

244
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:33,374
that you asked him to instruct you
to learn embroidery privately.

245
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:37,895
It was also you who lured him.

246
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,735
Prefect Chen trusted him

247
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:42,175
just by his words. How biased.

248
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:43,735
Biased?

249
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:47,495
Okay, tell me.

250
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:49,695
If what you said is true,

251
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:52,255
why didn't you report it
in the first place?

252
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,574
Since you didn't do so,

253
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,895
why are you doing it now?

254
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:00,334
From ancient,
a female's virginity is significant.

255
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:03,175
As Miss Lin lost her virginity
and was deceived in the Tower,

256
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,015
she dared not say it out at first.

257
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:07,814
So, you can make a scene now?

258
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:11,695
That's because Miss Lin
has seen through Wu Lian.

259
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:12,935
In the Yanyu Tower,

260
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:16,294
there are more victims like her.

261
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:22,215
It's okay, Mother. I'm leaving.

262
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:40,175
Mother.

263
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,215
Mother.

264
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:26,854
How is it? Did you see Meng Wan?

265
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,344
Let's go.

266
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:46,534
I do remember you said
in the court that day

267
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:49,614
that there were many victims.

268
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,895
But when I asked you
for their names, you wouldn't say.

269
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,094
You can't speak without any evidence.

270
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,655
This time, I have evidence.

271
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:01,015
Then present it.

272
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,184
(Restraint)

273
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:17,134
The owner of this handkerchief
was named Ding Ru,

274
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,175
who was also an embroideress
in the Yanyu Tower.

275
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:21,415
If you still remember it.

276
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,255
She was the one who died in the well

277
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:26,054
in the Yanyu Tower some time ago.

278
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:30,015
The handkerchief records every detail

279
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:32,814
of what happened to her
in the Yanyu Tower.

280
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:37,054
Ding Ru had been in the Yanyu Tower
for less than half a year and died.

281
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:40,895
Her death was not
an accident, but suicide.

282
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:43,334
- What?
- Suicide?

283
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:47,735
I remember that. Wasn't she pregnant
before getting married?

284
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,294
Shame on her. She deserved to die.

285
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:51,854
Surely she was too ashamed to live.

286
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:55,655
Do you guys know

287
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,774
who was the father
of the baby in her belly?

288
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:03,215
Who knows the man
she was having an affair with?

289
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:04,854
- Exactly.
- Who knows?

290
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,614
Could it be Mr. Wu?

291
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:09,215
Impossible, absolutely impossible.

292
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:13,975
That's right.
It was Wu Lian who defiled her.

293
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:15,814
Ding Ru was a weak woman.

294
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:19,134
She was afraid to let anyone know it.

295
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:23,614
Soon after that, she found
herself pregnant, which hit her harder.

296
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:25,455
But what did Wu Lian do?

297
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,735
He not only ignored Ding Ru's pleas

298
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,255
but also threatened her.

299
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:33,574
He said if she made it public,
he would ruin her.

300
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:37,455
Ding Ru had no way out,
so she chose to jump into the well.

301
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:42,094
A living girl was forced
to death just like that.

302
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,655
It doesn't sound like a lie to me.

303
00:23:46,814 --> 00:23:48,574
Isn't that handkerchief the evidence?

304
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,175
Yeah, one could be a false accusation.

305
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:52,774
How could they all be?

306
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:54,455
I remember

307
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:55,935
she was about the same age as my girl.

308
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,574
How tragic.

309
00:23:57,814 --> 00:24:00,415
Glad I didn't send my girl
to the Yanyu Tower.

310
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:02,334
Thank goodness.

311
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,094
Silence.

312
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:10,215
What can a handkerchief prove?

313
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,975
And now Ding Ru is dead.
There's no way to confirm it.

314
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:14,374
How can you prove

315
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:16,774
what's written
on this handkerchief is true?

316
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:21,015
Many embroideresses and maids
in the Yanyu Tower

317
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:22,294
know about it.

318
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,854
If you don't believe,
you can summon them

319
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,415
one by one for questioning.

320
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,415
Guards.

321
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:34,255
Sir.

322
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:39,415
Go bring all the embroideresses
and maids in the Yanyu Tower.

323
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,784
Yes.

324
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:57,814
Where's she? Is she getting cold feet?

325
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,975
Wan, I'm doing this for your own good.

326
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,215
Let's get rid of the fetus
while it's small.

327
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:08,774
It would be worse later.

328
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,774
We can't let others hear.

329
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:18,094
Be good. Stay at home.

330
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,975
I will try to arrange your marriage
as soon as possible

331
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,534
and get you married
out of the prefecture.

332
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:31,655
It's okay.

333
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:36,255
Easy. I won't harm you.

334
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:38,455
You're my daughter.

335
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,255
I will never harm you.

336
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:48,695
It will be over when you wake up.

337
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,614
Hurry up. I heard someone
had charged Mr. Wu of the Yanyu Tower.

338
00:25:58,735 --> 00:25:59,614
Hurry.

339
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:08,696
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)

340
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:09,655
(The Finest Judgment)

341
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,374
Did any of you see

342
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:15,134
Wu Lian and Ding Ru
having intimate contact?

343
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,334
Only women are allowed
in the inner courtyard of the house.

344
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:23,735
Ding Ru's baby
didn't just appear out of nowhere.

345
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:26,294
But there are footmen in the outer yard.

346
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:29,655
Mr. Wu isn't the only man
in the whole house.

347
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:34,614
Then which of you saw Ding Ru
interacting with a footman?

348
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:36,854
I think I saw it.

349
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,255
Tell me in detail.

350
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:41,175
About two or three months ago,

351
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:45,255
one night, I was late returning
from the embroidery room.

352
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:47,255
When I passed by the outer courtyard,

353
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:50,975
I saw Ding Ru and Sun Cai
who works in the outer yard together.

354
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:52,895
They seemed close.

355
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:56,175
I didn't stay
and hurried back to my room.

356
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,255
Ms. Chen, have you seen it too?

357
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:02,094
Yes, I did see it.

358
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:05,054
Ding Ru often sneaked
into the utility room of the outer yard

359
00:27:05,094 --> 00:27:06,175
to meet with Sun Cai.

360
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:09,574
Once I caught them, and I scolded her.

361
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,574
Where is Sun Cai?

362
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:13,415
Bring Sun Cai here.

363
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes.

364
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:29,574
Who are you?

365
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:35,495
Prefect Chen, I am Sun Cai.

366
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:41,975
What is your relationship with Ding Ru?

367
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:43,175
I...

368
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:50,374
If you don't tell the truth,
I can only torture you.

369
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:51,614
She seduced me first.

370
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,695
I didn't know
about the baby until later.

371
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:55,814
It was really not my fault.

372
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:57,415
Nonsense.

373
00:27:57,814 --> 00:27:59,735
Prefect Chen, please spare me.

374
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:01,175
It was really not my fault.

375
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,895
Prefect Chen, please spare me.

376
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:07,735
If Ding Ru and Sun Cai
really had an affair,

377
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:09,614
where did the handkerchief come from?

378
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,015
Don't believe them.

379
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:13,735
The handkerchief was left
by Ding Ru before she died.

380
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:15,975
Every word on it is true.

381
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:23,015
Prefect Chen,
I failed to find it out before,

382
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:24,334
and it's controversial.

383
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:29,175
Since Ding Ru's parents are still alive,
we might as well summon them to testify.

384
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:31,495
Ding Ru died in the Yanyu Tower.

385
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:34,655
Her parents must be resentful.

386
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:37,215
How can their words be trusted?

387
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:43,334
It's not difficult. Just look closely
at the handwriting on the handkerchief.

388
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:47,215
Then ask Ding Ru's parents
to bring some of Ding Ru's handwriting.

389
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:48,814
Just compare them.

390
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:04,814
How dare you, Lin Rulan!
You fabricated evidence.

391
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:06,094
Do you admit it?

392
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:07,895
I didn't.

393
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:12,935
Prefect Chen, do you have any proof?

394
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,614
Just now you said
the handwriting on this handkerchief

395
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,655
was left by Ding Ru before she died.

396
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:20,655
But I just looked.

397
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:23,294
The ink on it is clearly fresh.

398
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:25,374
It must be written
not more than 24 hours ago.

399
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:28,175
Ding Ru has been dead
for more than half a month.

400
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:31,695
Are you still going to lie?

401
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:33,134
No, it can't be true.

402
00:29:33,294 --> 00:29:36,655
Are you saying that I am framing you?

403
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:41,854
The handkerchief was given to me
by Ding Ru's mother last night.

404
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:42,935
It can't be fake.

405
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:46,334
So you conspired with Ding's parents.

406
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:49,415
Bring Ding's parents here.

407
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:52,895
Sir, I live in the same alley
with the Ding family.

408
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:54,774
They left Huaizhou Prefecture

409
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:56,534
early this morning.

410
00:29:56,854 --> 00:29:59,134
I'm afraid they're far away
from the town now.

411
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:04,374
They ran away? They must be guilty.

412
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,094
Lin Rulan,

413
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:12,895
do you have anything else to say?

414
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:21,695
Prefect Chen,
we are really telling the truth.

415
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:25,334
Whether it was Ding Ru
or Liu Sanniang last time,

416
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:26,935
we never lied.

417
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:28,655
There are so many embroideresses.

418
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:30,574
If you don't believe us,

419
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:32,054
you can ask them one by one.

420
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:35,015
That makes sense.

421
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:40,255
If we could find Liu Sanniang,
we could clear this up.

422
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:44,334
But she was driven out
of the Yanyu Tower back then.

423
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:46,015
Is it...

424
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:49,134
So she was driven out? I see now.

425
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,534
No wonder she gave up
being an embroideress at the Yanyu Tower

426
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,695
to be a courtesan.

427
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,774
Such people must harbor
the same resentment

428
00:30:57,215 --> 00:30:59,374
against the Yanyu Tower
as Ding's parents.

429
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,814
They just want to frame Mr. Wu.

430
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:05,774
I knew it. I knew they were in cahoots.

431
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,015
- They are definitely in cahoots.
- Yes.

432
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:24,215
Could it be as they said

433
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:27,975
that you conspired
with Ding's parents and Liu Sanniang?

434
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,054
It was you.

435
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:21,015
W-W-What?

436
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:23,975
You switched the handkerchief.

437
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:27,134
It is absolutely not the one last night.

438
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:30,574
Besides you, no one else
had the chance to touch it.

439
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:33,415
Miss Lin, you can't just make stuff up.

440
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,854
I can't bear such a charge.

441
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,655
If it weren't
for your sincere request earlier

442
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:40,175
and my sympathy for my cousin,

443
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,134
I wouldn't take this case.

444
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,774
I have no grudges against you.
Why would I do it?

445
00:32:46,574 --> 00:32:49,655
This evidence is fake,
and it was forged by Mr. Zhao.

446
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,374
Please believe me, Prefect Chen.

447
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,054
How can I believe you?

448
00:32:55,895 --> 00:32:59,054
So the evidence you presented

449
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:02,255
was forged by the lawyer you hired?

450
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:08,695
Why don't you guys
get your stories straight first?

451
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:26,775
Wan, are you going out?

452
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:42,495
Sick?

453
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:46,495
I'll ask Mr. Yang to push the cart back
and take you to the doctor.

454
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:48,455
I'm fine.

455
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:52,574
Who are you guys?

456
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:54,815
We are the embroideresses
of the Yanyu Tower.

457
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:56,935
We came to testify voluntarily today.

458
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,855
Are you all here
to testify for Lin Rulan?

459
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:03,935
We don't want
to see Mr. Wu being wronged.

460
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:06,455
That's right. Mr. Wu is such a good man.

461
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:07,895
We can't let Lin Rulan vilify him.

462
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:09,734
Since we came to the Yanyu Tower,

463
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:14,254
Mr. Wu has been patient with us
and never overstepped his bounds.

464
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,174
Yes, Mr. Wu
is a real stickler for etiquette.

465
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:18,614
But as for Lin Rulan,

466
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:21,254
I saw her several times seducing him

467
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:23,855
when Mr. Wu was teaching us.

468
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,855
Moreover, she often went to knock
on Mr. Wu's door late at night

469
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:28,375
under the pretext of asking for advice.

470
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:30,694
I've seen her pester Mr. Wu.

471
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:32,815
It was she who did it herself,

472
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,614
but now she's turning
this around on Mr. Wu.

473
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:35,895
We won't let that happen.

474
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,054
- That's right.
- We won't let it happen.

475
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,134
(Would you let him
just toy with your feelings?)

476
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,254
(Don't you want him to pay for it?)

477
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:47,734
Miss Gao, am I right?

478
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:49,495
We can't just let Lin Rulan

479
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,654
tarnish Mr. Wu's reputation.

480
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:53,775
That's right, Miss Gao.

481
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:55,935
- Miss Gao, please say something.
- Yeah.

482
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:57,654
- Miss Gao, just tell them.
- Yeah.

483
00:35:58,295 --> 00:35:59,174
Miss Gao.

484
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,534
- Come on.
- Miss Gao.

485
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:11,654
They're right.

486
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:12,855
See.

487
00:36:21,254 --> 00:36:24,415
Silence.

488
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:27,415
Lin Rulan,

489
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:31,815
do you know it's a felony
to trump up a charge?

490
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:33,495
Hurry.

491
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,174
Prefect Chen.

492
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:38,855
Prefect Chen.

493
00:36:40,855 --> 00:36:41,775
Prefect Chen,

494
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:45,534
she's just a child.
We're not charging Mr. Wu.

495
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:48,815
We are not.

496
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:53,174
This is a court, not a place
for your childish games.

497
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,455
Prefect Chen,
please forgive us. It's our fault.

498
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:57,574
We wronged Mr. Wu.

499
00:36:57,775 --> 00:36:59,214
We can apologize to him in person.

500
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:01,734
Please let us off this time.

501
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:03,134
Father.

502
00:37:03,335 --> 00:37:04,214
Lin Rulan,

503
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:08,935
since this is your first offense,
as long as you retract your complaint,

504
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:13,935
I can let bygones be bygones.

505
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:15,614
We'll retract it.

506
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,214
No, Father, I won't.

507
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:20,855
Dismissed.

508
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:48,295
Your mother has cried
night after night because of you.

509
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:50,094
Look at what you've done.

510
00:37:50,254 --> 00:37:51,895
We even trusted you.

511
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:00,815
- Go with her.
- Tell me what's exactly going on.

512
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:06,335
Go home with me.

513
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:11,214
Let's go home.

514
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:51,455
I didn't realize you were such a fool.

515
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:53,174
Look,

516
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:57,415
even your family
don't believe you in the end.

517
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,694
Fortunately, I did not act foolishly.

518
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:04,455
I have never asked any
of you to testify for me.

519
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:07,775
But why did you lie?

520
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:11,694
Have you ever wondered
what would happen if you won?

521
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:18,415
The law would punish Wu Lian.

522
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,134
Yes, Wu Lian would be convicted.

523
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,015
The Yanyu Tower might collapse,

524
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:25,895
but what about

525
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,415
all those women
who have stepped into the Tower.

526
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,295
Whether they were violated or not,

527
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:35,574
their reputations would be ruined.

528
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:39,775
Don't you understand it now?

529
00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:42,495
There's no winning
or losing in this matter.

530
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,134
You're just protecting your reputation.

531
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,015
So are they.

532
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:01,775
In this matter,
you lost from the beginning.

533
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:42,552
(Good Deeds Benefit All)

534
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,335
What's the matter?

535
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:06,574
It's over?

536
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:09,855
You're this weak already,
and you still want to get involved?

537
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:13,975
It's too late. Miss Lin
has already pleaded guilty.

538
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:17,415
It's her who has framed Mr. Wu. Leave.

539
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:34,734
Wan.

540
00:41:37,254 --> 00:41:42,694
Wan, are you throwing your life away?

541
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:48,694
Rulan.

542
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:09,495
Is Mr. Wu satisfied
with my performance just now?

543
00:42:14,174 --> 00:42:17,335
Lin Rulan has been looking for a lawyer
in Huaizhou Prefecture these days.

544
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:21,935
If she wants a lawyer, get her one.

545
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:26,214
You mean we should
find a lawyer for her?

546
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:30,855
She may not trust the one
who goes to her on his own.

547
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,694
It must be one she has sought.

548
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:35,094
You're right.

549
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:38,054
When a woman enters Yanyu Tower,

550
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:41,375
I will have her family background

551
00:42:41,694 --> 00:42:43,495
and relatives investigated.

552
00:42:46,214 --> 00:42:48,094
If I remember correctly,

553
00:42:50,455 --> 00:42:55,335
Meng Wan has a cousin
who is a lawyer and is somewhat famous.

554
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:58,734
But Meng Wan and Lin Rulan
are very close...

555
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:00,855
That is exactly what we want.

556
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:04,895
Investigate the man thoroughly,

557
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:08,375
find his weakness
and bring him to Huaizhou.

558
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:10,935
As for what's next,

559
00:43:11,895 --> 00:43:15,574
Meng Wan will complete it for us. Go.

560
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:16,935
Yes.

561
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,855
Do the rest as planned.

562
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:36,295
I want to see Mr. Wu.

563
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:38,495
If I can't see him,

564
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:41,295
I'm not sure what will happen next.

565
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:42,815
I'll arrange it.

566
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:00,295
Wu An said you wanted to see me.

567
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:06,054
Yes, I thought it was just
a trivial false accusation.

568
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,614
But after seeing Lin Rulan, I realized

569
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:10,375
there was a lot more to this.

570
00:44:11,534 --> 00:44:14,975
Just say it, Mr. Zhao.
Don't beat around the bush.

571
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:16,975
I just think

572
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:20,734
she was brought by my own cousin.

573
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:24,254
What I'm doing seems not good,
don't you think?

574
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:29,254
The fee can be doubled.

575
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:33,054
It's not about the money
which doesn't last.

576
00:44:33,895 --> 00:44:37,734
What I want is long-term benefits.

577
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:40,815
You want to expand your business
to Huaizhou Prefecture?

578
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:43,015
You're quite smart, Mr. Wu.

579
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,174
Given the rich merchants around here,

580
00:44:45,455 --> 00:44:47,815
I'd like to make a name for myself
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

581
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:50,335
That'll be a long-term business.

582
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:54,214
And I've heard that you

583
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:57,574
have a close relationship
with the Ning family.

584
00:45:02,855 --> 00:45:03,734
Sit.

585
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,935
Looks like you did a lot of research.

586
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:10,534
So what do you think, Mr. Wu?

587
00:45:12,174 --> 00:45:15,775
After this case is over,
I'll pave the way for you.

588
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:18,895
Thank you in advance, Mr. Wu.

589
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:23,295
You did well today.

590
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:29,455
What I want is not just money.

591
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:34,574
The things promised before
will be fulfilled later. Just wait.

592
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:38,415
Then I'll be looking forward
to Mr. Wu's good news.

593
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:44,094
Mr. Wu's scheme for today

594
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:46,134
was so brilliant.

595
00:45:46,574 --> 00:45:50,734
No one will believe
Lin Rulan's words anymore.

596
00:45:50,935 --> 00:45:54,295
Everything is
within Mr. Wu's expectations.

597
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:03,415
Ms. Huang.

598
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:10,015
Ms. Huang,

599
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:13,054
people are all talking about the case
of the Yanyu Tower. What's the result?

600
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:16,295
If something happens
to them now, then we...

601
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:19,734
The outcome's already decided.
It will end soon.

602
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:22,975
The Yanyu Tower is unscathed.

603
00:46:25,455 --> 00:46:28,455
I thought before that Mr. Wu

604
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:31,375
didn't look like the kind of person
who would do such a thing.

605
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:34,415
Now it turns out
to be a false accusation for real.

606
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,534
Ms. Huang, it's really
a decline in public morals.

607
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,815
How can a good girl falsely accuse
someone of such a crime?

608
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:46,495
She ruined her reputation herself.

609
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,534
If one day, you do something
that goes against your morals,

610
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:53,174
what will you do?

611
00:46:57,895 --> 00:46:59,174
I spaced out for a second.

612
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,254
For us women,

613
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:06,295
just being alive is good enough.
Get back to your work.

614
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:12,295
By the way, your cousin
you mentioned last time. Let her come.

615
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:15,455
Really?

616
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,815
Let her learn for a while first.

617
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,614
If she can handle it, let her stay.

618
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:24,054
We will need more people
when our shop expands later.

619
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:26,614
I knew you were a good person

620
00:47:26,935 --> 00:47:28,574
at heart.

621
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:32,174
Don't worry. My cousin
is smart and capable.

622
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:34,134
When she comes,
I'll make sure she works hard.

623
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:39,335
You just mentioned
expanding the shop. What do we do?

624
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,895
It might be hard to do it
by relying solely on the Yanyu Tower.

625
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:44,614
We can't just rely on them of course.

626
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,174
That's why I plan to hire
more embroideresses soon.

627
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,054
You want to start
an embroidery business?

628
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:54,455
We must think of other ways
as soon as possible

629
00:47:55,775 --> 00:47:57,815
to break free from the limitations
of the Yanyu Tower.

630
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:01,775
In at most five years,

631
00:48:01,855 --> 00:48:03,815
we must make a name
for our shop in Huaizhou Prefecture.

632
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,015
By then, there will be no need
to fear the Yanyu Tower anymore.

633
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:11,734
I believe in you.
We will definitely make it.
