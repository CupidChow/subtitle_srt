(The Retrial of Rulan Case)

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,528
What happened?

4
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
Mr. Lou, someone is stopping us.

5
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,480
Right in the middle of the road.

6
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,400
Who is it?

7
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,879
I, Tian Xiaoling, accuse Wu Lian.

8
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,560
What did you say?

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,240
I, Tian Xiaoling,
accuse Wu Lian of rape.

10
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,560
What about you?

11
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,400
I also accuse Wu Lian.

12
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,800
I accuse Wu Lian of rape.

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,479
Seven years ago, Lin Rulan
accused Wu Lian of rape but was judged

14
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,360
to be slanderous.

15
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,639
Today, Jueming and I both
can be witnesses

16
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,280
of Wu Lian's rape charge.

17
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,560
I hope Mr. Lou can reopen this case

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,159
to clear the name for Lin Rulan.

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,240
It looks like I can't leave today.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,199
Return to the Yamen.
Hold court tomorrow.

21
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,159
Yes, turn around.

22
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:16,352
(Yanyu Tower)

23
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,759
Lou Mingzhang returned to the Yamen.

24
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
The trial is scheduled for tomorrow.

25
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,879
He was about to leave the city.

26
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,520
But Jueming stopped him.

27
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,479
What do you think we should do now?

28
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,280
Jueming can't be alive.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,719
Without her,
Lou Mingzhang would have no way.

30
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:44,064
(Abandonment Letter)

31
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
Master.

32
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,039
What do you mean by this?

33
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,039
I just came back from the city gate.

34
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,759
The news should come out quickly.

35
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,199
If you divorce me at this time,

36
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,719
perhaps it can protect the reputation
of the Xu family.

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,680
What if I refuse?

38
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,680
Back then, I insisted on marrying you
as a concubine,

39
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,839
because I intended

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
to meet Mrs. Ning.

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,480
For the seven years,
you have treated me well,

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,120
and your wife has treated me
like a sister.

43
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,199
Although what I did was justified,

44
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,920
I cannot be that selfish,

45
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,040
making your family lose its reputation
because of me.

46
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,600
Do you have to go to court yourself?

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,079
I should have done this seven years ago.

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,839
Too many people
have sacrificed a lot for this.

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,079
How can I back down?

50
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,959
Don't you have anything
you can't give up in the Xu Family?

51
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,040
The seven years have
been the best time of my life.

52
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,199
But you still insist on leaving.

53
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,120
My mind is made up.

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
Let me write a divorce settlement
for you.

55
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,879
No, only an abandonment letter can

56
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,240
make a clean break.

57
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,160
(Peacefulness)

58
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,256
Wan.

59
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,480
You take this with you.

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,879
I can't accept it.

61
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,879
Where do you plan to go?

62
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,680
I'll stay at Huangji Embroidery House
for a few days.

63
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Madame, the carriage is waiting outside.

64
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,040
I will take you there.

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,279
You don't have to. Let's part here.

66
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,839
Take care, Zhiyang.

67
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,608
Take care.

68
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,240
Sir, we had a peaceful life in Hu'an.

69
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Now, we returned to Huaizhou.

70
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,240
Isn't it a little impulsive?

71
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
After all, we don't even know
who's behind this.

72
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,800
The person who wrote to me knows
about my grievances with Wu Lian,

73
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,160
and allows me to re-establish myself
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

74
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,480
If I don't come back, I will feel bad.

75
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,680
Could it be that someone wants
to use you to deal with Wu Lian?

76
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,920
Back then, Wu Lian promised
to connect me

77
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
with Mrs. Ning

78
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,199
and help me establish myself
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

79
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,639
But afterwards, he turned his back,

80
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,920
threatened me with Mrs. Ning,
and forced me to leave.

81
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,759
I must take revenge for that.

82
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,879
If you're right,

83
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm willing
to lend the person behind this a hand.

84
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,879
I always feel
that we shouldn't get involved again.

85
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,040
What if we...

86
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,160
You're being ignorant.

87
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,199
Master, I found a letter at the gate.

88
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:27,878
(Meet at Tianshui Tea House
tomorrow morning)

89
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,144
(Huangji Embroidery House)

90
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,759
Usually, no one lives in this room.

91
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
You can settle down here.

92
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,879
Thank you.

93
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,759
Why did you let Jueming stay
in Qingshui Nunnery tonight?

94
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Wouldn't it be safer to stay here
before the court session?

95
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,639
It's going to be a sleepless night.

96
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,279
Are you saying
Wu Lian will target Jueming tonight?

97
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,480
We will find out tonight.

98
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,200
In the middle of the night, all is good.

99
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,864
(Yanyu Tower)

100
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
Is everything alright here?

101
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
Yes. What about you?

102
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,639
I lost them.

103
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,440
I followed them out of the city.

104
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,240
After that, they entered the forest.

105
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,639
It was dark, and I couldn't keep up.

106
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,240
Did you notice anything suspicious
outside Qingshui Nunnery?

107
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Along my way here,

108
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,120
I didn't notice anything suspicious.

109
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,816
But it makes things stranger.

110
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:49,039
I have a bad feeling.
You stay, and I'll return to the city.

111
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,832
Be careful.

112
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,399
The key is to catch the leader first.

113
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,720
Meng Wan is the key among them.

114
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,759
Without her,
there would be nothing to fear.

115
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,519
I see. I'm on it now.

116
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,312
Wait a second.

117
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,879
You send some people
to Qingshui Nunnery.

118
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
Mr. Wu did a good trick.

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,039
Tomorrow is the court session?

120
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,879
But why did I let Jueming come back
to Qingshui Nunnery tonight?

121
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,519
If not so, would you so confidently dare

122
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,519
to make a move against me in the city?

123
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,279
Don't move.

124
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,360
You don't need a doctor?

125
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,576
It's not a big deal.

126
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
How is it?

127
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,559
Wu An has been detained.

128
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,879
- Jueming...
- Feng Da is bringing her back.

129
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,480
She should be here soon.

130
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,320
You have figured out

131
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,200
Wu Lian's real target is not Jueming.

132
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,320
I was just speculating. I was not sure.

133
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,879
You should have notified us in advance

134
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,519
to give us the idea of what's going on.

135
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,240
I was freaked out.

136
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,720
I've already informed Mr. Lou
about this in advance.

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,159
He dispatched a team of officers

138
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,879
and stationed them outside the house.

139
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,320
Once Wu Lian's people make a move,

140
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,759
they can capture them on the spot.

141
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,440
With Wu An captured,
Wu Lian is at his wit's end.

142
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,799
We must be cautious tomorrow.

143
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,399
Wu Lian will not easily admit his guilt.

144
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,159
Alright, go back and rest early.

145
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,879
Tomorrow will be a tough battle.

146
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,759
I've observed the night sky,
and tomorrow should be a good day.

147
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
The day is finally coming.

148
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,960
Master, there are soldiers ambushed
at Huangji Embroidery House.

149
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,520
Wu An has been captured.

150
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,240
Alright. You may leave.

151
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,200
Let's go. It's time for the trial.

152
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,279
Let's watch it.

153
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,399
Yesterday, when Mr. Lou was stopped,

154
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,639
I was there.

155
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,080
I heard

156
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,200
that they were going to sue Mr. Wu.

157
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,240
Perhaps I heard wrong.

158
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
Sir, you're not a local, are you?

159
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,879
This happened seven years ago.

160
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,720
Many local people still remember it.

161
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,840
This time, it's a retrial of this case.

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,120
Come on. Let's watch this.

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,159
Madam.

164
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,320
Madam, someone is waiting
for you at home.

165
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,112
(Benevolence)

166
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Silence. Summon Wu Lian.

167
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,919
Summon Wu Lian.

168
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,320
(Improving People's Wellbeing)

169
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,320
Greetings, Mr. Lou.

170
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:15,200
Wu Lian, seven years ago, Lin Rulan,
the embroideress of Yanyu Tower,

171
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,720
accused you of rape.
Do you remember that?

172
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,159
Yes. Back then,
Lin Rulan retracted the petition,

173
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,120
and admitted making false accusations.

174
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,720
Whether it's a false accusation or not,
it's for me to decide.

175
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,440
But now there is a new witness.

176
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,720
So, this case needs to be reheard.

177
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,799
Lin Rulan died seven years ago.

178
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,559
Who will file a case for this retrial?

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
According to the law,

180
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,120
they both cannot represent the deceased.

181
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,679
Mr. Lou. Although Rulan is dead,

182
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
her elder brother, Lin Lang, is alive.

183
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,519
Summon Lin Lang.

184
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,559
Summon Lin Lang.

185
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,879
Mr. Lou.

186
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm Lin Lang, Lin Rulan's elder brother.

187
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,440
Today I plead with you

188
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
to reopen the Rulan Case years ago

189
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,720
to vindicate Rulan.

190
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:34,278
(Unjust)

191
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,080
If you claim injustice for Lin Rulan,
where is your evidence?

192
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,320
My sister once said

193
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,480
that there were far more victims
than just her.

194
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,200
I've seen all the case files.

195
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,360
But she refused to reveal their names.

196
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,440
And no one came forward
to confirm her story.

197
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,279
To protect those girls

198
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,919
from being hurt again,

199
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,799
Rulan chose to remain silent.

200
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,559
But what she said was not false.

201
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,039
Today, I'm willing to stand in court

202
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
to testify for her.

203
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,720
I entered Yanyu Tower
two months earlier than Rulan.

204
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,319
I have been through everything
she experienced.

205
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,720
Meng Wan, I remember,
seven years ago, you were friends

206
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,000
with Lin Rulan.

207
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,000
The maids, servants,

208
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
and the embroideress
who studied with you at the same time

209
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,960
can testify
that you two had a deep friendship.

210
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,839
If what you said is true,

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,920
why didn't you testify seven years ago?

212
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,839
Or are you holding a grudge
because of Lin Rulan's death,

213
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,920
intending to take revenge?

214
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,799
Yes, it is deliberate revenge.

215
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,759
Mr. Lou, she is close to Lin Rulan.

216
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,640
Her testimony might not be trustworthy.

217
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,319
Amitabha. I'm Jueming.

218
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,480
Just now, Wu Liang said

219
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,279
Ms. Meng's testimony isn't trustworthy.

220
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,599
I am willing to vouch for Lin Rulan.

221
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,839
Alright, go ahead.

222
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,519
My real name is Tian Xiaoling.
My father was a private school teacher.

223
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,119
Seven years ago, my parents found out
that I loved embroidery,

224
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:36,359
so they chipped in
to send me to the Yanyu Tower.

225
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Not long after that,
Lin Rulan rang the drum,

226
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,480
accusing Wu Lian of rape.

227
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,640
However, I just wanted
to focus on learning skills,

228
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,279
so I did not take it seriously.

229
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,759
I thought as long as I protected myself,

230
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:04,359
everything would not concern me.
But I was wrong.

231
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,000
On the Qiqiao Festival,
we had a day off.

232
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,640
When I returned from the lanterns event,

233
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,319
I remembered the unfinished embroidery
I left in the embroidery room,

234
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,400
so I went to fetch it alone.

235
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,359
Unexpectedly, I ran into Wu Lian there.

236
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,279
At first, I wasn't very cautious,

237
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,920
thinking that he didn't dare
to do anything to me in the Yanyu Tower.

238
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,599
But I underestimated his shamelessness.

239
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,720
I thought about committing suicide,

240
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,720
but eventually,
I didn't have the courage.

241
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,200
So, I could only hide in the nunnery

242
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,200
and live out the rest of my life.

243
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,559
I just had a casual acquaintance
with Lin Rulan.

244
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,599
I have no reason
to falsely accuse Wu Lian.

245
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,960
I hope you can discern the truth.

246
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,599
Miss,

247
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,559
do you recognize a man
named Li Chunfeng?

248
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,200
He was just an old friend
from my childhood.

249
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
He has nothing to do with this case.

250
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,000
An old friend?
Were you two into each other?

251
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,440
Mr. Lou, Li Chunfeng is the reason
she falsely accused me.

252
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,160
What do you mean?

253
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,079
Days ago, Li Chunfeng always sang
at the gate of the Qingshui Nunnery,

254
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,240
expressing his sad feelings for a lady.

255
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,200
Who was he singing to?

256
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,640
Mr. Lou can send someone to inquire
at the Qingshui Nunnery.

257
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,599
Wu Lian, you've said so many things.

258
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,160
Does Li Chunfeng have anything
to do with the case?

259
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Here's one more thing.

260
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,680
A few days ago,
a thief broke into my house.

261
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,960
He got hurt by my servants.

262
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,440
Although he managed to escape,
he died from his injuries.

263
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,359
This thief was Li Chunfeng.

264
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,400
Well, a believer
in Buddhism doesn't lie.

265
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,839
Can you tell me if there's an affection
between you and Li Chunfeng?

266
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,519
Mr. Lou, they're both seeking revenge
for their friends.

267
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,920
and fabricating stories.

268
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,440
If you only listen
to their side of the story

269
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,839
and place the blame on me,

270
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm afraid it won't convince the public.

271
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,160
You were one of those
who broke my leg, right?

272
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,480
So what?

273
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,319
I couldn't understand

274
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,960
why a capable person like you

275
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,400
would always follow Wu Lian.

276
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,200
Then I found out you owed him a life.

277
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,640
Just for this,

278
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,559
you did so many vicious things for him.

279
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,799
I don't have anything to say to you.

280
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,200
Your parents died early,

281
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
leaving you a younger sister.

282
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Wu Lian once saved your sister's life.

283
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,200
That's why you follow him
with all your heart.

284
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Am I right?

285
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,039
What does it have to do with him?

286
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,400
Have you ever thought that what you did

287
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,960
will bring karma to you and your sister?

288
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,240
What exactly are you trying to say?

289
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,440
Based on what you've done for Wu Lian,

290
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,559
even if it's not capital offenses,
but you'll be exiled.

291
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,799
I'm afraid you can't see your sister
for the last time.

292
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,160
But if you can tell the truth,

293
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,000
Mr. Lou will deal with you leniently.

294
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,759
You might still have the chance
to see your sister live a happy life.

295
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,200
I wonder what your sister would think

296
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,720
if she knew about what you've done.

297
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,519
Wu An.

298
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,880
I respect you as a man.

299
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,440
Now's the chance to turn back.

300
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,680
Can I count on you?

301
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,559
Of course.

302
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,680
(Land Deed)

303
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,839
This is the title deed.
You take care of it.

304
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,759
Ms. Huang, why are you doing this?

305
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,799
Just a witness.

306
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,240
Even if you lose,
it won't implicate our business.

307
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,640
Just do what I said.

308
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,160
If anything bad happens,

309
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,799
you should sell this embroidery house

310
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,079
and leave here immediately
with those embroideresses.

311
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,039
Are you hiding something from me?

312
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,279
Ms. Huang, we will wait for you.

313
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,960
What are you doing?

314
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,480
Mr. Zhao, I'm afraid
you have to come with us to the Yamen.

315
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,960
What on earth did I do wrong?

316
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,400
Seize him.

317
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,648
Yes.

318
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,039
Take him back to the Yamen.

319
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
I will take people to his house.

320
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,400
- What are you doing?
- Go.

321
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Sir.

322
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,039
Search!

323
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:11,880
Sir.

324
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,759
Mr. Lou, if you reopen the old case,
you must have evidence.

325
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,400
Otherwise, even if I'm a minor official,

326
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,920
I have to go
to the Dali Court to seek justice.

327
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,559
Mr. Lou, you should read it
in the files.

328
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
In the second trial of Rulan Case,

329
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,039
there was a litigator
named Zhao Yucheng.

330
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
I do have impressions.

331
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,279
If some of you still remember

332
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,759
the situation seven years ago,

333
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,319
you should know

334
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,839
this litigator forged the evidence,

335
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,319
which led to Prefect Chen's judgment

336
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,519
that Rulan slandered Wu Lian.

337
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,720
And this litigator
was bribed by Wu Lian.

338
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,279
Therefore, he deliberately bit back
and reversed right and wrong.

339
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,799
Do you have evidence?

340
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,880
I am a witness.

341
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,839
I'm Huang Jiaojiao,
owner of the Huangji Embroidery House.

342
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,079
Greetings, Mr. Lou.

343
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,920
You're a witness?

344
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,960
I used to run a silk thread shop.

345
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,599
One day when I was delivering goods
to the Yanyu Tower,

346
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,240
I saw Wu Lian's man leading a person

347
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,160
into the study.

348
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,799
The next day I saw this person in court.

349
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,480
It was Lin Rulan's litigator.

350
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,039
Why didn't you speak out in court?

351
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,480
I was in a difficult situation.

352
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,240
The Yanyu Tower was my big customer.

353
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,119
I can only protect myself first.

354
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,519
Now Huangji Embroidery House has grown,

355
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,279
while my Yanyu Tower has collapsed.

356
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,400
You're probably the biggest beneficiary.

357
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,519
I have to say you have ulterior motives.

358
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,200
Huai Embroidery
has replaced Yanyu Embroidery,

359
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,240
becoming one of the birthday gifts
for Her Majesty.

360
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,480
Yanyu Embroidery has lost.

361
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,359
Wu Lian.

362
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
Is what she said true?

363
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,599
Indeed, I met Mr. Zhao before the trial.

364
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,200
But I didn't bribe him.

365
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,599
Instead, I wanted him
to persuade Lin Rulan

366
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,200
not to make a mistake.

367
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,160
If I remember correctly,

368
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,519
the laws do not prohibit meeting
with a litigator.

369
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,440
So, let's listen

370
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,960
to what Mr. Zhao says. Bring him here.

371
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,039
What was your deal with Wu Lian

372
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,799
during the Rulan Case seven years ago?

373
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,960
Just now, Wu Lian admitted

374
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,559
that he met with you privately.

375
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,839
If you lie, I won't let you go.

376
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,039
I did meet with Wu Lian.

377
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,079
Was it just a meeting?

378
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,559
Wu Lian wanted me to lose the case.

379
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,759
He promised
to help me establish a foothold.

380
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,400
You are such a treacherous person.

381
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,279
What exactly did you do?

382
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,240
He asked me to switch the handkerchief
left by Ding Ru prior to her death.

383
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,680
So, Lin Rulan was accused
of fabricating evidence.

384
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,119
Wu Lian, how do you explain this?

385
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,400
This man is Meng Wan's cousin.

386
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,720
Why is he coming forward
to testify at this point?

387
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,000
Moreover, there's no evidence.

388
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,119
The evidence is here.

389
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,240
I discovered it in Mr. Zhao's house.

390
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,000
It should be Ding Ru's handkerchief.

391
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,839
I have caught Zhao Yucheng's concubine

392
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,880
to testify.

393
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,039
Bring her here.

394
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,240
What exactly happened
when Zhao Yucheng acted

395
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,079
as Lin Rulan's litigator
seven years ago?

396
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,880
Speak up.

397
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,319
At that time, I was his personal maid.

398
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,119
When he just arrived at Huaizhou,

399
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,400
Wu Lian sent someone to find him.

400
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,559
They figured out
Lin Rulan would ask him for help, so...

401
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,799
Keep going.

402
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,319
I do not know details,
but that handkerchief...

403
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,720
I had someone embroider an exact copy

404
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,359
and handed it to Master.

405
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,160
Zhao Yucheng secretly
replaced the evidence.

406
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,039
How can you prove
that it was under my command?

407
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:38,200
Mr. Wu, you don't give up, do you?

408
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,119
How can you deny it before the evidence
and witness statements?

409
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,359
Mr. Lou, a man broke
into Huangji last night

410
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,519
and intended to kill me.

411
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,759
You should already know about this.

412
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,920
Why don't you interrogate this man now?

413
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,039
There may be more evidence coming.

414
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,960
Bring the person here.

415
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,480
Wu Lian, do you recognize him?

416
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,640
Of course, I do.

417
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,440
His name is Wu An,
the top steward of the Yanyu Tower.

418
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,720
Correct?

419
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,400
Wu An does work in the Yanyu Tower.

420
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,680
But he is not a slave,
so he is free in my house.

421
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,799
You may ask him what he has done.

422
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,759
Tell me. Who gave you the orders?

423
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,359
Mr. Lou, I beg you
to save an innocent woman.

424
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,319
What do you mean by that?

425
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,960
Meng Wan found out
that I liked her maid.

426
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,079
To threaten me,

427
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,160
she hid her in a secret place.

428
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,200
Her life or death is unknown,

429
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,079
And the lame man

430
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,359
just went to the prison

431
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,759
to threaten me
with the life of the maid,

432
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,359
forcing me to frame Mr. Wu.

433
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,960
It's a setup, truly heinous!

434
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,119
Yes.

435
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,519
It is intolerable!

436
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:40,200
It's personal grudge
between me and Meng Wan.

437
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,640
I like her maid,

438
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:49,240
so Meng Wan kept tormenting her.

439
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,559
I've been holding a grudge.

440
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,319
Wu An, you made a big mistake.

441
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,279
I only regret
that I couldn't kill her last night.

442
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,240
So, you two planned it long ago.

443
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,279
Meng Wan, get mad at me.

444
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,079
Do not hurt the innocent.

445
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,200
Mr. Lou.

446
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,039
Meng Wan wants to avenge Lin Rulan.

447
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,160
Tian Xiaoling wants
to avenge Li Chunfeng,

448
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,279
and Zhao Yucheng is a liar.

449
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,920
What can they prove?

450
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,799
Exactly. What can they prove?

451
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,160
I have evidence.

452
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Submit it.

453
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,119
Please look, Mr. Lou.

454
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,960
What's she doing?

455
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,039
This plum blossom
on my back is evidence.

456
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,239
Those who know Wu Lian will understand.

457
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,679
The plum blossoms
he embroiders are unique.

458
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,760
Somebody, get plum blossoms embroidery
from Yanyu Tower.

459
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,320
I have a handkerchief.

460
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,880
Mr. Wu embroidered it himself.

461
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,800
They are indeed identical.

462
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,960
Mr. Wu did it.

463
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Is that true?

464
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,920
It's really him.

465
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,039
I'm fine.

466
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,000
Seven years ago, the night I met him,

467
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,119
I wanted to leave quickly.

468
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,400
But he seemed to have had a drink
in a good mood,

469
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
so he started talking embroidery
with me.

470
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,320
When I said
a falling plum blossom seemed desolated,

471
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,280
and a plum blossom
on the tree showed more dignity,

472
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,320
it provoked his anger.

473
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,079
In his fury, he pinned me
to the embroidery table.

474
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,119
But that wasn't enough for him.

475
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,159
At that time, I was out of my senses,

476
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,079
filled with despair,
like the living dead.

477
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,960
He took a needle
and embroidered this plum blossom

478
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,199
on my shoulder stitch by stitch,

479
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:11,559
trying to leave this plum blossom
on me for a lifetime.

480
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,000
Wu Lian.

481
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,719
What else can you argue about?

482
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,519
I have long heard
that no one in Huaizhou

483
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,320
can imitate your embroidery skills.

484
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,800
Listen to me, Mr. Lou.

485
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,440
That day, the two of us
were discussing embroidery.

486
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,199
But she not only disobeyed,
but also talked back.

487
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
I just gave her a punishment.

488
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,000
Our bodies are given by our parents.

489
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,159
How could you hurt her body?

490
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,159
Yes, how could you?

491
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,400
Fortunately, Yanyu Tower
has been burned.

492
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,760
Such an evil person.

493
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,960
How can this woman get married
in the future with a scar on her body?

494
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Yes, how could you do this?

495
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,880
Mr. Lou, today these two women

496
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,880
accuse me of rape.

497
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,239
Even if my punishment method
is controversial,

498
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,159
it can't prove that I raped them.

499
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,239
If you use an embroidered plum blossom
to determine my crime,

500
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,400
I am afraid that it is too far-fetched.

501
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,679
Everyone, I have seen
many familiar faces here today.

502
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,360
I want to ask you all a question.

503
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,519
How have you been
over the past seven years?

504
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,719
Seven years ago, Rulan told me

505
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,719
to forget all this and start anew.

506
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,559
I don't know
how you've been over these years,

507
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,400
but I dream of my days
in the Yanyu Tower every day.

508
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,039
I dare not forget for a moment.

509
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,360
We are the victims.

510
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:06,880
But are we the only victims these years?

511
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,280
How many young ladies walked

512
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,599
into Yanyu Tower with hopes

513
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,639
but left in desperate?

514
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,239
Yet, Wu Lian, who's to blame,

515
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,679
continues to be teach embroidery.

516
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,960
Where is justice in this world?

517
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,119
Rulan,

518
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,320
Jueming, and me.

519
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,079
Perhaps many of you

520
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,880
may think we're overreaching ourselves.

521
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,480
But I know behind me are all of you

522
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,079
and many victims like us.

523
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,559
Even if one person is weak,

524
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,000
what about ten,
a hundred, or a thousand people?

525
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,760
A woman is inherently difficult.

526
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,480
It's even harder
to reveal the painful past.

527
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,599
I was once like all of you,

528
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:00,239
thinking about hiding in a corner
where no one can see,

529
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,920
because I fear rumors and judgments.

530
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,639
And I fear the damage
to the reputations of my family.

531
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,119
I even thought about ending my life.

532
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,559
But then, what did we do wrong?

533
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,760
Why do we, as victims,

534
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,400
have to carefully hide our pains

535
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:26,039
and live with nightmares,

536
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,679
yet not even have the courage
to speak the truth?

537
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,079
The one who did evil is this man.

538
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,159
So today, I am pleading you to step up

539
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,599
not for others, but for ourselves,

540
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,639
so that no nightmares will follow us.

541
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,000
Stop avoiding it.

542
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,159
Mr. Lou, I have a request.

543
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,000
Go ahead.

544
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,199
May I ask for a white screen
to be placed outside the Yamen?

545
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,880
Why?

546
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,320
The embroideresses got married
and had children.

547
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,719
Once they speak the truth,
it may destroy

548
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
their hard-earned peaceful lives.

549
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,239
If they were allowed to write the truth

550
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,199
on the white screen anonymously,

551
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,159
perhaps it could allay their concerns.

552
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,679
Mr. Lou.

553
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,320
No, this is an unprecedented request.

554
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,599
I cannot agree.

555
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,079
Dismiss!

556
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,559
Get out of here.

557
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,719
You two come with me.

558
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,480
After all these years,
you're still so naive.

559
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,000
Nobody will admit it.

560
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,360
Perhaps he is right.

561
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:09,119
Seven years have passed,
but nothing changed now.

562
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,159
Maybe it won't change
in the future either.
