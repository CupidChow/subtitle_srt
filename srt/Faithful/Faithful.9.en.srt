00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:15,962
(Seven years ago)

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,560
He can't run far.

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,280
The Fuyuan Temple is right ahead.

4
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,000
We can't let him escape. Go.

5
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,799
- Yes.
- Yes.

(Lin Rulan's Carrying Stigma Again)

8
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:37,266
(Lin's Pharmacy)

9
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,731
Lin Rulan, come out.

10
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:41,411
I'm calling off our engagement.

11
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,770
(Wang Liulang, Merchant in Chen County)
Lin Rulan,

12
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:45,731
I'm calling off our engagement.

13
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,650
Everyone, come and judge for me.

14
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,770
Come on, everyone.

15
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,171
- Come and see.
- Come and see.

16
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,251
Everyone,

17
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:59,011
my family is among the prestigious ones
in Chen County.

18
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:02,050
Although the Lin family
only owns a shop,

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,851
they are considered honest and upright.

20
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,770
So I arranged a marriage
with their daughter.

21
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,090
But who would have thought

22
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,851
Lin Rulan would be unfaithful?

23
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,131
After being engaged to me,

24
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,731
she went to seduce the son
of the county magistrate,

25
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:17,891
hoping to marry into wealth.

26
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,291
How can she do that?

27
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,251
Look, they're out.

28
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,971
You're talking nonsense.

29
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,370
I'm talking nonsense?

30
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,131
Your daughter seduced Yang Sanlang.

31
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,691
Someone caught them,

32
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:33,451
and you falsely accused
Yang Sanlang of harassing your daughter.

33
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,930
Fortunately, there were witnesses.

34
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,251
Otherwise, the Yang family
would have been framed.

35
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,490
Wang Liulang, I'll rip up your mouth.

36
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,530
Our engagement has been annulled.

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,971
What do you want?

38
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,411
You did a shameful thing before.

39
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,330
My parents forced me to dump you,

40
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,411
but I didn't.

41
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,731
I told them if I did it,

42
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,451
your life would be ruined.

43
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,451
So my whole family reluctantly
accepted this marriage.

44
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:00,810
But who would have thought

45
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,971
the Lin family felt ashamed
to stay in Chen County

46
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,810
and they took
the betrothal gifts and ran?

47
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,891
How could they do that?

48
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:08,770
They ran?

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,810
You wanted to cancel the engagement
without learning the true story.

50
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:15,530
I returned every single betrothal gift.

51
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,210
If you're right,

52
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,410
(Betrothal Letter)
why is Lin Rulan's betrothal letter

53
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,131
still at our house?

54
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:28,251
I never could have imagined

55
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,410
Lin Rulan would repeat her old tricks

56
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,131
to seduce Mr. Wu

57
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,530
and even turn it around on him.

58
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,051
Can I marry

59
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,131
such a woman?

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,410
That's why I must cancel
the engagement today.

61
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,530
- Cancel it.
- Cancel it.

62
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:42,451
Yes, cancel it.

63
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,371
So Mr. Wu was wronged.

64
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,970
Who would believe her words?

65
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,491
Why didn't the son
of the county magistrate harass others?

66
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,730
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,730
She's too promiscuous.

68
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,650
We have already returned
your betrothal letter.

69
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,970
Our two families have no ties anymore.

70
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:01,730
If you continue like this,

71
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,011
we will report to the official.

72
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,051
Okay, I just want the Prefect Chen

73
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,650
to uphold justice for me.

74
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,931
What do you think, everyone?

75
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,251
- Right.
- Right.

76
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,051
- That's right.
- Report it!

77
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,571
It should have been done long ago.

78
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,931
Father, let's go back inside.

79
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,730
Lin Rulan.

80
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,290
- Why are you leaving?
- Lin Rulan.

81
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,451
- She's guilty.
- She's guilty, right?

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,131
She's just guilty.

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,811
Go ahead and report it.

84
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,650
That man is simply slandering us.

85
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,931
I knew that he was a bad guy.

86
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,770
Father, if he comes again,

87
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,371
just don't open the door.

88
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:44,090
But there's still no conclusion
to the previous case.

89
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:46,730
Now with Wang Liu,

90
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,970
what are we going to do?

91
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,811
The Prefect Chen
has just postponed my case.

92
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,051
It hasn't been closed.

93
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,290
And I have found a litigator
willing to represent me in court.

94
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,491
If I can find
new evidence and witnesses,

95
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,051
I can clear my name.

96
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,491
But Wu Lian is not an ordinary person.

97
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,770
Law applies to everyone,
no matter their status.

98
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,891
Since we're not going
to open the next few days,

99
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,650
why don't you come
with me to the Fuyuan Temple

100
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,891
to dispel the bad luck?

101
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,410
Okay.

102
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:29,554
(Fuyuan Temple)

103
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,850
(There must be justice
in this world, right?)

104
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,090
Let's ask the abbot
to interpret the fortune stick.

105
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,170
Mother,

106
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,170
you do it alone.

107
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,330
I want to take a walk
on the back mountain.

108
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,090
Okay, it's good to get some fresh air.

109
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:05,850
Just don't go too far.

110
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,970
I'll be back within ten minutes.

111
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,251
Lady, please come with me.

112
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,170
Wan, you must be sincere

113
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,410
in front of the Buddha later.

114
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,210
Once you have a good marriage,

115
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,931
you will have everything in this life.

116
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,051
I can support myself
by doing embroidery.

117
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,410
Nonsense.

118
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,730
I sent you to the Yanyu Tower

119
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,891
to find you a good marriage,

120
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,691
not to let you become
an embroideress in the future.

121
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:52,770
What's wrong?

122
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,730
The carriage jolted too hard.

123
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,251
Did you see an injured man?

124
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,410
No, I didn't.

125
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:27,850
Oh my goodness.

126
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,530
Did he grow wings and fly away?

127
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,650
Even if I have to dig deep
into the ground today,

128
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:34,491
I must find him.

129
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:35,690
Split up and search.

130
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:13,851
Don't be afraid.

131
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,650
The bleeding is heavy.

132
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,770
I can only stop it temporarily.

133
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:45,091
After going down the mountain, you need
to get properly checked at a clinic.

134
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,211
It's not safe here.

135
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,891
We need to find a place to hide now,

136
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,050
and then I can properly
tend to your wound.

137
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,331
Can you get up?

138
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,290
Why did you save me?

139
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:13,971
My family runs a pharmacy,

140
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,810
and my father knows
a bit of traditional medicine.

141
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,170
I've been exposed to it.

142
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,290
Sometimes we treat people
who can't afford medical care.

143
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,530
I can't ignore someone in need.

144
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,810
You're my savior.
Please accept my gratitude.

145
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,170
No need.

146
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,491
You should lie down.

147
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,170
It's late.

148
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:43,131
I should go home.

149
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,650
It's here. Come on.

150
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,331
He is the adulterer.

151
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,570
Just now,

152
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,331
I saw them hugging and coming here.

153
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,410
Sure enough, they hid
in this hayloft for an affair.

154
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:55,971
Nonsense.

155
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,891
They're going to kill us.

156
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,091
Stop! Put it down.

157
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,091
Put the knife down.

158
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:00,971
They're framing you.

159
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,211
Put it down.

160
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,091
These two even came to this place

161
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:05,851
for an affair.

162
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,450
They are having an affair here.

163
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,211
Shameless.

164
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,611
- Right.
- Yeah.

165
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:13,851
Isn't Miss Lin who is notorious
in Huaizhou Prefecture?

166
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:14,891
It's her.

167
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,930
So it's you.

168
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,131
The rumors are not false at all.

169
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,930
You're really a promiscuous woman.

170
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,170
Why did you choose a cook?

171
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,131
You really are indiscriminate.

172
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,770
You're the cook.

173
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,930
I'm the second master of Heifeng Camp.

174
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,930
You're a bandit then.

175
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,810
A decent woman is associating
with a bandit.

176
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:38,491
You're degrading yourself.

177
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,170
Where's your dignity?

178
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:40,810
Yes.

179
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,050
Don't slander us.

180
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:44,530
You're doing such a thing,
and you're afraid of being discussed?

181
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,450
Exactly.

182
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:46,551
Rulan.

183
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:47,891
- You might as well admit it.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,530
What are you going to do?

185
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,331
Don't get involved with that woman
who tarnishes her reputation.

186
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:53,650
Don't you want to get married?

187
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,211
I left a handkerchief
in the prayer hall just now.

188
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,491
I'll go get it.

189
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,011
What?

190
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,011
If a man picks up such an item,

191
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,450
it's even harder to explain.

192
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:07,530
Then I'll go with you.

193
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,930
I'll be right back.

194
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,410
And she even wanted to go to the Yamen?

195
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,170
You two are doing such things
in broad daylight.

196
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,570
You really have no sense of shame.

197
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:23,530
Exactly.

198
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,570
You're glaring at me?

199
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,611
Just admit it.

200
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,290
Fine.

201
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,251
You said we were having an affair here,

202
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,371
so let me ask you

203
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:35,410
if you see any physical intimacy
between him and me?

204
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,810
You two alone hide in this hayloft.

205
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:41,530
What else could you do?

206
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,650
So you didn't see it.

207
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,810
Why are you so sure about something

208
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,611
you didn't really see?

209
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,770
So many of us are watching.

210
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,611
You are denying it.

211
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,131
That's because all of you are blind.

212
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,971
She was clearly treating my wound.

213
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:55,410
If you two didn't know each other,

214
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:58,091
why would she help treat your wound?

215
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,410
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

216
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,251
- That means you two have hooked up.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,410
She's a good person.

218
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,331
Do you take us all for fools?

219
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,251
Which unmarried girl

220
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,371
would act so intimately
with a strange man?

221
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,971
Who are you trying to fool?

222
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,410
- Right.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,690
If we had come a bit later,

224
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:16,050
the child would have been born.

225
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,131
It's hilarious.

226
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,050
Have you all lost your reason?

227
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,810
Right.

228
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,410
No matter what I say,
they won't believe it.

229
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,712
Because they don't care at all

230
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,211
what the truth really is.

231
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,011
What we saw must be the truth.

232
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,810
Exactly.

233
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,211
All of us

234
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,570
saw it with our own eyes.

235
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,450
Look at these people.
They're distorting facts

236
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,450
and stirring things up.

237
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,050
It really disturbs the peace here.

238
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,731
Please uphold justice.

239
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:44,331
Amitabha.

240
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,810
Sir and lady, please come with me.

241
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,091
Everyone, it's late.

242
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,611
You should go down the mountain.

243
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,450
That's it?

244
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:54,731
Nothing has been resolved.

245
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,170
What kind of people are these?

246
00:13:58,891 --> 00:13:59,650
- Did you see it?
- Forget it.

247
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,690
Her hands are on him.

248
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,851
- Did you see it?
- Oh my.

249
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,050
They just leave like this?

250
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,930
What a meddler.

251
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:10,971
Let's go.

252
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,331
Are you crazy?

253
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,930
Follow me down the mountain now.

254
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,170
Why are you so reckless?

255
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,491
It's not my savior's fault.

256
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,731
It's all about those women
causing trouble.

257
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,450
Shikong,

258
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,891
take this man to treat his wound first.

259
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,371
Yes.

260
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,570
- Wait.
- Sir.

261
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,570
Sir, let me tell you about it. I...

262
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,770
I already know about it.

263
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,050
You are the second master
of Heifeng Camp.

264
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,530
Your elder brother was sick,

265
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,491
so you robbed the herbs escorted
by the Changfeng Escort Agency

266
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:47,851
and were chased here as a result.

267
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,690
You can tell fortunes?

268
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,131
People from the Changfeng Escort Agency
have searched here.

269
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,211
Our temple doesn't interfere
with worldly matters.

270
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,891
After your wounds are bandaged,

271
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:59,410
please leave on your own.

272
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,011
Those bad guys.

273
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,091
Shikong, take him away.

274
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,251
Sir, this way, please.

275
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:16,371
Lady, may I ask your name?

276
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,971
Go treat your wounds.

277
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,450
How did such a thing happen

278
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,290
in such a short time?

279
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,371
Mother, I'm fine. I...

280
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,251
This is the fortune stick
your mother drew for you today.

281
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,851
The way forward is shrouded in mystery.

282
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,690
It's better not to get involved.

283
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,011
When the wall in front of you collapses,

284
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:56,211
even with the gods' help,
it will be hard to proceed.

285
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,530
Lady, be careful of the path ahead.

286
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,851
Don't be too persistent.

287
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,491
Even with the gods' help,
it will be hard to proceed.

288
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,650
Even if no one helps me,

289
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,930
I will still persevere.

290
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,530
I believe in human effort.

291
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:29,050
After Wang Liulang
made such a fuss yesterday,

292
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:32,251
the rumors have been bad enough.

293
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,491
And such a thing happened today.

294
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,410
Those people just twisted the truth.

295
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,530
It was the same back in Chen County.

296
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,170
It was the county magistrate's son
who harassed you,

297
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:48,371
and when it was exposed,

298
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,450
they turned it around on you.

299
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:56,770
He already has dozens
of concubines in his backyard.

300
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:00,530
Which decent family would
marry their daughter to him?

301
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,051
The Wang family is not good either.

302
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:08,291
He was just afraid
of offending the county magistrate.

303
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,490
He insisted on canceling the engagement.

304
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,970
But he twisted it.

305
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,210
I think

306
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,210
there's a conspiracy
behind Wang Liulang's showing up.

307
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,371
We have been away
from Chen County for so long,

308
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,331
yet he came to us at that moment.

309
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,051
It can't be a coincidence.

310
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,490
You mean...

311
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,571
It's Wu Lian.

312
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,331
He's gone too far.

313
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:44,690
Besides,

314
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,291
the people today

315
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,371
indiscriminately vilified me.

316
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,490
Mother, can you tell me

317
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,010
why the world is so unfair to women?

318
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,771
I've heard you coughing
these past few days,

319
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,650
so I personally cooked pear soup.

320
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,250
Leave it aside.

321
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,170
It will get cold.

322
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,771
Don't do things
that you're not good at again.

323
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,891
Sir,

324
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,490
madam.

325
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:07,891
Is there anything else?

326
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,291
I will take my leave now.

327
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:17,450
How is it?

328
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,571
Don't worry, sir.

329
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,771
Wang Liulang is a punk.

330
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:25,010
As long as you give him money,
he will do anything.

331
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,930
Has it spread out?

332
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,970
Such romantic affairs
always spread the fastest.

333
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,690
Now the whole city knows.

334
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:40,170
Get more witnesses from Chen County

335
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,410
and add fuel to the fire.

336
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:43,331
Yes.

337
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,490
Wait.

338
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,490
Take this down.

339
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:58,578
(Heifeng Camp)

340
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,811
Brother, you are seriously ill.

341
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,450
Don't force yourself. Take the medicine.

342
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,210
Because of my illness,

343
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:15,970
I almost got our men into trouble.

344
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:19,291
Brother, what are you talking about?

345
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,210
If you hadn't taken us in,

346
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:23,690
we don't know where we'd have been?

347
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,490
To get herbs,

348
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:27,490
even if it's the emperor's escort,

349
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:29,371
we must rob.

350
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,531
Thanks to Captain Liu last time,

351
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,291
we barely managed to settle the matter

352
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,170
with the Sun family.

353
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,010
I'm afraid the Changfeng Escort Agency

354
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,650
won't let it go easily this time.

355
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,571
You need to plan ahead.

356
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:44,930
We'll fight them if necessary!

357
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,891
You're badly injured.

358
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,730
How did you escape?

359
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:51,650
I'm okay.

360
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,811
At that time, a young lady helped me.

361
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,730
Speaking of which, I'm very angry.

362
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:01,250
She kindly saved

363
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,131
my life,

364
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,930
yet she was wronged by a bunch of women
who accused us of being adulterers.

365
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,091
I don't hit women.

366
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,611
Otherwise, I would give each one a cut.

367
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:10,970
Who's that lady? Is she pretty?

368
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,571
Shut up.

369
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,970
She is my savior.

370
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:16,930
You

371
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,170
must have troubled her a lot.

372
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,170
If this spreads out in the future,

373
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,331
it will be difficult
for her to get married.

374
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,571
Is it that serious?

375
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,250
You guys,

376
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,170
gather up all my belongings.

377
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

378
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:48,331
Open the door. Is anyone in there?

379
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,531
Come out!

380
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,891
- I'm coming. Be gentle.
- Open the door.

381
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:57,266
(Lin's Pharmacy)

382
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,371
What are you here for now?

383
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:06,091
Didn't you say last time
you wanted evidence?

384
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,250
I've brought all the witnesses over.

385
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,490
If you don't get me satisfied today,

386
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:11,771
I'm not leaving.

387
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:15,250
These people are all from Chen County.

388
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:18,131
This is the servant of Yang Sanlang.

389
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,930
This is Lin Rulan's previous maid.

390
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:23,371
This is the wet nurse who caught them.

391
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,811
Come on, just tell everyone

392
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,250
how Lin Rulan seduced Yang Sanlang.

393
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,131
Stop lying.

394
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,091
At that time, my young master
was drinking tea in a teahouse.

395
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:33,131
Get lost.

396
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:33,851
He's hitting!

397
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:35,371
So what if I hit you?

398
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,851
How can you hit people?

399
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,771
Hitting me in broad daylight?

400
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,650
I'll report you.

401
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,571
Go ahead!

402
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,410
Stop!

403
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,410
May I ask who you are, sir?

404
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,650
I am Feng Da of Heifeng Camp.

405
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,051
I'm here to propose a marriage.

406
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,291
What did you say?

407
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,771
Propose what?

408
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,771
A marriage proposal.

409
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:56,930
Marriage proposal?

410
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,970
This is all my belongings,
and can be used as betrothal gifts

411
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:01,250
to repay my savior.

412
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,771
So it's you.

413
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,891
You dare to come here?

414
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:05,650
Haven't you done enough to my sister?

415
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:07,051
No, I just...

416
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,650
The trouble before was caused by me.

417
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,091
I hate being indebted
to others the most.

418
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,611
They all say I ruined her reputation

419
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:14,650
and affected her marriage,

420
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,930
so I'm here to repay the favor.

421
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,690
Fine, none of you are good people.

422
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,210
You think my family are pushovers?

423
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,611
Stay put.

424
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:27,730
I'll beat you to death. I...

425
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:33,531
Let go. Who told you to stop him?

426
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:34,690
He is my savior's brother.

427
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,851
If he wants to fight, let him do it.

428
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,250
Come on.

429
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,091
So you're the adulterer too.

430
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,250
How shameless.

431
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,531
So Lin Rulan is truly shameless.

432
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,170
- Shameless.
- Truly shameless.

433
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:50,410
Not only did she frame Mr. Wu,

434
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,531
but she also seduced
this bandit to come to propose.

435
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,851
Doesn't your foot hurt?

436
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,331
Isn't that enough for you?

437
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:56,930
Don't hit him.

438
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,851
Stop it.

439
00:23:58,331 --> 00:23:59,331
Stop it.

440
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,571
Rulan.

441
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:05,091
Lin Rulan,

442
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,771
you'll see. This matter isn't over.

443
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,730
- Go.
- Go.

444
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,851
Get lost!

445
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,730
You too!

446
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:22,051
All of you, leave.

447
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,771
Disperse, everyone.

448
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:27,091
Go away.

449
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,970
Lang, you go inside.

450
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,091
I...

451
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,410
Savior,

452
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,690
did I cause you trouble again?

453
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:48,891
Not your fault.

454
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,851
It's just their plot.

455
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,131
It's okay. You can go.

456
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,730
Don't come again.

457
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,851
No way.

458
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:59,650
The trouble before was caused by me.

459
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,531
You can come back with me.

460
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,650
Come to Heifeng Camp and be my wife.

461
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,291
I guarantee no one will bully you there.

462
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,571
That's right. Come back with us.

463
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,891
- Come back with us.
- Come back with us.

464
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,891
I know you mean well,

465
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,571
but it has nothing to do with you.

466
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:18,891
Even if those things hadn't happened,

467
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,811
they would still spread other rumors.

468
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,010
I...

469
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,891
If you still want
to show me your appreciation,

470
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,170
just leave.

471
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,930
Leave.

472
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,051
Alright.

473
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,131
I'll do it as you wish.

474
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:36,891
I'll take my leave.

475
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,930
Move. Carry these back.

476
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:03,154
(Jichun Clinic)

477
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,331
This indicates a pregnancy.

478
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,891
It doesn't seem to make you happy.

479
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:27,450
If you want to abort,
you need to do it early.

480
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:30,371
The cost of the prescription
will be calculated separately.

481
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,291
Want it?

482
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,771
This is where I left off last time.

483
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,970
The young lady had
a scandalous affair with Mr. Cao.

484
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,611
It's quite amazing.

485
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:45,851
The book subtly suggests

486
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,531
that the young lady was once engaged.

487
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:54,051
Ordinary people couldn't catch her eye.

488
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,690
She had her eyes on the son
of the county magistrate.

489
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:01,371
But it was not that easy

490
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,250
to marry the offspring
of a county magistrate.

491
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,650
So she came up with a plan.

492
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,771
Taking advantage
of the man and his friend's outing,

493
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:16,371
she threw herself at him.

494
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:19,131
- Good.
- Good storyteller.

495
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,490
It's the same thing over and over.

496
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,410
These are all you have?

497
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,611
Miss Gao, we just got a batch
of new goods from the capital.

498
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:32,771
Do you want to take a look?

499
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,531
Why didn't you show them to me earlier?

500
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,450
You think I can't afford them?

501
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:39,690
How could I possibly think that?

502
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,331
You are our big customer.

503
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,410
Would you like to come upstairs
with me to take a look?

504
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,091
Take your time and choose carefully.

505
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,851
What are you waiting for?

506
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,010
This way, please.

507
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:00,930
What are you doing here?

508
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,170
I'm helping Miss Gao choose some rouge.

509
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:05,331
It will take some time.

510
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,611
Ladies, don't worry.
Please take your time.

511
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,250
No one will disturb you.

512
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,650
What are you going to do?

513
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,010
You're so angry,

514
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,410
because Wu Lian didn't marry you, right?

515
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,410
You've already given yourself to him.

516
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,250
What nonsense are you talking about?

517
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:30,891
I don't understand.

518
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,690
Remember the day
when Rulan burst into your room?

519
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,730
She went to see your bed sheet.

520
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,771
What's wrong with the bed sheet?

521
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,170
You don't know yet.

522
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,331
Once a girl sleeps with Wu Lian,

523
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,970
her bed sheet needs to be changed
from silk one to linen one.

524
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:50,531
That's the day I found out

525
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,410
that you were the same.

526
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,571
Who's the same as you?

527
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,051
I'm different from Lin Rulan.

528
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,730
She seduced Mr. Wu first.

529
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,650
How can that girl be compared with me?

530
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,450
My relationship with him
is more than you can understand.

531
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,291
What are you laughing at?

532
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:15,250
Did he also tell you

533
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,010
that you were unique

534
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,970
and that no one could replace you?

535
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,811
That's a fact.

536
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,571
I'm pregnant.

537
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,490
He said the same to me.

538
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,450
I refused,

539
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,250
but he forced me.

540
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,571
Impossible.

541
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,970
How could he possibly care
for someone lowly like you?

542
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,091
Who do you think you are?

543
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,531
You're right.

544
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:44,051
You are from the Gao family.

545
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,410
Even if you were to marry,
it should be a match in terms of status.

546
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,371
You should have been someone's wife.

547
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,891
But now you're the same as us.

548
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:57,531
You're just a bed sheet
used and discarded by Wu Lian.

549
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:58,650
Shut up.

550
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:00,730
Because in Wu Lian's eyes,
we're all the same.

551
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,210
We are just targets of his hunt.

552
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,490
He mentioned you to me.

553
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:08,811
He said that young ladies
from noble families

554
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,611
were the most boring

555
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:13,650
and thought that all the men
in the world were attracted by them,

556
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,611
making them more boring.

557
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,250
That bad guy.

558
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,611
I'll kill him.

559
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,811
Would you let him
just toy with your feelings

560
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:30,811
and get away with it?

561
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:33,250
Don't you want him to pay the price?

562
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,690
As long as you vouch

563
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,051
for Rulan in the court,

564
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,730
Wu Lian will surely lose.

565
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,730
Why should I do it for Lin Rulan?

566
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,970
I haven't settled a score
for that slap yet.

567
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,571
I can take it for her.

568
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:48,250
You don't think I will do it?

569
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,571
You will.

570
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,131
You've done so much for her.

571
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:08,650
Do you owe her?

572
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,091
Yes, I do.

573
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,891
Are you sure my presence in court

574
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,091
will reveal his true colors?

575
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:26,811
I'll go too.

576
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:30,051
The more people, the better the odds.

577
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:33,410
Then I'll trust you this time.

578
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,611
Wan.

579
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,331
Mr. Yang.

580
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,771
Wan, where did you go
early in the morning?

581
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,571
I bought some makeup.

582
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,730
I'll go back to my room.

583
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,611
Father, are you tired

584
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:00,690
from carrying this bucket?

585
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:01,811
No, I'm not.

586
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:04,811
(Yanyu Tower)

587
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:06,210
You have a headache today.

588
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,611
You should go to bed early.

589
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,410
Is the light in the study still on?

590
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,930
Yes.

591
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,091
Go get the invigorating plaster
prescribed by Physician Lin.

592
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:23,690
But didn't he tell you

593
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,970
not to use it too often?

594
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,611
Go.

595
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,490
Let the cook keep that sweet soup warm.

596
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,410
If the master comes, he can drink it.

597
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:50,851
But the master...

598
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,531
He hasn't stepped into this room
for more than a month.

599
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,571
You'd better go to bed early.

600
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,331
But what if the master comes later?

601
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,051
Do as I said.

602
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,291
Yes.

603
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,010
Master.

604
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,210
Husband.

605
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:19,490
I couldn't sleep due to some annoyance,

606
00:33:20,851 --> 00:33:21,811
so I came here.

607
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,611
Bring the sweet soup

608
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:25,611
and a basin of hot water.

609
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:26,531
Yes.

610
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:33,650
Are you worried about Lin Rulan's case?

611
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,490
The Lin family did not
accept the betrothal gifts.

612
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,531
I'm afraid there will be
a court hearing in a few days.

613
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:44,490
The rumors in the city
are rampant these days.

614
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:47,091
I guess the Lin family
aren't having a good time either.

615
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,331
If I personally visit them
to show my sincerity,

616
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,331
I believe they will reconsider it.

617
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,210
I'm afraid

618
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,331
you may feel aggrieved.

619
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,291
It's my pleasure
to relieve your worries.

620
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:11,811
I won't disappoint you.

621
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,610
I suddenly remembered

622
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,651
there is an unfinished draft.

623
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,130
I'll return to my study.

624
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:25,130
But it's already so late.

625
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,211
Go to bed early.

626
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,371
Master.

627
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,202
(Lin's Pharmacy)

628
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,171
You both know

629
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,771
I hail from the Zhang family
of Huaizhou,

630
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,811
which has three Prime Ministers.

631
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,851
I have received a good education.

632
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,410
There's no such a filthy thing
in Wu's house,

633
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,291
and I won't mistreat Rulan.

634
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,610
In that case,

635
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:04,610
I would like to ask you.

636
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,570
Why do you help that villain?

637
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:09,771
How can you stand by
and watch those girls

638
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,490
being harmed by Wu Lian?

639
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:12,651
Rulan.

640
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:16,371
You are still young,

641
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,331
and there are many things
you don't understand.

642
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,731
I don't.

643
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,530
I don't understand
why someone can tolerate

644
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:26,251
their husband committing
such shameless acts

645
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,851
and come here to speak for him.

646
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,490
We are both women.

647
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,171
I'm just a few years older than you.

648
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:37,211
There are some things

649
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:40,251
that not only you have encountered.

650
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,891
But we must move on.

651
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,490
You're lucky to have parents

652
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:50,530
who love you.

653
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,130
But they can't support you
for a lifetime.

654
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,211
You have a good brother,

655
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:57,171
but he will have to
get married eventually.

656
00:35:57,731 --> 00:36:01,530
No woman wants to support
her sister-in-law for a lifetime.

657
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:03,211
Marriage

658
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,811
is the only destiny for a woman.

659
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,651
You can't shave your head
and become a nun.

660
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,530
I would rather be a nun.

661
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,291
If Miss Lin marries...

662
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:58,731
Wang Liulang is a good-for-nothing,

663
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,130
and he has gambled away
his family's property.

664
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,291
Marrying him would be seeking death.

665
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:08,891
I just told you.

666
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,410
My husband doesn't have many concubines,

667
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,490
and I won't make it difficult for her.

668
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,530
Miss Lin won't have to serve
her parents-in-law

669
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,331
or me.

670
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,371
If she doesn't want to come out,

671
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,490
she can live her own life in the yard.

672
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,211
This is the best choice.

673
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,090
Rulan is still young.

674
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,291
She doesn't understand many things.

675
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,651
But I believe you two understand

676
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,410
what I said are heartfelt words.

677
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,811
I don't have children.

678
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:41,371
If it were my daughter,

679
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,530
I would plan for her

680
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,610
rather than fight for a temporary win.

681
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,331
You have one day to consider.

682
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:01,691
If you don't want to,

683
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,771
the Wu family won't force you.

684
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,371
But if that's the case,

685
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,331
we'll have to confront
Miss Lin in court.

686
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,450
Regardless of the result,

687
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,610
you surely understand

688
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,891
what it means for a woman.

689
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,331
The old lady sent
someone again to ask you

690
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,891
to return to the mansion right away.

691
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,331
Go to Zhang's mansion.

692
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:41,570
Take it slow.

693
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,851
I can't take your case.

694
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,651
What happened?

695
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,010
That day, before I took your money,

696
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,891
I asked you

697
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,530
if there was anything hidden.

698
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:02,691
What did you say to me?

699
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,211
I have absolutely no secrets.

700
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:07,130
Then why didn't you mention a word
about what happened in Chen County?

701
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,010
It has nothing to do with our case.

702
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,171
You tried to seduce the magistrate's son
and vilified him.

703
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,331
It is exactly like the case

704
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,371
of the Yanyu Tower.

705
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:20,171
If it happens only once,

706
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,970
some people may believe
you are innocent.

707
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:24,891
But for a woman
who has had the same thing

708
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:27,691
happen to her many times and even had
an affair with a bandit in a temple,

709
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,651
no one will believe her words.

710
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:32,251
Your case is doomed to lose.

711
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,251
And what about you?

712
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,930
Do you believe me?

713
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,010
You're my litigator.

714
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:45,811
If even you don't believe me,

715
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,490
how can you prove my innocence?

716
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,211
There's no such thing
as baseless rumors.

717
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,450
No smoke without fire.

718
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,731
I am wronged by you.

719
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:08,731
Help!

720
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,010
Help!

721
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:12,771
If I tell other people now

722
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,090
that you want to harass me,

723
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,050
does that also count
as no smoke without fire?

724
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,771
How could you do this?

725
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:22,251
At first, I thought
a well-read, discerning litigator

726
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,171
like you

727
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,930
would be different from others.

728
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,171
But it turns out

729
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:30,851
you're the same.

730
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:37,080
(Zhang's Mansion)

731
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,691
(Legacy of Virtue)
What's with all the rumors

732
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,771
in the prefecture?

733
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,050
It's just a girl.

734
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:48,530
I just visited the Lin family.

735
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:51,211
She will be brought into the harem soon.

736
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:55,291
Rong'er,

737
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:58,851
you're the legitimate eldest daughter
of our family.

738
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:00,691
Putting everything else aside,

739
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,610
(Zhang's Mother)
even those from humble families

740
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:08,010
don't have the wife personally
take in a concubine for her husband.

741
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,251
That's why

742
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,371
my personal involvement carries weight.

743
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:19,610
Otherwise,
the Lin family wouldn't relent.

744
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,930
So what that girl said is true?

745
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,490
Mother, don't worry about these things.

746
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:34,530
Either way,
it's just taking in another woman.

747
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,771
We were at fault
with that matter back then.

748
00:41:46,331 --> 00:41:48,851
Fortunately, Wu Lian didn't notice.

749
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:51,691
But you still don't have any children.

750
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,291
This is really hard to explain.

751
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,291
Just accept the concubine.

752
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,490
You should now focus
on getting your real work done.

753
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,970
Still no good news?

754
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:26,130
This is a prescription
that I entrusted someone to find.

755
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:29,371
It's said to have come
out of the palace.

756
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,691
It has a miraculous effect
on helping women conceive.

757
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,930
You should know

758
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,651
having a child
is the basis for a secure life.

759
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:45,251
You also have to figure out ways

760
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:48,010
to get him to visit
your room more often.

761
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,930
Why don't you say anything?

762
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,891
What's the matter?

763
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,490
Does Wu Lian treat you badly?

764
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:09,851
Mother,

765
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:12,490
he knows.

766
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,331
He's known all along.

767
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,050
From the day we were married,

768
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,090
he's known everything.

769
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:24,331
No prescription would work.

770
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,251
Oh my goodness.

771
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:28,811
I don't understand.

772
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:34,651
It was clearly my cousin
who was engaged to me,

773
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,171
and deceived me and took my virginity.

774
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:39,851
But why?

775
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,691
Why did I end up like this?

776
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,010
Why?

777
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,130
But

778
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:52,811
we can't let the reputation

779
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:57,530
of our family be stained.

780
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:15,651
I know

781
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:20,090
I have brought shame to our family.

782
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:27,371
I am already very content

783
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,410
to have my husband accept me.

784
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:46,354
(Yanyu Tower)

785
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:49,530
Husband,

786
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:53,891
the Lin family would
accept the betrothal gifts soon.

787
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,090
Thank you.

788
00:44:57,771 --> 00:45:02,130
I had the cooks prepare dinner.

789
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:05,811
Will you be sleeping in my room tonight?

790
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,530
I won't disturb you.

791
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,930
Wan,

792
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:30,891
drink the sweet soup.

793
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:36,891
Wan, Cheng has come
to Huaizhou Prefecture.

794
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:41,490
He's your aunt's eldest son.

795
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:45,731
Ever since I married your father,

796
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:48,130
I have had little contact
with my family.

797
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,930
We must seize the opportunity this time.

798
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,891
Seize what opportunity?

799
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,610
It's about your marriage.

800
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,771
Cheng is the most promising one
in your maternal family.

801
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,490
I haven't seen him
for five or six years.

802
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:04,090
What does it matter?

803
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:07,050
This is a good chance
to get to know each other.

804
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,050
Wan,

805
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,811
I've inquired.

806
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,530
Cheng will only stay
in Huaizhou Prefecture for a few days.

807
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,771
I'll invite him home someday...

808
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:25,651
Or not.

809
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:29,251
I'll treat him
to a meal at a restaurant.

810
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,410
Cheng is a famous litigator now.

811
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,211
He is a litigator?

812
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,211
Yes, he's doing very well.

813
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,891
Being a litigator may not be
as glamorous as being an official,

814
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,050
but it's practical.

815
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:49,691
All those rich merchants
and local gentry

816
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:51,490
are eager to befriend him.

817
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,171
If you marry him,
you'll definitely enjoy a good life.

818
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:58,050
Where does he live now?

819
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:01,291
Your uncle bought a house in Huaizhou

820
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,891
when he was doing business.

821
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,371
Where is it?

822
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,251
Good, you should be proactive like this.

823
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:12,090
But you must take it slow.

824
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,331
Don't let him think we're too eager.

825
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:17,691
Got it.

826
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:21,930
These days,

827
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,570
I've been holding everyone back.

828
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,090
After I pass away,

829
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,090
you guys

830
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:34,691
divide the things in the Camp

831
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:37,930
and go down the mountain.

832
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,930
Find a proper job,

833
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,731
marry a wife and live a good life.

834
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,291
Brother, you're fine.

835
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,171
- Brother.
- Master, you're okay.

836
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,130
- You'll be okay.
- You'll be okay.

837
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,171
I know

838
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:58,291
my condition.

839
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,610
Anyway, with you as my buddies,

840
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:03,090
my life is worth it.

841
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:08,371
I will die soon.
There's nothing to regret.

842
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,291
Brother,

843
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,851
help me put it on.

844
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:27,851
Bad news, master.

845
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:28,891
Bad news.

846
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,371
People from the Changfeng Escort Agency
are outside.

847
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,651
Guys, grab your weapons!

848
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,251
Rulan,

849
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:56,731
I have a cousin.

850
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,050
He's a rather famous litigator
in the Guang provinces.

851
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,211
He happens to be
in Huaizhou Prefecture today.

852
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,490
Let's go ask him for help now.

853
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:05,010
I don't need you to help me.

854
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:10,651
I found a new witness.

855
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,851
Gao Chengcheng will testify in court.

856
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,570
Why would she?

857
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,851
People always have weaknesses.

858
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,731
Well, forget about those things.

859
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:24,970
As long as we find a litigator

860
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,090
and the new witness,

861
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,171
we can ask for a retrial.

862
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,691
My mother said
he wouldn't stay here for long.

863
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:30,731
We need to hurry.

864
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,771
You think
I haven't looked for a litigator before?

865
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,970
I've gone to all the litigators

866
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,851
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

867
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,691
They either worry
about their reputation being ruined

868
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:46,090
or want to take advantage

869
00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:49,450
and don't believe I'm innocent.

870
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:53,410
What's the use of such a litigator?

871
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,010
So, you're planning to give up?

872
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,171
I struck the drum recklessly.

873
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,891
My parents closed their shop for me.

874
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,171
My brother

875
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,331
can't become Physician Lin's apprentice.

876
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,771
But Wu Lian only needs
to pay Wang Liulang

877
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,371
to let all my efforts be in vain

878
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,651
and let all the people
in Huaizhou Prefecture

879
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:20,450
think that I am a dissolute woman.

880
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,490
Isn't it ridiculous?

881
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,090
It's a tough road.

882
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:31,331
Perhaps you were right.

883
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,291
If we could go back to the start,

884
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,490
I'd still say the same thing

885
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,130
and try my utmost to persuade you.

886
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,211
But things are different now.

887
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,050
The drum has sounded
and the petition has been filed.

888
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,691
If you back down and give up now,

889
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:48,930
you would be admitting
to those absurd rumors.

890
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:50,891
You're right.

891
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:52,930
I shouldn't give up.

892
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,050
Even if there's little hope,

893
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:56,691
I should give it a try.

894
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,331
Let's go.

895
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:03,211
Where do we go?

896
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,490
To visit my cousin. Let's go.

897
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,651
Haven't I told you

898
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,331
our master doesn't see guests?

899
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:13,811
Miss,

900
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,291
I am Mr. Zhao's cousin.

901
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:19,050
I really need to see him today,

902
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,771
so could you please inform him for me?

903
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,371
What cousin?

904
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,331
Many people wanted to see our master,

905
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:27,010
and they all claimed
some kind of relationship.

906
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:29,731
Alright, if you don't let us in,

907
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,570
we'll just wait here.

908
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,371
Mr. Zhao will have to
go out eventually, right?

909
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,450
You...

910
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:36,930
Do it if you want to.

911
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,251
Miss.

912
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:42,610
Please.

913
00:52:43,331 --> 00:52:44,811
What's all the noise about?

914
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,691
Cousin.

915
00:52:47,771 --> 00:52:48,570
(Litigator Zhao Yucheng)
Wan.

916
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:49,731
My mother told me

917
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:51,010
you came to Huaizhou.

918
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:53,450
I hope you don't mind my dropping in

919
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,490
to ask for a favor.

920
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:57,930
I was planning to visit
your mother in the next few days.

921
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,610
Come. Please come in.

922
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,130
Suiyu, brew some tea.

923
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:15,251
Miss Lin,

924
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,691
it's not that I don't trust you,

925
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,130
but I came to Huaizhou Prefecture

926
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,651
to handle some personal matters.

927
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:23,771
I didn't plan to take any cases.

928
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,171
It won't take you too long.

929
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,490
But when I take a case,

930
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:30,291
I always do a thorough investigation.

931
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,090
This time, I'm in a hurry.

932
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,371
And I don't have the time or energy.

933
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,211
I'm also afraid I might impede it.

934
00:53:43,211 --> 00:53:46,050
I'm sorry to have bothered you today.

935
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,211
Cousin,

936
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,090
my mother said
you chose to study law back then.

937
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,291
Yes.

938
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,371
Why?

939
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,691
I wanted to redress the grievances of
the wronged people in the world

940
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,291
and make justice be achieved.

941
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,171
Wu Lian not only humiliates girls,

942
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:08,010
but also distorts the truth.

943
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,090
Is that justice?

944
00:54:10,811 --> 00:54:12,130
For you,

945
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,691
it may be just a mere case.

946
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,530
But for Rulan,

947
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:19,490
this involves her reputation
and innocence for a lifetime.

948
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,490
What will you do

949
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,171
if I refuse?

950
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,570
Even if no litigator takes my case,

951
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,731
I will also file
this lawsuit to the end.

952
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:36,090
If I can't find justice here,
I'll go to the capital.

953
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,490
If that doesn't work,
I'll petition the emperor.

954
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,490
There must be a place

955
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,731
where people can tell the truth.

956
00:54:45,771 --> 00:54:47,530
Do you have any witnesses
to prove what you said?

957
00:54:47,811 --> 00:54:48,691
Yes.

958
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:03,130
Okay. I agree to help you.

959
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,530
You're right.

960
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:11,970
I shall keep original aspiration

961
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:14,410
of studying the law.

962
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,891
Wan, I know

963
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:21,490
there are good people who can tell right
from wrong in the world.

964
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,570
Give me a few days to prepare.

965
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:27,090
You go back.

966
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,490
Just wait for the trial.

967
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,130
As for the payment...

968
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,090
Don't worry.

969
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:33,771
Let's discuss it

970
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,251
after I clear your name.

971
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,050
I hope I won't let you down.

972
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,010
Thank you, cousin.

973
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,410
Savior.

974
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:04,570
What happened?

975
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,010
My brother passed away yesterday.

976
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:10,450
Heifeng Camp was overturned
by the Changfeng Escort Agency.

977
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:13,291
My buddies have also left.

978
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,930
There's no point in me staying here.

979
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:17,251
Before I leave,

980
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:19,691
I just want you to know

981
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:21,171
I still owe you a life.

982
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:24,891
What do you plan to do next?

983
00:56:25,171 --> 00:56:26,651
Anyway, I can rob escorts alone.

984
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,651
I'll go wherever I end up.

985
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,811
But if you need me one day,

986
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:33,891
no matter where I am, I will come.

987
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:38,691
Living day to day
isn't a long-term solution.

988
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,610
But you have martial arts skills

989
00:56:42,771 --> 00:56:44,251
and are well-known among the bandits.

990
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,211
Instead of robbing escorts,
why not join them?

991
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:48,211
Join the escorts?
