1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,610
(7 years ago)

2
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,119
With a strike of the stringed drum,
two sleeves are raised.

3
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,840
Snow drifts back and forth.
A dance is performed.

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,079
(Master Yuan, Yuan Mei)

5
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,439
Fair lady.

6
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,600
Indeed, seeing is believing.

7
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,200
This is indeed a peerless beauty.

8
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,280
Zicai,

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,880
you hide such a peerless beauty
in your house.

10
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,920
You are so mean.

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,399
Well said.

12
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,520
Zicai,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,560
may I borrow this beauty for a few days

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,000
to discipline those clumsy ones
in my mansion?

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,120
What do you think?

16
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,439
How rude.

17
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,200
The women in my house are not objects

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,799
to be borrowed.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,599
Or can I exchange
a few menservants and maids

20
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,079
for her?

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,959
Just enjoy the show.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
Don't talk nonsense.

23
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,840
Please.

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Prefect Chen.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Master.

26
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,599
Those people are all lascivious.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,519
You must be careful.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Don't worry.

29
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
I can handle them.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
You must be Prefect Chen.

31
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,680
Yes, I am.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Please.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,759
You are comparable
to Venus when you dance.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,759
Why should I compare myself with Venus?

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,960
I am who I am.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,479
Well said.

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,000
How can the goddess Venus

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,319
be compared with Sanniang?

39
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,479
Yes.

40
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,199
Hu,

41
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,039
don't let your daughter
learn embroidery.

42
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,280
It'd be nice to learn
some dancing from Sanniang.

43
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,000
Nonsense.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
A few drinks

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
and your brain's not working?

46
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,039
Talking nonsense.

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,639
Hu,

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
which school
is your daughter going to study?

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,199
Which else could it be? The Yanyu Tower.

50
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,280
She'd better not learn it.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,039
Why?

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,319
Well, just listen to me.

53
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,449
I watched Xiaoyu growing up.

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,850
I won't harm her.

55
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:05,650
There are only us.

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,370
If you have something
to say, just say it.

57
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,769
Is Wu Lian going to fall?

58
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:13,609
Not that bad.

59
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,370
He has Mrs. Ning to support him.

60
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,289
But a few days ago,
I received a complaint

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,489
accusing Wu Lian

62
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,449
of rape.

63
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,410
Prefect Chen.

64
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,449
Prefect Chen.

65
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,690
The case at the Yanyu Tower...

66
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,289
What case?

67
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,449
I misremembered.

68
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,850
(Douhua)

69
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,009
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

70
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,329
Only you today?

71
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,090
My girl went out

72
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,810
of town to collect beans.

73
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:07,489
I am

74
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,090
almost overwhelmed.

75
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,009
I'd like a bowl of douhua.

76
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,090
Go ahead.

77
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,090
Alright.

78
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,049
Mr. Liu.

79
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,570
It's been days,

80
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,809
but still no news about my case.

81
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:26,970
When will Prefect Chen hold court?

82
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,530
Miss Lin,

83
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,450
I do want to help,

84
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,970
but with no witness or other evidence,

85
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,090
we really can't accept the case.

86
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:38,489
Am I not a witness?

87
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,650
In such cases, both parties
often hold their own views.

88
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,169
If you can't find any other proof,

89
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,010
how does Prefect Chen handle it?

90
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,929
In my opinion...

91
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:49,890
I'll find it.

92
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,450
I'll find the evidence.

93
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:31,824
=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

94
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,986
=Episode 5, Chapter 3, Part 1=
(Lin Rulan Beats the Drum of Injustice)

95
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,338
I believe you.

96
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:09,138
Ding Ru

97
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,859
was driven to her death.

98
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,939
You know it?

99
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,338
Yes.

100
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:23,778
I know all about it.

101
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:28,539
Because I

102
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,578
experienced the same thing.

103
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,138
It's a sin,

104
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,059
truly a sin.

105
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,979
Both I and Ding Ru

106
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,018
are victims.

107
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,658
Someone must expose
what happened at the Yanyu Tower

108
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,138
to show Wu Lian's true colors

109
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,819
and seek justice for ourselves.

110
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,979
You are going to...

111
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,098
I already submitted a petition

112
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:17,859
to report all of Wu Lian's wrongdoing.

113
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:21,179
But I need witnesses
and physical evidence.

114
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,939
If you are willing
to testify in court...

115
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:25,979
Absurd!

116
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:28,939
Taking this matter to the public court.

117
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:30,939
What a disgrace!

118
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,539
Seeking justice?

119
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,299
What is justice?

120
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,059
She's dead.

121
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,059
Do we need to tarnish her name again?

122
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,819
Aren't the rumors bad enough?

123
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,539
My Ru was clearly forced,

124
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,819
yet they're making it
sound so disgraceful now.

125
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:53,899
My niece, Yuan,

126
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:57,059
had her engagement canceled due to it.

127
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,019
If this goes to court,

128
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,498
all the girls in my family will have to

129
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:04,059
shave their heads and become nuns.

130
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,299
That is exactly

131
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,498
why the truth should be revealed, right?

132
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,378
Only in this way, can they understand

133
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,139
it wasn't Ding Ru's fault.

134
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:19,498
And only in this way,

135
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:21,779
can you restore Dings' reputation.

136
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,098
Do you think

137
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:27,378
clarifying the truth
can change anything?

138
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,338
Our family will just become

139
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,698
a topic of conversation
in the prefecture.

140
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:38,019
I just hope that
this matter can blow over quickly

141
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:41,019
and not cause any more trouble.

142
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,978
Ru is dead.

143
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,939
I can't let her
carry this stigma forever.

144
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,059
You...

145
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:50,738
If Ru had been willing
to tell the truth,

146
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,498
she wouldn't have ended up
choosing death.

147
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:59,899
She was my own daughter.

148
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,939
Her death hurt me more than anyone else.

149
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,779
But people can't be so selfish.

150
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:09,498
She is gone,

151
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,939
but those who are alive
still continue to live.

152
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,659
People must accept their fate.

153
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,779
It's just that my daughter was unlucky.

154
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:30,139
I hope that in her next life,
she can be a man.

155
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,698
You leave and don't come back again.

156
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,858
We just want to live a peaceful life.

157
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,019
It was never our fault.

158
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:06,419
Why should we accept it?

159
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,059
Since the world is unjust,

160
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,819
then we must fight

161
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,978
for ourselves.

162
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,978
May I ask if you are Miss Lin?

163
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:27,978
I am.

164
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,498
(Maid Chan)
My lady would like to speak with you.

165
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,498
My lady, she is here.

166
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:49,698
You're here.

167
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,539
Sit.

168
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:08,498
This is

169
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:10,659
wine?

170
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,378
Men can eat meat and drink heavily.

171
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,858
Why should women
only sip tea and embroider?

172
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,139
I refuse to conform.

173
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:25,978
I didn't expect that the one
who accused Wu Lian

174
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,858
would be a young girl like you.

175
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:30,738
Who are you?

176
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,299
How do you know about it?

177
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,698
After you entered the school,

178
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,179
did he first belittle your skills?

179
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,738
If you leave here later,

180
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:43,299
don't tell others you're from here.

181
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,899
To make you queasy and self-blame.

182
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:50,139
Then under the pretext of teaching,

183
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:52,059
he approached you privately.

184
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:53,899
Your hand isn't strong enough

185
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,059
to hold the needle well.

186
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,698
Making you feel deeply grateful,

187
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,858
making you even more eager

188
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,978
to work hard to satisfy him.

189
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,539
He also told you that you were talented,

190
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:08,378
but not working hard enough.

191
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,659
So he had an excuse

192
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,498
to go even further with you.

193
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,059
How do you know all this so clearly?

194
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,698
That's all he's got.

195
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,498
Whether a noble lady

196
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,978
or a common girl,

197
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:24,819
he just needs variations

198
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,019
to get her.

199
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:29,578
Did you also...?

200
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,378
He is not that capable.

201
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:35,858
You are gorgeous.

202
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,819
So are your embroidery pieces.

203
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:44,539
Beautiful,

204
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,939
but lacking some charm.

205
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:48,899
What's lacking?

206
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:51,858
You will understand later.

207
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,098
This is a bit inconvenient.

208
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,378
How about I help you undress?

209
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:22,059
I should have killed him

210
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,299
to stop him from hurting so many girls.

211
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,498
You are

212
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,578
smarter than me.

213
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:30,819
We're different.

214
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:35,378
I grew up in a geisha house.

215
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,419
I had seen enough as a girl,

216
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,338
so Wu Lian's sweet words

217
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:42,779
couldn't deceive me.

218
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,338
He just knows that the girls
who enter the embroidery school

219
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:48,498
are all inexperienced,

220
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,659
so he uses those means.

221
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:53,978
It was not your fault.

222
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:00,498
I know.

223
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:07,019
Do you know what you are facing?

224
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,539
Now even the reputation
of Huaizhou Prefecture

225
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:13,019
benefits somewhat from the Yanyu Tower.

226
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,458
The road ahead

227
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:18,939
might be harder than you imagine.

228
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,098
So what?

229
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:24,179
I don't believe there is no justice.

230
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,779
Everyone says I won't succeed.

231
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:29,819
I don't believe it.

232
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,659
Good, well said.

233
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,299
I will testify in court about this

234
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,698
to do my part.

235
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,698
Most women are afraid
of ruining their reputations.

236
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,218
I wanted to learn embroidery.

237
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:50,698
Every time I brought it up,

238
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,858
I would be beaten by my master.

239
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,378
In a geisha house,
singing was what I should do.

240
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:58,338
Later, I stole some money of my master

241
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,419
and entered the Yanyu Tower.

242
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:04,618
After hurting Wu Lian, I ran away.

243
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,419
Soon I met a trafficker who sold me

244
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,139
to the Yuan family.

245
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:12,858
Now I am a courtesan of their family.

246
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:16,978
My master is a good person.

247
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:22,659
But Wu Lian should have paid
for what he did long ago.

248
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:24,899
Because

249
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,259
he didn't get his way with me,

250
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,939
I couldn't report him with evidence

251
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,978
and had to wait until today.

252
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,139
You've gone all out.

253
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:35,939
What am I afraid of?

254
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,539
As long as we can expose
Wu Lian's true colors,

255
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,939
it's worth it.

256
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:43,618
Now,

257
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:45,059
I have a witness.

258
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,419
Tomorrow I will go to see Mr. Liu.

259
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:49,779
Good.

260
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:52,419
Cheers.

261
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,138
You have fair skin.

262
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:24,019
This shade suits you best.

263
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:28,459
Master,

264
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:33,299
you gave me back my deed of sale,

265
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,539
saying I could leave at any time.

266
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,259
Does this still count?

267
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,259
What do you mean by this?

268
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:46,098
Master,

269
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:48,499
I'm destined to drift.

270
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:51,378
If you hadn't sheltered me,

271
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,979
I don't know where I would have been.

272
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:57,779
You taught me poetry, music,
calligraphy and painting.

273
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:00,858
I have all these in my heart.

274
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,059
I am a courtesan,

275
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,578
but you have never forced me

276
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,819
to do anything I don't want to do,

277
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,178
so I can keep my chastity.

278
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:12,618
It is my blessing

279
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,819
to meet you.

280
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:20,578
Sanniang,

281
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:22,819
I have told you.

282
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,378
It isn't I who sheltered you,

283
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,938
but you who have accompanied me,

284
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,578
making my boring life more lively.

285
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:34,338
If something's happened,

286
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,259
don't hide it from me.

287
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:40,059
Master,

288
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:42,779
there is something,

289
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,019
I have to do.

290
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,779
If someone asks in the future,

291
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,098
just answer I have long left

292
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:56,779
and have no ties with you.

293
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:58,259
Sanniang,

294
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,138
what exactly are you going to do?

(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)

296
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,178
Captain Liu,

297
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:40,459
you said I needed
witnesses and evidence.

298
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,178
I didn't find much proof,

299
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:43,658
but I got a witness.

300
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,658
Can the Yamen accept this now?

301
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:47,858
Miss Lin,

302
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,618
you are a young woman
who has had it tough,

303
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:53,219
so I'll be frank.

304
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:55,858
You should give up

305
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,138
on this case.

306
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:00,779
Go home.

307
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:03,138
Get married and live a good life.

308
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:06,699
After I seek justice,

309
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,819
I will naturally do it.

310
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:14,338
Then you may not be able to do it.

311
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:16,499
You weren't like this

when taking my hairpin.

313
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:18,699
No justice!

314
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,578
Isn't it because you're dissolute?

can turn the world upside down.

330
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:37,539

00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:33,858
Sir, the Yamen...

346
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:35,499
Wu An has informed me.

347
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:38,178
I'm going there.

348
00:22:38,418 --> 00:22:39,219
Is it serious?

349
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,098
Should I go back

350
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:43,019
to ask my parents for help?

351
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:51,138
No need.

352
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,259
When have your parents
ever truly respected me?

353
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,378
Every time we go to Zhang's mansion,

354
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:00,819
don't they just pay me lip service?

355
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:03,578
If I have to ask for help

356
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,699
from your family
for such a minor matter,

357
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,338
won't it be a joke?

358
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,578
Right,

359
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,059
have someone prepare
a room in the backyard.

360
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:26,178
I got it.

361
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:31,699
In our city, who doesn't know
about Mr. Wu's character?

362
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,378
It's absolutely impossible.

363
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,378
Mr. Wu is here.

364
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,739
The young woman in the court
seems firm in her speech.

365
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,098
It doesn't seem like she's lying.

366
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:41,618
Yeah,

367
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:43,618
which woman would joke
about her reputation?

368
00:23:57,098 --> 00:23:59,499
Prefect Chen.

369
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,539
Mr. Wu, you're here.

370
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,059
Take a look at this first.

371
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,539
This Miss Lin

372
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:16,578
said that during her time
at the Yanyu Tower,

373
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,618
she was violated by you.

374
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,098
Is it true?

375
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:28,578
Yes, it's my fault.

376
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:30,739
What does he mean by that?

377
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,259
Is it true?

378
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,299
So,

379
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,618
you admit it?

380
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:42,898
My school is known
for the Yanyu Embroidery.

381
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,459
I inform every woman in advance

382
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:47,299
when they step inside

383
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:51,979
that they all can learn
excellent embroidery,

384
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:53,898
aside from the Yanyu Embroidery.

385
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:58,618
Half a year ago,
Miss Lin entered my school.

386
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:03,459
She's quite a good learner

387
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,819
and is quite talented.

388
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,019
If it weren't for the rules I had set,

389
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:09,618
the Yanyu Embroidery...

390
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:19,898
Back then, Miss Lin was studying
mandarin duck embroidery,

391
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,539
but she said
she couldn't get the hang of it.

392
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,338
She asked me to guide her
privately several times.

393
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:28,979
Given her talent, I didn't refuse.

394
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:30,938
Every girl in the embroidery school

395
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,338
has a dedicated teacher.

396
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:36,259
I should have said no.

397
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,098
Mandarin ducks are a symbol of love.

398
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:43,739
Miss Lin is young.

399
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:47,299
She didn't understand love,
so naturally, she couldn't do it well.

400
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,378
One day, I returned late from a banquet

401
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:52,699
and was stopped by her outside my study.

402
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:55,219
She asked me to guide her in her room.

403
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:57,858
I wanted her to do it later,

404
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,658
but she was very stubborn,

405
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:04,779
asking me to teach her about love.

406
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:09,898
It was my fault
for having too many drinks.

407
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:14,779
I couldn't refuse her at that moment.

408
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:16,499
You're talking nonsense.

409
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:17,858
What rape?

410
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:19,539
Isn't it clear?

411
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:22,499
In order to learn
his secret Yanyu Embroidery,

412
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:23,819
this woman seduced Mr. Wu.

413
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,938
- Yes.
- Yes.

414
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:27,779
It's just that Mr. Wu is a good man.

415
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,858
If it were me,

416
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:30,578
I would have long since driven her out.

417
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:31,779
Right.

418
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:33,138
Could Mr. Wu do such a thing?

419
00:26:33,178 --> 00:26:33,898
Exactly.

420
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:35,858
How could someone
as elegant and noble as Mr. Wu

421
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,979
do such an unbearable thing?

422
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,658
Right.

423
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:40,819
No matter what,

424
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:42,459
I am a man.

425
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:44,699
I should take responsibility for this.

426
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:48,819
I can take her as my concubine.

427
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,178
Please fulfill this, Prefect Chen.

428
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,578
Make way.

429
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:00,378
- The case is clear now.
- Rulan.

430
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,938
Since Mr. Wu...

431
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,019
I absolutely refuse
to marry him as a concubine.

432
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:05,578
I would rather die

433
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,138
than be in his harem.

434
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,219
It's known to all that Mr. Wu
is highly skilled in embroidery.

435
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:17,378
I also used to admire and respect him.

436
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:19,299
In order to gain his approval,

437
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,338
I practiced tirelessly.

438
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:23,539
But I never thought

439
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:25,019
the person I admired

440
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:27,418
turned out to be
such a shameless person.

441
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,539
He first deceived me
under the pretext of guiding embroidery

442
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:33,138
and made me believe it

443
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,459
and let my guard down.

444
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:36,208
(Justice)
Later, under the pretext

445
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,819
of helping me improve,

446
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:42,138
he raped me

447
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:45,059
and tricked me into believing

448
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,098
that he truly adored me.

449
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,138
Later I told myself

450
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,378
that he might do it
due to a moment of weakness,

451
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:56,178
that what he said might be true,

452
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:57,858
and that I should believe him.

453
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:02,618
Later I realized
everything he said was a lie.

454
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:05,858
Just his way to cover up
his beastly behavior.

455
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:16,299
Silence.

456
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:21,618
Do you have witnesses or evidence?

457
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,779
I am the witness.

458
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,138
Who are you?

459
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:51,138
Mr. Wu,

460
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:53,858
do you still remember me?

461
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,618
Don't you remember me?

462
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,858
When you tried to force yourself on me,

463
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:11,378
I cracked your head open
with a candlestick.

464
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,539
That scar

465
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:16,499
is still there, right?

466
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,138
I guess it's not so easy to forget.

467
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,611
Everyone says Mr. Wu has
unparalleled embroidery skills

468
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:30,371
and wants to send
their daughters to his school.

469
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,411
Little do they know
that the embroidery girls

470
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:36,091
have long been his prey

471
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,331
and under his control.

472
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:42,091
Is that really the case?

473
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,411
This young lady speaks with such detail.

474
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:46,530
It sounds somewhat credible.

475
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,490
I still don't believe it.

476
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,331
Just look at Mr. Wu's face.

477
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,651
How could it be?

478
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,651
What I said in the court
today was not a lie.

479
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,730
Please stand up for me, Prefect Chen.

480
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,171
If you're going to testify for her,

481
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,050
state your identity and name.

482
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,411
My real name is Liu Sannü,

483
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:16,250
now called Liu Sanniang.

484
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,131
I was a courtesan of the Yuan family.

485
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:22,411
Now I have bought my freedom.

486
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,851
Courtesan?

487
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,411
That means a strumpet, right?

488
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:27,770
Exactly. Don't put it nicely.

489
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:28,690
Free?

490
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:30,171
Isn't she still a harlot?

491
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:37,290
What does my status
have to do with this case?

492
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,010
Ridiculous.

493
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,290
How can we take the words
of a harlot seriously?

494
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,371
- Yes.
- Yes.

495
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,571
Now she's saying Mr. Wu violated her.

496
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,171
It's absurd.

497
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:48,010
Agreed.

498
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:50,450
I guess the woman standing next to her

499
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,851
isn't any better.

500
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,290
How could a good girl

501
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,970
be mixed up with this kind of person?

502
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:57,331
That's right. Neither of them is good.

503
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,931
It's slander.

504
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,050
Of course it is.

505
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,050
You can go to investigate

506
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:07,571
everything I've said.

507
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:12,730
I remember when you were at the school,

508
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,611
your skills were excellent.

509
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,571
Why are you ruining yourself now?

510
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,530
Mr. Wu,

511
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,611
you're just too kind-hearted.

512
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:23,571
Why bother with such a person

513
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:24,530
who degrades herself?

514
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,651
It's damaging the reputation
of the Yanyu Tower.

515
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,770
- Yes.
- Yes.

516
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,690
This is clearly a case of the woman
making false accusations against him.

517
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,290
I propose she should be charged
with the crime of false accusation.

518
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:37,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

519
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,611
Lin Rulan,

520
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,050
do you have anything else to say?

521
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,851
There are other victims in the school.

522
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:02,530
Do you know their names?

523
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,171
(Don't be foolish.)

524
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,770
(Once a woman's reputation is ruined,)

525
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,931
(her life is ruined.)

526
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:50,371
I don't.

527
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,331
What is she saying?

528
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,571
Such a big matter,
but not a single word of truth.

529
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:01,450
It's ruining others' reputation.

530
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:19,698
(Jian's Herb Shop)

531
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:23,131
Rulan,

532
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,250
why were you so hasty?

533
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,371
Before charging him,

534
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:29,210
you should be fully prepared.

535
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,091
They said you got a harlot to testify.

536
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,371
What happened?

537
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:34,371
I can vouch for you

538
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,490
if you really need it.

539
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,651
I don't need someone
who treats me like a fool

540
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:40,050
to do it for me.

541
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:43,411
Rulan.

542
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,411
Rulan.

543
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,010
Take care of yourself.

544
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,130
I don't want to see you again.

545
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,291
I told you I didn't...

546
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:24,731
Sanniang.

547
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:30,793
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

548
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:34,082
Fool. It has nothing to do with you.

549
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,202
I was just too stupid.

550
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:51,122
I thought people could
tell right from wrong.

551
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:55,682
I thought
there was still justice in the world.

552
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:57,682
Don't say that.

553
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,642
They just don't know
what you've been through.

554
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,802
Because in their eyes,

555
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:06,722
it doesn't matter.

556
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,162
Whether I wanted it or not,

557
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:15,122
whether I'm still chaste or not,

558
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:16,961
in their eyes,

559
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,162
I'm just a self-degraded and impure.

560
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,282
People like me,

561
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,961
even if they are truly violated,

562
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,841
would just be thought to deserve it.

563
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:30,122
What they think

564
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:32,202
doesn't matter.

565
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:37,802
I'm sorry

566
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:41,202
for dragging down your efforts.

567
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,001
I'm sorry.

568
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:45,202
I dragged you into it.

569
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:47,001
I really appreciate

570
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:48,562
your agreeing to testify.

571
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:51,001
And my case is only postponed
for further trial.

572
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:52,921
There is still a chance.

573
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,881
I'm here to bid you farewell.

574
00:35:57,562 --> 00:35:58,881
You're leaving?

575
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:00,082
It has come this far.

576
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:05,202
My stay will not benefit the trial.

577
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:11,401
Furthermore, I worry
about implicating the Yuan family.

578
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,642
Where are you going?

579
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:15,162
There's anyhow a place

580
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,841
for me in this vast world.

581
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:24,441
Over the years, to maintain
so-called chastity, I had been cautious,

582
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,521
never making a misstep.

583
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:28,521
In the end,

584
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:30,762
what for?

585
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:46,762
Take care of yourself.

586
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,041
You must.

587
00:36:56,082 --> 00:36:57,001
Sanniang,

588
00:36:58,001 --> 00:36:59,481
once you're settled,

589
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:01,961
you must write to me.

590
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:03,881
The day I achieve justice,

591
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:06,401
I will inform you first.

592
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:07,481
Alright.

593
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,441
I'll be looking forward
to your good news.

594
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:23,921
Is it good?

595
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,162
Yeah.

596
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:29,642
I hear discussions everywhere
about the case in the Yamen.

597
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,722
The girl they're talking about
is Miss Lin, isn't it?

598
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:36,401
Yes.

599
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,642
The girl dares to do
what ordinary people dare not.

600
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:42,481
Where did she get such courage?

601
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,961
This case is quite difficult.

602
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,401
Initially, the Yamen did not accept it.

603
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:51,162
But seeing Miss Lin's hardships,

604
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:53,242
I encouraged her to strike the drum.

605
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:56,321
Once the drum is struck,
the Yamen must hold court.

606
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,562
Then I can try my best
to help her seek justice.

607
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,138
I knew you would help her.

608
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:08,498
Well,

609
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:10,899
tonight, at 7:15 PM,

610
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:13,938
I'll wait for you at the bridge.

611
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,498
I need to go back to the Yamen.

612
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,779
Darn it, what are you doing?

613
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:14,259
Liu, sorry about this.

614
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:15,338
Take him away.

615
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,378
Move.

616
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:31,259
These stolen goods
were all found in your house,

617
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:34,059
Liu.

618
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,378
What are you trying to do?

619
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:44,139
Framing me?

620
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,378
I've never seen these things before.

621
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:49,898
Liu,

622
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,579
you're a smart man.

623
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:53,779
What do you mean?

624
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,498
Does it matter

625
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,458
if these things are yours?

626
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,938
What are you doing?

627
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,498
Where's the prefect?
I want to see Prefect Chen.

628
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:08,898
Prefect Chen is busy
with official duties tonight.

629
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,259
He can't come.

630
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,739
But he has instructed us.

631
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,978
As long as you honestly confess

632
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,699
where these stolen goods came from,

633
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:21,378
you can suffer less.

634
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,179
You're going against us.

635
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:25,498
You dare.

636
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,818
Sir, it's all taken care of.

637
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:41,458
Very well.

638
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:46,579
Come sit down and have a drink with me.

639
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:47,938
Thank you, sir.

640
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,259
Wu An,

641
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,898
how many years have we known each other?

642
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:58,498
12 years.

643
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,498
In Yanyu Tower, besides me,

644
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,458
you are the only one
who saw with your own eyes

645
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,219
how it was established
in Huaizhou Prefecture

646
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,699
and has gradually come this far.

647
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:14,139
Come on. Let's drink.

648
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:23,938
I understand.

649
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:27,139
This school is your life's work, sir.

650
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:29,139
But now,

651
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,659
someone wants to destroy it.

652
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,539
Don't worry, sir.

653
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:35,378
Even if it costs me my life,

654
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,858
I will protect it.

655
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,938
I believe that.

656
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:46,219
If there's only one person
I can trust in this house,

657
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:47,898
it's you.

658
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,018
Sir, here's a toast to you.

659
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:12,458
Sir, how do we deal with Liu Xin?

660
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:18,978
Just a cripple.

661
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:20,938
What can he do?

662
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,699
Let him there to die in the jail.

663
00:42:36,898 --> 00:42:37,818
Master.

664
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:40,378
You must leave?

665
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,099
You know me.

666
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,099
Once I make a decision,

667
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:48,858
I never change it.

668
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,059
Sanniang,

669
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,818
this bag

670
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:58,139
was packed by myself.

671
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:01,739
Inside it are all your favorite things.

672
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:03,898
(Travel permit)
This is a travel permit.

673
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:07,579
Without it, you can't go anywhere.

674
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,139
Once you get somewhere,

675
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:13,858
you still need to find a reliable man
to entrust your life to.

676
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:16,978
I don't want to.

677
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:18,619
It's not about what you want.

678
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:20,579
It's the way of the world.

679
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,498
Women are like duckweed.

680
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:27,219
You still need a man to rely on
and a place to settle.

681
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,378
You don't know
the survival power of duckweed.

682
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:32,579
Why should I

683
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,458
be trapped by these things?

684
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:37,458
Sanniang,

685
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:40,458
don't stray.

686
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:42,018
From now on,

687
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,458
I will only live for myself.

688
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:49,898
Take care, Master.

691
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,954
(Shihua House)

692
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:32,898
Are you here for anyone?

693
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:35,619
I want to see the person in charge here.

694
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:38,179
I'm the one in charge here.

695
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:42,579
You want to talk to me?

696
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,978
I want to recommend myself to you.

697
00:45:45,898 --> 00:45:48,539
I wonder what you think.

698
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:51,498
We don't just

699
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:53,579
take anyone.

700
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:58,139
Over the past two years, your whorehouse

701
00:45:58,378 --> 00:46:01,099
has always been overshadowed
by Yunliang House in Xunzhou Prefecture.

(Ms. Wang of Shihua House)

703
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:05,858
Don't you want to win
the first prize next year

704
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:07,978
in the top courtesan competition?

705
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:09,579
With you?

706
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:12,739
Yes, with me.
