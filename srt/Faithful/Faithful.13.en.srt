00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,546
(Seven years ago)

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,760
Mr. Li, I want to buy medicine.

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,039
You only give me one copper coin?

4
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,640
Captain Liu, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,000
I just had a big meal

6
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,439
in the market.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,799
And I only have one copper coin left.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,159
You ate it up?

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,640
Yeah.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,960
Didn't you think
of leaving me some food?

11
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,960
Captain Liu, can you tell me

12
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,840
what exactly is going on in Yanyu Tower?

13
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:55,840
If you want food,

14
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,359
that's no problem.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,079
I can buy it for you every day.

16
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,200
Why are you asking about this?

17
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:02,707
I have a friend studying

18
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,666
in Yanyu Tower.

19
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:06,226
Recently,

20
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,026
there has been a lot of gossip
about Lin Rulan's case.

21
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,067
And I'm worried.

22
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,746
Lin Rulan won't win.

23
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:16,386
Don't get involved in this.

24
00:01:18,907 --> 00:01:19,746
Forget it.

25
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,547
If you don't tell me, I'm leaving.

26
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,186
Mr. Li.

27
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:26,946
Li Chunfeng.

28
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:28,746
You pickpocket.

29
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:32,106
I've helped you a lot in the past.

30
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:33,427
Now I'm in trouble,

31
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,386
and you only give me one copper coin?

32
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,147
Do you have a conscience?

33
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:09,864
=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

34
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:14,034
=Episode 13, Chapter 7, Part 1=
(Lin Rulan's Red Wedding Dress)

35
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,690
(Lin's Pharmacy)

36
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,920
Rulan, I got you something to eat.

37
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,667
You really acted impulsively.

38
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,306
Tell me the truth.

39
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:48,827
Do you have feelings for Mr. Wu?

40
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:50,986
That's why

41
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,440
you had intimate relations

42
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,426
with him?

43
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,625
You're afraid
of being blamed by our parents.

44
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,905
So you made up it all.

45
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:02,346
What if I say yes?

46
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:03,705
How could you be so silly?

47
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:05,386
If you had told the truth earlier,

48
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,465
things wouldn't have ended up like this.

49
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,185
What would happen then?

50
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,786
Our parents
and I would stand up for you.

51
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:14,585
We would make Wu Lian

52
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:15,625
take responsibility.

53
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:16,625
At least,

54
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,586
it could be resolved quietly,

55
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:24,986
instead of ruining your reputation.

56
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,026
What are you going to do?

57
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,786
You are muddle-headed.

58
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,745
I'm tired, brother.

59
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:35,505
You can leave.

60
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:41,265
Rulan.

61
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:44,385
I'm worried about you.

62
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:46,425
I spoke a little harshly.

63
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:47,945
Don't take it to heart.

64
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,226
Eat something.

65
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:52,865
I'll go.

66
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,026
(Gentle Breeze)
That matter has been resolved.

67
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,865
You just focus on
preparing the embroidery.

68
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:17,706
Yes.

69
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,305
This is your new product?

70
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:39,786
It's hot in summer.

71
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,906
It's made of fine gauze,
cooling the skin.

72
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:45,106
It's custom made for you.

73
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,666
Her Majesty has decided

74
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,146
the gift list for the tributaries.

75
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,185
Yanyu Embroidery is listed.

76
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,625
Congratulations.

77
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,505
It can be attributed
to your recommendation.

78
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,146
This batch of embroidery

79
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,385
concerns the reputation of the court.

80
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,906
I have strongly recommended it.

81
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,706
You mustn't make any mistakes.

82
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:21,906
Madam, you can rest assured.

83
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,385
When has Yanyu Tower ever let you down?

84
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:50,385
Wan, don't blame me.

85
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:52,706
We can't fight them.

86
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,625
Eat the medicine.

87
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:13,865
Mother.

88
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,786
Anything is bland to me,

89
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:21,305
so the medicine tastes bitter,
and I can't swallow it.

90
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:24,945
Can you get me some candied fruit?

91
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,706
Okay, I will go out and buy it for you.

92
00:07:58,425 --> 00:07:59,385
Zhao Yucheng.

93
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,786
Zhao Yucheng.

94
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:04,745
What are you doing here again?

95
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,945
You can't go in.

96
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:09,146
Meng wan.

97
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:10,625
Why?

98
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,226
Why?

99
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,226
What are you doing?

100
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,466
You're a woman.

101
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,906
You wouldn't understand
even if I explained.

102
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,226
A man who wants
to succeed should use tricks.

103
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,986
Necessary sacrifices are inevitable.

104
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,026
So you teamed up with Wu Lian

105
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:32,426
and sold me out?

106
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:35,505
What makes you say that?

107
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:38,186
He and I just
take advantage of each other.

108
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,385
Shameless!

109
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,865
You told me

110
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:45,346
being a litigator is to seek justice.

111
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,385
Pah!

112
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:50,385
You know what?

113
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,865
Your mother always wanted you
to marry me.

114
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:53,826
You wish.

115
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,986
I dare not marry a woman

116
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,306
from Yanyu Tower.

117
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,986
However, considering your help for me,

118
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,466
I might consider taking you
as a concubine.

119
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,706
Zhao Yucheng,
you will get your retribution.

120
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:14,785
Retribution? What retribution?

121
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,745
Did Mr. Wu get any retribution?

122
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,865
In this world, winner takes all.

123
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:23,426
What's wrong with me
looking out for myself?

124
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,545
Enough.

125
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,706
If there's nothing else,

126
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:29,145
please leave.

127
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:29,785
Go.

128
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,905
Don't touch me.

129
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:32,986
I can leave.

130
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,826
I am waiting for the day you fall.

131
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,145
Fine, we'll see.

132
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,745
See you.

133
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:50,905
Rulan.

134
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:51,586
Coming.

135
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:52,745
Rulan.

136
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,545
How is Rulan?

137
00:09:58,426 --> 00:09:59,545
You better go check on her.

138
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,025
You help me persuade her.

139
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:37,826
Rulan.

140
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:40,905
You're really here.

141
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:43,066
What are you doing here?

142
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,066
Do you still have anything to say?

143
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,706
She almost destroyed me yesterday.

144
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,025
Did you plan

145
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:51,826
to push everyone else out

146
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,025
while you hide behind?

147
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:54,785
You ask her.

148
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,306
What did she say to me back then?

149
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:01,426
You were quite talkative that day.

150
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:03,265
Are you dumb now?

151
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,066
Make a scene somewhere else.

152
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,145
Your good friend

153
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:09,066
can only talk something nice,

154
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,265
but in reality, she's useless.

155
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:13,785
Where was she when you were

156
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:14,905
in court yesterday?

157
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:16,745
If I were you,

158
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:18,505
I would stay away from her.

159
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:21,586
Or you will get screwed.

160
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:24,186
Yes, I did betray your trust yesterday.

161
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,106
You're a smart person.

162
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,785
You knew the truth about Wu Lian,

163
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:36,186
but you didn't dare to speak.

164
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,625
You're just a coward.

165
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:44,826
If you make a fuss here,

166
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,466
I'll throw you out.

167
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,745
You're still defending her?

168
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:49,706
Get lost!

169
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:57,826
You deserve to lose so badly.

170
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,051
Are you okay?

171
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,931
She's right.

172
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,931
I caused you in trouble.

173
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,650
No.

174
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,291
I'm glad you weren't

175
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,530
in court yesterday.

176
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,610
I just never expected

177
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,410
I would lose.

178
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:38,691
Forget it.

179
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:42,931
Let's leave here.

180
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,490
Yes, let's leave here.

181
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,051
Go to a beautiful place.

182
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:49,931
The further, the better.

183
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,171
We can embroider.

184
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,770
We can support ourselves.

185
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:55,010
Even if we never marry,

186
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,490
we can rely on each other.

187
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,162
I know you want justice,

188
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,402
but don't you understand by now?

189
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,483
Not all grievances will be redressed.

190
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,363
And not all villains will be punished.

191
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,963
You have to think about yourself.

192
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:13,723
Or have you decided

193
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,642
to stay and marry Wu Lian?

194
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:25,323
No, I'd rather die.

195
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,562
Is it worth dying for such a man?

196
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,243
He's to blame.

197
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:32,042
Why should we bear it?

198
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,922
But you're not like me.

199
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,723
You still have a chance
to choose the life you want.

200
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:41,123
What I just said is the life I want.

201
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,762
Alright, let's get out of here.

202
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,363
The further we go, the better.

203
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:09,195
In the next few days,

204
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,434
you should eat well

205
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:12,634
and keep healthy.

206
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:14,115
Since we've decided to leave,

207
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:15,914
we must do some preparations.

208
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:17,154
Wait for my news.

209
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:33,434
Where did you get this?

210
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,875
I sold my jewelry a few days ago

211
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:38,634
to find a litigator.

212
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,754
Finally, it comes in handy.

213
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:48,514
Okay.

214
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,754
(Yanyu Tower)

215
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:03,554
By the way, Ling,

216
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,195
I'm about to finish the book

217
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,274
you recommended us. It's a good book.

218
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:08,434
Isn't it?

219
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,875
I have many good books.

220
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:11,514
You can get them from me.

221
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,554
Okay, we'll go.

222
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:14,475
See you tomorrow.

223
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:15,674
See you tomorrow.

224
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:37,914
Mr. Wu.

225
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,595
How is the embroidery piece
from yesterday?

226
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,434
I've revised it many times,

227
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,355
but it's still not good enough.

228
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,075
If you have any problems,

229
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:49,715
you can come to me anytime.

230
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:50,995
Thank you.

231
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:02,195
You may go.

232
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:03,995
Alright.

233
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:22,875
Let's drink.

234
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,154
Is it Mr. Li?

235
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,554
As the usual.

236
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,355
He's a poor guy.

237
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:40,195
Did you just see your sweetheart again?

238
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,634
I'm telling you.

239
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:44,195
It is useless.

240
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,154
A suitable marriage is
about the match of two families.

241
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:50,835
Here.

242
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:52,195
It's on credit.

243
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,355
You should pay off all your debts.

244
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,595
I will settle it
at the end of the month.

245
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:00,075
Fine.

246
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:10,994
Isn't this Butcher Du?

247
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:12,994
I heard your butcher shop is doing well.

248
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:15,035
Of course.

249
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,315
Good.

250
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,355
You asked me
to write a letter to your lover.

251
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:20,234
It costs ten copper coins.

252
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:21,234
You haven't paid me yet.

253
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:22,434
Since we meet today,

254
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:23,555
why don't you settle it?

255
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:24,674
What letter?

256
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,355
If you don't remember,

257
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:27,115
I'll recall.

258
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,355
You asked me to write...

259
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:30,394
Just a letter.

260
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:32,875
Is it worth ten copper coins?

261
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:35,154
It's a rip-off.

262
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:37,914
I was just saying.

263
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,914
I don't dare to let you pay.

264
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:43,394
Just ignore him.

265
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:47,115
Sir, I'll pay for today's wine.

266
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:28,515
I'm back.

267
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:31,994
Wan.

268
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:56,994
Wan.

269
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,555
Wan, why is the door bolted?

270
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,355
I'm getting changed.

271
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,835
Wan, if you still want to run out,

272
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:20,075
I have to lock you in the room.

273
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:22,075
I know.

274
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:25,994
Fortunately, your father

275
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,634
has been drinking outside
and hasn't come home these days.

276
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:30,595
Otherwise, if he saw you

277
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,795
and smelled the medicine,
he would be suspicious.

278
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,595
If he knew I sent you
to the embroidery house

279
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:37,835
and you caused trouble,

280
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,515
neither of us would have a good life.

281
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:50,234
Mother.

282
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,275
Have you ever thought about a divorce?

283
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,275
What are you talking about?

284
00:19:58,674 --> 00:19:59,914
Since I was little,

285
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,234
my father has been drunk

286
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:03,875
more often than he's been sober.

287
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,674
When he's drunk, he goes crazy.

288
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:12,154
How did you get all these wounds?

289
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:13,515
Have you forgotten?

290
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:15,954
I really don't get it.

291
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,154
Why do you must stay

292
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,355
in this cold place?

293
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:22,674
Divorce.

294
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,835
Do you know what it means?

295
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,954
It means I'll be homeless.

296
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:43,875
I have nowhere to stand in this world.

297
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,994
Are you hoping for such a tragic end

298
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,194
for your mother?

299
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,315
How can we have nowhere to stand?

300
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,755
We can support ourselves.

301
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,154
It's just
that life will be a bit harder.

302
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:01,315
Isn't that better than living in fear?

303
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:06,355
Or you're just weak,

304
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,035
and you can't leave him.

305
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,795
What are you talking about?

306
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,474
You're ungrateful.

307
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,515
I secretly saved some money

308
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,674
just to send you
to study in Yanyu Tower.

309
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,914
I was hoping you would learn something

310
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,234
to have a good marriage,

311
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,674
and have a good future.

312
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,914
What did you do?

313
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:32,795
You didn't learn anything good.

314
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,555
How did you have those ridiculous ideas?

315
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:38,194
You've disappointed me.

316
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:13,035
I...

317
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:17,154
I'm home.

318
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:28,474
I'm not drunk.

319
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:32,474
I can drink more.

320
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:35,234
Who's it?

321
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,634
You get away from me.

322
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:44,674
I'm not drunk. Let's drink.

323
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:45,755
Have a drink.

324
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:48,954
You jinx.

325
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:51,634
Go away. I'm not drunk.

326
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:53,875
I'm not drunk.

327
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:56,795
Get away from me.

328
00:22:57,154 --> 00:22:58,795
I don't need your help.

329
00:22:58,954 --> 00:22:59,914
Get away.

330
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:03,875
Have a drink.

331
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:37,555
Rulan, you're too skinny.

332
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,875
You should eat more to nourish yourself.

333
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:46,394
In a few days,

334
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,755
it will be the ninth day
of the lunar month.

335
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:58,075
Brother,

336
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:00,355
do you want to study medicine?

337
00:24:01,914 --> 00:24:03,674
I don't have any big ambitions.

338
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,755
It's okay to sell herbs with our father.

339
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:09,555
When things settle down,

340
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:13,154
you can visit Dr. Lin
with our father again.

341
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:14,515
You have talent,

342
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,315
and Dr. Lin values talent.

343
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:17,634
He will definitely teach you.

344
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,035
You can't let my issue

345
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,115
affect your future.

346
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,755
It's okay. You eat more.

347
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,312
By the way,

348
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,595
mother's cough seems to get worse.

349
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:31,914
When autumn comes,

350
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,515
you must remind her
to take her medicine in advance.

351
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,394
Otherwise, she will suffer this winter.

352
00:24:37,835 --> 00:24:38,755
Don't worry.

353
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,434
And you should persuade our father.

354
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,234
Whenever he gets busy,

355
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:45,914
he always forgets to eat.

356
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:47,714
Rulan.

357
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:49,674
Why did you say those things?

358
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:51,914
What's wrong?

359
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,355
They have raised me.

360
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:59,194
Now I'm about to get married,

361
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,035
I don't know
when I'll have time to come back.

362
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:06,035
I'm worried.

363
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:09,154
Taking care of our parents

364
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:12,355
will rely on you.

365
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:16,595
No worries.

366
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,994
You should take care of yourself.

367
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,355
You are the apple of their eye.

368
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,634
As long as you are well,

369
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:29,714
they will be at ease.

370
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:34,954
You rest for a while.

371
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,595
If you want,

372
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,115
go out to get some air.

373
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,234
Don't always stay in the room alone.

374
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:42,474
Okay.

375
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:43,875
I'll go.

376
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,075
Brother.

377
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,194
I will be fine.

378
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:54,315
You silly girl.

379
00:26:58,875 --> 00:26:59,674
Mother,

380
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:01,835
why are your cough getting worse?

381
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,515
Your father made a fuss last night.

382
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:09,634
And my illness has recurred.

383
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:13,154
It's okay.

384
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:15,795
I'll go get your medicine.

385
00:27:15,954 --> 00:27:16,795
I'll be back soon.

386
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,275
No.

387
00:27:23,314 --> 00:27:26,578
(Huaizhou)

388
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:54,994
I knew I was right.

389
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,075
I noticed something was wrong with Wan.

390
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,595
I sent her out on purpose this morning

391
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:02,714
and hurried over here.

392
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:05,595
You're leaving Huaizhou Prefecture?

393
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:07,515
Where are you going?

394
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:12,714
Anywhere is fine.

395
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:14,194
In this vast world,

396
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:15,795
there's always a place to stay.

397
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,355
Once you leave here,
you'll become refugees.

398
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:21,515
Who would marry a girl
without clear background?

399
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:23,736
Or do you just want to live

400
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:26,360
in anonymity and hardship

401
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,298
for the rest of your lives?

402
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:30,058
Being single might not be miserable.

403
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:31,979
Getting married might not be happy.

404
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:34,338
It depends on ourselves.

405
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:37,378
You should

406
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:40,138
know it.

407
00:28:44,818 --> 00:28:46,098
I know I'm hopeless

408
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,419
in this life.

409
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:48,858
So, I cannot let Wan

410
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,939
live an unstable life.

411
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,138
Please leave her alone.

412
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:55,419
I beg you.

413
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:00,179
Please don't do this.

414
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,419
Please get up.

415
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:05,818
Wan has had a hard life
since she was a child.

416
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,298
It's my fault. I was blind

417
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:10,419
and married that bad guy,

418
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,522
giving Wan a hard life.

419
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,363
In this home,

420
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:18,123
she hasn't lived a peaceful day.

421
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,123
Finally, when she grew up,

422
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:24,042
I tried every means
to get her into Yanyu Tower,

423
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,282
hoping to find her a good marriage.

424
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:32,323
But she met Wu Lian.

425
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:36,923
Do you know

426
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:41,682
why Wan didn't show up

427
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:44,403
on the second day of the trial?

428
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:46,962
That day,

429
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:50,962
I personally gave her abortion medicine.

430
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:53,883
Are you saying that Meng Wan...

431
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,923
She was pregnant.

432
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:02,803
I really had no other choice.

433
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,242
Wu Lian would never admit it.

434
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:13,442
I couldn't let Wan's life be ruined.

435
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,603
I thought if the child was aborted,

436
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:21,083
I could find her a marriage
outside Huaizhou Prefecture.

437
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,242
And this matter could be covered up.

438
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:26,643
But,

439
00:30:27,962 --> 00:30:31,323
her fate is really unjust.

440
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,722
The abortion medicine damaged her.

441
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,042
The doctor said

442
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,282
Wan

443
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:46,363
would hardly conceive again.

444
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,643
Wan has had a hard life.

445
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,643
Please.

446
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,282
I found a match for Wan.

447
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,883
He is my maternal relative.

448
00:31:01,522 --> 00:31:02,883
If Wan marries into another family

449
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:04,242
and can't bear children,

450
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:07,163
she won't have a good end.

451
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:09,762
But with my relatives looking after her,

452
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:11,682
even if she can't bear children,

453
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:14,722
she can adopt a child

454
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,042
and have someone
to rely on in the future.

455
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,883
Does Meng Wan know about this?

456
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:26,002
Wan values friendship.

457
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:29,202
Now she only wants to take you away

458
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:31,363
and leave this place.

459
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:36,803
But she never thinks for herself.

460
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:40,163
If you care about her,

461
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:41,843
please let her go.

462
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:46,123
Let her live a stable life.

463
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:47,563
Can you promise me?

464
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:51,442
I beg you.

465
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:05,083
Today,

466
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,002
I never show up.

467
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,410
(Huaizhou)

468
00:32:49,163 --> 00:32:50,083
Wu Lian.

469
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:53,323
Come out.

470
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:00,482
You guys go.

471
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:02,923
Get them out of here.

472
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:04,123
Yes.

473
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:08,803
Get out of here.

474
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,123
You changed your style today.

475
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,603
It's more interesting
than your usual dress.

476
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:16,482
You've hurt so many people.

477
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:19,522
How can you get away with this?

478
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,843
Ants want to shake the tree.

479
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,123
Isn't that ridiculous?

480
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:26,923
Zhao Yucheng, Wang Liulang.

481
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,002
Are you behind them?

482
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:31,962
If you hadn't started it,

483
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,323
you wouldn't have ended up like this?

484
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:38,123
Originally, it was a good thing for you,

485
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:39,883
but you just didn't appreciate it,

486
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:40,803
making a fuss like this.

487
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:43,762
If anything happens to you in my house,

488
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:46,962
they will say you bring it on yourself.

489
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:55,762
Kill me if you dare.

490
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,282
Otherwise, I won't let you go.

491
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:10,602
Why should I kill you?

492
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:12,803
Once you marry me,

493
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:15,042
you'll learn to be good.

494
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:16,962
I'll see

495
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:19,683
if you can say the same thing.

496
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:25,962
It's just a pity
for your rare embroidery talent.

497
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:29,962
I'm afraid
you can't use it in the future.

498
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:40,923
Wu Lian,

499
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,642
even if I die,

500
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:46,923
I won't let you go.

501
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,530

If something happened to you,

568

Mother.

570
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,203
Could you buy me

571
00:38:29,122 --> 00:38:31,122
bright red fabric?

572
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,162
I want to embroider a wedding dress
for myself.

573
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:43,403
Well, red color?

574
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,323
I know.

575
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,803
Only the rightful wife

576
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:49,803
can wear a bright red dress.

577
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:53,883
I just want to realize a wish.

578
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:58,602
I'll buy it for you.

579
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:01,243
Thank you.

580
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:04,522
I have a headache.

00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:10,283
Take a break.

584
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:13,923
Well,

585
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:16,923
you get some rest.

586
00:39:18,562 --> 00:39:20,243
Don't overthink.

587
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:22,923
Be good.

588
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:58,243
Meng Wan came to see you.

589
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:01,042
You two can talk.

590
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:21,403
Why did they lock you up?

591
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:23,002
What happened?

592
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:25,683
Were you discovered
when you tried to leave?

593
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:27,122
It's okay.

594
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:28,962
We can find another way.

595
00:41:29,642 --> 00:41:30,482
No.

596
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:34,122
I didn't plan to leave.

597
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,283
What's this?

598
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:41,763
I'm embroidering a wedding dress
for myself.

599
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:44,082
Why?

600
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:45,602
Didn't we have a deal?

601
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,243
We will wander the world together.

602
00:41:50,803 --> 00:41:53,162
It's just a joke.
Don't take it too seriously.

603
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:55,482
We are women.

604
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:57,562
How are we supposed to survive outside?

605
00:41:58,763 --> 00:41:59,763
By embroidery?

606
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:01,283
Don't be silly.

607
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:03,042
Where

608
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:05,962
and how can we

609
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:07,323
sell our embroidery?

610
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:09,363
Even if we can barely make a living,

611
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:12,442
what if we

612
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:13,962
encounter bullies?

613
00:42:14,203 --> 00:42:15,442
There's always a way out.

614
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:16,843
Don't give up.

615
00:42:17,522 --> 00:42:19,203
But I don't want to take risks anymore.

616
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:24,683
Mrs. Wu is right.

617
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:27,923
Perhaps marrying Wu Lian
is the best choice.

618
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:30,683
Wu Lian has long lost interest in me.

619
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:33,923
Mrs. Wu is a lady of a good family.

620
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:35,683
She won't give me a hard time.

621
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,803
So I just need to live my life

622
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:42,042
peacefully and safely.

623
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:43,803
But you won't be happy.

624
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,323
Many people

625
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:48,203
long for a peaceful live.

626
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:50,522
Don't you hope that I can live well

627
00:42:51,203 --> 00:42:52,482
for the rest of my life?

628
00:42:58,403 --> 00:42:59,763
Have you really decided?

629
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:02,883
We're good friends.

630
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,683
I really hope you can understand me.

631
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:16,442
All I wish is

632
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,323
that you're happy.

633
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:36,883
(You've hurt so many people.)

634
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:40,082
(How can you get away with this?)

635
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:43,442
(If anything happens
to you in my house,)

636
00:43:44,323 --> 00:43:46,883
(people will say
you bring it on yourself.)

637
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:52,883
If you have any problems,

638
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:54,283
you can come to me anytime.

639
00:43:54,642 --> 00:43:55,522
Thank you.
