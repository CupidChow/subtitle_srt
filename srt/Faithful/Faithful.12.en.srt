00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,000
Ms. Chen, please have some tea.

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,799
I always think you're capable.

6
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,000
Your embroidery house
has only been open for three years,

7
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,159
but it's overtaking Yanyu Tower.

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,680
It's just a superficial prosperity,

9
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,040
not profitable.

10
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,599
It can't be compared with Yanyu Tower.

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,000
Isn't it profitable?

12
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,560
Silk reeling, dyeing,
weaving, and embroidering.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
You have a complete product line.

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,920
Apart from those sericulture farmers,

15
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,280
who can get a few copper coins

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,079
from you?

17
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,680
Ms. Chen, it smacks of exaggeration.

18
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,519
My embroidery house
can have a good reputation here,

19
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,359
all thanks to
the Yanyu Tower's promotion

20
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,120
and support.

21
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,200
(Huangji Embroidery House)
There are many rivals.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,200
The more rivals, the more talk.

23
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,000
Please don't believe those rumors.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,239
What rumors are you talking about?

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
Nothing.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm just saying.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Since your opened this embroidery house,

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,920
you have been producing silk
for self use.

29
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,200
We haven't cooperated in a while.

30
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,599
I just don't have enough of it.

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,000
How can I sell it?

32
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,159
You don't have to sell too much.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,159
It should be okay

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,000
to sell a small quantity, right?

35
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,719
Are you here today

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,439
to buy our silk?

37
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,199
Mr. Wu embroidered a white crane

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
and urgently needed purple thread
to outline its wings.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
I've looked for many places,

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,680
but their dyeing or texture is not good.

41
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,240
I found

42
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,000
their silk is not as good as yours.

43
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm so sorry.

44
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,199
What happened?

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,120
The purple thread needs a plant's roots,

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,240
but we've run them out.

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, since you're in urgent need,

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,199
I can't let you go back empty-handed.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,120
Nan, go get me a hoe.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,319
What are you doing with a hoe?

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,879
I'm going to the mountains.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,599
Ms. Chen, you give me a few days,

53
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,080
at most half a month.

54
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,840
I will dig up the whole mountain

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,800
to find the plant's roots for you.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,879
Now that your business is growing,

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,719
I can't accept your great favor.

58
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,919
I won't bother you.

59
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,639
Ms. Chen, hold on.

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,479
I want to invite you to have dinner.

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,439
I can't believe her.

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
She's been slandering
our embroidery house.

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,199
How dare she come here.

64
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,840
Things finally get ugly.

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
The Yanyu Tower

66
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,800
won't give us any room to survive.

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,120
Wu Lian is in trouble now.

68
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,439
Look.

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,879
I just picked it up outside.

70
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,800
It's posted everywhere.

71
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:34,673
Ms. Huang.

72
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:36,833
Are you okay?

73
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:40,594
We shouldn't get involved

74
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,474
in these old affairs.

75
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:46,154
We'll just do our own business.

76
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,034
Forget it.

77
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,874
Let's check on the big order.

78
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:22,514
How is it going?

79
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,073
The sleeves are almost done.

80
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,193
The rest will take some time.

81
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,433
The buyer is quite strange.

82
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,281
For the past three months,
he has paid us on time,

83
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:33,841
but he never shows up.

84
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,401
Where will we deliver it once it's done?

85
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:38,962
As long as we get the money,

86
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,401
we don't care who he is.

87
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:42,921
It's not peaceful now.

88
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:44,921
You all must be careful and hide well.

89
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:46,481
Don't go out.

90
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,801
Understood?

91
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:50,642
Wait a little longer.

92
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:54,002
Once I establish a good relationship
with officials,

93
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,442
I'll finish your household registration.

94
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,202
So, you won't have to be scared

95
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,481
and hide.

96
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:04,841
Go ahead with your work.

97
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,275
Did she really say that?

98
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:13,515
Yes.

99
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:16,674
Without you
appreciating her craftsmanship,

100
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,114
her silk factory would have closed down.

101
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,155
She wouldn't have a good business now.

102
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:22,994
She's cunning.

103
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:26,074
Forget it.

104
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:28,475
Bring me the golden thread.

105
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,035
Yes.

(Ms. Huang Presents Gold Embroidery)

108
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,307
It's truly

109
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,427
beautiful.

110
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:29,547
Why did you use golden thread
for the crane's wings?

111
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:32,427
Due to the time constraints,

112
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,307
I couldn't find
the perfect purple thread,

113
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,706
so I replaced it
with this golden thread.

114
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:40,067
However, this golden thread
adds an extra touch

115
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,067
of elegance to the embroidery.

116
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:43,906
Indeed.

117
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:45,826
It's really good.

118
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:51,307
Are you certain
that Mrs. Lou will like it?

119
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:53,667
In fact, a few years ago,

120
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:55,507
she longed for the Yanyu Embroidery

121
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,427
and even asked me about it.

122
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,067
But I declined her at that time.

123
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,826
Who would have thought
that Lou Mingzhang

124
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,146
would be so lucky

125
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,586
to be promoted
to the position of the inquisitor?

126
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,747
Now, tell me what I should say

127
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:15,466
to praise this embroidery
in front of her.

128
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,266
This embroidery pattern was designed

129
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:22,747
by a famous artist Qin Qizhi.

130
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:25,826
It's elegant and auspicious.

131
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,826
And most importantly,

132
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:31,067
it's one of a kind.

He's trying to investigate you.

So,

137
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,106
this might be your last chance.

138
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,626
If you make any more mistakes,

139
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:03,106
no one will be able to save you.

140
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:06,307
Thank you for your concern.

141
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:08,866
I will keep that in mind.

This embroidery

144
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,387
took Mr. Wu half a year

145
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:40,346
to complete in person.

146
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:42,586

like this in the world.

148
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,746
Madam, this gift is too precious.

149
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:53,027
I really can't accept it.

150
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,506
Please accept it.

151
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,826
It's rare for you
to visit Huaizhou Prefecture.

152
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,466
How can I let you return empty-handed?

153
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,427
As a first-time visitor,

154
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:10,187
it's improper for me
to accept such a generous gift.

155
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:14,147
Mrs. Lou,

156
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:17,267
this gift is indeed extremely valuable.

157
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:20,067
Madam has indeed
put a lot of thought into it.

158
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:23,027
Mr. Lou and you
have been devoting yourselves

159
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,787
for the welfare of the people,

160
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:27,387
enduring hardships.

161
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,866
Compared with that,

162
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,746
the Yanyu Embroidery

163
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,586
means nothing.

164
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,947
Mrs. Ning admires
your selfless dedication

165
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,586
to the people,

166
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,027
and wishes to present this gift to you.

167
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,106
Please don't decline

168
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,346
her kind intention.

169
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:50,626
She's incredibly eloquent.

Apart from that,

171
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,267
her tea-making skill is extraordinary.

172
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,986
You don't know how much I love it.

173
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,506
We can taste it together some day.

174
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:01,986
Alright.

175
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:08,147
So I can't decline.

176
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:10,427
I'll accept it then.

177
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,907
Thank you, Mrs. Ning.

178
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,307
You're welcome.

179
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,626
Mrs. Lou, have you heard

180
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:21,667
about Zuixian Restaurant?

181
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,106
Zuixian Restaurant?

182
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,826
It's just a small gathering,

183
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:30,346
without official business.
What are you afraid of?

184
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:39,387
This outfit is beautiful.

185
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,986
A one-of-a-kind Yanyu Embroidery.

186
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,147
A gift from Mrs. Ning.

187
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:53,986
My dear,

188
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:56,586
you should not accept it.

189
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:59,466
I fear that it would give us trouble.

190
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,307
Send it back quickly.

191
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,267
And if I don't send it back?

192
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:08,746
This is not a trivial matter.
It must be returned.

193
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,466
Alright, Lou Mingzhang.

194
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,506
You've just been promoted,

195
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,947
and you're putting on airs.

196
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:16,866
I'll send it back.

197
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:18,307
You might as well dump me

198
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,147
and send me back to my parents' house.

199
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,907
My dear.

200
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:25,267
Can we stop arguing?

201
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,387
Please.

202
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,706
Alright, I have a question.

203
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,466
How's the case investigation going?

204
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,027
This case has long been pending.

205
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:47,387
The litigator back then was missing.

206
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:50,866
And the victim's parents
also disappeared.

207
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,187
I have no way to start.

208
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:57,267
Since the case
involves Yanyu Tower's collusion

209
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,986
with Ning Mansion.

210
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,787
Isn't the banquet tomorrow night
a great opportunity?

211
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,826
Alright, I'll listen to you.

212
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:11,027
I'll accompany you to meet Mrs. Ning.

213
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,387
Mr. Lou, long time no see.

214
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,106
Greetings, Mrs. Ning.

215
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:42,466
I have official duties,

216
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:44,147
so I haven't visited you yet.

217
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:47,147
Please forgive me.

218
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,106
No need for formalities.

219
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:52,746
The food is getting cold. Let's sit.

220
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:58,387
Mrs. Lou, this dress looks great on you.

221
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,187
It really suits you.

222
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,586
It's all thanks to your good taste.

223
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,027
It's because you are beautiful. Please.

224
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,144
Please sit.

225
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,586
When you just arrived,

226
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:31,427
Huaizhou had a disturbance.

227
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,346
It's really humiliating.

228
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,427
Even though you reside in Huaizhou,

229
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,387
you're not in charge
of the official affairs.

230
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,067
There's no need to blame yourself.

231
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,387
Perhaps Mrs. Lou will understand.

232
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:50,067
A domestic woman's life is boring.

233
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:53,346
We're only interested in the rouge,

234
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,027
silk, and embroidery.

235
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:59,986
Huaizhou Prefecture is famous
for the Yanyu Embroidery.

236
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,147
So naturally, I have become

237
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:04,706
Wu Lian's regular customer.

238
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,706
He has caused such a trouble.

239
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,787
Actually,

240
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:13,187
the people may already have
grievances against me.

241
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,027
I really feel uneasy.

242
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,226
Mrs. Ning.

243
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:21,787
Do you remember the Rulan Case

244
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,027
seven years ago?

245
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,506
I vaguely remember,

246
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:31,466
but I only heard

247
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:36,466
she had a bad reputation.

248
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,907
She was engaged.

249
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:45,147
She also had an unclear relationship

250
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:49,346
with the bandit in the Heifeng Camp.

251
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:52,626
Do you have evidence?

252
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,187
I don't.

253
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,466
I just heard it from the streets.

254
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:02,947
If you want to know,

255
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:05,187
you can inquire.

256
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,187
Alright, let's not talk about it.

257
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:10,586
Let's eat.

258
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:11,947
Okay.

259
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:12,746
Please.

260
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,506
Did you arrange this?

261
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,387
No, Madam.

262
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,506
(His embroidery pattern
is unbelievable.)

263
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,546
(But it can't be embroidered
in one night.)

264
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,827
(Bring the best painters)

265
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:12,387
(in the city quietly.)

266
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:37,266
Well...

267
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,026
Stop.

268
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:38,867
Well...

269
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:39,832
Stop.

270
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,867
Stop it.

271
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,107
What do you want to do?

272
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,066
Where did you come from,
you dirty thing?

273
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:47,387
Step back.

274
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:50,306
Get out of here.

275
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:56,867
Ladies, you got the wrong door.

276
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:58,986
It's a mess.

277
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:00,907
Another room ordered dancing.

278
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,306
You're in the wrong room.

279
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:05,667
I'm really sorry.

280
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,546
Sorry to barge in.

281
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:09,466
You eat.

282
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,266
Why are you sitting at the table?

283
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,627
What are you thinking?

284
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:16,827
Hurry up. The guests are waiting.

285
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:17,827
Hurry up.

286
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,266
Come on.

287
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,147
Don't keep guests waiting.

288
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:43,954
(Zuixian Restaurant)

289
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,226
Madam.

290
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:58,986
Wu Lian.

291
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:02,347
From now on,
I don't want to see you anymore.

292
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,466
Madam, what's wrong?

293
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:09,867
Madam.

294
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,794
(Zuixian Restaurant)

295
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,786
(Letter from the Ministry of Rites)

296
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:49,026
There's less than two months left
for Her Majesty's birthday.

297
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:50,506
The letter from Ministry of Rites

298
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,026
is like a death warrant.

299
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:55,066
I'll receive one letter
every two or three days.

300
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,226
Actually, I have already told them.

301
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:01,427
I will deliver the gift
the day before the birthday.

302
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:04,947
Madam, do you still plan
to use Yanyu Embroidery?

303
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:07,546
Don't mention these words.

304
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,387
If I use that jinx's embroidery again,

305
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,667
I'm afraid that one day I'll be killed.

306
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,986
You have always used Wu...

307
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:25,066
You have used that jinx's embroidery,

308
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,107
and Her Majesty loves it.

309
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,226
If you abandon it this year,

310
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:32,226
do you have other plans?

311
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:33,786
I called you here today

312
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,107
to help me come up with ideas, right?

313
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:37,947
Madam, don't get agitated.

314
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,947
I really have a candidate.

315
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,387
I don't know if you agree.

316
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:44,506
Who is it?

317
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,667
Are you serious?

318
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:51,786
Of course.

319
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:54,427
Yesterday night,

320
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,786
I saw it at Zuixian Restaurant.

321
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:59,306
Wu Lian was so embarrassed,

322
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,466
looking a real mess.

323
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,667
This morning, Madame Xu's maid went

324
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:04,266
to embroidery houses to collect samples.

325
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,827
It's obvious.

326
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:15,226
It seems that Mrs. Ning has fallen out

327
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:17,026
with Wu Lian.

328
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:19,706
Wu Lian

329
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,427
caused a storm.

330
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:24,466
The plaque
of the Ning Mansion was taken down.

331
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,867
Can't Mrs. Ning fall out with Wu Lian?

332
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,506
Wait.

333
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:28,907
What were you doing

334
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:30,827
at the Zuixian Restaurant last night?

335
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,667
Yesterday, a maid came and asked me

336
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,786
to bring some embroidery samples
to that restaurant to meet her master.

337
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,147
I was wondering

338
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,546
who would choose samples
in a restaurant?

339
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:41,746
Did you see her master?

340
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:42,867
I didn't.

341
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,546
I guess I missed her.

342
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,347
I always feel something is wrong.

343
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,107
Never mind.

344
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:51,306
Get me some embroidery samples.

345
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:52,427
The most exquisite ones.

346
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:53,947
I have to go to see Madame Xu.

347
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:55,427
Now?

348
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:56,867
Her house is already crowded.

349
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,506
I'm afraid you can't enter.

350
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,546
How did Madame Xu

351
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,907
start a connection with Mrs. Ning?

352
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:06,867
Who knows?

353
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:09,746
She's in charge of this house so soon.

354
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:11,907
She must have some moves.

355
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:14,746
Today, if we can associate with her

356
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:16,986
and send our embroidery
to the Ning Mansion,

357
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:18,986
we'll have a good business.

358
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,786
You own a small embroidery house.

359
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:22,506
You're just wasting your time

360
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:23,907
coming here.

361
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,827
Your embroidery house is quite large,

362
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:27,827
but most of your samples

363
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,066
are all copied from ones
of the Yanyu Tower.

364
00:22:30,546 --> 00:22:32,827
Even if it's sent to Mrs. Ning,

365
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:33,947
can she tell the difference?

366
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:34,587
You...

367
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:35,986
Which local embroidery houses

368
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,466
never copied Yanyu Embroidery?

369
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:39,026
Enough.

370
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,506
Don't get angry with her.

371
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,706
Everyone.

372
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:43,506
- I'm coming.
- I'm coming.

373
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:45,187
Miss, can we see Madame Xu now?

374
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:46,986
I'm really sorry.

375
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:49,387
Madame Xu won't see visitors today.

376
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:51,947
You can come back another day, please.

377
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,187
But what should we do with our stuff?

378
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,427
I'm really sorry.

379
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,627
You all might as well go back today.

380
00:22:58,907 --> 00:22:59,706
Sorry.

381
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,347
- Alright.
- We'll come back another day.

382
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:04,986
Thank you all for coming.

383
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:14,827
Lancui.

384
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,187
Here I am.

385
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,466
I've driven them away for you.

386
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:28,986
Now there's no one to compete with you.

387
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,627
Let's go.

388
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:32,867
Wait a moment, Lancui.

389
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:39,466
Thank you.

390
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:40,667
I can't.

391
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,147
This hairpin suits you.

392
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:43,786
Put it on. It's beautiful.

393
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:52,147
Thank you, Ms. Huang.

394
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:53,466
Let's go.

395
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,546
Madame Xu, this is Ms. Huang
from Huangji Embroidery House.

396
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:09,587
I've heard a lot about you.

397
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,746
You look gorgeous.

398
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,066
Such a sweet talker.

399
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:16,347
What's your name?

400
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:19,546
Have you heard of Silk Thread Huang?

401
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,667
I heard Mr. Wu from the Yanyu Tower
has exquisite embroidery skills.

402
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:27,226
And he has high demands
for silk threads.

403
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:32,546
He particularly likes those
from Silk Thread Huang.

404
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:34,306
That's me.

405
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:44,066
Madam, what's the matter?

406
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,546
No need
to look at the embroidery samples.

407
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,786
If you are here for the Ning Mansion,

408
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,627
why not take me directly
to your embroidery house?

409
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:57,986
Is there any inconvenience?

410
00:24:58,627 --> 00:24:59,786
It's convenient.

411
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:01,827
If you want to go,

412
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:03,466
let us set off now.

413
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,466
I started with silk threads
in my early years.

414
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,627
So, I won the name Silk Thread Huang.

415
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,706
Three years ago,
I closed my old workshop

416
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:20,587
(Huangji Embroidery House)
and opened Huangji Embroidery House.

417
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:22,627
This way, please.

418
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,266
Ms. Huang, you're back.

419
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:33,667
This is Madame Xu.

420
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,867
Madame Xu.

421
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:43,026
This is our signature,

422
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:44,786
the unique Huai Embroidery.

423
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,506
It does look different.

424
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:51,867
Your vision is sharp.

425
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:53,226
The Huai Embroidery

426
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:55,107
combines a technique
called gold embroidery

427
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:57,187
with our local embroidery skills.

428
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,867
The embroidered surface
is complex but not messy.

429
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:01,706
It's a unique luxury.

430
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,706
You can't see it elsewhere.

431
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,786
In Huaizhou Prefecture,

432
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,947
plain and elegant embroidery sells best.

433
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,986
Why do you insist
on doing Huai Embroidery?

434
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:14,066
Madam, please.

435
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,867
Craftsmen hope

436
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,587
to make what others don't have.

437
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:21,867
If everyone imitates
the Yanyu Embroidery,

438
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,107
they will be overshadowed
by Yanyu Tower.

439
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,466
The business can't grow.

440
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:26,706
Take a seat.

441
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:34,226
Although you're a woman,

442
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,427
you have big ambitions.

443
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:37,546
Madame Xu.

444
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:38,907
We are women.

445
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,706
So, we know the difficulties of women.

446
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,427
I am a widow.

447
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,986
l hired women,

448
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:46,546
and they need to make a living.

449
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,786
But Yanyu Tower is a strong rival.

450
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:52,226
Business is hard.

451
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:56,147
My embroidery house is about to close.

452
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:58,266
Ms. Huang.

453
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:02,226
Your embroidery house is well-known
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

454
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:03,986
How come it will close?

455
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:08,066
Anyway, we have good skills,

456
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:10,986
but we don't know
how to open up the market.

457
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:13,947
Now this is a mess.

458
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:15,466
If you don't mind,

459
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,187
please help me out.

460
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:19,266
We can

461
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,706
co-own this embroidery house.

462
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,466
For every penny earned,

463
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:24,907
you will have half of it.

464
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:28,226
Ms. Huang, let's not talk about it now.

465
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:31,786
If you want me
to recommend your Huai Embroidery

466
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,546
to Mrs. Ning,

467
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:36,107
we should be frank, right?

468
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,466
I wonder

469
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,587
if I can meet your unseen friends.

470
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:49,026
I always thought

471
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:50,546
you learned

472
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,187
a rare needlework technique.

473
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:54,786
But today,

474
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:59,706
I found several old clothes
hanging in the courtyard.

475
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:02,627
The style of those clothes

476
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:04,187
doesn't look like
that of ours in Huaizhou.

477
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,026
So I took a guess.

478
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:08,786
If I guessed wrong,

479
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,506
don't take it seriously.

480
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:15,226
Madame Xu, you are a smart person.

481
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:00,746
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

482
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,627
Three years ago, I went
to the countryside to collect silkworms

483
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,746
and encountered them who were fleeing.

484
00:29:11,427 --> 00:29:12,427
I felt pity for them,

485
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:14,667
so I hid them in my silkworm basket,

486
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:16,947
brought them back,
and kept them at home.

487
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:20,266
At that time, I made some money
from the silk thread business.

488
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:22,187
And I found that these women

489
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,827
know a unique embroidery skill.

490
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:26,466
That is gold embroidery.

491
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,226
On second thought,

492
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:30,706
I opened Huangji Embroidery House

493
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:32,107
and created Huai Embroidery.

494
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:33,466
Ms. Huang.

495
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:37,306
I didn't misjudge you.

496
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,387
Are you willing

497
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,667
to recommend my embroidery to Mrs. Ning?

498
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,147
I am,

499
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:49,667
but I'm afraid
you can't take the chance.

500
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:51,466
How so?

501
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:54,226
In over a month,
it will be Her Majesty's birthday,

502
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:57,066
Mrs. Ning bears the responsibility
of offering gifts.

503
00:29:58,147 --> 00:29:59,986
She has abandoned Yanyu Embroidery,

504
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:03,667
but she hasn't found anything
to replace it.

505
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:07,587
Right now, she's deeply troubled

506
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,627
by that.

507
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:14,066
So you mean I can take the job.

508
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,587
If you can take it,

509
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:20,306
all future orders from the Ning Mansion

510
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:21,627
will come to you.

511
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:24,187
If Her Majesty wears your embroidery

512
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:26,026
and walks around at the banquet,

513
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:28,147
I'm afraid customers in the capital

514
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,147
will look for you to place orders.

515
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:32,947
Well,

516
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,107
I wonder if you dare to take this job.

517
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:38,187
I dare to.

518
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:43,266
If you take this job,

519
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,506
you will become an eyesore to Wu Lian.

520
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:49,947
He will try to tear down your place.

521
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,147
Madame Xu.

522
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,107
I dare to.

523
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:58,427
Fortune favors the bold.

524
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:00,706
A fool will refuse to make money.

525
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:08,427
But there's only over a month left.

526
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:13,627
What does Mrs. Ning want
to give Her Majesty for a gift?

527
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:15,427
I'm afraid there's not enough time.

528
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:17,947
Three months ago,

529
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:20,306
didn't you already take an order

530
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:21,746
for a birthday gift?

531
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:26,066
You placed that order?

532
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,147
Let's go.

533
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:32,387
Mrs. Ning has been waiting.

534
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:40,667
Because of the competition
between Huangji and Yanyu Tower,

535
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:42,506
you noticed
the Huai Embroidery long ago,

536
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:45,266
and placed an order
three months in advance.

537
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:46,627
Later,

538
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,627
you deliberately led Yunniang

539
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,026
to Zuixian Restaurant.

540
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:51,427
You used her as a messenger

541
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,947
and made me come to you.

542
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:56,147
Madame Xu, well played.

543
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,627
No wonder you are favored by Mrs. Ning.

544
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,506
By the way,
there's one thing I don't get.

545
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:06,667
What's your grudge with Yanyu Tower?

546
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,066
Why are you helping me?

547
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:10,786
Could it be...

548
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:13,627
Ms. Huang, we're here.

549
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:36,306
Madam, Ms. Huang is here.

550
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:38,706
Greetings,

551
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:40,546
Mrs. Ning. May you be well.

552
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,066
Madam, are you not feeling well today?

553
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:51,546
Have a seat.

554
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:01,147
Madam.

555
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:03,947
This is the Huai Embroidery
from Huangji Embroidery House.

556
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:11,347
Where is this from?

557
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:12,746
This is a sample

558
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:13,986
from Huangji Embroidery House.

559
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:17,627
This embroidery technique
seems familiar.

560
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,226
After that lame fortune teller

561
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:21,746
made a fuss,

562
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,867
I asked you
to bring some embroidery samples.

563
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,427
You've shown me this before.

564
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:29,306
Yes.

565
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,347
The first time I came here,

566
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,347
I was wearing Huai Embroidery.

567
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:37,226
Because you had planned long ago

568
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:40,867
to recommend Huangji to me.

569
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:43,546
Local embroidery houses

570
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,746
have similar techniques.

571
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,667
Only Huai Embroidery is different.

572
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:48,867
I like it personally.

573
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:52,427
However, your close friend Lin Rulan

574
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,587
likes Yanyu Embroidery.

575
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,347
Mr. Wu finally remembered me.

576
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:10,387
Madame Xu.

577
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:13,546
Meng Wan.

578
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:18,387
Over these years,
many people have been around me,

579
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:21,026
but you're the only one I like.

580
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:23,186
Sometimes,

581
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:25,227
I don't even see you as a maid.

582
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:27,747
I even consider you a friend.

583
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:31,666
However,

584
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:36,466
You've been fooling me for months.

585
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:39,787
Have you thought about the consequences?

586
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:42,267
Madam.

587
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:47,707
Since the day Rulan died
seven years ago,

588
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,907
we could never be friends.

589
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,267
Before you ask me to think
about my consequences,

590
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,026
why not think about your own way out?

591
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,227
What do you mean?

592
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:04,267
Have you ever thought about it?

593
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:08,387
As soon as Wu Lian's smuggling case
was exposed,

594
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,506
why did Mr. Lou just happen

595
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,427
to appear in Huaizhou Prefecture?

596
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:15,267
You're behind it?

597
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:19,907
Since you already know my identity
and purpose,

598
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:22,227
there's no need for me to hide anything.

599
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:25,267
This is just the beginning.

600
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:28,066
You can't

601
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,347
protect Wu Lian.

602
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:34,907
Have you ever thought
that I could kill you?

603
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,186
Do you really think

604
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:40,227
that I could

605
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:42,827
make it to this day on my own?

606
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:54,106
What do you want exactly?

607
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:57,026
Over the years,

608
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,827
Wu Lian has taken too many lives.

609
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:04,307
Among the women in Yanyu Tower,

610
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:08,466
some drowned in the cold well water,

611
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:11,787
some swallowed needles and died,

612
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:14,626
some hung themselves in their rooms,

613
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:16,986
and some died from excessive bleeding
during miscarriage.

614
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,947
But he is still at large,

615
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:23,466
all thanks to your protection.

616
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:27,586
Do you know how much innocent blood

617
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:30,267
is on your hands?

618
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,466
Even if Wu Lian committed these crimes,

619
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:34,427
it's his business.

620
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:35,787
What does that have to do with me?

621
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:38,586
Right.

622
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,626
You are not behind it,

623
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,586
so I never harmed you.

624
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,146
I'm still suggesting you think

625
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,907
for yourself.

626
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:51,466
Smuggling and raping.

627
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:53,387
It's a huge scandal.

628
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,427
Mr. Lou has already targeted Wu Lian.

629
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,506
If you are really a smart person,

630
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:58,947
what you should do now

631
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:01,787
is not to kill me to protect Wu Lian,

632
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,506
but to do your best
to protect yourself first.

633
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:14,466
Madam.

634
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:18,066
This is a gamble.

635
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:22,066
You decide whether you place your bets

636
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,427
on me

637
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,586
or on Wu Lian.

638
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:30,427
Don't think that I'm good to you,

639
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,387
so you can ignore everything.

640
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:37,307
I'm grateful for your appreciation.

641
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,466
I have never harmed you.

642
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,427
Everything I said today is
from the bottom of my heart.

643
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,546
It's up to you

644
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,506
to believe it or not.

645
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:56,506
Meng Wan.

646
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,947
You are not allowed to set foot
in Ning Mansion ever again.

647
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:03,106
Get out.

648
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:08,787
Over the past days,

649
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:10,867
you've been taking care of me.

650
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:17,347
Thank you.

651
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:21,586
Get out.

652
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,867
Your face.

653
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:49,186
It's okay.

654
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:54,867
I met Lin Rulan before.

655
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:58,466
About seven years ago,

656
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,546
when she and Wu Lian were in court,

657
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:03,106
she hired a litigator.

658
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:06,986
But when I went to Yanyu Tower
to deliver silk threads the day before,

659
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:10,787
I saw that litigator being brought
into Wu Lian's study.

660
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,626
I've kept this

661
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:16,626
to myself.

662
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:21,347
A few days ago, when I saw the petition,

663
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:23,586
I felt uneasy.

664
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,026
I always felt guilty for her.

665
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,347
I was so naive back then.

666
00:39:33,347 --> 00:39:34,747
I thought I could save her.

667
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,707
Now that you know the ins and outs,

668
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,466
if you don't want to get involved,

669
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:45,106
I will have no complaints.

670
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:48,227
Madame Xu.

671
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,106
Though I value profit,

672
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:52,387
don't belittle me.

673
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:55,466
I've been able to support the women
in Huangji Embroidery House,

674
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:58,066
and hide the embroideresses

675
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,626
who escaped here for so many years.

676
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,387
Do you think

677
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:03,546
I only care about money?

678
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:07,347
You're an upright woman.

679
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,267
I misspoke.

680
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:18,482
(Peace)

681
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:30,186
Meng Wan.

682
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:32,106
Long time no see.

683
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:34,267
How have you been?

684
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:45,986
I'm an idiot.

685
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:49,146
I've been deceived for so long.

686
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:51,347
Gu Songju.

687
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,947
This name must have a deeper meaning.

688
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,546
Just cut to the chase.

689
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,707
I once heard a poem.

690
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:02,506
There is a line in it.

691
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,506
May my heart be as firm as an orchid

692
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,586
to keep my promise.

693
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:08,186
Have you heard it?

694
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,586
Of course.

695
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:12,506
Have a heart as firm as an orchid

696
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:14,387
and keep my promise.

697
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,186
That's exactly my intention.

698
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:20,787
I underestimated your friendship
with Lin Rulan.

699
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:24,986
The first time I saw you,

700
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:27,626
I just thought you looked familiar.

701
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:32,307
When you saw the embroidery samples
with Mrs. Ning,

702
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:35,787
I took a good look at your face.

703
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:39,586
I checked the portraits
for the embroideress.

704
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:42,907
And I increasingly felt
that something was wrong.

705
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,427
I was stuck on the ship for days,

706
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,466
so this matter was delayed.

707
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:48,947
After returning,

708
00:41:49,747 --> 00:41:52,546
I asked Wu An to investigate Gu Songju.

709
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:54,947
You investigate another person for me.

710
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:56,307
Yes.

711
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:59,666
The concubine of officer Xu Zhiyang

712
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,347
is named Gu Songju.

713
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,146
Send someone to Qizhou

714
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:06,146
to investigate her background.

715
00:42:06,347 --> 00:42:08,986
Also, keep a close eye on her.

716
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:10,867
Find out where she has been,

717
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:12,186
and whom she has met.

718
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:13,267
Take down every detail.

719
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,227
Before my people returned from Qizhou,

720
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,707
you have exposed yourself.

721
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:21,867
At first, I thought
what I had experienced lately

722
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:25,146
was caused by Cripple Liu
who just got out of jail.

723
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:28,747
When Wu An saw you two
having a secret meeting,

724
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:32,787
I connect these strange things together.

725
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,506
You have been working hard
on these matters.

726
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,787
Now it's all in vain.

727
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:40,387
What do you feel now?

728
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:41,827
Mr. Wu.

729
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,106
The victory is not yet decided.

730
00:42:45,026 --> 00:42:47,986
What makes you think it's all in vain?

731
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,267
You are so persistent,

732
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,986
because you feel guilty
for Rulan, right?

733
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,307
Can you sleep well at night?

734
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:02,787
And you?

735
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,747
Can you live in peace

736
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:10,747
after harming so many innocent people?

737
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:12,186
Meng Wan.

738
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:15,066
You brought an inquisitor here,
but so what?

739
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:18,986
For such a trivial love affair,

740
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:21,626
do you really think
the court will attach importance to it?

741
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:29,066
Rulan will not die in vain.

742
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:33,427
I will make you pay the price.

743
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:37,387
We'll see, Madame Xu.

744
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:48,120
(Goodliness)

745
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:14,707
Madam, it's late.

746
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:17,387
Xiangzhu.

747
00:44:19,387 --> 00:44:22,986
Is the night wind in Huaizhou cold?

748
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:25,787
Or is the night wind
in the capital cold?

749
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,747
Madam, I don't know.

750
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:33,707
Compared to the capital,

751
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:38,827
it is danker in Huaizhou.

752
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:48,026
I don't know if I still have a chance
to go back to the capital.

753
00:44:53,907 --> 00:44:55,466
Even if I can go back,

754
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,427
I'm afraid
I can't feel familiar anymore.

755
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:33,947
We split ways?

756
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:36,506
Can we?

757
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:38,986
At this point, it's hard to say.

758
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:42,867
Maybe we chose the wrong path

759
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:45,986
from the beginning.

760
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:49,626
Should I still go to the eastern market

761
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,066
to look for that guy?

762
00:45:52,026 --> 00:45:53,347
Just put it aside.

763
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:09,026
Who is it?

764
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:11,466
Madame Xu, it's me.
Please open the door.

765
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:19,546
What happened?

766
00:46:19,787 --> 00:46:21,546
It's done.

767
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:23,066
What's done?

768
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,347
I wanted to ask you.

769
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:25,986
When I returned in the afternoon,

770
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:27,466
I was so worried.

771
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,186
But just after nightfall,

772
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,106
someone from the Ning Mansion

773
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:32,986
paid me lots of money.

774
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:35,907
Mrs. Ning has chosen Huai Embroidery.

775
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:38,347
They asked us to finish it
as fast as possible.

776
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:39,586
Well,

777
00:46:39,787 --> 00:46:41,546
did you go to the Ning Mansion again

778
00:46:41,986 --> 00:46:44,106
and say something to Mrs. Ning?

779
00:46:47,586 --> 00:46:48,506
Mr. Liu.

780
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:51,427
You need to find that guy tomorrow.

781
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:04,106
Mr. Lou.

782
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:09,186
Greetings, Mr. Lou. I'm Meng Wan.

783
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,787
Please seek justice for Lin Rulan.

784
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:23,986
Sit.

785
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:25,707
Thank you.

786
00:47:50,227 --> 00:47:51,387
6,000 copper coins from Mr. Zhou.

787
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:53,267
1,000 copper coins from Mr. Sun.

788
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,586
2,000 copper coins from Mr. Zheng.

789
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:57,666
Take a look at the sachets.

790
00:47:57,907 --> 00:47:58,666
Look at this one.

791
00:48:02,186 --> 00:48:03,267
It helps calm the mind.

792
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,146
Calm the mind.

793
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:09,626
Seven years ago,

794
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:13,387
you stole all over Huaizhou Prefecture.

795
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:16,907
Your stealing skills got better now.

796
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:18,642
(Li Chunfeng)

797
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:21,466
You got the wrong person.

798
00:48:22,186 --> 00:48:23,307
You don't know me?

799
00:48:28,186 --> 00:48:29,066
Captain Liu.

800
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:31,026
Long time no see.

801
00:48:31,427 --> 00:48:33,626
Seven years ago, I was caught
and thrown into jail.

802
00:48:35,106 --> 00:48:37,227
You gave me a copper coin,

803
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:40,387
so I could buy the medicine
to save one leg.

804
00:48:41,427 --> 00:48:43,747
Today, I have to pay it back to you.

805
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,506
