(Shen Mu Is Onboard)

3
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,751
(Seven years later)

4
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,071
Once the goods are all transported
into the cargo ship,

5
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,751
we dismantle the deck
and head to the sides.

6
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,550
(Kong Xin, Vice Head of the Imperial Guard Bureau)
Mr. Shen, something's going on.

7
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,830
Quick. Stop them!

8
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,927
Stop.

9
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,568
Go!

10
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,351
You bandits, how dare you rob my ship!

11
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:48,110
Zhao Yin, the Supervisor of
Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau

12
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:49,951
and Wu Lian from the Yanyu Tower.

13
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,550
You two are smuggling
and caught in the act.

14
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:54,270
Send them
to the capital for investigation.

15
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,830
What happened?

16
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,231
I'm about to ask you.

17
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,270
It seems like they're from the capital.

18
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,670
- Did you leak any information?
- I...

19
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,430
Let me know after you decide.

20
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:09,071
You plead guilty

21
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:11,110
or let me take you?

22
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,631
You're slandering me.

23
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,511
Do you dare to show your face?

24
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,791
Why not?

25
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,830
Do you recognize him?

26
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,830
I think I've never seen him.

27
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,031
Arrest them!

28
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,864
Go!

29
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,710
Do you dare to jump?

30
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,990
Obviously don't.

31
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,270
It's too high. Let's see how it goes.

32
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,430
Can your guards beat them?

33
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,230
Why does this person look so familiar?

34
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,751
Do you know him?

35
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,350
Shen Mu? He once worked
for the Huaizhou Prefecture.

36
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,910
I can't believe
he's become so powerful in seven years.

37
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,551
Well, go ask for help quickly.

38
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,311
Let's see how it goes.

39
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,350
I don't know
if he's a good man now. Calm down.

40
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:05,710
- You stay. I'll get off to get help.
- You...

41
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,710
Protect me off the ship.

42
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,431
Go around from behind.

43
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,150
No.

44
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,470
Where are you going?

45
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,790
If Wu Lian gets caught by him,

46
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,590
how are we going
to explain to Madame Xu?

47
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,191
There are too many people there.

48
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,311
Mr. Wu, where are you going?

49
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,030
Who are you?

50
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,470
An old acquaintance.

51
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,350
Which one?

52
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:59,590
No need to know. Follow me back
to the capital to confess your crimes.

53
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:01,830
I won't hurt you.

54
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:07,991
Shen, spare his life.

55
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,071
Shen, long time no see.
Do you still remember me?

56
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,390
Liu Xin?

57
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,910
Good, you still remember me.

58
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,071
Mr. Wu, don't be scared.

59
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,191
Shen, let's talk.

60
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,710
Shen, what are you doing?

61
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,830
You were once famous
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

62
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,951
Now you're the dog of the Yanyu Tower?

63
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,470
What? You misunderstood me.

64
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,030
Guys.

65
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,431
Don't kill me.

66
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,951
Sanniang, help.

67
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,710
Sanniang, aren't you good
at sword dancing?

68
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,631
You fight them.

69
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,951
- Stop talking nonsense.
- Wait.

70
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,790
I will take him back to the capital.

71
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:06,030
You didn't want to kill him?
It's a misunderstanding.

72
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,910
His life can be spared
for now, but not yours.

73
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,150
Shen, you've misunderstood.

74
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,710
I'm not a villain.

75
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,590
Once you've boarded his ship,

76
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,350
don't expect to escape alive.

77
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:22,790
Shen, Wu Lian is my nemesis.

78
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,350
Why can't you believe me?

79
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:31,631
Listen to me.

80
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,511
She's Liu Sanniang,
the top courtesan from Xunzhou.

81
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,511
She excels at singing,
dancing, and music.

82
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:45,390
I can give her to you all for free.

83
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:46,551
It's on me.

84
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,631
You rat.

85
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,551
Sanniang, just treat it
as serving guests.

86
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,390
After him!

87
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,910
Shen, don't kill Wu Lian.

88
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,511
I'll be back shortly.

89
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,111
She is the top courtesan.

90
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,270
Why are you chasing me?

91
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,590
Wu Lian, how did you offend them?

92
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:19,350
How did you get caught too?

93
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,751
Who exactly are you?

94
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,991
Can't you let us know

95
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,951
before we die?

96
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,071
You'll know when we get to the capital.

97
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,551
Even if we get to the capital,
what can you do to us?

98
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:41,350
It seems you've already thought
about your excuses.

99
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,110
I merely teach skills
and sells embroidery.

100
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,071
What crimes have I committed?

101
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,990
Mr. Shen, something's going on outside.

102
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:49,510
Mr. Shen, allow me
to come aboard and talk.

103
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,151
Kong Xin, bring them here. Be careful.

104
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,584
Yes.

105
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,391
It's been seven years.

106
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,151
I didn't expect to meet you today.

107
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:10,630
When you left Huaizhou Prefecture
after Rulan's death,

108
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,870
you said you'd give up politics
and join the army.

109
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,510
Now, you've entered the officialdom.

110
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:20,951
You swore to seek justice
for Lin Rulan back then,

111
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:25,350
but now,
you're speaking up for the culprit.

112
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,830
Yes, that's why I'm here.

113
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Mr. Liu is under my instruction.

114
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,311
That's why he tried to protect Wu Lian.

115
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,710
But you've misunderstood our intentions.

116
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:44,391
What intentions?

117
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,151
According to Mr. Liu,

118
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,911
you plan to take Zhao Yin
and Wu Lian back for trial.

119
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,911
You work for the Imperial Guard Bureau
or the Supervision Bureau?

120
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,830
Since you don't want to say,

121
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,350
I will make a guess.

122
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,791
The Tiger Head Army
is skilled at blades,

123
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,551
and they like using pungent pine wax oil
to wipe the blade.

124
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:13,551
So, you did join the military back then.

125
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,391
A year ago, after the Tiger Head Army
quelled the border chaos,

126
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,510
it was merged into the Imperial Guard
and the Supervision Bureau.

127
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,750
I guess you must've chosen
to work for the Imperial Guard Bureau.

128
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:28,431
Why?

129
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,710
Because you'll have the opportunity
to investigate Wu Lian.

130
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,110
A year ago,
I heard from maritime merchants

131
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,311
that the embroidery tribute appeared

132
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:43,311
on the overseas market,

133
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,311
which resembled the Yanyu Embroidery.

134
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:48,470
It reminded me.

135
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,911
Although his embroidery is expensive,

136
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,830
he doesn't produce many pieces
throughout the year.

137
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,230
If the Yanyu Tower relied solely

138
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,830
on embroideresses
and the apprentices' tuition,

139
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,151
it would hardly make ends meet.

140
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,391
So, all these years,

141
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,671
what has he been doing

142
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:11,350
to maintain his rich and luxurious life?

143
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:19,630
He's been smuggling
to make huge profits.

144
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,431
I'm a married woman
with many restrictions.

145
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,110
It took a lot of effort and time

146
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,990
to investigate the dealings

147
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,750
of Zhao Yin and Wu Lian.

148
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,230
I presume
you also noticed something strange.

149
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:43,031
That's why you work
in the Imperial Guard Bureau

150
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,911
to find an opportunity
to investigate Wu Lian, right?

151
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,911
Since you know my intention,

152
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,431
why did you come tonight?

153
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:57,110
It's been seven years,
and you're still chasing after Wu Lian,

154
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:03,191
even acting in secret. Why?

155
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,470
He's been smuggling,
disloyal to the country and people.

156
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:10,830
Is that all?

157
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:13,311
Are you doing it to seek justice

158
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:16,031
for the woman who was wronged?

159
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:24,911
Absolutely.

160
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,630
So you, me, Mr. Liu

161
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,431
and Liu Sanniang are all
in the same boat.

162
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:33,031
How so?

163
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,590
We all think Wu Lian deserves to die,

164
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:37,191
but he shouldn't die for smuggling.

165
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,671
He should die for Rulan, for Ding Ru,

166
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,431
and for all the women he has harmed.

167
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,071
Do you have a plan?

168
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,311
Yes. Park the ship
and give me three days.

169
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,830
After three days,
if I fail to keep my promise,

170
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:58,630
you can do as you wish with Wu Lian.

171
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:01,230
I work for the Imperial Guard Bureau.

172
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:05,791
You're asking me to neglect my duty.

173
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,151
You boarded secretly.

174
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,470
If you don't mention
the Imperial Guard Bureau,

175
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,151
who would know the identities
of these men in black?

176
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,791
I'll give you three days.

177
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:23,470
If you have time, could you chat
with Zhao Yin for me?

178
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:24,830
That would be better.

179
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,230
About what?

180
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,311
I made a mistake

181
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,671
and caused you both to take risks.

182
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,350
I should apologize to you both.

183
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:54,350
Stop it.

184
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,951
We finally caught Wu Lian.

185
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:58,870
We just let him go?

186
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,551
I should do something to him.

187
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,271
We didn't catch him.

188
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,350
If you want to take his life,

189
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,510
none of the officials
on this ship would agree.

190
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,870
I'll just break his leg.

191
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,630
He owes me.

192
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,911
Don't try to scare me.

193
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:21,151
Let me tell you.

194
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,071
If we go by seniority,

195
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,470
your boss used to work for me.

196
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,431
Get out of here. Stop pretending

197
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,311
like you can beat them.

198
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:42,071
Hey, I'll get to you later.

199
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:09,752
(Yanyu Tower)

200
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,791
Open the door.

201
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,590
Open the door.

202
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,431
What's wrong?

203
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:26,671
Mr. Wu was arrested.

204
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,027
(Ning Mansion)

205
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,311
Wenyue went back to visit her family.
Her home isn't far.

206
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,350
She should have been back yesterday.

207
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,550
Why is there still no sign of her?

208
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,591
( Xiangzhu, the maid)
I've already asked someone to inquire.

209
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,510
There's no one at her home.

210
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,951
No one at home?

211
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,911
Mrs. Ning, Prefect Chen is here.

212
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:26,631
Greetings, Mrs. Ning.

213
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,030
What's the matter at this late hour?

214
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:35,631
I just received a report that Mr. Wu...

215
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,151
What happened to him again?

216
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,710
Tonight Mr. Wu went
to the wharf to meet a friend,

217
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,151
but he ran into a group of villains.

218
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,310
He is now trapped on a cargo ship.

219
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,951
He asked his servant

220
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:48,431
to come to the Yamen for help.

221
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,591
The wharf?

222
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,550
Shouldn't he be at home
embroidering now?

223
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,111
Who is he meeting at the wharf?

224
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,310
Well...

225
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,831
Tell me.

226
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,631
We've interrogated his servant
for a long time

227
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,151
before he told the truth.

228
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,631
Mr. Wu met a man
from the capital named Zhao Yin,

229
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,030
the Supervisor
of the Foreign Trade Bureau.

230
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,951
When they were smuggling,

231
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,990
they were caught on the spot.

232
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,550
But we really don't know

233
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:22,591
who caught them.

234
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,310
Unbelievable.

235
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:31,191
How dare he do such a thing
under my watch.

236
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,151
He is really bold.

237
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,750
Calm down, Mrs. Ning.

238
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,070
This matter involves a lot.

239
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,431
I dare not act rashly.

240
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,591
So I'm here asking for your advice.

241
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,790
Zhao Yin is a child
of an official family in the capital.

242
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:49,591
Now he is trapped
on the ship with Mr. Wu.

243
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,230
His life is uncertain.

244
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:54,470
I really don't know what to do.

245
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,750
Don't make a fuss about it.
Leave immediately.

246
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:08,191
No matter what, help me save him first.

247
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,111
Yes.

248
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,911
Listen, you bandits on the ship.

249
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:33,710
How dare you kidnap an official.

250
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,671
It's a capital offense. Surrender now.

251
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,631
I'll give more lenient sentences.

252
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,911
They are unrepentant.

253
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,470
Prefect Chen, can I have a try?

254
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,288
Go ahead.

255
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,191
Everyone on the ship.

256
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,351
Can we have a good talk?

257
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:10,550
As long as you release the two men,

258
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,631
we won't punish you all.

259
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:21,951
It doesn't work.

260
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,151
Let's be tough then.

261
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,591
The ship is surrounded by water,
so it's hard to attack.

262
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,070
How do you plan to rescue them?

263
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,470
Do you have any good strategies?

264
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,871
Prefect Chen.

265
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,631
Since they use bamboo poles,

266
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,230
why don't we follow suit?

267
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:47,550
Fine, go find poles quickly.

268
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes.

269
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,151
Prefect Chen.

270
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,510
It takes a day and night to go

271
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,191
to the bamboo forest
in the suburbs and come back.

272
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,710
You really know a lot.

273
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,710
You tell me what to do.

274
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,550
Why don't you go over by boat yourself?

275
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:04,310
You are an official.

276
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,510
I guess they dare not hurt you.

277
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,710
Are you using me as a live target?

278
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:11,871
I dare not.

279
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:15,191
A bunch of losers.

280
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,030
- Prefect Chen.
- What is it?

281
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,391
Mrs. Ning is pressing us again.

282
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,951
Send a clever person back
to report quickly.

283
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:26,431
Tell her we are still trying.

284
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,230
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

285
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:40,911
Bring the archers.

286
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,671
It's too far away.
The arrows can't reach it.

287
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,230
Do I need you to tell me? Do it now.

288
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,831
Yes, I'm on it.

289
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:59,160
Shoot.

290
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,631
Why are you looking at me? Go on.

291
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,831
Load the arrow.

292
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,671
Shoot.

293
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,151
Again.

294
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,230
Load the arrow.

295
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,871
Shoot.

296
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:31,631
Load the arrow.

297
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:44,871
What are they doing?

298
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,790
They are probably exercising.

299
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,070
Prefect Chen, it doesn't work.

300
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:56,871
We're running out of arrows.

301
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,391
Prefect Chen.

302
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:17,990
Prefect Chen.

303
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,030
Help me up. Hurry.

304
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,351
Go back.

305
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,191
You bandits,
how dare you shoot an official.

306
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,750
Report to Mrs. Ning.

307
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:30,391
I am dying.

308
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:31,831
Come on.

309
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,510
Report to Mrs. Ning.

310
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,391
Are you okay? Slow down.

311
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:46,391
Mr. Shen.

312
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,510
Whatever you want, just say it.

313
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,270
I can buy you an official position.

314
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,191
Any positions below the third rank.

315
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:54,510
I have connections.

316
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,230
Right, why don't you join us?

317
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,790
Let's become sworn brothers
and make big money together.

318
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:04,391
We could learn from the ancients.

319
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,470
Wu Lian, don't you think so?

320
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,510
Buddy, say something.

321
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:11,391
Life matters. Forget your pride.

322
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,270
Why are you panicking?
Even if we go to the capital,

323
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,191
we'll be sent to the Dali Court.

324
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:21,310
Isn't it better to avoid trouble?

325
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,470
If we're convicted, and it gets big,

326
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,671
neither of us can survive.

327
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:28,750
Mr. Shen, you think about it.

328
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,310
Is your shouting going to help?

329
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,030
I have no choice. What can we do?

330
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,951
The point now is to find a way out.

331
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,310
How?

332
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,151
Help me untie the rope.

333
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:47,750
How?

334
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,710
Use your mouth. Bite it with your teeth.

335
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:53,911
You help me first.

336
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,270
Don't you want to get out?

337
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,391
Hurry up.

338
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,710
Help me untie it too.

339
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,111
Hurry up.

340
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:32,408
Hurry.

341
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,671
What are you doing?

342
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,151
Mr. Wu, what are you doing?

343
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,470
If you try to escape again,
I will cut off your fingers.

344
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,671
So you can never hold a needle again.

345
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,391
Mr. Shen.

346
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:37,310
Mr. Zhao, in addition to smuggling,

347
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,391
you have so many unspeakable secrets.

348
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:44,431
What do you mean by this?

349
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:48,111
Wu Lian has already sold you out
to save his own life.

350
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,391
What did he say about me?

351
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,310
He insisted

352
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,591
that he sold embroidery to you,

353
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,550
but he didn't know
where you were going to sell.

354
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,671
Is it true?

355
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:06,591
It seems you've already thought
about your excuses.

356
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:10,351
I merely teach skills
and sells embroidery.

357
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,391
What crimes have I committed?

358
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,351
Mr. Shen.

359
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:20,351
Wu Lian couldn't have said that.

360
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,911
When Wu Lian is back,

361
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,790
you can ask him yourself.

362
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:28,310
What else did he say about me?

363
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,391
He also said
that you have violated many young women

364
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,710
in the Yanyu Tower.

365
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,151
Nonsense. He's slandering me.

366
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:38,951
Wu Lian is framing me.

367
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:44,831
Forget it. Whether it's true or false,
no rush to know it right now.

368
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,191
After we get to the capital,

369
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:48,871
the two of you can argue then.

370
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,871
Mr. Shen, wait.

371
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,671
I want to confront Wu Lian face to face.

372
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,671
Don't believe Wu Lian's one-sided words.

373
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,911
Mr. Shen.

374
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:11,191
- Mrs. Ning.
- Why are you alone?

375
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,230
Where is Madame Xu?

376
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,790
I have been to her house,

377
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,111
but her maid said

378
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,351
that Madame Xu went out after noon.

379
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,871
She usually comes to visit me every day.

380
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:26,951
Now I can't find her when I need her.

381
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,710
You wait for her at her home.
Once she comes back,

382
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,831
bring her to see me immediately.

383
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,911
Yes.

384
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,351
Wait.

385
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,831
Yes.

386
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,310
What about Wenyue? Any news?

387
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,470
Our people have been there many times,

388
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,951
but no one is at her house.

389
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,631
Go ahead.

390
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:48,600
Yes.

391
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,831
Don't light it. It gives me a headache.

392
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,671
Alright, Mrs. Ning.

393
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:44,600
Who is it?

394
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,951
Mrs. Ning, what's wrong?

395
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,671
I beg your forgiveness.
I should have checked first.

396
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,550
Is Wenyue going behind my back?

397
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:36,351
Madame Xu, what are you trying to do

398
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,030
making lanterns all day and night?

399
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:41,990
This lantern is wrapped in soft paper,

400
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,750
soft on the outside

401
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,191
but tough and unyielding inside.

402
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,070
Isn't it similar to the women?

403
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:20,211
(The young man goes with the wind
and returns in time.)

404
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,131
(A leaf in the vast ocean, floating
and sinking between heaven and earth.)

405
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:39,794
(Give a treasure hairpin to the hero.
Ignite a candle light.)

406
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,288
(Wait in the boudoir for seven years,
but nothing is forgotten.)

407
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,030
That's interesting.

408
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,990
It seems you're not hanging lanterns,

409
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,671
but weaving a net for Wu Lian.

410
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:17,653
(Who says the wilderness
don't know the emotions of the world?)

411
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,111
Lady, have you heard
about a recent rumor?

412
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:32,790
What is it?

413
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,951
People are saying

414
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,831
that Mr. Wu has committed a crime,

415
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,750
and he is being held on a ship
by the officers from the capital.

416
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,871
I don't know if it's true.

417
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,550
There's no news from Yamen.

418
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,631
To solve a case, courage, wisdom,

419
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:55,111
and power are all indispensable.

420
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,750
Is there such a person
in Huaizhou Prefecture?

421
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,990
There wasn't in the past,
but there is today.

422
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,230
Are you referring to him?

423
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,310
It's the one he brought.

424
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:21,790
I see. This man dresses like an escort,

425
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,030
but he looks scary like a bad man.

426
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:30,431
Don't be afraid. He's an old friend
who came to return a favor.

427
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,860
