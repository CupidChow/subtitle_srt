1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,640
(7 years later)
Please, Mr. Li.

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
Leave us alone and steal from others.

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,559
Liang, your words are a bit harsh.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,800
What do you mean by stealing?
I just borrowed something.

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,399
Don't you believe me?
Look, I've written it all down here.

6
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,399
Three taels of dumplings yesterday,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,839
two taels of wonton the day before,

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,600
four taels of meatballs
the day before that,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,039
and two taels of meat dumplings today.

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,240
Liang, just give them to me.

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,600
Once I become the top scholar,

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,240
I will surely pay you back tenfold.

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,880
Y-Y-You little thief!

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,079
You really think

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,560
you can get away with this?

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,640
Get lost! Now!

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,600
Calm down. Leave.

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,479
You guys

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,399
have just got tunnel vision.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,119
You'll regret it.

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,840
Why are you here again?

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,759
Stay away from me.

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,439
Short-sighted.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,200
New bun shop open for business!

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,560
Fresh meat buns
just out of the steamer!

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,479
Everyone, come and have a look.

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,840
Freshly steamed meat buns!

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Step right up!

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,480
Sir, new bun stall.

30
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,159
Would you like to try a few?

31
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:10,178
No, thanks. I'm just looking.

32
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:11,137
Okay.

I'm just here to have a look.

38
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:29,578
Li Chunfeng,

39
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:32,257
you've practically stolen
everything from my bookshop.

40
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,057
You've even ruined my business.

41
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:36,578
Tomorrow, the landlord
is coming to take it back.

42
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:37,857
And you still dare to come?

(List of Items Borrowed)

44

Tell me,

45
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:47,057
what will my family
live on in the future?

46
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:48,977
On the debt bills from you?

47
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:52,298
Alright, sir.

48
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:53,818
Don't you just want money?

49
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:54,977
Don't worry.

50
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,777
I'll be right back.

51
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,617
Look at this.

52
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,298
It helps to calm the mind.

53
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,378
Calm the mind.

54
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,138
7 years ago,

55
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,898
you stole all over
Huaizhou Prefecture, Mr. Li

56
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:16,178
Mr. Liu,

57
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:18,657
how have you been?

58
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:21,138
7 years ago, I was caught
and thrown into jail.

59
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,738
Thanks to you giving me a copper coin,

60
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:27,858
I could buy the medicine
to save one leg.

61
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:31,377
Today, I have to pay it back to you.

62
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:35,458
Hey you, I have a thief here.

63
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,258
This man stole your purse.

64
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:38,057
Come on.

65
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,057
Everyone, come and help.

66
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:39,898
What are you doing?

67
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:40,698
It's him.

68
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:41,777
Not me.

69
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't. Catch him.

70
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,097
Catch him.

71
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:49,738
It's not me.

72
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:54,777

(Mr. Li's Burglary at the Yanyu Tower)

75
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,297
Mr. Liu, how are you?

76
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,258
Come in and sit down.

77
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:49,857
Since I'm here,

78
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,018
surely I will come in
and sit for a while.

79
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:02,018
Mr. Liu, your visit
brightens my humble abode.

80
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,537
It's been so many years,

81
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,097
and you still didn't get
a proper job for yourself.

82
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:08,898
Look at this dilapidated house.

83
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,297
My job is studying.

84
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:13,417
As the ancients said,

85
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:16,138
all professions rank below a scholar.

86
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:17,537
Let me tell you.

87
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,417
- When I pass the exam...
- Enough.

88
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,378
You're still saying the same nonsense
after all these years.

89
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:24,258
If your father were alive,

90
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:25,698
he'd definitely beat you up.

91
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,857
Mr. Liu, how have you been
in prison these past years?

92
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:31,537
Mind your own business.

93
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:33,777
Stop prying into mine.

94
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:43,698
Look at these.

95
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,177
You're messing around

96
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:47,458
with children's toys now?

97
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:50,177
No, I-I-I just do this for fun.

98
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:54,818
Don't. Mr. Liu, please sit down.

99
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,058
I'll pour you some water.

100

(List of Items Borrowed)

101
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,657
You've kept these accounts quite clear.

102
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:11,258
Are you planning to repay them

103
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,058
or what?

104
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:15,498
I'm so ashamed.

105
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,618
Li Chunfeng,

106
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,737
you're a scholar,

107
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:26,898
but you barely know how to write

108
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,058
and are always idling around.

109
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,058
You're still
a low-level scholar even now.

110
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,938
You're a thief,

111
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,777
and you're quite good at it,

112
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,898
but you just don't admit it.

113
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:43,458
If we say you've gone
astray in your life,

114
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,058
it's not thievery you've strayed into,

115
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,177
but studying.

116
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:57,458
Mr. Liu,

117
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:00,417
back when you were influential
in Huaizhou Prefecture,

118
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:02,378
you did help me a lot.

119
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:05,297
That's why I still have
some respect for you.

120
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,378
But for us scholars,
it is our lifelong dream

121
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:09,297
to pass the imperial examination.

122
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:11,657
You can't joke about it.

123
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:14,857
Enough, I don't want
to hear such nonsense.

124
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,578
I came today to ask you.

125
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,578
Do you know about the Yanyu Tower

126
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,378
in Huaizhou Prefecture?

127
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:24,138
The Yanyu Tower.

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,378
Well,

129
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,177
everyone from Huaizhou knows about it.

130
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,618
Why do you suddenly ask about it?

131
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:34,498
I want to ask you for a favor.

132
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:36,498
What would I do in there?

133
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:39,498
Look for a woman.

134
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:53,297
The gold embroidery
of yours is grand and elegant,

135
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,537
and it blends perfectly
with the meticulous style

136
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:57,337
of the local needlework

137
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,018
without any awkward clash.

138
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:04,058
Instead, it conveys
a harmonious feeling

139
00:08:04,378 --> 00:08:05,898
by enhancing each other.

140
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:07,657
Even good wine needs bush.

141
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,058
It's all thanks to you

142
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,417
that our store got this opportunity.

143
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:14,938
When will this embroidery be finished?

144
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,578
You ordered it three months ago.

145
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:21,217
Now this large-sleeve shirt
has been done.

146
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:23,378
And that cloak.

147
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,337
I've also been helping recently.

148
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,297
It can be finished in at most ten days.

149
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,217
I promise there won't be
any more delays.

150
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:30,177
No rush.

151
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,618
You just delay it

152
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:34,738
until the last day.

153
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,697
What does it mean?

154
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,978
Are you really going to do it?

155
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:51,817
Just in case.

156
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:54,338
It's a risky move,

157
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,618
but also a backup plan.

158
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:16,978
Sir.

159
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:18,577
What's wrong?

160
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:20,417
I just heard

161
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:22,258
that Huangji Embroidery House

162
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:24,258
had taken a big order
from the Ning family.

163
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:27,777
Are you sure?

164
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,098
Yes, absolutely.

165
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,498
Prepare a litter.

166
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,297
I'm going to the Ning Mansion.

167
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,498
Yes.

168
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,298
(Ning Mansion)

169
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:09,978
Sir.

170
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:11,898
The lady is still napping?

171
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:13,018
Yes.

172
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,498
Sir, would you mind

173
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,618
coming again another day?

174
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,457
I'll wait a bit longer.

175
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:25,297
If Mrs. Ning wakes up,

176
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,498
please let me know.

177
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,858
I'll get you some hot tea again.

178
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:34,657
No need.

179
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:39,138
Mrs. Ning.

180
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:45,138
Wu Lian, how many years
have we known each other?

181
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,378
It's been 11 years.

182
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:53,177
So my husband
has been dead for 11 years.

183
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,138
I still remember it.

184
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,777
Back then, I moved here with him.

185
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:03,057
We hadn't been here for two months,

186
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:05,898
and the peonies planted

187
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:09,378
in this garden hadn't bloomed yet,

188
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,378
but he died suddenly.

189
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,657
At that time, I almost died with him.

190
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:24,258
Ever since his death,

191
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:26,858
this house

192
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,858
has been no longer the Ning Mansion,

193
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,098
but a tomb.

194
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:34,978
I never thought

195
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,457
I could actually endure the loneliness

196
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,697
for 11 years.

197
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:44,657
Mrs. Ning,

198
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,777
why did you suddenly mention this today?

199
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:52,898
Wu Lian,

200
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:55,338
I don't care anymore

201
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,697
what bad things you've done

202
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:00,978
or what troubles you've caused

203
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:02,417
over the years.

204
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,618
But I hope you understand

205
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:09,138
I'm just a lonely woman.

206
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,937
Over these past years,

207
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,898
it's been a long, hard grind of striving

208
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:16,098
on my own step by step

209
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:20,018
just to barely keep
the Ning family afloat

210
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:21,978
until today.

211
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:25,057
So I absolutely won't

212
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:28,218
burn all my bridges

213
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:29,338
just because of you.

214
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:30,817
Mrs. Ning.

215
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:31,898
From now on,

216
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,618
we'll only have a business relationship.

217
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,898
We'll take care of our own fortunes.

218
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:44,858
Over the years,

219
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,218
you've served me tea many times,

220
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,657
so today, I'll do it for you.

221
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:12,498
The relationship between the Yanyu Tower

222
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:15,777
and the Ning Mansion ends today.

223
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:28,297
I remember you once said,

224
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:31,618
"An intelligent person

225
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:34,457
should be used.

226
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:37,338
But if you keep a person

227
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,697
who is too clever by your side,

228
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:40,978
probably,

229
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,457
even you will become his stepping stone.

230
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,577
Such a person is even more dangerous."

231
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:05,537
I'm grateful

232
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,457
for your care over the past years.

233
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:10,138
I wish you all the best.

234
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:19,498
Take care.

235
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,882
(Wait in the boudoir for seven years,
but nothing is forgotten.)

236
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,258
This is the place.

237
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:27,697
The place is quite unique.

238
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,858
Definitely better
than your shabby house.

239
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:32,817
Madame Xu,

240
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,577
sorry to drop in like this.

241
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,177
This guy is too stubborn,

242
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,697
insisting on knowing the whole truth

243
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:40,738
before taking on the work.

244
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,457
I thought we weren't strangers,

245
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,177
so I took it upon myself
to bring him here.

246
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:48,297
Mr. Li.

247
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:49,577
Nice to meet you, Madame Xu.

248
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,498
I'll get straight to the point.

249
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,297
Your commission is quite peculiar.

250
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,177
I need to know the details

251
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,657
just to be reassured.

252
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:58,858
I hope it's okay.

253
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:00,898
The matter is quite hard.

254
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,218
Mr. Liu recommended you to me.

255
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,417
You must have learned from him

256
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,697
about what we're working on.

257
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:09,338
Have you heard an inquisitor

258
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,777
from the Eastern District of Huainan

259
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,738
has arrived in Huaizhou recently?

260
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:18,858
Yes, I have.

261
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,177
Yesterday, my friend introduced me

262
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,457
to him.

263
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:27,657
Now, the two factions
behind the Yanyu Tower

264
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,018
have both disintegrated,

265
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,138
and Wu Lian has no allies.

266
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,978
No one can protect him anymore.

267
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:37,858
If the old case
is reopened at this time,

268
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,057
it can be a sweeping victory.

269
00:16:40,618 --> 00:16:42,978
Tonight, I did not come

270
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,898
as a friend of Rulan,

271
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,378
but as a plaintiff and witness

272
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:50,258
in Wu Lian's rape case.

273
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,457
7 years have passed.

274
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:54,618
Even though it's a bit late,

275
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:57,777
I'd like to continue

276
00:16:58,057 --> 00:16:59,537
to charge Wu Lian for Rulan.

277
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,817
It's seven years.

278
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,497
Madame Xu,

279
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:08,177
whether you're doing this for justice

280
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,818
or for a dear friend,

281
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:12,937
as an official, I am ashamed

282
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:17,618
to see you've managed to do all this.

283
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,937
But even though
Wu Lian's patron has fallen,

284
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:26,338
there are still many difficulties
in reversing the verdict.

285
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,937
Please elaborate, Mr. Lou.

286
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:29,898
First,

287
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:34,257
you and Miss Lin were very close.

288
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,257
The plaintiff passed away.

289
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:41,338
As her close friend,
you want to take over the case now.

290
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:46,338
It'll make your testimony less credible.

291
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:47,457
Second,

292
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:51,578
all the old case files in the Yamen

293
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,378
are in Wu Lian's favor

294
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:55,697
and unfavorable to Miss Lin.

295
00:17:56,257 --> 00:18:00,737
To reopen an old case,
there needs to be a cause.

296
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:02,697
So you mean

297
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,898
I need to find

298
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:08,098
more credible witnesses or evidence?

299
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:09,177
Exactly.

300
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:14,378
I'm currently reviewing
the case records of Wu Lian.

301
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:15,977
I think

302
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:22,257
Mrs. Wu may help us get a breakthrough.

303
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:23,737
Zhang Rong'er?

304
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:24,657
Yes.

305
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:28,257
She has been living
a secluded life these years,

306
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:33,298
yet she often goes
to the Fuyuan Temple to pray.

307
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:35,578
I went to the temple

308
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:39,657
and found the monk who was close to her.

309
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,298
Did you find anything?

310
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,298
I didn't get much.

311
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:46,697
I had to reveal my identity

312
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:49,217
before he finally agreed
to share anything.

313
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:55,298
He said that during one
of her chanting sessions,

314
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:59,257
Zhang Rong'er said something to him,

315
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,457
and it seemed to have
an underlying meaning.

316
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:02,937
What was that?

317
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:04,737
She said,

318
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:09,457
"The evidence is right in front of us,

319
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:13,778
but everyone turns a blind eye."

320
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,217
The evidence is right in front of us,

321
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:24,417
but everyone turns a blind eye.

322
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:26,058
Mrs. Wu

323
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:27,818
used to be in the public eye

324
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,737
and handle the affairs
of the Tower herself a few years ago.

325
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,017
But in recent years, for some reason,

326
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,618
she has lived a secluded life

327
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:35,898
and rarely shows up.

328
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:37,338
I'm not even sure

329
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,177
if she still lives in that house.

330
00:19:39,818 --> 00:19:41,977
Tonight, I'll sneak
into the Yanyu Tower,

331
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:43,257
find out where she is

332
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,177
and ask her the meaning of her words.

333
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:47,298
It'll be good if she tells you,

334
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:49,497
but if she doesn't,

335
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:52,017
you'll have to do a search

336
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,737
in that house

337
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:56,338
to find out what the evidence,

338
00:19:56,457 --> 00:20:00,017
which is in front of everyone,
yet unseen, exactly is.

339
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:05,257
Alright, I'll do it.

340
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:15,618
This is the place.

341
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:19,017
Go. Be careful.

342
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:20,497
Alright.

343
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,578
Why are you still here?

344
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,017
It suddenly occurs to me.

345
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:31,338
Money is dispensable,

346
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,217
but the task is quite dangerous.

347
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:34,977
Shouldn't there be

348
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,818
some pay?

349
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:38,778
You little ungrateful wretch!

350
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:40,378
If it hadn't been for me,

351
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,378
you would have died in the prison!

352
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,058
You are so rude!

353
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,818
I'm in debt, okay?

354
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,937
If I don't pay back the money tomorrow,

355
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:50,977
I might ruin a good business.

356
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,898
Aren't you stupid?

357
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:55,898
Inside this house

358
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:57,657
is valuable stuff everywhere,

359
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:00,017
especially those Yanyu Embroideries made
by Wu Lian himself.

360
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,378
Steal the biggest

361
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,497
and most expensive-looking one,

362
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,138
and it'll cover you for three years.

363
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,538
You're really the greediest person
in Huaizhou.

364
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:35,618
Hey.

365
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:39,497
What are you doing at this late hour?

366
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,618
Cripple Liu.

367
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,618
You drank?

368
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:49,858
Come with me.

369
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:50,737
What?

370
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:51,497
Come on.

371
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,058
Hurry up.

372
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:54,177
What are you going to do?

373
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:55,578
What...

374
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:59,898
Dig up this place.

375
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,257
Hurry.

376
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:03,298
Do it now.

377
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:04,977
Are you crazy?

378
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,177
Hurry up!

379
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:51,058
Did Mrs. Wu

380
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:53,457
really move outside?

381
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:21,737
How did you know
there was vintage wine below it?

382
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:24,338
I've lived here for many years.

383
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:26,138
How could I not know?

384
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,457
There's still a lot inside.

385
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,457
This is the previous house
of the Yuan family, right?

386
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:36,657
The taste.

387
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,618
I never managed to make it afterward.

388
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,657
Master seemed to have
something up his sleeve

389
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:47,457
and didn't give me the complete recipe.

390
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:51,417
Mellow wine.

391
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:53,017
Of course it is.

392
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:58,217
My master was not only
talented and handsome

393
00:23:58,818 --> 00:23:59,858
but also

394
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:02,058
good at making wine.

395
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:03,737
You still have him in your heart.

396
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:05,618
So what?

397
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:11,858
What about him?

398
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:14,177
You don't understand.

399
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,058
I still love him,

400
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:18,538
and that's enough.

401
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,417
You're quite open-minded.

402
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,417
I don't understand.

403
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:36,298
Are you

404
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,977
still pining for that douhua maker?

405
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:45,778
How could it be?

406
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,017
You're just being stubborn.

407
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:50,657
If you still miss her,

408
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,657
go to see her.

409
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:57,898
She's now married with a child
and living a happy life.

410
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:00,017
I'm just a cripple.

411
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,618
Why would I go to see her?

412
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:04,017
She can get divorced.

413
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,497
If she has you in her heart,

414
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:08,578
what are you worried about?

415
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,298
What are you talking about?

416
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:12,017
Nonsense.

417
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,578
If I really like her,

418
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:21,417
I should let her go,

419
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:24,138
instead of holding onto her.

420
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,058
Besides,

421
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:26,977
she's living a good life.

422
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,058
Why should I interfere

423
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,017
and torment myself?

424
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,417
Do you still remember

425
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,417
what you said to me the night

426
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,737
before we followed Zhao Yin's cargo ship

427
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:42,017
to Xunzhou Prefecture?

428
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:43,578
What was it?

429
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,217
You said

430
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:49,138
you were afraid I'd be sexually harassed
by Zhao Yin on the journey.

431
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,697
Afraid I'd be humiliated by him.

432
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:53,818
Before that,

433
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:55,937
the men I'd met

434
00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:59,017
were all eager to take advantage of me,

435
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:00,937
except for

436
00:26:01,657 --> 00:26:03,058
only two men

437
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:06,098
who didn't want it to happen to me.

438
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:07,977
One was my master,

439
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:10,017
and the other one

440
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:12,497
was you.

441
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:15,017
At that moment,

442
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,657
I decided

443
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:20,098
I wanted

444
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,017
to be friends

445
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:24,257
with you

446
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,378
for life.

447
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:31,417
We wander the world

448
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:34,618
with a sense of fellowship.

449
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:37,578
If you really appreciate my help,

450
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,138
you might as well get me
a pair of decent shoes.

451
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:44,657
Don't take off your shoes

452
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,298
while talking.

453
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:50,338
Shoemakers never consider the crippled.

454
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:53,818
Look, the soles of the shoes are even.

455
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,378
It really hurts to walk.

456
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:59,138
Oh, no. My good mood

457
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,378
was ruined by you.

458
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,298
Go back to where you came from.

459
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:05,098
Fine, I will.

460
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,538
You don't want me to accompany you,

461
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,457
and I don't want to either.

462
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:12,017
Keep drinking. I'm leaving.

463
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:15,578
Leave my wine.

464
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,217
The wine?

465
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,697
Would you like a fart instead?

466
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:20,818
You!

467
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,098
Sir.

468
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:42,818
What's the matter?

469
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:43,858
The kitchen caught fire.

470
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:46,338
Go put it out.

471
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,138
Yes.

472
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,298
Mr. Wu,

473
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:50,818
should we inform Mrs. Wu?

474
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:55,977
Go ahead.

475
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:56,818
Yes.

476
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:10,457
What's the matter?

477
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:12,497
The kitchen's on fire.

478
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:13,657
I came to inform you.

479
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:17,937
Got it. Close the door.

480
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:46,697
Who's there?

481
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:54,417
Mrs. Wu.

482
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:55,898
Who are you?

483
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:57,417
I mean no harm.

484
00:28:58,217 --> 00:29:00,378
I was just commissioned

485
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:02,497
to seek an answer from you.

486
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:04,657
What answer?

487
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:10,378
Do you still remember
the name Lin Rulan?

488
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:12,578
Who on earth are you?

489
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,058
Who I am is not important.

490
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,017
What matters is that you once said,

491
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,138
"The evidence is right in front of us,

492
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:19,737
but everyone turns a blind eye."

493
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,818
What exactly is the evidence?

494
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:27,098
I just want a straight answer from you.

495
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,298
I don't know you.

496
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:37,338
You should leave,

497
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:38,778
or I'll call for help.

498
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:45,657
If you feel guilty,

499
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:49,578
it's better to tell the truth
than to pray.

500
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:51,058
Get out!

501
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:55,378
Sorry.

502
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:08,657
It's right in front of us,

503
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:10,818
yet everyone turns a blind eye.

504
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,818
What could it be?

505
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:16,977
- Put it out!
- Put it out!

506
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:17,898
- It's spreading.
- Hurry!

507
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,017
Water!

508
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:22,657
Sir, the fire is too big.

509
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:24,457
Should we move the valuables first?

510
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,457
Call the Fire Brigade.

511
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:27,538
- Alright.
- Hold on.

512
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:30,177
If the fire can't be put out,

513
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:32,578
move everything out of my study.

514
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:33,417
Okay.

515
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:36,058
The study.

516
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,417
How am I supposed to find the evidence

517
00:31:41,937 --> 00:31:43,497
without even knowing what it is?

518
00:31:49,697 --> 00:31:52,257
Never mind. I better head back today.

519
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:58,378
(Especially those Yanyu Embroideries
made by Wu Lian himself.)

520
00:31:58,737 --> 00:31:59,818
(Steal the biggest)

521
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,017
(and most expensive-looking one,)

522
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:02,657
(and it'll cover you for three years.)

523
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:43,737
Meng Wan,

524
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,937
since you're determined to corner me,

525
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,017
I don't need to wait anymore.

526
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:58,170
(Pray to Silkworm Mother at the door,
worship the God of Wealth inside.)

527
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:03,177
Alas, the path to being an official
is unpredictable.

528
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:05,737
Well, the debts are hard to pay.

529
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:09,778
Isn't this quite fitting
for that little thief?

530
00:34:11,738 --> 00:34:13,017
It's almost 9 p.m.

531
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:15,097
Why isn't Mr. Li back yet?

532
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,057
Don't worry.

533
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:21,178
With his skills,

534
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:22,698
he could at least escape.

535
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:28,977
Did you find anything?

536
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,617
How is it?

537
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,617
Are you hurt?

538
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:42,097
I'm fine,

539
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,617
but I'm afraid
I might disappoint you both.

540
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:46,577
Mrs. Wu is very tight-lipped.

541
00:34:46,738 --> 00:34:47,778
She didn't tell me anything.

542
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:48,818
I even started a fire

543
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:50,738
and ran around blind.

544
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:52,457
I really didn't find any evidence.

545
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:55,617
Thank you

546
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:57,577
for being willing to take such risks.

547
00:34:58,417 --> 00:34:59,378
Not at all.

548
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:01,097
But the Yanyu Tower

549
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:02,818
will certainly tighten security later.

550
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:04,338
Let's take action again

551
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:05,218
after it cools down.

552
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,378
If you still need me,

553
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:07,977
I can make another attempt.

554
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:10,738
Thank you in advance, sir.

555
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:12,698
Thank you, Madame Xu.

556
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:15,258
It's getting late. I'll take my leave.

557
00:35:16,977 --> 00:35:17,778
Wait.

558
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:23,937
You're a thief.

559
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:26,417
Did you get anything

560
00:35:27,218 --> 00:35:28,778
from this trip?

561
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,057
There are

562
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:32,537
only girls' clothes.

563
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:33,977
No treasure there.

564
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:37,617
Bring it out. I saw it.

565
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:40,417
And you lied?

566
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:41,577
As usual, I'll take 30.

567
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:42,457
Give it back.

568
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:43,577
You greedy constable.

569
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:45,137
You've been to prison
and you're crippled,

570
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:46,738
and you still haven't improved?

571
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:47,658
I'll report you,

572
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:49,258
and you'll be back in jail again.

573
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:50,258
Will you shut up?

574
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,057
Hand it over.

575
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:52,417
Give it back to me. It's mine.

576
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:54,338
Wait.

577
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:55,298
What's wrong?

578
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:57,298
Wait.

579
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:01,818
What's this?

580
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,234
(Lin Rulan)

581
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:29,562
(Meng Wan)

582
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:53,057
This is the evidence
Zhang Rong'er mentioned, I guess.

583
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,617
The trophies Wu Lian got.

584
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:00,417
A list of victims.

585
00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:06,698
Each plum blossom on this

586
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:10,378
represents a victim.

587
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:14,778
They are

588
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:16,137
the witnesses.

589
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:19,537
Perhaps they won't testify for us.

590
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:21,658
But as long as we can persuade one,

591
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,178
the situation will change.

592
00:38:26,457 --> 00:38:27,738
Let's take action now.

593
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:28,937
Convince whoever we can.

594
00:38:30,497 --> 00:38:31,417
Wait.

595
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:49,818
We took this plum blossom embroidery.

596
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,858
It's not clear
what Wu Lian will do next.

597
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:55,617
These red fireworks
can be used to signal.

598
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:57,858
When it's lit,
there will be a buzzing sound,

599
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,497
and it will shoot into the sky.

600
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,658
If any of us

601
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:03,178
is trapped in danger,

602
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:04,577
set it off.

603
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,378
No matter what,

604
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:07,977
the rest must rush to the rescue.
