1
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:15,840
(Seven years later)

2
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:22,693
(Tian Xiaoling)

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,520
Some of them died, and some fled.

4
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,640
And the rest shuts their big mouths.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,920
Their mouths seem small, actually.

6
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:45,888
(Tian Xiaoling)

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,679
Mr. Li, you know this woman?

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,719
Did you find any new clues

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,319
on that embroidery?

10
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,456
Mr. Li.

11
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,920
Li Chunfeng, it isn't valuable.

12
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,079
Why do you want it?

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
I brought it back.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,439
So it's mine. How does it concern you?

15
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,280
Stop him!

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,536
Step aside!

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,120
Let go of me.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,239
It's mine.

19
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,400
- Behave! What's wrong with you?
- Give it back to me.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,159
Let me go. Give it back to me.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,760
Mr. Li, would you like to talk to me?

22
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,736
(The path to being an official is
unpredictable as debts are hard to pay.)

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,879
Years ago,

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,280
on the Qiqiao Festival,

25
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,960
that was the last time we met.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
(That day,)

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,599
(I won her a rabbit lantern.)

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,680
(But she asked me to keep it for her.)

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
(I sent her back to the Yanyu Tower.)

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,879
(I watched her enter.)

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,639
Back then, a murder occurred,
and everyone was in panic.

32
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,199
Many girls left Yanyu Tower.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,719
After that night,

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,120
she suddenly disappeared.

35
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,360
(I went to her home,)

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,479
(only to find it empty.)

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,879
(The properties were all sold.)

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,840
(She just vanished overnight.)

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,479
(I kept that rabbit lantern.)

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,400
(I waited and searched for her
for seven years.)

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
(Yet still, no word from her.)

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,420
(Looking at the moon,
I'm standing on the bridge, sighing.)

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,560
I saw her name just now.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
Seeing her name on this embroidery,

45
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,120
I realized what had happened to her
after we parted,

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,639
and why she left without saying a word.

47
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,479
Actually, I knew Ling.

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Did you two meet at the Yanyu Tower?

49
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,520
I remember
her father was a school teacher.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
Maybe that's why

51
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,240
she seemed more brilliant
than the other girls.

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Also, she looked distant.

53
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
She was always alone,

54
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,800
embroidering quietly in a corner.

55
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,800
Do you know where she is now?

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,800
However, there are now seven of us.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,720
Finding her wouldn't be hard.

58
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,560
None of the women
leaving Yanyu Tower years ago

59
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,560
are willing to testify in court.

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Perhaps Tian Xiaoling is our last hope.

61
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,839
Would you consider showing it to them?

62
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:41,312
(Tian Xiaoling)

63
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,704
=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

64
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,320
=Episode 16, Chapter 8, Part 2=
(Break into Qingshui Nunnery at Night)

65
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,680
It's getting hotter

66
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,360
and hotter.

67
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
It makes us sweaty soon.

68
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,759
Check out this silk cloth.

69
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,040
It's light, breathable, and cool.

70
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,800
Once you put it on,

71
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,600
you could walk around

72
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,360
under the hot sun
and still feel refreshed.

73
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,680
Ms. Huang, you're really kind.

74
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll tell you what I know,

75
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,120
but I can't accept such good stuff.

76
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,240
You're deeply trusted in our city.

77
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,319
I know the rules.

78
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Please accept it, but don't trick me.

79
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Alright. I'll accept it then.

80
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,600
You're asking about the Tian family.

81
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,000
The man of the house was a teacher.

82
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,839
The woman of the house ran a teahouse.

83
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,560
Yes, that's it.

84
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,839
Do you know their whereabouts?

85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,480
I don't know.

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,199
Strangely, they disappeared overnight

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,079
and dismissed all of their servants.

88
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,279
I helped those servants

89
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,759
find new jobs back then.

90
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,519
Do you still keep in touch
with any of these servants?

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,519
I remember. Ms. Xing.

92
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,120
Ms. Xing?

93
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,759
Mr. Zhao, the dishes taste fantastic.

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,639
They're better
than the food at restaurants.

95
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,839
Do you have a famous cook?

96
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,800
It's not what you think.

97
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,759
A few old maids

98
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,040
in my house are experienced in cooking.

99
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,199
Their cooking is good.

100
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,079
May I learn from them?

101
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,879
Why are you suddenly interested

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,680
in learning to cook?

103
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,639
If you disagree, I will leave right now.

104
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,879
As you wish.

105
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,959
Are you Ms. Xing?

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Yes, it's me.

107
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm here to ask you about someone.

108
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,480
Was your former employer Mr. Tian
seven years ago?

109
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,960
Who are you?

110
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,639
I am distantly related
to the Tian family.

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,840
I came here to look for them,
but I found no one.

112
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,879
After asking around, I found you.

113
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,720
I hope you can tell me.

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,159
Distant relative?

115
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,879
That was a long time ago.

116
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't ask me. I know nothing.

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
I'll let you go
if you tell me where the Tian family is.

118
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,399
You...

119
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,399
Why did the Tian family hurry
to the capital overnight?

120
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,879
Something must have happened.

121
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,840
(Chenghe Gate)
What on earth do you do?

122
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,159
(Capital)
A low-ranking official.

123
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,320
If so, how can you mobilize officials
in the capital

124
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,799
to find out the Tian family.

125
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,679
People's movement within the capital

126
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,879
will be recorded.
It's not difficult to investigate.

127
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,759
Found it, right here.

128
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,120
Would you like some tea? Please come in.

129
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,639
No, we're here for the shopkeeper.

130
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,240
She is over here.

131
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
If you don't drink tea,

132
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,759
what brings you to our teahouse?

133
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,519
Madame.

134
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,480
Do you have a daughter
named Tian Xiaoling?

135
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,664
(Tian Xiaoling's mother, Yao Wusao)

136
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,360
(Tian Xiaoling's father, Tian Yongzhong)

137
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
You are...

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,759
There was an incident in Yanyu Tower
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,840
We're here
to ask your daughter a few questions.

140
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,159
Hope you'll cooperate.

141
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,039
I'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.

142
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,279
We don't have a daughter.

143
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,960
And we never heard of the Yanyu Tower.

144
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,600
Please, you may go.

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,279
I've already checked your files.

146
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,159
I wonder what you are worried about.

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,519
Who are you?

148
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,159
He...

149
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,240
He is a second-ranking official
of the Imperial Guard Bureau.

150
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,759
If you're sensible,
you can avoid unnecessary suffering.

151
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,720
How dare you scam in the capital.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,120
I know the second-ranking official
of the Imperial Guard Bureau.

153
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,080
He is a regular in my teahouse.

154
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,080
You look new here.

155
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,399
Who bestowed the second-rank title
on you?

156
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,279
You tell her.

157
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Madame, actually I...

158
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
- You liar, are you speechless?
- I...

159
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,639
How dare you swindle in broad daylight.

160
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,639
Don't force me.

161
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,639
If you dare to act, I'll break your leg.

162
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,799
Please go on.

163
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,240
The younger man

164
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,080
seems like an official.

165
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,559
I probably saw him somewhere.

166
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,080
Even so, what do you want to do?

167
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,320
No, nothing.

168
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,360
In my opinion, we can sneak in at night

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,879
search room by room,
tie the girl, and bring her back

170
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,480
to the Huaizhou Prefecture.

171
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,039
This is the capital.

172
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,600
If you do so, I'll arrest you.

173
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
You tell me what to do.

174
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:06,960
Who's it?

175
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,000
Sirs.

176
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,639
What's it?

177
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,159
I am Tian Xiaoling's father.

178
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,279
Oh, it's you.

179
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
Yes.

180
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm sorry for intruding.

181
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,960
I asked someone
to secretly follow you both.

182
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,679
Thus, I know you're here.

183
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,159
Sorry to disturb you.

184
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,440
Now that you're here,

185
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,320
I assume you've got something to say.

186
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
You two saw it in the daytime.

187
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,559
My wife is domineering.

188
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,639
She's reluctant
to mention anything from the past.

189
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,799
She even forbids me
from asking about it.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,240
It has been seven years.

191
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,279
But I still have many questions.

192
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,480
I never let it go.

193
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
When hearing you two came

194
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,120
for the matter of the Yanyu Tower,

195
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,240
I wanted to come
and listen to the whole story.

196
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
Why don't you start first?

197
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,440
What is the past you mentioned?

198
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,159
It dates back to seven years ago.

199
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
Back then, Ling studied embroidery
at the Yanyu Tower.

200
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,320
And she lived there.

201
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,159
At that time,
a woman had a lawsuit with Wu Lian.

202
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,879
Nobody could clearly know
what really happened.

203
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,399
I was worried about Xiaoling's safety.

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
So I wanted to take her home.

205
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
But she was unwilling to do so.

206
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,480
Unexpectedly,
not a long time after that,

207
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,039
(an elderly lady asked us)

208
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,159
(to take her back home,)

209
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,240
(claiming that she was morally flawed)

210
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,879
(and had a love affair
with a man outside.)

211
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,279
Ling...

212
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,080
What happened? She has passed away?

213
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,080
No, she survived.

214
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,600
But when we brought her back,

215
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,559
(she was already delirious.)

216
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,320
Ling, eat something.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,320
(My wife was both angry and distressed,)

218
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,559
(afraid that the word would spread out
and ruin Ling's reputation.)

219
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,840
(So, we decided
to relocate to the capital,)

220
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,879
planning to open a larger teahouse

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and make enough money
to find a good doctor for Ling.

222
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,960
After all these years,
I've never believed

223
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,159
a single word that old lady said.

224
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,480
Ling is my daughter.

225
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,879
I know her

226
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,200
pretty well.

227
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,759
She's not that kind of person.

228
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,320
Something must be wrong.

229
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,600
So, if the two of you

230
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,039
really came for that incident back then,

231
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,759
please find out the truth

232
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,240
and clear my daughter's name, thank you.

233
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,799
There's no need. Please get up.

234
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,879
How about you let us talk

235
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,559
to your daughter tomorrow morning?

236
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,600
However, Ling is not in the capital.

237
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,960
What?

238
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,120
Then where is she?

239
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,000
In these seven years,
she has never left Huaizhou Prefecture.

240
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,679
Qingshui Nunnery?

241
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Yes, it's on the mountain
outside the city.

242
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,559
Since they decided to move,

243
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,320
why did they leave her behind?

244
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,039
According to her father, weirdly,

245
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,399
when they just left the city,

246
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,639
they rested
and prayed at Qingshui Nunnery.

247
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,879
Suddenly, Ling stopped crying.

248
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,960
But she refused to leave.

249
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,919
No matter who tried to persuade her,
she wouldn't leave.

250
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,879
Her parents discussed it

251
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,080
and stayed at Qingshui Nunnery
for a long time.

252
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,639
In the end, they allowed her to stay.

253
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,080
So for these seven years,
she has been in this nunnery.

254
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,960
Yes, her father
has secretly visited her a few times.

255
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,159
However, this nunnery
does not receive male visitors.

256
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,920
So now, he only knows
her religious name, Jueming.

257
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,759
Mr. Li, don't act rashly.

258
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,559
If Ling was harmed by Wu Lian
and lost her mind,

259
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,759
Ms. Chen must have known

260
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,680
about her relationship with me,

261
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,400
so she used it and framed me.

262
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,920
Shen Mu and I have the same speculation.

263
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,200
We just don't know why Ling's mother

264
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,880
could easily believe the nonsense.

265
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,319
She's not a fool since she
runs a tea house in the capital.

266
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,279
Perhaps her mother doesn't believe.

267
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,200
She just accepted the fate

268
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,519
and didn't want to find the truth.

269
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Since we know
Tian Xiaoling's whereabouts,

270
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,279
let's meet her as soon as possible.

271
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,839
I'm going to look for her.

272
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,200
Mr. Li.

273
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,079
The Qingshui Nunnery is a sacred place.

274
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,559
Men can't enter at will.

275
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,680
Could I go first?

276
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,000
You've been waiting for seven years.

277
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,240
Does it matter
if you wait half a day more?

278
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,039
I will do my best
to bring back good news.

279
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,640
Alright, you go.
I'll wait for your news.

280
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,000
We made such a fuss at the Yanyu Tower,

281
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,480
and even tailored
Wu Lian's Falling Blossom Embroidery.

282
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,799
Please keep an eye on him.

283
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,839
I'm afraid
he's up to something in secret.

284
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,759
Don't worry. I'll watch him.

285
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,039
Master, I am here to find someone.

286
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,559
Greetings. Who are you looking for?

287
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,839
Her secular name is Tian Xiaoling,
and her dharma name is Jueming.

288
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,984
(Juexin, a disciple of Qingshui Nunnery)

289
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,559
What's wrong?

290
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,400
Since Jueming stayed here,
she hasn't met strangers.

291
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,119
Please follow me.

292
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,640
People study Buddhism

293
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,680
mostly to seek a way of liberation.

294
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,680
I wonder what you've been seeking

295
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,640
after many years of self-cultivation.

296
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
If there really is a way to liberation,

297
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,839
I don't want to be liberated yet.

298
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,799
After all, I can't forget
too much stuff.

299
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,640
There's also a person I can't forget.

300
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,640
She has been dead
for many years, named Rulan.

301
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,599
Do you still remember her?

302
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,799
Perhaps many people
have forgotten about her,

303
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,599
but I dare not forget her for a moment.

304
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,519
Rulan always thought
that we first met at the Yanyu Tower,

305
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,400
but that's not the case.

306
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
That was eight years ago.

307
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,759
One day my father got drunk
and severely injured my mother.

308
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,759
(Lin's Pharmacy)
(But he refused to buy her medicine.)

309
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,240
(I had a few copper coins,
but they were not enough.)

310
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,200
(I couldn't afford one herb.)

311
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,440
(That pharmacy clerk didn't allow me
to buy it on credit.)

312
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,200
(So I left.)

313
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,599
(When stepping out of the pharmacy,)

314
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,160
(I heard a young lady calling me.)

315
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,400
Wait a moment.

316
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,640
(It was Rulan. She stole herbs
from her own pharmacy for me.)

317
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,920
(Later, when I met her again
at the Yanyu Tower,)

318
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,000
(she had forgotten about that.)

319
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,920
Rulan, do you remember the day
we first met?

320
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Of course I do.
Wasn't it just when we started school?

321
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,440
And I gave you a chestnut cake.

322
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
(Many years later,
I married into the Xu family.)

323
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,440
(Seven years later,
I finally became Madame Xu.)

324
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,240
(Peaceful)
(I had a chance meeting Mrs. Ning.)

325
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,079
(I started implementing my plan.)

326
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,839
(Actually, I once hesitated.)

327
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,920
(After all, I have a decent
and gentle husband.)

328
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,440
My life was heading for happiness.

329
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
Should I really implement the plan

330
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
I have been sticking to?

331
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:45,960
I made up my mind

332
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,119
when I decided to visit Mrs. Ning.

333
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,480
(I thought about it
all night until dawn.)

334
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,319
(Finally, I remembered one thing.)

335
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,319
(Turns out
that the day I first met Rulan,)

336
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,359
(the medicine she secretly stuffed
into my hands was called privet.)

337
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,440
(Everything I do now is)

338
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,960
(to return her favor.)

339
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,310
(Invitation Letter)

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,039
But I'm not talking

341
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
about her chastity.

342
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,880
I'm helping her shake the stigma

343
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
of being insulted
and mocked by Wu Lian, the Yamen,

344
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
and people across the Huaizhou.

345
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,519
Ling, I know there are some people

346
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,680
and things you can't give up, right?

347
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,359
Alright, since you don't answer,

348
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,039
I will continue.

349
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,160
You and I studied embroidery
at the Yanyu Tower.

350
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,359
You probably have forgotten about me,

351
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,359
but I have always remembered you.

352
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,559
(Back then, Rulan's case
caused a big stir.)

353
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,720
(People often gossip about her.)

354
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,920
(But you stayed out of it.)

355
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,559
You never thought

356
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,279
that you would be the next her, did you?

357
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,799
Actually, what you experienced before
was not an accident.

358
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,200
Apart from Rulan, you and me,

359
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,359
(Yanyu Tower)
(many other innocent women)

360
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,960
(have shed tears,
lost souls, and even lives)

361
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,839
(in the Yanyu Tower.)

362
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,559
(Seven years have passed.)

363
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,519
(Some have passed away,
and some are nowhere to be found.)

364
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,200
(Some people move on from the past.)

365
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,200
But no matter where we are now,

366
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,519
whether we were married
or became a believer,

367
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,240
we should seek justice for ourselves.

368
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,480
After all, Wu Lian has never stopped.

369
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,799
Not only in the past,
but also in the present.

370
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,839
Each year, there are still many girls

371
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,920
stepping into the Yanyu Tower.

372
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,960
(They are humiliated)

373
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,720
(and played like a toy.)

374
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,279
If we continue to be silent,

375
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,079
allowing the evil to escape the law,

376
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,599
allowing girls
to have their lives ruined,

377
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,680
have we become accomplices?

378
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,279
I know you've been silent

379
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,680
because you lack the confidence
to confront Wu Lian.

380
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,160
You think
many things are impossible to do alone.

381
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,079
But since I've come here to find you,

382
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
I have a nine out of ten chance
of success.

383
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,599
(But nothing is forgotten.)
(I have never forgotten the hatred.)

384
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,319
(I can't even sleep well at night.)

385
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,039
(It took me seven years of planning)

386
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920
(to reach today's situation.)

387
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,000
(Ignite a candle light.)
(I found Captain Liu Xin,)

388
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,680
(who was crippled by Wu Lian
and falsely accused)

389
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
(and imprisoned for seven years.)

390
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,400
(I found Liu Sannv,
who escaped from Wu Lian's control.)

391
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,319
(A leaf in the vast ocean.)
(But she ended up being a courtesan.)

392
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,880
(Even her most cherished person
suffered persecution by Wu Lian.)

393
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,720
(I also found Shen Mu,
a government official in the capital.)

394
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,599
(The young man returns in time.)
(Like me, he hasn't forgotten the past,)

395
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,160
(always seeking for justice.)

396
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,480
(The wilderness also has emotions.)

397
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,519
(And Feng Da, the head
of the Huashi Convoy.)

398
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,759
(Pray to Silkworm Mother.)
(Huang Jiaojiao, the owner of Huangji.)

399
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,319
(Debts are hard to pay.)
(And one more person, your old friend,)

400
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
(Li Chunfeng.)

401
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,839
All of us have had grudges with Wu Lian

402
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:24,039
and the Yanyu Tower.

403
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
All of us have only one goal,

404
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,200
and that is to destroy Yanyu Tower

405
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,440
and make Wu Lian repent

406
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,480
for his sins.

407
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,799
I know this sounds so difficult,

408
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,279
but I'm about to make it.

409
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,599
Wu Lian has lost his support
from Mrs. Ning,

410
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,440
and even lost a ready source of money.

411
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,039
But we need new witnesses.

412
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,799
I'm a witness, but it's far from enough.

413
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,880
So, Ling, are you willing to join me,

414
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,519
confront Wu Lian in court,

415
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,440
and send him to jail?

416
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,960
Miss, Tian Xiaoling has died.
I'm Jueming.

417
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,839
You've mistaken me for someone else.

418
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,440
(Master Huichen, head of Qingshui Nunnery)
Amitabha.

419
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,759
And you are?

420
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,079
I'm Master Huichen,
the head of Qingshui Nunnery. Greetings.

421
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,200
I heard that you are here
to invite Jueming down the mountain.

422
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,440
Yes, I didn't think I could do it.

423
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,960
As expected, Jueming refused me.

424
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,559
If so,

425
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,440
why did you insist on coming?

426
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,920
I have to come.

427
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,640
And I will come back tomorrow.

428
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,720
Ever since Jueming joined the nunnery,

429
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,440
every morning, she would stand
outside my door holding a razor,

430
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,720
asking me
to shave her head to become a nun.

431
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,319
She was rejected every day,
but she still came.

432
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,119
In this regard, she is similar to you.

433
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,920
Why did you refuse her?

434
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,920
She still has attachments in her heart.

435
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,839
What's the difference
even if I shave her head?

436
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,359
You know all about her ordeal.

437
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,960
When Jueming just came,

438
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,119
(Sutra)

439
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:46,359
(she often woke up
from her dreams, screaming loudly.)

440
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,559
(I never asked,
and she never told me anything.)

441
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,960
Until one night, she wrote me a letter,

442
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,440
telling me about her past.

443
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,759
After I read it, I burned the letter.

444
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,759
Now that you know the whole story,

445
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,319
I wonder if you can help persuade her.

446
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,000
As long as she can leave with me,

447
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,480
the wrongs and hardships
of the past could end,

448
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
and there will be a chance
to seek justice.

449
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,000
Have you ever thought about it?

450
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,759
Is your relentless pursuit appropriate?

451
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,599
Punishing the evil
is a matter of course.

452
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,640
I don't see what's wrong with that.

453
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,519
Firstly, you ask yourself.

454
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,000
In all your actions so far,

455
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,920
is it more out of righteousness,

456
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,400
or is it more out of self-interest?

457
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,799
I don't dare to lie.
Indeed, it's more out of self-interest.

458
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,200
Secondly,

459
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,319
you think you're fearless,

460
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,839
but you don't understand the fear
of others.

461
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,160
Those suffering women might not hope
to bring up old matters.

462
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,799
It will make them suffer again.

463
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,240
If not handled well,
it could put them back in trouble.

464
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,240
Did you think of it all?

465
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,799
Can you tell me what to do?

466
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,480
Not everything can be fixed.

467
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,680
If you seek solutions,
just remember one thing.

468
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,680
If you hurt others for justice,

469
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,519
there is no justice to speak of.

470
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,359
I didn't mean to disturb you.

471
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,039
Today I failed to persuade Jueming.

472
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,960
If a man breaks in at night,

473
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,599
I hope you can be understanding.

474
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,680
Thank you for the reminder.
I will prepare for that.

475
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,559
Master, it is a place for cultivation.

476
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,400
If a man breaks in at night...

477
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,599
If her heart is peaceful,
why fear a man?

478
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
If she has attachments,

479
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,559
even if she stays for seven more years,

480
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,720
it can't stop the thought
of the worldly stuff.

481
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,759
All dharmas arise
from karma and cease with it.

482
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,039

00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,159
Tian Xiaoling, you broke your promise.

498
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,719
I've been keeping this lantern
for you for seven years.

499
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,320
When are you going to take it back?

500
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,079
Speak!

501
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
Are you taking it back?

502
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,280
If you don't, I'll throw it away.

503
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,984
Ling.

504
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,760
Tian Xiaoling.

505
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,000
Ling. You tell me

506
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:58,039
who on earth lost whom?

507
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,679
Did you lose me?

508
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,079
Or did I lose you?

509
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,800
I haven't move over these years.

510
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,960
My house is dilapidated.

511
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,719
I've been suffering every single day.

512
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,519
I'm afraid you can't find me
when you come back.

513
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,719
I've been looking for you everywhere.

514
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,000
I even broke into people's houses.

515
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,639
Once I was trapped in a cellar,

516
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,360
almost starved to death.

517
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,679
Since you left,

518
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,679
I have never read the book you gave me.

519
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,039
And I have never worn the clothes
you gave me.

520
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,159
I'm afraid of damaging them.

521
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,760
Ling.

522
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,599
Do you really want to give up our past?

523
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,199
On that Qiqiao Festival,

524
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,159
you asked me for the answer
to a riddle, but I didn't tell you.

525
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,000
The answer was butterfly.

526
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,239
Back then, I thought

527
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,000
of a pair of happy butterflies.

528
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,800
But it turns out

529
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,760
to be a single sad butterfly.

530
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,639
Ling, it's okay
if you don't want to see me.

531
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,480
I'll be waiting for you.

532
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:34,079
I'm not a wealthy man.

533
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,639
But if you're willing to leave here,

534
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,199
I promise I won't leave you.

535
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:18,857
(Weituo Hall)

536
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,440
Madame, we have a visitor.

537
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,559
It's Mr. Wu from the Yanyu Tower.

538
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,960
You may go.

539
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,719
Yes.

540
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,519
I hear Mr. Wu is here.

541
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,000
Master.

542
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,159
Madame Xu is back.

543
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,639
There are new Yanyu Embroidery samples.

544
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,559
Mr. Wu personally
brought them over for you.

545
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,559
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

546
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,960
My pleasure. It's just a return gift.

547
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,119
After all, you have sent me a gift.

548
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,159
I surely reciprocate.

549
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,840
Mr. Wu, you are too thoughtful.

550
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,559
Yanyu Embroidery is truly exquisite.

551
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,840
Only Mr. Wu,
who maintains a pure lifestyle

552
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,639
and has high moral conduct,
can produce such work.

553
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,440
Why are you acting
that you see it for the first time?

554
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,239
Seven years ago,

555
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,960
I carefully taught you how to embroider.

556
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,239
Mr. Wu, what do you mean?

557
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,320
Are you unaware of that?

558
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,880
Madame Xu's real name is Meng Wan.

559
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,480
She once studied embroidery
at the Yanyu Tower.

560
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,320
Master, it's okay. Others can be fooled,

561
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,880
but Mr. Wu can't be.

562
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,000
After all, you and I met
at the Yanyu Tower.

563
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,480
Speaking of which,
Mr. Wu was kind of our matchmaker.

564
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,320
Yes, Mr. Wu.

565
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,199
Back then, when I visited your place,

566
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,800
I met Wan, and she married me later.

567
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:56,760
Now, she became the main wife
from a concubine.

568
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,199
I'm afraid
it might damage Wan's reputation.

569
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,480
So I asked her to claim
to be from the Gu family.

570
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,960
Mr. Wu, sorry about that.

571
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,679
Yes, Mr. Wu.

572
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,079
Master knew my background long ago.

573
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,920
I've told him about my past.

574
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,880
There is something
I haven't told him yet.

575
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,239
But I believe he wouldn't mind.

576
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:28,840
After all, he is a very generous man.

577
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,519
He wouldn't care too much about it.

578
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,719
I'm so lucky to have a kind

579
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,800
and loving husband in my life.

580
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,840
Mr. Wu.

581
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,719
You and your wife have been
in deep love for many years.

582
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,360
You must understand me.

583
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:06,760
It's getting late. I'll take my leave.

584
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,679
See you, Mr. Wu.

585
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,920
Master, I'll send him out.

586
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,519
See you.

587
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,440
Very impressive.

588
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,360
The once-humble girl

589
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,800
really has some moves.

590
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,679
You turned Huaizhou Prefecture
upside down.

591
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,719
And you also know
how to please your husband.

592
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,400
By the way,
the Falling Blossom Embroidery,

593
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,039
you sent someone to tailor it, right?

594
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,599
Yes, but so what?

595
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,119
There's one more interesting thing.

596
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,000
Maybe you have not heard of it yet.

597
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,480
What is it?

598
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,239
The lady of the Zheng family
learned embroidery in the Yanyu Tower.

599
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,840
Now she is married
and has a happy family.

600
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,159
But she poisoned herself this afternoon.

601
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,039
She was saved,
but she hasn't regained consciousness.

602
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,400
I hear a few days ago,
someone came to bother her,

603
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:42,719
pushing her to be a witness.

604
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,760
Afterward, she fell ill.

605
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,159
If she's dead because of you,

606
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,119
will you feel remorse?

607
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,679
Mr. Wu.

608
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,760
You're here today to threaten me.

609
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,880
Isn't it because you are afraid
that your scandals will be exposed?

610
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,519
What scandals?

611
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,719
Why not tell me all about them?

612
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,679
You seduced innocent embroideresses
with your power.

613
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,559
Isn't that one of them?

614
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,039
You colluded with the Supervisor
of the Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau,

615
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,519
smuggling embroidery products
and evading tax. That's one of them.

616
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,079
I still remember
Wang Liulang's disgusting face,

617
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,239
just as sickening as yours.

618
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,840
You bribed a lawyer
and framed innocent people.

619
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,639
I saw it with my own eyes.

620
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,920
Can you get away with this?

621
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:09,639
I've seen people like you.

622
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,400
Once you get some money,
you become arrogant.

623
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:17,840
Once you have some power,
you ignore the law

624
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:20,159
and harm innocent people.

625
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,039
Wu Lian,

626
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,719
today should be your day of doom.

627
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,000
We don't kill you today,
not because we can't.

628
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,760
We need you to pay a fitting price

629
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,440
for the evil things you've done.

630
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,239
That day won't be too far away.

631
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,599
Nice try.

632
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,559
Meng Wan, do you think
that I lose the support of Mrs. Ning,

633
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,599
so you can do as you please?

634
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,280
You won't have to wait too long.

635
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,440
Within three days, I will let you see

636
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,320
how I rise steadily

637
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,840
and how the Yanyu Tower rises
to the next level.

638
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,000
Why have you all come today?

639
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,920
You asked me to keep an eye on Wu Lian.

640
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,320
I saw him visiting your house today
and was worried.

641
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,559
So I talked it over with the others

642
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,280
and snuck in at night.

643
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,119
Thanks to you all.

644
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:17,119
Why do you look so worried?

645
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,639
Are you worried that he will use tricks?

646
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,239
No, I'm worried

647
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,199
about Mrs. Zheng.

648
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,079
Who's she?

649
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,320
Lancui, if there's something

650
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,119
you think is absolutely right,

651
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:47,199
but it might hurt innocent people.
Would you continue to do it?

652
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,920
I don't understand what you're saying.

653
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,079
But I remember something
from when I was little.

654
00:52:58,719 --> 00:52:59,679
What is it?

655
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,280
My father was bitten by a snake.

656
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,800
My mother urged the doctor
to look for the herbs at night.

657
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,480
Unexpectedly, the doctor
fell off the cliff and died.

658
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,400
After that,
my mother always felt guilty.

659
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,159
She got sick for many years.

660
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,119
Should my mother be to blame?

661
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,519
She shouldn't be, but not quite.

662
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,880
It's getting late. You may go back.

663
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:40,519
Yes.
