1
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:12,439
(Huashi Convoy)

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,800
The distance from Huaizhou to Xiangyang

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,679
is just about three to four hundred li.

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,320
(Seven years later)
More than half of the Kunshan crabs died.

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,920
Now Mr. Hu wants compensation.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,800
You all have to give me an explanation.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,839
Manager,

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,879
you should talk to Feng,
the convoy leader.

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, Manager.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,839
We didn't set the convoy route.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,560
Right, where is Feng Da?

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
Feng Da, get out.

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,039
On my way!

14
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:46,163
(Convoy)

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,119
Manager, I was wrong.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,759
Is that enough?

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,159
Do you know how much a Kunshan crab is?

18
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,679
One hundred.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,719
How did you guys do your business?

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,840
I boiled them.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,120
I only ate eight.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,640
You stole and ate them?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,519
That's not "steal".

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,040
No, no, calm down.

25
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,400
I won't eat next time.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,719
They don't have much meat.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
Feng Da.

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,319
You've offended
all the clients of the convoy.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,799
Now, get out of here!

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,120
(Huashi Convoy)
Go back to Heifeng Camp,

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,319
and be your bandit.

32
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,359
Don't even think about
getting a cent of your salary.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,519
No way, Manager.

34
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,920
If you don't pay me my salary,

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,159
I'll beat you.

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,200
Manager.

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,599
Manager,

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,799
we have a client.

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,319
The person specifically
appointed Feng to escort the goods.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,799
Madam, are you looking for me?

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,560
Feng Da,
Heifeng Camp's second in command.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,439
Have we met before?

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,639
I heard that years ago,

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,280
Heifeng Camp robbed a government convoy,

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,000
and thus infuriated the government
and was taken down.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,280
The followers dispersed
when the leader fell.

47
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,919
I didn't expect the second in command

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,360
to join an escort agency.

49
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,479
It's all old news.

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,639
Let bygones be bygones.

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,680
Madam, do you want to
escort goods or people?

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,159
People.

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,080
Who are they?

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
From where to where?

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,199
This person can't be picked up.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
I would like you to grab.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Kidnap the bride?

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,639
Seven years ago,

59
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,159
you made a promise to a young girl.

60
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,800
Do you still remember?

61
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:24,584
=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

62
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:28,754
=Episode 10, Chapter 5, Part 2=
(Feng Cleverly Presents His Grievance)

63
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,307
Master, be careful. An ambush!

64
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,067
Quickly lower the curtain!

65
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,627
They're after you?

66
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:02,786
Possibly.

67
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:03,947
Go.

68
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,427
We were scared all the way,

69
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:23,547
but we still couldn't escape.

70
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,507
Don't be afraid.

71
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,187
People in the sedan, come out!

72
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,747
Hand over anything valuable now.

73
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,427
If we have to search,

74
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,187
it won't be nice.

75
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:44,706
Asking for money.

76
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:46,547
No matter what happens,

77
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,987
don't come out.

78
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:50,906
Okay.

79
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,187
Be careful.

80
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,187
By your skills and looks,

81
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:10,346
you don't seem to be bandits.

82
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,466
Stop the nonsense.

83
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,627
Hand over all your possessions now.

84
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,547
Or I'll kill you.

85
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,507
Since you want to kill me,
then go ahead.

86
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,346
You're truly not afraid of death.

87
00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:23,826
On the day I set out,

88
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,346
I had already paid respects
to my parents and ancestors,

89
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:29,747
and arranged my affairs,
so naturally, I'm not afraid.

90
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:35,187
Then I won't stop.

91
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:36,386
Go ahead.

92
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:37,586
I'm going to kill you.

93
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:38,627
There you go.

94
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,466
The sword is at your neck.

95
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:44,067
You bandits, spare his life.

96
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:48,146
You bandits, spare his life.

97
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,867
Who is there? Tell us your name.

98
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:57,386
Double Hammer Feng from Huashi Convoy.

99
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,706
Oh, it's Feng.

100
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,226
I've long heard of your name.

101
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:04,346
Today, I'll respect you.

102
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:05,826
Brothers, retreat.

103
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,507
Heroes, take your time.

104
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,146
Give back my men.

105
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,266
Sir, are you injured?

106
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:18,987
You're an escort.

107
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,947
Righteousness comes first
when escorting.

108
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:24,667
Seeing injustice on the road
and lending a hand

109
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,226
is also a common thing.

110
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,947
They are your accomplices, aren't they?

111
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:30,987
What a coincidence.

112
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:32,987
I'm also going to the capital.

113
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:34,627
The capital?

114
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:36,667
What do you mean?

115
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,026
W-What I mean is

116
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:40,187
I can accompany
the two of you on the journey.

117
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:41,747
How about I escort you
into the capital?

118
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,906
What exactly are you?

119
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:46,547
Who instructed you

120
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:49,146
to put on the show?

121
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,187
You've seen it through.

122
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:53,786
It's hard not to.

123
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,786
I knew it. I shouldn't have adopted
those women's ideas.

124
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,346
It's worse than using my hammers.

125
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:00,346
Women?

126
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,507
What do you mean?

127
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:04,947
Sorry.

128
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,506
Is anyone there?

129
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,147
Who's outside?

130
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:37,866
Mr. Lou, you're awake.

131
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:39,826
I am the escort Feng Da.

132
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,706
You did know my identity.

133
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,826
The leader of the Department of Juices
of the Eastern District of Huainan,

134
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:46,866
Lou Mingzhang.

135
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,866
It is "Department of Justice."

136
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,147
(Department of Justice, Lou Mingzhang)
About the same.

137
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:52,067
Anyway, I know you're an official

138
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,826
much more powerful than Prefect Chen.

139
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,907
You're now on an incognito visit,

140
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:58,506
warning various officials,

141
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:02,067
and investigating collusion
between officials and businessmen.

142
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,226
Am I right?

143
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:05,586
I've been cautious all the way,

144
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:07,947
(Mrs. Lou)
but I still fell into your hands.

145
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:11,907
Tell me, who instructed you?

146
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,746
The civilians of Huaizhou Prefecture.

147
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,466
The civilians?

148
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,147
What do you mean?

149
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,187
There's a vicious dog
in Huaizhou Prefecture now,

150
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:20,947
dominating the area.

151
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,067
You are the one to deal with the dog.

152
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,547
All this fuss

153
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:29,746
is to get me to Huaizhou Prefecture
to investigate it and arrest him?

154
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,346
Executing justice is your duty.

155
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:34,907
Are you refusing me?

156
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,106
You're not a corrupt official, are you?

157
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:43,626
Do you think I look like one?

158
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,826
That's good then.

159
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,226
The mad dog you mentioned.

160
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:51,226
Who is he?

161
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,067
You'll know when you get there.

162
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:01,106
(Huaizhou)

163
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:05,067
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)

164
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,147
There's really nothing serious.

165
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:11,907
Just a group of petty thieves
sneaked into the city,

166
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,826
robbed a cargo ship, and then...

167
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:16,226
They were messing around.

168
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:20,267
Is this ship
from the Foreign Trade Bureau?

169
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:23,746
Well...

170
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:30,547
Well, it's not necessarily not.

171
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:34,866
Is there smuggled tribute on the ship?

172
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:43,866
I-I'm thinking there could be. Possibly.

173
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:47,307
Mr. Lou, how about we
go to Zuixian Restaurant first

174
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,427
and throw a welcome party?

175
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,626
Welcome what?

176
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:51,267
Don't play tricks.

177
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,506
Prefect Chen,

178
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:57,667
after all, you are
an official of Huaizhou Prefecture.

179
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:01,387
Do you have to wait
until you're kneeling in your own yamen

180
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,466
before you're willing to tell the truth?

181
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,187
Mr. Lou,

182
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:12,387
I really can't help it.

183
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,226
Alright, hand over your office seal.

184
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,387
You're suspended for investigation.

185
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:22,626
Feng Da, go to the pier.

186
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:26,547
I'll personally welcome
these two gentlemen ashore.

187
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:27,947
Let's go.

188
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:47,787
How's it going?

189
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,506
Madam, still no movement on the ship.

190
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:52,147
Keep watching.

191
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,106
Yes.

192
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,787
Madam, your tea is getting cold.

193
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:05,787
Madame Xu,

194
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,466
you are always resourceful.

195
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:13,387
What do you think I should do now?

196
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,787
This big ship is stopped
in the middle of the river,

197
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:17,986
easy to defend and hard to attack.

198
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,067
Unless...

199
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:21,547
Unless what?

200
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,067
Bring another bigger ship.

201
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:28,346
Then the soldiers from the yamen
can board and rescue Mr. Wu.

202
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:30,267
A bigger ship?

203
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,626
What solution is this?

204
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:35,187
Where am I supposed to find
a bigger ship out of the blue?

205
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:36,586
Madam.

206
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:39,826
Why are you back again?

207
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:41,027
Madam,

208
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,667
the yamen just sent a letter.

209
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,427
Prefect Chen
has been suspended for investigation.

210
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,787
What? Who suspended him?

211
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,387
It's said to be a high-ranking official.

212
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:49,667
Who is he?

213
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,187
The judge of
the Eastern District of Huainan.

214
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,187
Invite him to the mansion immediately.

215
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:56,746
You can't let him
go to the wharf no matter what.

216
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,706
Madam, this official has already gone.

217
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,267
And as soon as he got to the shore,

218
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,626
the ship docked.

219
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:04,226
By now, Mr. Wu should have been
taken to the court already.

220
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:08,346
Go keep an eye on it now.

221
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:09,826
Yes.

222
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,466
Why are you so anxious, Madam?

223
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,307
The case of Wu Lian and Zhao Yin

224
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,307
could still be settled
within Huaizhou Prefecture,

225
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,427
and could be resolved privately.

226
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,187
Now,

227
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,226
a judge of
Eastern District of Huainan popped up.

228
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,187
We're doomed.

229
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:39,626
Who is he?

230
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:42,586
You don't know?

231
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:45,626
He is in charge of
the Eastern District of Huainan.

232
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,106
And he is responsible for
supervising and inspecting.

233
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:49,667
He is famous

234
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,307
for being impartial.

235
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,147
These years,

236
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:56,067
he often moves around in the capital,

237
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,986
deeply trusted by the imperial family.

238
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,866
Given the imperial edict,

239
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:02,667
he can make incognito visits.

240
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,787
He was supposed to return to the capital
to report on his duties.

241
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,346
I really don't understand

242
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:10,027
why he would stop by
our Huaizhou Prefecture.

243
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,387
Are you and the judge

244
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,187
old acquaintances?

245
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,586
I've only met him once.

246
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:18,427
But many years ago,

247
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:21,427
his wife was interested in
the Yanyu Embroidery,

248
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,147
and even made a special trip to order.

249
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:24,907
Unfortunately, at that time,

250
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:26,586
I didn't let Wu Lian sell it to her.

251
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,866
I really don't know if she

252
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,226
took it to her heart.

253
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,346
But why does everything seem

254
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:40,346
to have come together?
What a coincidence.

255
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:42,947
Could there really be someone

256
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,427
trying to put Wu Lian
in a deadly situation?

257
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:51,067
Madam, why do you say this?

258
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:52,907
Because previously,

259
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,106
that lame fortune teller

260
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:58,826
might have colluded with my maid

261
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:00,746
to deceive me.

262
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:03,746
Actually, you reminded me back then,

263
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,427
but I didn't listen.

264
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,466
I should have listened to your advice.

265
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,787
What do you think I should do?

266
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:14,826
I apologize for my arrogation again.

267
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:17,506
What do you think?

268
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,586
Regardless of the truth of the past,

269
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,866
you should focus on
the current predicament.

270
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:25,826
Perhaps now

271
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:29,387
is the best time for you to let go.

272
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,466
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)
Bring them in.

273
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,027
(Bring Peace to the People)
Wu Lian.

274

You rat!

275
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:44,626
You framed me. I will kill you.

276
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,427
Wu Lian!

277
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,947
Zhao Yin, the Supervisor of
Minzhou's Foreign Trade Bureau.

278
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,226
Wu Lian from Yanyu Tower.

279
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:57,826
Do you two know your crimes?

280
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:01,706
I don't know if the other one is guilty,

281
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,626
but what crime have I committed?

282
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,346
Who are you?

283
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:07,986
Lou Mingzhang.

284
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,226
Have you heard of it?

285
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:15,307
Mr. Lou, how come
you are in Huaizhou Prefecture?

286
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,346
Huaizhou Prefecture
is under my jurisdiction.

287
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:18,626
Can't I come?

288
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:20,466
Yes, you can.

289
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,626
Mr. Lou, I want to report.

290
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:23,866
I want to report Wu Lian.

291
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,147
The women in the Yanyu Tower

292
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:26,387
were all violated by him.

293
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:27,346
It wasn't me.

294
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:29,106
Please investigate.

295
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:30,826
Wu Lian,

296
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,387
is it true?

297
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:35,187
Mr. Lou,

298
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,067
this is just an old false accusation.

299
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:39,787
It was withdrawn seven years ago.

300
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:41,346
I was innocent.

301
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:45,427
Zhao Yin must have been misled
and fooled by others.

302
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:48,626
Panic-stricken,
he is making wild accusations.

303
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:50,067
(The Passing of the Finest Judgment)
Wu Lian, you rat!

304
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,626
You framed me

305
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,706
to save your own life.

306
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,826
Despicable, you sly fox.

307
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,346
Wu Lian, you rat!

308
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,547
Bring up the evidence.

309
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:20,746
Wu Lian,

310
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,427
do you recognize the things in this box?

311
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:25,667
I do.

312
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:29,667
Some of these embroidery samples
are made by me,

313
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:32,986
and some are made by
the embroideresses in the tower.

314
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:36,546
So are you admitting

315
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,266
that you privately
embroidered royal tributes,

316
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,506
gave them to Zhao Yin,

317
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:45,827
and profited from
smuggling them by sea, right?

318
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,427
Mr. Lou, you are mistaken.

319
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:49,986
First,

320
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:53,427
my relationship with Zhao Yin
is merely a common business one.

321
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:56,347
After I sold my embroideries to him,

322
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:59,387
whether he chose to smuggle, gift,

323
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,587
or even burn them on the spot,

324
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,187
it had nothing to do with me.

325
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,187
You.

326
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:06,705
Zhao Yin.

327
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:10,266
Do you have anything
you're in a hurry to say?

328
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,866
I'm not in a hurry. You go first.

329
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:17,625
Second,

330
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,985
Mr. Lou, how can you be sure

331
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,705
that these embroideries
are royal tributes?

332
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:25,665
Whether you participated in smuggling,

333
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,905
we will know if we examine

334
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,945
the accounts of your Yanyu Tower.

335
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,145
For every penny you've earned,

336
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,145
you better give me a reasonable list.

337
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,786
And the embroideries in the boxes

338
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,625
are identical to the embroideries
you contributed to the imperial palace

339
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:45,425
two years ago.

340
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,026
Not only they are
decorated with dragons, but also...

341
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:49,945
Mr. Lou, you are mistaken again.

342
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,705
Everything of the nobles in the palace,

343
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,826
based on their status,
is all abided by strict regulations.

344
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:59,625
Missing a scale on a dragon or
a feather on a phoenix is disrespectful.

345
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,145
While having one more
is a serious crime.

346
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,225
For so many years,

347
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,026
Yanyu Tower has contributed
to the royals,

348
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,145
and there has never been any mistake.

349
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,266
Mr. Lou, please look carefully.

350
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:19,425
This auspicious beast
has a short body, a long tail,

351
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:20,866
four whiskers, single sideburn,

352
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:22,625
and even has no eyeballs.

353
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:25,425
It looks like a flying dragon,
but it's actually a Qilin.

354
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,385
In all aspects,

355
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:28,985
it doesn't meet the criteria
of royal tributes,

356
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,145
nor does it exceed
any etiquette regulations.

357
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:35,506
I am honest and upright.

358
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,945
Mr. Lou, please don't falsely accuse me.

359
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:41,346
Well played, Wu Lian.

360
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,425
It seems that
before you entered this game,

361
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:47,145
you planned to withdraw

362
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:49,026
and prepared early on

363
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:52,786
how to deal with today's situation.

364
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:54,346
Mr. Lou, I am flattered.

365
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:56,266
Since my Yanyu Tower

366
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:58,905
is in the embroidery business,

367
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,905
naturally I know better
than anyone else.

368
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,705
What can be embroidered and what can't.

369
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,665
Artisans earn their living

370
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,705
by being careful and prudent.

371
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:12,185
You've completely cleared yourself?

372
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:15,665
There were never any wrongdoings,

373
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:17,506
so why would I clear myself?

374
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,385
You.

375
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:19,625
Zhao Yin,

376
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,905
I advise you not to falsely accuse me.

377
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:23,625
Confess now,

378
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,026
and seek a lenient punishment.

379
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,225
Wu Lian, you rat.

380
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,200
You are so unfaithful and unrighteous.

381
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,346
- That's no truth.
- Zhao Yin.

382
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:34,586
It seems that

383
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:38,185
Mr. Wu is indeed innocent.

384
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,026
And you, Zhao Yin,

385
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:42,985
as the Supervisor
of the Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau,

386
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,266
used your power for personal gain
and engaged in smuggling.

387
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:50,665
The amount of smuggled embroidery
is so large as well.

388
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:54,306
I don't think you can wait until autumn.

389
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,586
Mr. Lou, Mr. Lou.

390
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,905
Wu Lian's lying.

391
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,586
For the smuggling of embroidery,

392
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:03,026
it was he who first contacted me.

393
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:04,665
Oh, right.

394
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,385
He violated the embroideresses
in the Tower.

395
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,225
He did a lot of dirty things.

396
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,106
Few of the girls in the Yanyu Tower

397
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,985
were free from him.

398
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:15,106
Almost all have been victimized by him.

399
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,425
Zhao Yin, stop talking nonsense.

400
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:19,465
Wu Lian,

401
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:22,465
keep calm.

402
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,506
I will judge whether it's true or false.

403
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:27,465
Continue.

404
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:29,145
Seven years ago,

405
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:33,026
he violated one of his embroideress,

406
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,346
and was taken to court.

407
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,506
He was desperate
to clear his name at that time.

408
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:39,985
To bribe officials
in Huaizhou Prefecture,

409
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:41,425
he reached out to me.

410
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:44,306
He said he had a batch of
royal embroidery to be shipped

411
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,665
to Abbasid Caliphate.

412
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,026
The price could be quadrupled or more.

413
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:48,866
I...

414
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,866
I-I was bewitched at that moment,

415
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,346
so I conspired with him.

416
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:57,346
Do you have any physical evidence?

417
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:01,625
No.

418
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:02,985
What about witnesses?

419
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:19,866
None.

420
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,346
Enough, we lost.

421
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:39,746
Meet me at the side court tonight.

422
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:40,985
Okay.

423
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:42,425
Thank you.

424
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:44,066
I'll see you out.

425
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:46,145
Wu Lian, you framed me.

426
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,385
- I'll kill you.
- Stop him.

427
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:48,866
Wu Lian, I won't let you off.

428
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:49,625
Take him away.

429
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:50,665
You're unfaithful!

430
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:51,905
You're a rat!

431
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:53,266
You'll get what you deserve!

432
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,705
Wu Lian, I won't let you off!

433
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:56,985
You're a beast!

434
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,866
Shame on you!

435
00:22:59,066 --> 00:22:59,786
I'm telling you.

436
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:02,546
I won't let you off, Wu Lian!

437
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:03,945
Wu Lian!

438
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,306
Mr. Lou, Her Majesty's birthday
is around the corner.

439
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,506
I'm in preparation for
the gifts all day long.

440
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,625
Since this case
has nothing to do with me,

441
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,786
I'll return to the Tower now.

442
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,066
Mr. Wu, please wait.

443
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,586
The case is not over yet.

444
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,945
During my duty visit to the capital,

445
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:29,106
I'll report this case in detail.

446
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:33,586
I'm afraid I'll have to bother
Mr. Wu in the future.

447
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:36,506
Of course.

448
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:39,385
If needed, I won't refuse.

449
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,346
Then I'll take my leave.

450
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,465
(The Wu Lian rape case of Lin Rulan)
Mr. Lou, please take a look.

451
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,746
From the case file,

452
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,185
this case doesn't seem complicated.

453
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:07,546
Yeah.

454
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,185
It's just a naive young lady,

455
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:11,746
who admired Mr. Wu,

456
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,066
wanted to marry into his family,

457
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:15,385
and played a little trick.

458
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,465
There's no injustice.

459
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,730
(Plaintiff, Lin Rulan
Defendant, Wu Lian)

460
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:33,225
Mr. Lou, what's on your mind?

461
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:39,385
Wu Lian is now facing two charges.

462
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,026
One is smuggling,

463
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:44,385
the other is raping
apprentice embroideresses.

464
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:47,225
But so far,

465
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:50,826
there is no substantial evidence
for these two cases.

466
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:54,425
I can't work on the investigation.

467
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,346
What should we do then?

468
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,225
If there's no evidence,

469
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:01,506
then we have to go find it.

470
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:02,746
- Lou Mingzhang!
- Find...

471
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,705
Don't you take your life seriously?

472
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:09,145
A bandit

473
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:10,266
trapped us here.

474
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,866
You don't have him thrown in jail,

475
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:12,985
but you're even

476
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,106
making friends with him?

477
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,106
Honey, he's not a bandit.

478
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:17,905
A bandit leader.

479
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:20,266
The second in command of Heifeng Camp.

480
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,665
Look.

481
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:26,586
Lou Mingzhang,

482
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,866
you're the judge of
Eastern District of Huainan.

483
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:32,346
How much evidence of
corrupt officials you have!

484
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,346
You won't hurry to the capital
to meet the royals,

485
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:35,826
but you're investigating

486
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:37,586
an embroidery smuggling case
here in Huaizhou?

487
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:38,945
You're not afraid of death,

488
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:40,425
but I am.

489
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:42,306
Dear, calm down.

490
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:43,705
You're right.

491
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:47,425
We need to return to the capital
as soon as possible indeed.

492
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,826
How about this? Let's set off tomorrow.

493
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,425
Escort Zhao Yin to the capital,

494
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,866
and then we will
plan the rest for the long term.

495
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:57,425
Wait, Mr. Lou.

496
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,425
You mean, you're leaving?

497
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:03,425
You're still clinging to my man?

498
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:04,826
Who's clinging?

499
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:05,945
The culprit's on the loose.

500
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,026
You can't leave.

501
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:08,066
You...

502
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:12,185
Feng Da, listen to me.

503
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:16,145
The one at the Yanyu Tower
is indeed suspicious,

504
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,425
but when handling cases,
we need to rely on solid evidence.

505
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,313
Moreover, as this case
involves a lot of old matters,

506
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,993
I still have official duties here,

507
00:26:26,313 --> 00:26:28,713
and I really can't be
distracted for too long.

508
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:34,313
Let's discuss this
for the long term in the future.

509
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:36,233
Hurry up and go.

510
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,834
No, let's not table it.

511
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:39,993
Wait, Mr. Lou.

512
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:42,194
You said you're a good official.

513
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,170
(Yanyu Tower)

514
00:26:51,753 --> 00:26:53,914
Which room is the one
who entered the Tower a few days ago

515
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,434
arranged in?

516
00:26:58,194 --> 00:26:59,473
Mr. Wu,

517
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:02,233
the fifth room in the east.

518
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:06,073
Got it. You can go.

519
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:07,753
Yes.

520
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,793
(Few of the girls in the Yanyu Tower)

521
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,594
(were free from him.)

522
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:33,594
Almost all have been victimized by him.

523
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,394
Did Zhao Yin really say so?

524
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,753
Yes, but he must have been anxious

525
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:42,154
and made false accusations.

526
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,834
He can't produce any evidence.

527
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:45,114
Mr. Wu

528
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,154
should have returned to
the Yanyu Tower by now.

529
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:53,954
If Wu Lian comes to see me
in the next few days,

530
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,154
tell him I'm sick and refuse him.

531
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:58,753
Yes.

532
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,154
Mr. Wu.

533
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:15,674
Do you know why I called you here?

534
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,273
The misfortune that befell you

535
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:18,354
is out of my carelessness.

536
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:19,874
Please punish me, Mr. Wu.

537
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:23,874
It is not the time to punish you yet.

538
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:27,594
The background of Madame Meng
whom I asked you to investigate.

539
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:29,434
Do you have any news?

540
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,354
I have found Meng Wan's residence,

541
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,194
but her property has been sold long ago.

542
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,233
It is said that her whole family

543
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:36,793
left Huaizhou Prefecture seven years ago

544
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,354
and their whereabouts are unknown.

545
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,194
Help me investigate another person.

546
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:50,914
I heard there is
a theater in the capital,

547
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,874
with a highly skilled female musician.

548
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:56,954
I wonder if Mr. Shen has seen her.

549
00:28:58,114 --> 00:29:00,273
I don't frequent
such places as theaters.

550
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:04,033
Right.

551
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:09,313
Mr. Shen is full of righteousness,

552
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:11,674
ignoring the salary of
the Imperial Guard Bureau,

553
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:13,033
preferring to be suspended,

554
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:14,634
and coming to Huaizhou Prefecture

555
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,073
for this scandalous scene.

556
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,553
The suspension is only temporary.

557
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,553
My prisoner is in Huaizhou Prefecture,

558
00:29:22,154 --> 00:29:23,553
so I am in Huaizhou Prefecture.

559
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:25,114
What's scandalous about that?

560
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:27,553
Since you're specifically
for the Imperial Guard Bureau,

561
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:29,273
why not hurry back to the capital,

562
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:32,194
and tell the royal family

563
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,473
about the scandal of Wu Lian,

564
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,954
so we don't waste our time here?

565
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,313
I'm just a member of
the Imperial Guard Bureau,

566
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,753
not even in charge of the guards.

567
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,394
I can't meet the royal family.

568
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:46,354
Turns out you're not
as useful as a eunuch.

569
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:03,473
Boil the medicine for me.

570
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:05,834
Why should I boil medicine for you?

571
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:08,273
If you hadn't forced me
to jump into the river,

572
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:09,993
how would I have caught a cold?

573
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:12,154
If I contact any illness,

574
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,434
I'll cling to you
for the rest of my life.

575
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,793
It seems I didn't misunderstand you.

576
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:19,553
What do you mean?

577
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,354
Captain Liu seven years ago

578
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:24,434
only seemed like an idiot,

579
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,834
while Cripple Liu now

580
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:29,513
is truly an idiot.

581
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:31,233
You dare to scold me?

582
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,233
Get out of my way.

583
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:33,553
I won't.

584
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,834
So noisy.

585
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:36,434
Forced by you to jump into the river

586
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,354
and left with injuries.

587
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:39,954
I must take revenge.

588
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:41,874
Catcher,

589
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:44,793
you're more vicious than Wu Lian.

590
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:48,073
I just smelled a scent of trash on you,

591
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,154
so I made you jump in the river
to take a bath.

592
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:53,233
Why are you following me?

593
00:30:53,753 --> 00:30:54,674
You're really beautiful.

594
00:30:57,513 --> 00:30:58,434
Thank you.

595
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:01,273
Are you married?

596
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:02,753
No.

597
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:05,114
Is it because

598
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,553
you're in the prostitution industry
that men don't want to marry you?

599
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:13,354
I hope you men

600
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:17,154
stay away from me. Will you?

601
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:19,674
What I mean is I can accept it.

602
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:21,634
Look, you sell your body,
and I sell my labor.

603
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:22,713
I think we're a good match.

604
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:23,993
- I really...
- Match my foot.

605
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:24,914
- No.
- Are you dumb?

606
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,114
Can't you talk nicely?

607
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:27,713
It doesn't hurt when you hit me,

608
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:28,834
so what's the point?

609
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:29,793
Everyone!

610
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,634
Food's here.

611
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:44,082
(Wait in the boudoir for seven years,
but nothing is forgotten.)

612
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,473
Luckily, they didn't bring Wu Lian
back to the capital.

613
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:50,313
Otherwise, not only
could he easily escape,

614
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:53,354
but he could also
falsely accuse us of a crime.

615
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:55,513
Wait, is this so troublesome?

616
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:56,674
I really don't understand.

617
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:57,914
Let's go to the Yanyu Tower now

618
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,473
and catch that guy.
Then, it's all done.

619
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,793
Feng, great minds think alike.

620
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,033
Let's go now.

621
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:03,793
Go.

622
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:06,194
As the saying goes,

623
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:07,753
stupid minds attract each other.

624
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,233
Just for personal revenge,

625
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:12,634
you dare to call yourselves great minds.

626
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,313
What's wrong with personal revenge?

627
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,513
Woman.

628
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,434
Aren't you also avenging your beloved
for personal reasons?

629
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,394
Making yourself so noble, huh?

630
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:22,273
Even if it's personal revenge,

631
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:24,874
you should use your brains.

632
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:26,674
What can you two brutes

633
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:28,553
achieve?

634
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,473
Enough. Stop nagging.

635
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:30,874
We'll get him tonight.

636
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,073
Feng, let's go.

637
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:32,914
Go.

638
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:35,594
I serve in the Imperial Guard Bureau.

639
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:39,594
There's no way
for your murder in the dark.

640
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,993
If you dare to harm people
for personal revenge,

641
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,513
don't blame me for arresting you.

642
00:32:47,394 --> 00:32:49,473
Such official prestige.

643
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:52,434
When did I say I wanted to end his life?

644
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:54,313
Aren't we going to end his life?

645
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:56,793
I just want his leg. That's all.

646
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,993
Am I going to kill him?

647
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:01,114
With one hammer,
I could make him smashed.

648
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,114
I find that you're starting to
nag like a woman.

649
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,033
Who are you calling?

650
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:04,553
You.

651
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:05,834
You two idiots.

652
00:33:06,473 --> 00:33:07,473
Why not have a fight,

653
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:10,033
giving us some entertainment?

654
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:11,513
Liu Sanniang,

655
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,513
you don't need to
fan the flames like this.

656
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,313
You're speaking up for them again.

657
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:17,354
Woman,

658
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:19,033
why do you always stir up trouble?

659
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:20,354
Are we leaving or not?

660
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,713
Make way.

661
00:33:21,914 --> 00:33:23,513
- Stop.
- Everyone,

662
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,114
we have serious business tonight.

663
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,634
Could you first listen to me?

664
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,313
The situation in the court today

665
00:33:38,553 --> 00:33:39,993
indeed went beyond my expectations.

666
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:44,594
Never thought Wu Lian could keep things
so clean after all these years

667
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:48,394
that even Zhao Yin couldn't
find a shred of evidence.

668
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,394
But haven't we
already achieved our goal?

669
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:52,713
What goal?

670
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:56,033
If you really want to
bring someone down,

671
00:33:56,473 --> 00:33:58,473
just pushing isn't enough.

672
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:01,114
Even if he falls a hundred times,

673
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:03,233
there's still
a possibility of him getting up.

674
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,154
Only by completely
chopping off his two legs

675
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,234
can he truly fall
and confess his crimes.

676
00:34:12,954 --> 00:34:14,673
Wu Lian also has two legs.

677
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:17,633
One is Mrs. Ning,

678
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,633
who connected him with the royal family,

679
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:23,794
elevating his Yanyu Tower to the top,

680
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:27,033
which brought him great fame.

681
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:29,553
The other

682
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:31,193
is Zhao Yin,

683
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:34,914
who helped him
with the fake royal tributes,

684
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,153
using the convenience of
Foreign Trade Bureau

685
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:39,073
to amass enormous wealth.

686
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:42,673
In any case,

687
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:46,473
we didn't gain nothing
in the court today.

688
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:50,314
Zhao Yin has completely fallen.

689
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:53,193
As for Mrs. Ning,

690
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:55,394
she is still connected to him.

691
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,274
So next, we should...

692
00:35:00,394 --> 00:35:01,513
What should we do next?

693
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:05,794
Keep Mr. Lou in our Huaizhou Prefecture.

694
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:09,113
Why must it be him?

695
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:12,193
He has the people's welfare in mind

696
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:18,314
and boasts his official position,
duty, power, and good temperament.

697
00:35:19,314 --> 00:35:20,794
Second to none.

698
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,874
How can we keep him here?

699
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:26,633
To keep a big shot,

700
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,553
naturally, it requires a big case.

701
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:33,274
It's just that if a thousand people
share the same mind,

702
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:34,874
they have the strength of a thousand.

703
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:37,914
If they share different minds,
it's useless even if it's ten-fold.

704
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:43,234
Everyone,

705
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:45,834
the next thing we need to do

706
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:47,834
is to seek common ground.

707
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:50,153
Only with concerted efforts
can we succeed.

708
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:52,993
Please.

709
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:32,120
(Unjust)

710
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,666
(Ning Mansion)

711
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,184
(Unjust)

712
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,162
(Yanyu Tower)

713
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:33,816
(Unjust)

714
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:48,152
(Unjust)

715
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:09,794
Madam,

716
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,954
several were posted
on the main gate of our Ning Mansion.

717
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,033
On the doors of
nearby residents' houses.

718
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:17,073
And on the walls.

719
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:19,274
Madam, something is wrong.

720
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:20,633
On our main gate...

721
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:22,954
What's happened to the main gate?

722
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,593
This girl's death was horrible.

723
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:27,553
She was really violated.

724
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:29,754
No way.

725
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:31,834
The young girl is only fifteen.

726
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:34,673
What is written here?

727
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,553
It says she was violated.

728
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:37,794
At such a young age.

729
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:39,193
Pull over.

730
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:41,794
Look at what's written here.

731
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:44,113
If it is true, it's too tragic.

732
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:45,033
Indeed.

733
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:48,673
She was truly wrongly accused.

734
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:54,394
Is it true?

735
00:38:54,993 --> 00:38:56,193
Who would still seek justice

736
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,193
seven years after a wrongful death
if it weren't?

737
00:38:58,234 --> 00:38:58,794
Right.

738
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,914
- Excuse me.
- Did Mr. Wu...

739
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,354
Are you talking about Lin Rulan?

740
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:05,593
Yeah.

741
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:07,193
The way this young girl died was tragic.

742
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:09,633
How did she die?

743
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:12,633
I heard she fell to her death.

744
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:13,513
No, no.

745
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:15,633
She was killed.

746
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:16,673
Indeed.

747
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:18,473
What a tragedy.

748
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:20,274
She was just a young girl.

749
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:21,834
What a pity.

750
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:25,473
So unjust.

751
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,513
Dared to steal
even the plaque of Ning Mansion.

752
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:28,794
Who are they on earth?

753
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:29,874
(Huaizhou)
Have they no fear of death?

754
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,354
Right.

755
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:33,234
Look at these three plaques.

756
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:35,394
Are they implying that Ning Mansion
and Huaizhou Yamen

757
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:37,874
are the left and right guardians of
the Yanyu Tower?

758
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:39,593
This matter is not simple.

759
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,234
Wu Lian must have a powerful backer.

760
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:44,394
Who would have thought Mr. Wu

761
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,874
was such a hypocritical gentleman?

762
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:49,466
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)

763
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:51,426
(Yanyu Tower)

764
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,394
(Ning Mansion)

765
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:10,274
Madam.

766
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:14,394
Did anyone

767
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:17,633
attempt to smear Mr. Wu today?

768
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:19,794
If you ask me,

769
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:23,714
all the accusations
leveled against Wu Lian

770
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:26,473
in the court yesterday are true.

771
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:30,354
Every piece of it.

772
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:32,794
Madam, what do you plan to do?

773
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:36,754
If Lou Mingzhang

774
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:39,794
was determined to
leave Huaizhou Prefecture,

775
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:42,673
I still can take the opportunity

776
00:40:44,714 --> 00:40:46,794
to sever ties with Wu Lian.

777
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:50,193
But he's not leaving now.

778
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:54,274
He even said he must
get to the bottom of it.

779
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:58,954
Madame Xu,

780
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,153
do you know what this means?

781
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:07,033
I apologize for my ignorance.
I don't understand.

782
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:17,234
It means

783
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:19,857
for this crisis,

784
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:23,977
I must save him.

785
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:27,417
Even if he has to die,

786
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:31,138
he has to die innocently.

787
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,618
Don't move, don't move.

788
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:38,977
Get away.

789
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:41,977
Stop looking. Stop looking.

790
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:45,337
What now?

791
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,178
Has the one from Ning Mansion given up?

792
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,377
It appears we
have underestimated Mrs. Ning.

793
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,537
We still need to give her a good push.

794
00:41:56,218 --> 00:41:57,178
What's your plan?

795
00:42:25,937 --> 00:42:27,857
Your turn to perform
after I've done my part.

796
00:42:29,057 --> 00:42:31,818
The show just started.

797
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:46,218
Boss, Ms. Chen is here.

798
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:49,977
Ms. Huang, you seem busy.

799
00:42:51,098 --> 00:42:52,937
(Huang Jiaojiao)
Long time no see, Ms. Chen.

800
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:54,337
Hope you've been well.

801
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:56,778
Good. Thanks to you.
