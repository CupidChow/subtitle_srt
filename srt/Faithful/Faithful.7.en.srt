00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:15,456
(Seven years ago)

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,160
How dare you newbie
wield your blade against me?

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,920
I saw you asking
the Liang family's farmer for bribery.

4
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,000
Give the money back.

5
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,200
I can do whatever I want here.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,920
This is the Huaizhou Prefecture.

7
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,960
Know the rules before you talk or act.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,600
If you dare to cause me trouble again,

9
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,960
my men won't let you off so easily.

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,560
You lawless people.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to Prefect Chen now.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,560
Shen Mu, right? You've got some nerves.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Our Prefect Chen
has been overwhelmed by the case

14
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,159
between Miss Lin and the Yanyu Tower.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
He has some anger to vent.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,824
Go ask for a good beating. Let's go.

17
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:02,184
=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

18
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:06,072
=Episode 7, Chapter 4, Part 1=
(Mrs. Wu Finds Mr. Wu a Fine Concubine)

19
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:32,167
Rulan, it's all my fault.

20
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:36,206
If I hadn't sent you
to that so-called Yanyu Tower,

21
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,607
you wouldn't have
suffered such misfortune.

22
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,607
I am the one to blame.

23
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,206
No, Mother.

24
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,327
I loved embroidery
and asked you to send me there.

25
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,047
Let me kill that bad man!

26
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,246
Are you trying
to stir things up even more?

27
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,567
Father, Wu Lian crossed the line!

28
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:54,727
My little sister...

29
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:00,926
Lin's Clinic sent us a message that

30
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,966
(Mr. Lin)
they won't take Lin Lang in just yet.

31
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,526
Is it because of me?

32
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:22,047
I'm sorry you're implicated
because of me.

33
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,926
And I got our family store closed.

34
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,366
Don't talk nonsense.

35
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:30,287
I don't need a mentor like that.

36
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:36,246
Gossip is a fearful thing.
It's normal for Mr. Lin to hesitate.

37
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,486
Rulan, don't overthink.

38
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,566
Father and Mother will protect you.

39
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,326
And I'm here for you.

40
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:08,566
What are you doing?

41
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,167
Proposing, obviously.

42
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,967
Mr. Lin, I've done
matchmaking for almost

43
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,446
all the respected families

44
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,207
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

45
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,126
I'm here in person only

46
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:20,767
because Mrs. Wu insists on it.

47
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,647
Listen. Rulan is not getting married.

48
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,287
Get those things back.

49
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,607
How can you force a girl to get married?

50
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,407
With all due respect,

51
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,326
not everyone can be so lucky.

52
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,006
Not even a virgin girl gets to

53
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:35,806
marry Mr. Wu so easily,

54
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,486
let alone your daughter.

55
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:39,647
You...

56
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,967
Mr. Lin, as you can see,

57
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,926
the Wu family offers betrothal gifts
of the highest standard.

58
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:47,126
Who's so generous to a concubine?

59
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,087
Mrs. Wu is just kind enough

60
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,126
to help save your daughter's reputation.

61
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:52,926
Am I right?

62
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,847
- Yeah.
- Totally.

63
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,207
If I were Mrs. Wu...

64
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,806
Come on, carry the things inside. Go.

65
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:01,767
Who dares to come in?

66
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,047
Mr. Lin, just wait for the wedding.

67
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,407
Get lost! Take them away!

68
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,926
Nobody wants your betrothal gifts!

69
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,486
Who dares to come in?

70
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,207
You have a death wish?

71
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,126
Come and try it.

72
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:18,566
Ungrateful people.
You'd better not regret it.

73
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:19,806
Get lost!

74
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,486
Let's go.

75
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:23,527
So ungrateful.

76
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,806
What are you looking at? Get lost!

77
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,126
The Wu family prepared so many gifts.

78
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,967
It's good enough for your girl.

79
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:35,287
But you drove them away.

80
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:37,366
Father, let's go in.

81
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:38,607
Let's go.

82
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,648
(Lin's Pharmacy)

83
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:58,047
Rulan, we're here for you.

84
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:01,727
In the worst-case scenario,
we'll sustain you forever.

85
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,760
You're back?

86
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:19,407
Pick carefully.

87
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:21,767
Give it to me!

88
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,087
Or I'll beat you up.

89
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,886
I don't even have a penny.

90
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,006
I beat you!

91
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,886
Wan, you're back.

92
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:30,926
Want to sit in my room?

93
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,047
I have just steamed some buns. Try some.

94
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,446
No, thanks, Mrs. Yang.

95
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,167
Give it to me!

96
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:38,006
I know

97
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,207
you're hiding it!

98
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,207
Give it to me!

99
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,647
I remember you have
a fine bracelet in your dowry.

100
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,486
Where did you hide it?

101
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,287
You've traded all my dowry
for wine over the years.

102
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,407
What bracelet do I have left?

103
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,647
You even gave away
half of your ancestral house.

104
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:55,727
How are we...

105
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:56,886
Get lost!

106
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,712
Mother.

107
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,607
(Mrs. Meng)
Another loser!

108
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:05,407
(Mr. Meng)
Your mother sent you to Yanyu Tower!

109
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,087
It's time to pay for it.

110
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:08,486
What are you doing?

111
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:12,287
Look at your sour faces!

112
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,686
Our family has been jinxed

113
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,366
and lost all the fortune because of you.

114
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:18,727
Mother.

115
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:21,486
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

116
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:22,527
Bad luck.

117
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,686
What are you doing?

118
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,926
Get lost.

119
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,206
Mother.

120
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:37,086
Listen to me.

121
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:40,287
I won't let you off
until you give me that bracelet.

122
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:57,287
Wan, you're my only hope.

123
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,446
You must work hard.

124
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,007
Your father will surely die

125
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,407
in a few years
if he keeps drinking like this.

126
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:07,686
The best decision I've made

127
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,047
is to send you to Yanyu Tower.

128
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,566
Work hard and master the skill.

129
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,367
Marry a nice guy.

130
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,767
Then we have hope in life.

131
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:27,966
Why did you come home today?

132
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,326
Did you do something wrong there?

133
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,686
Many things happened there these days.

134
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,606
Many parents took their daughters home.

135
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:45,127
So our teacher stopped the lessons.

136
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,606
Because of Lin Rulan's incident?

137
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,127
It's no big deal.

138
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:53,767
The Wu family sent betrothal gifts
to the Lin family today.

139
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:56,647
What did you say?

140
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,247
That girl would be lucky
to marry into the Wu family.

141
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,206
Did they say yes?

142
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,007
They drove the matchmaker away.

143
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,926
I bet they're just
trying to ask for more.

144
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,086
They'll end up with nothing.

145
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,407
Look at you.
You're not any worse than Lin Rulan.

146
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:16,647
Why aren't you capable of that?

147
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:18,767
My silly girl.

148
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:20,326
I'll be right back, Mother.

149
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,446
Where are you going?

150
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,407
Lin Rulan, come out!

151
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:28,167
I know you're in there.

152
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:31,367
Lin Rulan, come out.

153
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:33,784
Lin Rulan.

154
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,806
What are you doing?

155
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,086
What am I doing?

156
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,647
Why don't you ask your friend
what she's doing?

157
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,127
She slandered Mr. Wu

158
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,127
just to marry him.

159
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,367
Now, her scheme worked.

160
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,686
The Wu family sent a matchmaker here.

161
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,206
She doesn't deserve it!

162
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,647
Wu Lian did this to cover his tracks.

163
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:54,487
Besides, they drove the matchmaker away.

164
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:57,726
So pretentious.
She's just playing hard to get.

165
00:10:58,487 --> 00:10:59,606
Totally shameless.

166
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,926
Why am I wasting my time
with her sidekick?

167
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,846
Go away. Lin Rulan.

168
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,127
Go ahead if you want to marry Mr. Wu.

169
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,606
But I won't let you tarnish

170
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,167
Rulan's reputation.

171
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:12,686
I'm tarnishing her reputation?

172
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,007
She has no reputation.

173
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:19,206
Rulan.

174
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:23,566
Get lost or I'll teach you a lesson.

175
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,487
I don't have anything to lose now.

176
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,086
Try me. Get lost.

177
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:33,606
Lin Rulan, don't be so cocky.

178
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,326
I'll wait to enjoy your misery.

179
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:43,446
Rulan, is it true?

180
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:45,767
He sent you betrothal gifts?

181
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,966
How can he be so shameless?

182
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:52,696
Rulan.

183
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:55,744
Rulan.

184
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:05,463
I've been looking for you. What's wrong?

185
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,264
What do you want?

186
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:09,784
The first day
of the lunar month is coming.

187
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,264
Didn't we agree

188
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:13,264
to burn incense at the Fuyuan Temple?

189
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:14,944
I came to ask you

190
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:17,264
what snacks to prepare.

191
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:20,024
I'm not in the mood for that.

192
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,064
Mr. Wu.

193
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,024
Mr. Wu.

194
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:35,144
Are you really marrying Lin Rulan?

195
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:41,264
Go back to practice.
Your skill is deteriorating.

196
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,823
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)
Everyone's talking about that case.

197
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:05,184
Have you heard the storytelling?
It was thrilling.

198
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:06,424
You can do better.

199
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,544
What's the fun of the storytelling?

200
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:11,503
Wouldn't it be more exciting

201
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:14,304
to hear it from the lady herself?

202
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,703
Get to work. You guys,
we're going to the Lin's Pharmacy.

203
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:21,223
Lin's Pharmacy?
Are we arresting Miss Lin?

204
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:22,823
Prefect Chen told us

205
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:25,823
- to bring her here.
- Let's go.

206
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:27,304
Sorry.

207
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:29,784
The granny who makes pancakes
was in trouble.

208
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:33,304
I drove away those hooligans
and got delayed.

209
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,424
A newbie wants to be a hero?

210
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:37,784
Alright, come with us.

211
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,343
I won't let you off
if you bring me food late again.

212
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:52,463
(Lin's Pharmacy)

213
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:53,976
Open up.

214
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,632
Open up.

215
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,840
Who is it?

216
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,863
Coming. Just a second.

217
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:03,103
- Open up.
- Coming. Wait.

218
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:06,184
W-What are you doing?

219
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,904
What's wrong, sir?

220
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,823
What brought you here?

221
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,223
We're working on a case.
Get Lin Rulan here.

222
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm here.

223
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,784
We're looking into your case
against Wu Lian.

224
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,623
Come with us to the Yamen.

225
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,904
Wait, where is Captain Liu?

226
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,583
You know Captain Liu?

227
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,863
He's put in jail. Nobody told you?

228
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:28,703
Cut the crap. Let's go.

229
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:31,343
Sir, can I come with my little sister?

230
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,544
You're irrelevant.

231
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:36,223
Prefect Chen only told us
to bring Lin Rulan back. Let's go.

232
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:37,944
- Rulan.
- Go.

233
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:40,064
- Rulan.
- Go.

234
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:49,823
Go.

235
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:50,743
Rulan.

236
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:53,103
Rulan.

237
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,784
Rulan.

238
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:00,784
Miss, are you cold?

239
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:03,703
Would you like me to warm you up?

240
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,983
She's not Yan'er in Yanchun House.

241
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:09,743
She may sue you.

242
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:11,784
Girls in Yanchun House

243
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,823
are entertainers, not courtesans.

244
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:16,424
She's no match for them.

245
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,223
I strongly disagree.

246
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:21,144
Miss Lin has fairer skin

247
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:23,944
than the most popular girl
in Yanchun House,

248
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,304
just like girls in Xiaoxiang House.

249
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:41,703
Sit.

250
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:43,784
I'd like to see Prefect Chen.

251
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,064
Prefect Chen has tons of work.

252
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:50,304
We're not distracting him.

253
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:52,983
Sit.

254
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:57,664
You filed a lawsuit against Wu Lian.

255
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,304
So you have to tell us everything

256
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,944
in detail

257
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,064
for us to keep a record.

258
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:06,424
Go ahead.

259
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:11,823
How did Wu Lian assault you?
Give us the details.

260
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:14,944
We can't afford to miss out

261
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,343
on any important detail.

262
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:28,703
Go ahead.

263
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:33,184
Go ahead.

264
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,264
I was sewing that night.

265
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:49,583
Wu Lian suddenly came into my room

266
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,304
and grabbed my hand from behind.

267
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,664
What are you doing?

268
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:03,463
Easy.

269
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,904
We have to confirm every detail.

270
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,944
Wu Lian grabbed your hand like this?

271
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,983
Enough. Let go of her.

272
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,184
Go on.

273
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,063
Go ahead.

274
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:33,584
Then he taught me sewing

275
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,104
while undressing me,

276
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:51,904
and pushing me onto the bed.

277
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:54,584
Louder. I can't hear you.

278
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:58,223
Do you hear him? Louder.

279
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:03,223
What did Wu Lian do
after he pushed you onto the bed?

280
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:07,944
I don't remember.

281
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:09,144
That won't work.

282
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,063
How do we solve the case

283
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:13,904
if you don't make things clear?

284
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,704
Exactly.

285
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:28,904
He first grabbed my hands by force.

286
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:32,223
Go on.

287
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:37,584
I wanted to push him away
but I just couldn't.

288
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:39,783
How come?

289
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,344
Was it like this?

290
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,463
Now you're pretending to be a virgin?

291
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:59,344
Mr. Zhou, Prefect Chen
only told us to solve the case,

292
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,184
not to interrogate her.

293
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:06,743
Who do you think you are, newbie?

294
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:07,824
You learned

295
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,503
to take pity on women before anything.

296
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:15,344
Don't you see the teapot is empty?

297
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:19,783
Go fetch some water. Go.

298
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,624
Come on now.

299
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:54,223
Captain Qian.

300
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:56,424
Take her to be inspected.

301
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:01,904
Go away. What are you doing?

302
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,503
Step aside.

303
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:06,223
Get in.

304
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:12,944
Get undressed.

305
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:18,624
What are you waiting for?
Should I do it for you?

306
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:22,384
Why should I get undressed?

307
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,864
A woman who claims
to have been assaulted

308
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,503
should be inspected, of course.

309
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,303
Otherwise, how do we know

310
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:31,584
if you're telling the truth?

311
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:35,824
Ma'am, can you tell them to leave?

312
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:37,624
Or we can go to the inner room.

313
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:39,624
I will collaborate.

314
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,783
You're not a virgin girl.

315
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:45,303
Why so pretentious? Hurry up.

316
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:49,783
Ma'am, you're also a woman.
Please show mercy.

317
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,824
Please. I beg you.

318
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:55,104
It's fine if you don't
want to be undressed.

319
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,584
Withdraw the lawsuit
and you'll be spared the trouble.

320
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,463
No, I can't withdraw the lawsuit.

321
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:05,743
Then you can't blame me for this.

322
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:07,983
Someone, help her.

323
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:10,463
Get lost, guys.

324
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,104
Help!

325
00:21:18,184 --> 00:21:19,223
Let go of me!

326
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,344
Shen Mu, are you out of your mind?

327
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,584
Hands off her.

328
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:38,904
Hands off her.

329
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:52,543
Get out.

330
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:02,584
Get out.

331
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,783
Alright, get out.

332
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,184
Stay here with Ma'am.

333
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:54,664
Prefect Chen.

334
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:57,344
How's it going?

335
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:00,983
Zhou Yi and those guys
have gone too far.

336
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:03,824
It was too much even for me.

337
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:07,463
People should know their limits.

338
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:10,503
Otherwise, they'll harm
others and themselves.

339
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,384
That girl won't last.

340
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,023
I bet she's going to resign soon.

341
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,624
I don't care what Lin Rulan wants.

342
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:23,543
But I can't let anything go wrong

343
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:24,624
for Mrs. Ning.

344
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:28,424
Don't let that girl
tarnish Mr. Wu's reputation.

345
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:30,023
Yes.

346
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:51,063
Ma'am, you've inspected me.

347
00:23:51,824 --> 00:23:54,263
Does it serve as evidence?

348
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:59,063
I'll report to Prefect Chen accordingly.

349
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:03,344
It's true that
you're no longer a virgin girl.

350
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:09,664
But I haven't seen any signs of a tear.

351
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:14,904
Therefore, we can conclude

352
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:17,543
that you either did it voluntarily

353
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:21,384
or took the initiative to lure Mr. Wu.

354
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,624
Ma'am, that's not true.

355
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:30,303
No?

356
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:31,344
No.

357
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:36,783
I've seen plenty of young ladies
who would do anything

358
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:39,664
to marry into
wealthy families just like you.

359
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:43,184
I suggest you stop it
before it's too late.

360
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:49,743
Do not end up losing everything.

361
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:23,543
Miss Lin, we don't have
women's clothes in the Yamen.

362
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:26,184
It's a new gown. Please make do with it.

363
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:08,424
Thank you.

364
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:14,703
I'll take you to the clothes shop
on South Street.

365
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:18,864
No need. I can go by myself.

366
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:22,664
I'm just worried that
you'd run into Mr. Zhou on the way.

367
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:33,344
Alright, thank you.

368
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,223
Who says she can leave?

369
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:41,824
Miss Lin is not a suspect.

370
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:43,983
You've questioned her

371
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:45,743
and inspected her.

372
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:48,743
Mr. Qian, is there anything else?

373
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:50,328
You...

374
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,783
Alright, let her go.

375
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:07,263
Why did you let her go?

376
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:10,463
People saw her coming to the Yamen.

377
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:12,703
Are we going to keep her here?

378
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,543
But Prefect Chen told us...

379
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,344
That Lin Rulan is a hard nut to crack.

380
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,864
I guess we can't make her back down

381
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:22,144
like this.

382
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,584
Let's think of something else.

383
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:28,664
Shen Mu is the one to blame.

384
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:32,463
Can't you even tame your people?

385
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:44,424
I'll get this one.

386
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:45,944
Ten wen.

387
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,703
I didn't bring money.

388
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:12,184
This is my token and my uniform.

389
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:13,703
(Huaizhou Prefecture)
They are for collateral.

390
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:15,703
Is that fine?

391
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,792
Sure.

392
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:23,303
Thank you, sir.

393
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:35,104
I'll ask my brother
to pay for the clothes.

394
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,743
Are you going to keep suing Mr. Wu?

395
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,664
I know they're giving me a hard time,

396
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,344
so I can withdraw it.

397
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:52,424
I thought Yamen officials
would do me justice.

398
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,223
What they did convinced me
to fight to the end.

399
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:02,223
If I can't find justice here,
I'll go to the capital.

400
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:05,424
I'm sure there is justice somewhere.

401
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,983
Maybe you can find yourself a litigator.

402
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:18,144
I heard that
some litigators are really good.

403
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:22,543
Why?

404
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:27,944
Everyone in Huaizhou Prefecture

405
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:29,983
thinks I'm a shameless girl

406
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:32,904
who has seduced Wu Lian

407
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:36,104
to marry into the Wu family.

408
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:40,223
Why did you help me

409
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:43,223
and even turned against your colleagues?

410
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:47,463
Don't you find me filthy?

411
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:51,503
I didn't think so much.

412
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:55,503
I just thought that
they shouldn't mistreat you.

413
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:05,023
Thank you.

414
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:13,584
Because I believe you.

415
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,144
I believe what you said.

416
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:20,703
I don't think a lady

417
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,944
would lie to tarnish her reputation.

418
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:25,543
I don't find you filthy.

419
00:30:26,664 --> 00:30:30,584
Those who have done
the evil deed are the filthy ones.

420
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:43,624
What's your name?

421
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:45,463
Shen Mu.

422
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:52,184
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

423
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:26,424
Rulan, you're back.

424
00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:28,263
Did they give you a hard time?

425
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,864
Rulan, why did you get changed?

426
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:34,664
They didn't do something to you, right?

427
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:38,184
They didn't do anything.

428
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:43,463
I got changed
because my clothes got dirty.

429
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:45,904
Stop being worried.

430
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:50,223
I'm a bit tired. I'll get some rest.

431
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,344
Rulan.

432
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,776
Lin Lang.

433
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,184
What should we do?

434
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,463
What do you want?

435
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,743
Weren't you a tough guy when you

436
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:32,944
saved the beauty earlier?

437
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:47,063
I won't use my blade.

438
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:51,063
We all work here. Don't push me.

439
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,103
Kowtow to me.

440
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:11,463
And I'll let you off.

441
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:14,904
You used to work
for that villain Liu Xin.

442
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:17,864
Now that he's in jail,

443
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:23,103
I'd be so terrified if I were you.

444
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:24,183
Shut up!

445
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,143
Mark my words.

446
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:38,904
If you dare to cross me again,

447
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,264
I swear I'll kill you.

448
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:48,583
Let's go. To Yanchun House. My treat.

449
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:28,063
It's the first day
of the lunar month tomorrow.

450
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:29,864
On the first day of each lunar month,

451
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:32,784
the head monk at Fuyuan Temple
would read people's fortunes.

452
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:36,183
I'll ask him to bless you
with a good marriage.

453
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,063
What's wrong?

454
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,983
I'm dizzy. I want to go to bed.

455
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,663
Alright, your father is still out.

456
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:48,103
Rest well.

457
00:35:59,183 --> 00:36:00,344
The first day of the lunar month.

458
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:48,704
Don't touch it.

459
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:52,344
Haven't I told you

460
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:57,344
not to touch
any embroidery in this study?

461
00:36:57,983 --> 00:37:00,224
Master, please forgive us.

462
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:01,983
- Leave me alone.
- Yes.

463
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:53,583
Isn't Lanxin in charge of the study?

464
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:55,183
Why is someone else on duty?

465
00:37:55,744 --> 00:37:58,384
I heard that
something happened at her home.

466
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,224
Mr. Wu let her go with some money.

467
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,663
So sudden? Yesterday afternoon,
she was telling me

468
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,864
to go shopping

469
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:06,704
with her once we're free.

470
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:08,304
Are you idling about?

471
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:10,304
Get back to work.

472
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:11,304
Yes.

473
00:38:21,944 --> 00:38:24,183
Sir, how much can I get with these?

474
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:30,463
These are common items.
Two guan at most.

475
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:36,183
Fine. Two guan is fine.

476
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,023
Here.

477
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:54,304
Are you Mr. Qian?

478
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,384
I heard that you studied law

479
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:00,824
and have won many lawsuits.

480
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:04,384
Will you take on my case?

481
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,304
Who are you?

482
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:10,503
I'm Lin Rulan. Some days ago...

483
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:15,543
You were the one who sued
Mr. Wu from Yanyu Tower?

484
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,384
Go away. This is a school.

485
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,103
It's a place for education.
Don't tarnish my reputation.

486
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,784
But you haven't heard me out.

487
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,623
If we go on talking,

488
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:30,424
I'm afraid you'd sue me as well.

489
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:40,824
Go away.

490
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:43,424
If I represent
a shameless person like you,

491
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,784
I'll sabotage my reputation.

492
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,824
You will help me for real?

493
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:52,264
Of course, why don't we

494
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:55,183
talk about the case in detail at night?

495
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:58,503
I'm sure we can figure things out.

496
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:11,103
Mr. Li.

497
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:45,384
Stop it.

498
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:50,264
Stop it.

499
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,424
Let's go.

500
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:16,663
Sir, are you fine?

501
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,463
I'm fine, Miss.

00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:37,503
Will you help me with my lawsuit?

504
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:40,864
Miss, didn't you see what happened?

505
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,864
Yes, I did.

506
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:44,264
And you dare to hire me?

507
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:48,824
Should I tell you about my case first?

508
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:51,623
I've heard about it.

509
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,744
I was right outside the Yamen

510
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:55,944
when you filed the lawsuit.

511
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,224
So will you help me?

512
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:03,424
I only have one question
before I take on a case.

513
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:06,063
Were you telling

514
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:09,744
the whole and absolute truth that day?

515
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:12,663
Yes. I swear on my life.

516
00:42:15,384 --> 00:42:19,904
Alright, then I'll take on the case.

517
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:22,224
Really?

518
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:23,768
Really.

519
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:29,264
Please take the money.

520
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:32,904
Alright.

521
00:42:32,904 --> 00:42:37,063
Miss, I'll wait for you at the teahouse
the day after tomorrow.

522
00:42:37,543 --> 00:42:40,784
Tell me everything once we meet.

523
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:43,448
Alright.

524
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:53,663
I've found a litigator
who's willing to represent me.

525
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,424
Thank you for your advice.

526
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:57,983
Justice will be done.

527
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:00,463
I'm sure you'll clear your name.

528
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,224
Ever since I filed the lawsuit,

529
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:08,224
you're the only one
who's been supportive.

530
00:43:08,663 --> 00:43:09,704
I'm a Yamen officer.

531
00:43:10,023 --> 00:43:11,304
This is my job.

532
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,983
You don't have to thank me.

533
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:16,663
But it's bound to be an arduous journey.

534
00:43:17,183 --> 00:43:18,304
Be very careful.

535
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:21,503
Okay, I will.

536
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:27,023
I'll treat you to a drink once I win.

537
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:29,583
Alright.

538
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,143
Adulterous couple.

539
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:36,583
It's getting late. I'll head home.
