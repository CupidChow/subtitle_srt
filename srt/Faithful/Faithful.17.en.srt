(Lin Rulan's Wedding)

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,359
(Seven years ago)
Comb your hair.

4
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,120
Wish you a happy life.

5
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,959
Mother, it's enough.

6
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Your dress doesn't conform to the rules.

7
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,520
If Mrs. Wu sees it,
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

8
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,759
Since I was little, I've been hoping

9
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,879
to wear the wedding dress
that I embroidered myself.

10
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,400
If I don't wear it today,

11
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,919
there won't be another chance.

12
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,599
Rulan, it's time to go.

13
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,080
Rulan, let me carry you out.

14
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,599
Brother, I know you love me the most.

15
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,360
Father, Mother.

16
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,759
You're going to be a married woman.

17
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,280
Take good care of yourself.

18
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,039
Rulan, we failed to protect you.

19
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,599
If you meet any difficulties,

20
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,439
send a message to us.

21
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,480
Don't try to bear it all by yourself.

22
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,480
Father, Mother.

23
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,839
I'm sorry I let you down.

24
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,439
If there is a next life,

25
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,319
I'll hope to be your daughter again.

26
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,360
Child, today's your big day.

27
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,240
Don't speak ominous words.

28
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,759
I know.

29
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,160

43
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,759
Bring some wedding candles.

44
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,800
And find a screen from the storage room.

45
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,959
After all, it's her first day.

46
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,639
Master doesn't care about Lin Rulan.

47
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,480
Otherwise, he wouldn't let her live
in this abandoned house.

48
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
Why should you be kind to her?

49
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,480
I just got her some daily necessities.

50
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,600
They don't cost much.

51
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,800
What a strange day.

52
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,759
Suddenly, it turned dark.

53
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,959
Mr. Wu.

54
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,279
When will Master come back?

55
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,800
You are already impatient?

56
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,920
Today is my wedding day.

57
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,319
Shame on you.

58
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,839
You're just a concubine.

59
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,639
You have to wait. Master is busy.

60
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,720
I want to get some food for my husband.

61
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240
Could you help me cook it?

62
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,080
Can't you see the fire is off?

63
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,000
I can cook it myself.

64
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
Please light the fire for me.

65
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,200
That's unreasonable.

66
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,480
I can't light the fire for you.

67
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,000
You have to figure it out yourself.

68
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,679
I just made some food for Mrs. Wu.

69
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,840
There's some left.

70
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,679
If you don't mind, you can have it.

71
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,480
Thank you.

72
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,879
The past is the past.

73
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,559
You are young.

74
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,720
You can apologize to Master.

75
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,720
After some time, he will accept you.

76
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,960
Thank you.

77
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
What are you here for?

78
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,720
I got you some food.

79
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,200
Please enjoy it while it's hot.

80
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,559
On that day in the court,

81
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,360
didn't you say you'd rather die
than become my concubine?

82
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,720
Do you give up now?

83
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,240
I was unreasonable before.

84
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,039
My parents have scolded me.

85
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,759
I am just a weak woman.

86
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
Now that I've married you,

87
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,919
I will listen to you.

88
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,440
I just want to live a quiet life.

89
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,360
Do you remember what I told you?

90
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,679
Once you marry me,
you will learn to behave.

91
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,080
So, I was right.

92
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
Yes.

93
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,159
Alright, you may go back.

94
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,360
Yes.

95
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,840
Are you trying
to win favor in another way?

96
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,960
Seeing you like this,

97
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,480
I prefer how you look in court.

98
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,840
I've imagined the scene
of marrying you a million times.

99
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,639
We're on the top of the Yanyu Tower,

100
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,159
overlooking the lights
of the whole city.

101
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,639
The view must be beautiful.

102
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,279
Now, I finally married you.

103
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,000
Master, would you like to go up with me?

104
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,840
To fulfill my little wish.

105
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,879
If so, I'll go up with you.

106
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,960
Mr. Shen.

107
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,919
Lin Rulan asked me to give you this.

108
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,957
(I'm in danger.
Please come quickly to Yanyu Tower.)

109
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,000
- Zhao Gang, come with me.
- All right.

110
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,039
Lin Rulan is in danger.

111
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,240
It's going to rain.

112
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,639
Compared with the round moon,

113
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,399
today's bleak moon seems better.

114
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,240
You must be very proud now.

115
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,039
Whether me

116
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,799
or other women,

117
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,919
you must think
we're all overreaching ourselves.

118
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,639
It's a foolish idea
to challenge a big shot.

119
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,200
You have certainly improved
in your acting skills.

120
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm not as good as you.

121
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,080
I thought you had learned your lesson.

122
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,200
Turns out you are still so obstinate.

123
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,279
After what you did to me,

124
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,720
I kept telling myself that you liked me.

125
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,559
You did that to me

126
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,480
on impulse.

127
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,960
I was also into you.

128
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,559
So I looked forward to marrying you.

129
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,319
But later, I realized

130
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,559
you didn't love me at all.

131
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
I was deceiving myself.

132
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,799
You had no feelings for me.

133
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,440
It was just a trick you used on me,

134
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,799
just to deceive me.

135
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,559
If you valued your chastity,
would you let me into your room?

136
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,759
If you had a sense of shame,

137
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,319
you would have committed suicide
the next day.

138
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,400
You women are naturally promiscuous,

139
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,400
yet you always claim to be innocent.
It's really funny.

140
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,559
You're just a man bullying women.

141
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,720
Now, I realize

142
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,960
you're nothing
more than a despicable coward

143
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,400
with low self-esteem.

144
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,920
You're a shameless man.

145
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,279
One day, your hypocritical mask

146
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,279
will be torn off,

147
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,039
and you will be laughed at by the world,

148
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,559
only spending the rest
of your life in jail with rats.

149
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,519
If you have the guts, kill me.

150
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,799
You think I dare not?

151
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,640
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

152
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,440
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

153
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,000
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

154
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,000
What did you do?

155
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,000
You want to kill me?

156
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,720
I won't admit defeat.

157
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,240
She's dead.

158
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,079
Go and catch him.

159
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,000
(What's your dream?)

160
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,240
(I want to be the best embroideress.)

161
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,200
(And I'll find the gentlest husband)

162
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,359
(and have a son and a daughter.)

163
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,559
(You will be my children's godmother.)

164
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,200
(They can accompany you.)

165
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,839
(Deal.)

166
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,200
(Deal.)

167
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,680
(I don't believe there is no justice.)

168
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,960
(Even if justice is truly served,)

169
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,920
(the price to pay is a ruined life.)

170
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
(Is it really worth it?)

171
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,240
(He ruined so many people.)

172
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,599
(Shouldn't he pay the price?)

173
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,839
Even if no lawyer
in the world would take my case,

174
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,319
I will never give up.

175
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,519
If I can't find justice here,
I'll go to the capital.

176
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,039
If that doesn't work,
I'll petition the Emperor.

177
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,000
(There must be a place
where the truth can be told.)

178
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,279
What happened?

179
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,279
I was wrong?

180
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,319
Tomorrow will be a busy day.

181
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:42,464
(Yanyu Tower)

182
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
Who authorized you to arrest him?

183
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,720
I saw Wu Lian kill her concubine.

184
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,160
I must take him down and await trial.

185
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,440
You made a mistake.

186
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,160
I don't get it. Please.

187
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,640
Just a concubine.

188
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,200
Any reason would do to get past it.

189
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,519
Don't you know Wu Lian?

190
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,559
If Mrs. Ning blames me,

191
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,640
how am I to explain?

192
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,200
Law applies to everyone,
no matter their status.

193
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,839
Lin Rulan is a legally
recognized concubine,

194
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,200
not a maid of the Wu family.

195
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,480
Wu Lian has no power to kill privately.
According to the law...

196
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,680
Enough.

197
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,440
You're so stubborn.

198
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,400
I won't waste my breath on you.

199
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,359
Get Officer Gao here.

200
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,519
Go.

201
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:06,208
(Ning Mansion)

202
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,480
She's dead?

203
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,240
It's not a big deal

204
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,599
that a concubine died,

205
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,400
but two officers saw it.

206
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,559
And they arrested Mr. Wu.

207
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:27,359
They saw it?
How could it be such a coincidence?

208
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,400
How come they showed up

209
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,680
in Wu Lian's house?

210
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,079
The incident happened suddenly.

211
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,119
After Prefect Chen got the news,

212
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,200
he ordered me to report to you
first thing in the morning.

213
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,480
I haven't had time to investigate yet.

214
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,559
It's doesn't matter.

215
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,039
Has the news been spread already?

216
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,000
When they brought Mr. Wu to the Yamen,

217
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,599
some people saw it.

218
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,640
It has already started to spread.

219
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,599
The envoys will arrive soon.

220
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,559
Wu Lian's Yanyu Embroidery
was handpicked by the Empress Dowager.

221
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,839
At this point,
if Wu Lian is sent to prison

222
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,599
and the news spreads out,

223
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,400
the whole court will be humiliated.

224
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,599
So, you mean...

225
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,000
Since she is already dead,
you have the final say.

226
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,599
I see.

227
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,799
I'm a little tired.

228
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,480
I won't bother you.

229
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,680
Wu Lian always causes trouble.

230
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,680
Madam, you're still covering for him?

231
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,400
Well, Lin Rulan died at the wrong time.

232
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,839
If she died another day,

233
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,400
I would make Wu Lian pay for it.

234
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,319
I can't always clean up his messes.

235
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,119
Don't be mad. It won't worth it.

236
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,200
If his embroidery satisfies Her Majesty,
his merits and demerits are offset.

237
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,240
I suddenly got this bad news.

238
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,640
It's giving me a headache.

239
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,799
I have a favor to ask.

240
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,119
Go ahead, Miss Lin.

241
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
If I need your help someday,

242
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,319
you must show up.

243
00:28:58,016 --> 00:28:59,808
(I'm in danger.
Please come quickly to Yanyu Tower.)

244
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:09,920
Move.

245
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:16,689
(Benevolence)

246
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,759
Prefect Chen, Wu Lian...

247
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,079
Stop it.

248
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,000
The case is already closed.

249
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,799
It's closed?

250
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,400
The coroner and Captain Qian
have just reported to me.

251
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,279
Lin Rulan plotted to harm Mr. Wu.

252
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,319
Mr. Wu was merely defending himself.

253
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,799
You can go now.

254
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,279
Where's the evidence?

255
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,519
We have Wu Lian's confession.

256
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,920
How can we trust his confession?

257
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,119
It's none of your business now.

258
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,119
Tomorrow, you will report
to the Yamen of Sheyang County.

259
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,200
You'll get the transfer order soon.

260
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,960
It's okay if you want to transfer me.

261
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,920
But I refuse to believe
there is no justice to be done.

262
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,680
Are you trying to give me more trouble?

263
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,519
Zhao Gang went with me that day.

264
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,880
He is a witness too.

265
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,160
I'll go find him now.

266
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,960
Come back here!

267
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,720
He's still immature.

268
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,680
I know.

269
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,640
Everyone's against me.

270
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,279
It's me.

271
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,559
Why are you here?

272
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,960
I heard you caught a cold,

273
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,640
so I came to check on you.

274
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,519
Why don't you want to see me?

275
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,519
I just want to do my job.

276
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,640
I can't get involved in other matters.

277
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,599
If that's the case,

278
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,056
why were you willing
to go with me last night?

279
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:48,736
I regretted it now.

280
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:56,880
Just tell everything you saw truthfully.

281
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,759
Last night,
Miss Lin fell from the tower.

282
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,160
You witnessed it.

283
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:19,279
It is a human life.

284
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,039
Whatever.

285
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,799
It's okay to lose it.

286
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,920
What exactly did she say in that letter?

287
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,039
Since the day
Miss Lin decided to marry Wu Lian,

288
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,680
I'm afraid she's been determined to die,

289
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,480
hoping to trade a life for a life.

290
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,480
(Have you decided to stay
and marry Wu Lian?)

291
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,799
No, I'd rather die.

292
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,559
I don't believe
you really want to marry Wu Lian.

293
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,039
Your mother told me a lot that day,

294
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,319
but that's not the real reasons

295
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
why I stayed.

296
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,599
I'm going to be married
the day after tomorrow.

297
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,200
What I feel sad about is

298
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,359
that I can't often see you.

299
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,400
If I had opened her letter earlier

300
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,920
to know she had such thoughts,

301
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,240
I would have stopped her at all costs.

302
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,359
What exactly happened that night?

303
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,720
When I arrived,
I only saw her falling from the tower.

304
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,119
But there were bruises
on Miss Lin's neck,

305
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,839
and the hairpin that killed her

306
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,039
was in Wu Lian's hand.

307
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,079
These cannot be faked.

308
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,799
Will Wu Lian be convicted?

309
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,800
Yes, but it won't be easy.

310
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:26,079
Miss Lin trusted me so much.

311
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,360
I will give it my all.

312
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,559

Prefect Chen, it's Shen Mu.

What?

What is he doing?

319
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,119

I request a retrial of Wu Lian's case.

Once the drum is beaten,
any case shall be handled.

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,840
Seeing someone appearing,

335
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,039
Wu Lian dropped the hairpin
he used to kill Lin Rulan.

336
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,639
Here's the evidence.

337
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,960
Put it aside.

338
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,719
I'm asking you.

339
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,000
Why did you go to Yanyu Tower?

340
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:28,079
Don't tell me
you can predict the future.

341
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,119
I received a letter from Lin Rulan.

342
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,199
She was worried about her life.

343
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,599
What a nonsense!

344
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,920
Yesterday was her wedding day.

345
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,599
How could her life be threatened?

346
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,320
Unless she was plotting something.

347
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,679
Maybe Wu Lian threatened her.

348
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,639
Zhao Gang went with you?

349
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,559
Yes, he is also a witness.

350
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,679
He can prove that what I said is true.

351
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,159
- Captain Qian.
- Yes.

352
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,880
Go get Zhao Gang.

353
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,760
Yes.

354
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:18,464
(Justice)

355
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,679
Zhao Gang, answer my question.

356
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,360
Yesterday, did you see

357
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,719
that Wu Lian killed Lin Rulan

358
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,000
and pushed her down the tower?

359
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,719
I...

360
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,599
You just need to tell the truth

361
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,880
about what you saw yesterday.

362
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,760
I didn't see it clearly.

363
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,400
When we arrived,

364
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,880
we only saw her falling from the tower.

365
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,719
It's a bit far away
and the tower is high,

366
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
so I didn't see it clearly.

367
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,920
In that case,

368
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,039
Wu Lian might be right.

369
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,880
Lin Rulan intended to attack him

370
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,519
and lost her own life instead.

371
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,599
Is that possible?

372
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,599
Yes.

373
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,719
Shen Mu.

374
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,760
I can't make a judgment
based on your one-sided words.

375
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,920
At this point, there's no evidence

376
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,400
to prove that Wu Lian is lying.

377
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,000
On the contrary,
Lin Rulan is suspicious.

378
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,880
But she is dead now.

379
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,239
I can't pursue it anymore.

380
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Listen, the case is closed.

381
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,039
If you have any complaints,

382
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,840
you can go to the Censorship Bureau.

383
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Prefect Chen.

384
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,119
If you go on,
you're undermining public order.

385
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,840
I can punish you. Withdraw!

386
00:39:09,187 --> 00:39:12,728
(Good Deeds Benefit All)

387
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,920
Why?

388
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,280
Did they threaten you?

389
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,039
I don't care for myself.

390
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,639
At worst, I lose this job.

391
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,079
But I have an elder brother.

392
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,840
He is the only scholar in my family.

393
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,000
He is in the capital for the exam
and is very likely to pass.

394
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,559
Captain Qian reminded me.

395
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,599
If I offended Mrs. Ning
and the Empress Dowager,

396
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,639
wouldn't I ruin my brother's future?

397
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,360
So,

398
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,800
we just watch them do as they want

399
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,119
and ignore justice?

400
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,159
Common people can't defeat officials.

401
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,280
I have some advice for you.

402
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,800
You and Lin Rulan just met a few times.

403
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,000
Why ruin your future for her?

404
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,400
Go and apologize to Prefect Chen.

405
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,719
Let it go.

(Huai'an Prison)
Seeing me coming out safely,

408
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,000
you must be disappointed.

409
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,000
Since I'm waiting here, I'm ready.

410
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,199
Whether you believe it or not,

411
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,519
I really didn't kill her.

412
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,800
Unexpectedly, she tried
to frame me with her death.

413
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,159
But she's too foolish.

414
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,440
She is not stupid but kind.

415
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,039
So she believed in justice.

416
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,199
Unfortunately, everyone let her down.

417
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,880
Don't you get it now?

418
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,559
What's the difference
between kindness and stupidity?

(Yanyu Tower)
Please show mercy.

421
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,000
Give my daughter back to us.

422
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:26,760
She married into the Wu family,

423
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,280
so she can't leave,

424

alive or dead.

425
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:35,360
I know it's a bit improper.

426
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,920
But she is our only daughter.

427
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,400
She suddenly died on her wedding day.

428
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,400
We must give her

429

a proper funeral.

430
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,639
I can't decide.

431
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,239
If I let you take her back,
Master might blame me.

432
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,360
I can't bear the responsibility.
You may go.

433

- Well.
- Please.

434

- I'm begging you.
- I'm begging you.

If you continue,

436

I don't know who let them in.

441
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,679
They behaved so impudently.

442
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,280
It's really unruly.

443
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,239
Let them take her back.

444
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,440
- But Master...
- I will explain to him.

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,119
I...

501
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,840
Mr. Wu...

502
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,599
Mother, I want to drop out.

503
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,039
Are you kidding?

504
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,760
Do you know how hard I tried
to send you to school?

505
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,000
But I don't want to go back anymore.

506
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,360
That's impossible.

507
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,320
The bracelet was

508
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,960
the only valuable thing I had.

509
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,239
When your father beat me,

510
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,679
I couldn't give it to him.

511
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760
But I sold it for you.

512
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,360
Now you want to drop out?

513
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,079
I'm telling you. Even if you die,

514
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:27,880
you have to die in the Yanyu Tower.

515
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,039
What are you standing here for? Go back.

516
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
I won't go back, Mother.

517
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,079
If someone bullies you,

518
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,039
- you must bear with it.
- I won't go back.

519
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:40,960
Don't go back home again. Go.

520
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,280
- Mother.
- Grow up. Go back.

521
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,760
Mother.

522
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,400
Hi, my name is Lin Rulan.

523
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,960
Today is my first day here.

524
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,920
What's your name?

525
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:23,960
The embroidery is beautiful.

526
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,239
Did you do it yourself?

527
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,559
This is chestnut cake.
I made it myself. It's delicious.

528
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,360
I brought a lot today

529
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:36,519
and shared it all with them.

530
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:38,159
But I saved some especially for you.

531
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,039
Have a try.

532
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,199
Is it delicious?

533
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,280
I knew it. I'm good at this.

534
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,960
If you like it, I can teach you.

535
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:18,199
Oh, you haven't told me your name yet.

536
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,280
My name is Meng Wan.

537
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Meng Wan.

538
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,199
Here, it's all yours.

539
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
I have to go.

540
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:47,136
(Tomb of Lin Rulan)

541
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,199
You asked me to live.

542
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,079
How about your life?

543
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,960
You once saved me.

544
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,920
Rest in peace.
I'll take care of the rest.
