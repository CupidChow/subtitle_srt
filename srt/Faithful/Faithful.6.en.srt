00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,039
(Xunzhou Prefecture)
Here she is.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
Lady Sanniang is coming.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,719
Sanniang.

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:19,920
Sanniang.

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,000
Sanniang, it's me.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,160
(Seven years later)

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,879
Sanniang.

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,239
Lady Sanniang, do you remember me?

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,600
Sanniang.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
Do you remember me?

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,799
Sanniang, just ignore them.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,759
Sanniang.

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,520
Sanniang, look at me.

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,600
Lady Sanniang, I'm Mr. Ge.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,719
I've been admiring you.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,280
Sanniang, I'm here to see you.

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,479
If I can see you,

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm willing to die.

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,359
You've seen me now.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,359
Why don't you die now?

21
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:32,784

(Liu Sanniang Seduces a Young Man)

23
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,802
The lotus grows
in the middle of the pond.

24
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:45,042
Its pink leaves
and green buds sway in the wind.

25
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:48,482
The emerald stalk stands tall.

26
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:50,281
(Gentle Breeze)

27
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:54,202
The pond gets fragrant
in the moonlit night.

28
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:56,762
Incredible!

29
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,522
This peacock can understand poetry.

30
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:01,001
I told you.

31
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,762
The top courtesan
of Xunzhou owns this garden.

32
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:07,082
This peacock is her treasure.

33
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,001
It's not an ordinary creature.

34
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,922
Why hasn't Lady Sanniang shown up yet?

35
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:15,161
The Zheng family invited her last night.

36
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,802
She didn't come back all night.

37
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,962
She must have served that old man well.

38
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,962
You are in high spirits.

39
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:30,161
Sanniang, you've kept me waiting.

40
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,721
You guys have something important to do?

41
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:38,322
I'll make it up to you with a drink.

42
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,522
Are you satisfied now?

43
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:44,561
Sanniang.

44
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:47,642
You're two hours late.

45
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:48,601
Well,

46
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:52,042
do you think a drink is enough?

47
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:59,161
What else do you want, Mr. Sun?

48
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,881
What are you up to tonight?

49
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:06,161
Ms. Wang from Shihua House is available.

50
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,362
How about I arrange her for you?

51
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:10,642
Sanniang.

52
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,242
I thought you were a peerless beauty.

53
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:16,281
Turns out you're vulgar.

54
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,481
May I have your name?

55
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:24,027
You were so funny.

56
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,947
You are only a courtesan.

57
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,666
You don't deserve to know my name.

58
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,746
A courtesan?

59
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:33,907
So what?

60
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,707
Men are born strong

61
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,986
and go to the battlefield
to earn merit and fame.

62
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:42,426
You can become heroes.

63
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:46,027
Women are born with good looks

64
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,986
and if we use our attractiveness,
we will be considered indecent.

65
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:52,067
It's all given by nature.

66
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,346
Who is nobler?

67
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,467
If you despise me,

68
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,267
I will disdain you too.

69
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:03,587
You...

70
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,306
Chan, see him out.

71
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:18,507
Who are you?

72
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:23,306
Do you remember me, Miss Liu?

73
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:25,267
I don't know you.

74
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:26,786
Report to the official now.

75
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:27,507
Yes.

76
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,546
Wait.

77
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,387
Seven years ago, in Huaizhou Prefecture,

78
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:34,467
there was a lady named Rulan.

79
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:38,546
Do you remember her?

80
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,226
Meng Wan.

81
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:51,707
Is she Lin Rulan's close friend?

82
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:54,067
Yes.

83
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,507
How did you know her?

84
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:01,507
That's a long story.

85
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,226
I came here today

86
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,226
to ask you a favor.

87
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:14,067
You all may leave.

88
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,027
What is it?

89
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,986
Zhao Yin just arrived here.

90
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,147
Do you know him?

91
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,306
I have never heard of him.

92
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:32,027
He's from a noble family in the capital.

93
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,707
He likes to hang out in brothels.

94
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:36,666
Everywhere he goes,

95
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:39,467
the first thing he does is
to meet the famous courtesans.

96
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:42,067
If you can win his favor,

97
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:46,106
it will bring us one step closer
to bringing down Wu Lian.

98
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:52,627
Why are all the women

99
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:56,027
in this world so foolish?

100
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,746
What do you mean by that?

101
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,546
Lin Rulan is already dead.

102
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,507
Even if you kill Wu Lian,
what good will it do?

103
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:07,707
Go ask around in Huaizhou Prefecture.

104
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:10,387
How many people still remember her?

105
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,467
You fool.

106
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,827
If you dig up the past,

107
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:20,106
it will only tarnish her reputation.

108
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,267
What's wrong with you?

109
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,267
I'm trying to be nice.

110
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:25,786
Who is a fool?

111
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,467
The one

112
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,627
who is angry now.

113
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,106
Stop.

114
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,147
I won't argue with you.

115
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:40,027
Anything else?

116
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:43,426
Meng Wan said

117
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:47,106
if you're unwilling to help,
she won't force you.

118
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,346
But she hopes
you can return to Huaizhou Prefecture.

119
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:54,147
There's something
you'll be interested in.

120
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,794
(Ning Mansion)

121
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,387
I am Hu.

122
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:07,067
I do a street fortune-telling business.

123
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:08,907
I have nothing to do

124
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,387
with that lame man.

125
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,728
Well,

126
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,507
did he buy banner from you?

127
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:19,546
Yes, he also bought my copper bell

128
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,707
and divination compass.

129
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,666
Did he mention

130
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,186
what he wanted to do with these items?

131
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,426
He didn't.

132
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:37,627
Alright, take him away.

133
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:38,946
Yes.

134
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:48,987
Madam, you heard him.

135
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,306
That lame man is a cheater.

136
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,186
I bet someone tried
to sow discord between us.

137
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,786
You must not believe him.

138
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,147
Mr. Wu.

139
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,387
You're so omnipotent.

140
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:06,107
Whoever comes to my mansion,

141
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,227
and whatever they have said,

142
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,627
you know it all.

143
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:10,147
I...

144
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,387
Alright, you may leave.

145
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,066
We'll not talk about this for now.

146
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:18,027
Are you satisfied about the sample
for the Her Majesty's birthday?

147
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,706
Just put it aside.

148
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,387
I need time to think about it.

149
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:27,747
Madam, you still don't trust me?

150
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,747
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to go back.

151
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:53,306
It's mainly embroidered in a fine way.

152
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:57,826
It includes mallow, daylily,
cereus, and other flowers.

153
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,826
Too flashy and petty.

154
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,066
This is a pair of mandarin ducks.

155
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:10,507
A pair of mandarin ducks perch

156
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:12,466
on the shore.

157
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:13,546
It's meaningful.

158
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:16,426
This is for a birthday, not a wedding.

159
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:17,747
It's inappropriate.

160
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,426
What about this one?

161
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:25,747
It seems both solid and void.

162
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:31,347
Where did this come from?

163
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:34,347
It's from the Huangji Embroidery House.

164
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,786
It's peculiar and unheard of.

165
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,147
Are you unsatisfied?

166
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:45,306
They really can't be compared
to Wu Lian's Yanyu Embroidery.

167
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:46,586
Well...

168
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,267
What?

169
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,786
I misspoke last time.

170
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,546
I dare not contradict you.

171
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:58,747
Forget it.

172
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:02,546
I'll check out Wu Lian's samples.

173
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:05,466
Madame Xu.

174
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,466
You accompany me to the Yanyu Tower.

175
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:11,347
Yes.

176
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,130
(Yanyu Tower)

177
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:27,426
Greetings.

178
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,586
I will immediately invite Mr. Wu over.

179
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,002
(Yanyu Tower)

180
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,546
Wan, come on.

181
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:43,387
Slow down.

182
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,666
Where are we going?

183
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,706
A new girl has just arrived.

184
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,186
She is begging to return.

185
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:50,306
It's funny.

186
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,186
Walk slowly.

187
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,627
Get up, or we'll be scolded.

188
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:08,907
Wan, look.

189
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,227
That cloud looks like a little rabbit.

190
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:16,507
Yes.

191
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,466
Look at that one.

192
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:22,267
It looks like a rabbit, right?

193
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,507
What can I do for you?

194
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:47,186
Show me

195
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,186
your embroidery samples again.

196
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,267
Sure, please follow me, Madam.

197
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,306
What do you think?

198
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,147
Mr. Wu is renowned,

199
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:07,747
and his skill is unquestionable.

200
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,306
It is truly unique.

201
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,546
This must be Madame Xu.

202
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,387
I heard about Mr. Wu

203
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,267
from Manshu in Qizhou.

204
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:20,747
When I see you today,

205
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,306
I think you deserve your reputation.

206
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,147
Madame Xu,

207
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,186
you flatter me.

208
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:30,227
In three more months,

209
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,147
it will be
the Her Majesty's 70th birthday.

210
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:36,107
Many gifts are almost ready.

211
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,546
So, in the coming days,

212
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,946
you will have to work hard.

213
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:45,306
It is my honor to be able to help.

214
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,107
Mr. Wu.

215
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,227
There was once an embroideress here

216
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:12,466
named Meng Wan.

217
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:13,946
Do you still remember?

218
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:18,706
There are dozens of embroideresses
studying here every year.

219
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,387
I can't remember.

220
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:25,907
She is from Huaizhou.

221
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:30,706
But I can't remember

222
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,546
her exact background.

223
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:38,066
You find out where she is now.

224
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,066
Yes.

225
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,267
I have long heard of you.

226
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:06,306
To be honest,

227
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:09,267
you do look amazing.

228
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:14,867
I have seen you once.

229
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:16,946
When?

230
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,107
Seven years ago.

231
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:21,227
After Yamen held court
for the Rulan Case,

232
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,747
I went to the pharmacy
to bid her farewell.

233
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,546
I saw you
at the back door of the pharmacy.

234
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,186
She drove you out.

235
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,027
You seemed lost.

236
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:30,987
You and I are the same.

237
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,867
There are people
who wanted to protect us,

238
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,227
but they had to bear a lot for us.

239
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,027
What do you mean by that?

240
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:44,586
Seven years have passed in a flash.

241
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:47,666
How have you been these years?

242
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:48,946
After I let go

243
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:51,826
of some things,

244
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:54,507
I live more freely.

245
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,666
It seems that you have already decided

246
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,946
not to get involved in this matter.

247
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:01,666
Madame Xu, I know

248
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,907
you want to seek justice
for your friend.

249
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,027
But have you ever thought

250
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,666
if there is anything in this world

251
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:12,984
that makes us insulted,

252
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:14,907
and that we cannot abandon,

253
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,466
it must not be a good thing.

254
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,666
You and I are both women.

255
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,466
I sincerely advise you.

256
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:24,267
Let it go.

257
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,227
Stop getting caught up in the past.

258
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,546
Let me tell you

259
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:32,387
another old story I have heard recently.

260
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:34,147
Seven years ago,

261
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,027
a prestigious man in Huaizhou Prefecture

262
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,786
kept a geisha.

263
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:43,066
This geisha offended the powerful

264
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:44,867
and fled overnight.

265
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:46,627
Not long after,

266
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,066
the man suffered a disaster.

267
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:53,466
I don't know what torment he suffered.

268
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,466
Not only did all his wealth
go up in smoke,

269
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:00,507
but he became insane.

270
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,226
He has been living
on the streets for seven years.

271
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:07,466
I often help him.

272
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,706
He is so down and out,

273
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,827
but he is unwilling to be settled.

274
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:16,827
Now,

275
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:21,307
I'm afraid only you can persuade him.

276
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:22,907
Sir, give me a bun, please.

277
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:24,347
I'll exchange it with something.

278
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,387
Get away from me.

279
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,907
Get away, beggar, or I'll kick you.

280
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:27,827
I have something else.

281
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:29,347
That's a good thing from Persia.

282
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,746
Come with me.

283
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,347
Give me a bun, please.

284
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:33,426
Get away from me.

285
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,186
Give me a bun.

286
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,587
- Get away from me.
- Give me a bun.

287
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,226
Get away, beggar.

288
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:40,387
- Give me a bun.
- Here you are. Go away.

289
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:42,587
Leave me alone.

290
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:43,666
Bad luck.

291
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,147
Master.

292
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,466
Sanniang.

293
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,547
Sanniang.

294
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:07,067
Sanniang, are you hungry too?

295
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,986
Here you go. It's yours.

296
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:15,986
- Sanniang.
- I'm sorry.

297
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,547
Don't cry, Sanniang.

298
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,787
- Don't cry, Sanniang.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,787
- Sanniang.
- I'm sorry.

300
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,547
Did someone bully you?

301
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,067
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,387
Don't cry, Sanniang.

303
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:31,107
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:32,547
Sanniang.

305
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,266
Sanniang, let's go home.

306
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:38,547
I'll hire the best opera troupe for you.

307
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,746
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:41,827
Don't cry, Sanniang.

309
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,907
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:46,867
Alright, Sanniang.

311
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,907
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,107
Sanniang.

313
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,787
I just want
to seek justice for my close friend.

314
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,067
Would you be willing to do it with me?

315
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:26,866
(Gentle Breeze)

316
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,587
Such a beautiful peacock.

317
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,746
Sanniang, shall we buy one
and take it home?

318
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:36,627
Hey.

319
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,226
You've met Madame Xu.

320
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,466
How did it go?

321
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,186
I'm asking you.

322
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,547
If you really don't want to help,

323
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,266
let's not waste each other's time.

324
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:50,466
I'll go back to Huaizhou Prefecture

325
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,587
and plan how to infiltrate Yanyu Tower.

326
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:53,907
I can handle Wu Lian...

327
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:58,026
I bought this peacock from Shihua House.

328
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,587
After I escaped from Huaizhou Prefecture

329
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:03,466
and entered Shihua House,

330
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,907
I saw it at first sight.

331
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,827
It was kept in a cage,

332
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,266
hung high in the hall,

333
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:17,426
for people to tease and enjoy.

334
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,147
When guests were happy,

335
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,307
they would reward it with some food.

336
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:23,226
When they weren't,

337
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,547
they would throw stuff at it.

338
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,186
Some would even spit at it.

339
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:32,547
I seemed to see myself

340
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:36,627
in that cage.

341
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:40,387
From that day on,

342
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,147
I swear

343
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:43,706
I won't care

344
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,107
about how others see me anymore.

345
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,107
I need to survive.

346
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,107
I need to have money.

347
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:52,387
I want to be the top courtesan
in Xunzhou Prefecture.

348
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,867
Finally, I got what I wanted

349
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,466
and made enough money,

350
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,506
so I bought this peacock

351
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,946
and opened this Peacock Garden.

352
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:04,827
I thought

353
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:08,787
I had completely gotten rid of the past.

354
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:14,587
I even advised Meng Wan

355
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:18,387
to let go of the past.

356
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:21,026
Now I think about it.

357
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,627
It's easier said than done.

358
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:26,907
I thought

359
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,506
the person I cherished

360
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:34,026
was not hurt.

361
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:37,426
How ridiculous.

362
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:40,746
I'm so silly.

363
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:46,186
Anyway,

364
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:48,266
the Rulan Case

365
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:51,107
changed the way we live.

366
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:53,666
Madame Xu and I

367
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,587
both embarked on a road of no return.

368
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,387
Zhao Yin is in Xunzhou Prefecture.

369
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,666
I have found out about his whereabouts.

370
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,266
So,

371
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:09,907
you are going to help.

372
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,147
At this point,

373
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,067
I will help you this time.

374
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,067
As the old saying goes,

375
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:21,107
beauty is heartless,

376
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:25,067
but you're not a cold woman.

377
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:26,827
If you can't say nice things,

378
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:29,067
shut your mouth up.

379
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,147
Sanniang, look.

380
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,514
(Shihua House)

381
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:40,147
I'm coming.

382
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:44,226
Sir, I'm here.

383
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:45,506
Come here.

384
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,387
Naughty.

385
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:48,547
- Come on.
- Naughty.

386
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:49,347
Come and catch me.

387
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,746
Master, I'm here.

388
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,186
I'm standing here.

389
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,426
Here I come, beauty.

390
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:00,547
You cheated. It doesn't count.

391
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,466
(Zhao Yin, Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau Supervisor)
Okay.

392
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:04,746
I cheated, so you punish me with a kiss.

393
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,466
Do you like it?

394
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,587
Ms. Wang.

395
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:31,547
I'm coming.

396
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:32,907
Enjoy yourself.

397
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:36,986
Hurry up.

398
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:38,107
What happened?

399
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:39,587
Didn't you have fun today?

400
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:40,426
Ms. Wang.

401
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,107
You're dishonest.

402
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:44,466
No matter how much it costs,

403
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:47,266
you bring me
the most beautiful girl here.

404
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,627
But you're hiding such a gorgeous girl.

405
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,026
Let me explain.

406
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,186
The girl downstairs

407
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:56,787
is the top courtesan of Xunzhou.

408
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:58,506
She redeemed herself long ago

409
00:23:58,787 --> 00:23:59,986
and opened her own garden.

410
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:01,867
Her Peacock Garden

411
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,587
only serves one table of guests a day.

412
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,147
If you want to make a reservation now,

413
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:10,026
I'm afraid you'll have to wait
until the end of the year.

414
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:11,946
Top courtesan?

415
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:18,147
She is Liu Sanniang?

416
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:19,547
Right.

417
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:20,867
You've heard of her?

418
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,026
Of course.

419
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:25,706
If she's so busy,

420
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,827
why is she playing the zither here?

421
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,107
That's because of me.

422
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:35,347
She comes back to perform

423
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:36,666
to attract customers.

424
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:40,067
Ms. Wang.

425
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:42,666
You do me a favor,

426
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:43,867
and help jump the line.

427
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:47,347
Tonight, I want to meet her.

428
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:50,827
Well...

429
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:52,706
Ms. Wang.

430
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,506
Ms. Wang.

431
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,666
Alright.

432
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,706
I'll try,

433
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:05,186
but I can't promise I can do it.

434
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,466
Hurry up.

435
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:07,946
Okay.

436
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,026
Sanniang,

437
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:38,226
Move.

438
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:41,827
Ms. Wang.

439
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:42,986
Why did she leave?

440
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:44,186
Can I meet her tonight?

441
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,907
I'm really sorry.

442
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,746
She is proud and expensive.

443
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:54,506
Ordinary people can't afford her.

444
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:59,186
I don't think I can take your money.

445
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:01,547
What do you mean by that?

446
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:03,147
Am I an ordinary person?

447
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:05,266
Who can be richer than me

448
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:07,627
in Xunzhou Prefecture?

449
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:11,186
Don't get angry.

450
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:14,266
I'll think of a way.

451
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:15,186
What is it?

452
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,226
Her Peacock Garden

453
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,466
hosts a banquet every year.

454
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,666
(It happens to be tonight
for this year.)

455
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:27,426
(The nobles in Xunzhou Prefecture)

456
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,186
(will gather together.)

457
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:34,266
(Sanniang will play the zither)

458
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:36,067
(and invite guests to play with her.)

459
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:38,587
(If you can do it with her)

460
00:26:38,787 --> 00:26:39,986
(and win the applause,)

461
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:41,986
(then Lady Sanniang...)

462
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,547
Get out of here.

463
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:44,907
(will be yours.)

464
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:49,347
Sanniang, please.

465
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:15,706
Sanniang, your fish is on the hook.

466
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,026
Thank you.

467
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:22,026
You promised me.

468
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,387
I'll help you with this,

469
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:27,186
and you perform here once a month.

470
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:29,867
Rest assured.

471
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:32,587
I will keep my word.

472
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:40,627
Good.

473
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:02,946
When ordinary courtesans play music
and dance,

474
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:05,746
most of them are pretentious.

475
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,587
But your dance has a mixture
of firmness and tenderness

476
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,706
Very impressive.

477
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,627
If it looks vulgar,

478
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,026
how could I stand out

479
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:17,946
and become the top courtesan?

480
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:22,466
Brilliant.

481
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:26,147
Where did you

482
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,226
learn this skill?

483
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,226
A kind-hearted man took me in,

484
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,226
and I became a geisha.

485
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,426
He taught me.

486
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:41,026
Did he teach you some other skills?

487
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,186
Poetry, chess, calligraphy and painting,

488
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:50,387
I've learned a bit of each.

489
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:54,627
Would you be interested

490
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:57,867
in making a poem with me?

491
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,067
I'm not a scholar.

492
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,867
Why don't we do some serious stuff?

493
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:08,867
What do you mean by that?

494
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,666
I only drink with you.

495
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:12,226
What are you doing?

496
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,426
I didn't give you enough money, right?

497
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,787
The more money, the better.

498
00:29:20,147 --> 00:29:23,706
I'm afraid that you can't afford it.

499
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,706
I don't believe it.

500
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:30,787
Name your price.

501
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:34,107
Ganoderma,

502
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:35,226
western saffron,

503
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:36,867
Bozhou cordyceps,

504
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,067
Suhe Musk,

505
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:44,986
and a hundred-year-old wild ginseng.

506
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:46,186
What is that?

507
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:48,186
Are you going to open a pharmacy?

508
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:52,506
This is the prescription for my brother.

509
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:56,026
He needs to take it daily.

510
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,266
Can you afford it?

511
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:00,827
If your brother eats this every day,

512
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:02,426
doesn't he have nosebleeds?

513
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:07,867
I have a tough life.

514
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:10,787
I lost my parents at a young age,

515
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,466
and my brother is seriously ill.

516
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:19,787
He's been relying
on these rare medicinal herbs.

517
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:23,907
I've been supporting him for years,

518
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,547
but it's beyond my means.

519
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:30,706
If you can

520
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:33,107
save my brother's life,

521
00:30:33,746 --> 00:30:37,347
I will marry you as a concubine.

522
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:41,946
Are you serious?

523
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:43,387
Yes, I am.

524
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:45,867
Okay, you come
with me back to the capital.

525
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:48,107
I'll buy you a house, land,
and treat your brother.

526
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,787
I promise you'll have a good life.

527
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:53,026
Mr. Zhao.

528
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:55,587
You don't need to brag.

529
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:57,226
Who is bragging?

530
00:30:57,506 --> 00:30:59,706
Do you know who I am?

531
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:02,147
Who can you be?

532
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:07,226
You're nothing more than a wealthy man.

533
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:08,787
Not to mention my family background,

534
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,907
I'm the Supervisor
of the Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau,

535
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:13,387
in charge of overseas trade.

536
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,547
If our local silk and treasures need

537
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:17,547
to be shipped overseas to sell,

538
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:20,186
every time a cargo ship leaves the port,

539
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:22,986
they have to get
one official warrant from me.

540
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:26,827
Do you know what this means?

541
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,026
Zhao Yin is the Supervisor
of the Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau.

542
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:33,466
He's in charge of maritime trade.

543
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,746
Yet he has secretly colluded
with Wu Lian,

544
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:38,347
taking a large amount of embroidery
from the Yanyu Tower.

545
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:39,827
With just one official warrant,

546
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:42,186
three cargo ships
can be shipped overseas.

547
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:44,946
They have faked the merchandise list
and evaded tax,

548
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,587
profiting immensely from it.

549
00:31:49,147 --> 00:31:51,867
So, the reason why Wu Lian
can stand firm all these years

550
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,706
is not only
that Mrs. Ning is behind him.

551
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,147
He also has benefits from Zhao Yin.

552
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:02,627
Supervisor of the Foreign Trade Bureau?

553
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,466
I seem to have heard of it.

554
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:06,986
You should know

555
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:08,946
I have enough wealth

556
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,706
to cure your sick brother.

557
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:18,026
I can help you
no matter how many sick brothers

558
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:22,387
you have.

559
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:26,787
Mr. Zhao, don't blame me
for being suspicious.

560
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,107
To be honest,

561
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:34,706
I've seen too many heartless men
like you.

562
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,666
They never kept their promises.

563
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:39,266
You tell me what to do.

564
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:44,587
Aren't you in charge of silk treasures?

565
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:52,026
Do you know
about Mr. Wu's Yanyu Embroidery?

566
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:53,627
Of course I do.

567
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:56,307
Wu Lian and I are old acquaintances.

568
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:57,426
Why bring him up?

569
00:32:57,746 --> 00:33:01,226
If you can get me Yanyu Embroidery,

570
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:02,706
I'll believe you.

571
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:05,986
Okay, I'll set off tomorrow.

572
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:08,387
Take the waterway
to Huaizhou to meet Wu Lian.

573
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,426
You go with me.

574
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:13,506
I'll let him give you ten pieces.

575
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:15,986
What will you
go to Huaizhou Prefecture for?

576
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:18,147
I do business.

577
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,107
What kind of business?

578
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:23,946
Why do you want to know?

579
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,347
I'm afraid when you sober up tomorrow,

580
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:32,426
you'll regret bragging today.

581
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:35,307
No, let's...

582
00:33:36,907 --> 00:33:39,466
Mr. Zhao, you're drunk.

583
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:41,746
Go back and rest early.

584
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:43,627
I'll see you tomorrow.

585
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:48,186
You...

586
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,307
He has business in Huaizhou Prefecture?

587
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:55,226
Is he going to smuggle embroidery
with Wu Lian again?

588
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:56,666
Chances are high.

589
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:58,266
I really didn't expect

590
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,666
that he would set off
for Huaizhou early tomorrow.

591
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:04,706
He has now agreed
to let us accompany him.

592
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:07,506
You quickly notify Meng Wan

593
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:08,626
and let her prepare early.

594
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:10,546
How can I make it?

595
00:34:10,986 --> 00:34:13,707
The fastest way
from Huaizhou to Xunzhou is by water.

596
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:16,546
Am I supposed to fly over
to deliver the message?

597
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,747
If we could catch him
in the act at the dock,

598
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:22,347
that would be best.

599
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:25,347
You should think about another thing.

600
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:27,986
If you get on the ship and meet Wu Lian,

601
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:30,387
and he sees through your identity,

602
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:31,907
what will you do?

603
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,907
Even if I see him,
it will be at Huaizhou dock.

604
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,267
I'll try to avoid him.

605
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:41,747
Well,

606
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:44,546
although Huaizhou
and Xunzhou are neighboring,

607
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,946
it takes at least a day
and night by water.

608
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:52,827
On this journey,
Zhao Yin will flirt with you.

609
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:56,586
Do you care about that?

610
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:03,146
Of course.

611
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,626
Madame Xu and I uphold justice.

612
00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:09,307
How can we make
a living person get insulted

613
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:11,387
for a deceased person's chastity?

614
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:14,867
I am a prostitute.

615
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:18,986
That's different.

616
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,466
How so?

617
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:32,026
No worries. Aren't you there?

618
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,787
Sanniang.

619
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:53,387
You're really beautiful.

620
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:04,747
Why are you staring at me?

621
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:09,227
Mr. Zhao, you're such a handsome man.

622
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,026
I can't help but look at you.

623
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:12,867
Please forgive me.

624
00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:23,586
Sanniang, what do you want
to eat tonight?

625
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:27,626
Brother, what's wrong with you?

626
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:30,707
Brother.

627
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:31,787
It's okay.

628
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:35,747
I'm not feeling well.

629
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:41,546
Sanniang, is his illness contagious?

630
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:44,347
Hard to say.

631
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:46,827
Brother.

632
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:48,907
Brother, if you're not feeling well,

633
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:50,747
you should go out for some air.

634
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:54,267
Mr. Zhao, it's windy outside.

635
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:57,707
My body is weak, and I can't stand it.

636
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,946
Fine, you sit here.

637
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:02,747
I'll go out.

638
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,307
The two of you do as you please.

639
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:07,267
Thank you.

640
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:11,747
By the way, Sanniang,

641
00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:13,907
we should reach Huaizhou
by midnight today.

642
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,026
We won't get off.

643
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,187
You told the cooks
to prepare some wine and food.

644
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:20,066
I want to host Wu Lian on the ship.

645
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:21,466
I see.

646
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,546
Brother.

647
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:39,106
He doesn't get off the ship.

648
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,747
He's going to load the goods and leave.

649
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:43,907
Once we reach Huaizhou dock,

650
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:46,026
we will find out
about the smuggled goods.

651
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,946
Then I'll find a way to stall them.

652
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,546
You go inform Meng Wan.

653
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,227
When Wu Lian gets on the ship,

654
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:55,387
you try to avoid him

655
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:56,667
in case of causing troubles.

656
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,626
Don't worry. I'll play it by ear.

657
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:03,867
Tonight, we must catch them both.

658
00:38:41,426 --> 00:38:43,747
Mr. Wu, how have you been?

659
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:45,586
I'm fine, Mr. Zhao.

660
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,227
Please.

661
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,267
How's the situation in Minzhou now?

662
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:06,426
It's rare to see each other.

663
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:08,187
Let's have a good drink.

664
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,747
Don't worry about anything.

665
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:10,707
Come on.

666
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,506
Have you dealt with the people
in the capital?

667
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:22,267
Don't worry, okay?

668
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,307
I have the official warrant.

669
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:26,347
The official seal is also in my hand.

670
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,626
Stamping seals, and releasing ships,

671
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:30,307
isn't it all up to me?

672
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:33,146
You better keep it clean.

673
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,106
Don't cause any trouble.

674
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:37,066
Well,

675
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:40,827
I'm not as clean as the girls
in Yanyu Tower.

676
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:43,227
By the way,

677
00:39:43,586 --> 00:39:46,506
I have a gorgeous woman on my ship.

678
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:49,026
I'll let you meet her today.

679
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,986
- Somebody.
- Yes.

680
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:53,546
Master.

681
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:55,026
Call for the top courtesan.

682
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,066
Yes.

683
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:00,387
Mr. Wu.

684
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:10,506
I've heard of the top courtesan
from Minzhou,

685
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:11,907
but I've never seen her.

686
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:14,707
Anyway, I don't understand.

687
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,586
I love charming women.

688
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,827
I don't know

689
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,667
why you like the girls in your place.

690
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:26,227
She is just a prostitute,

691
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,946
crowned with the name
of the top courtesan.

692
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,307
What difference does it make?

693
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,146
Alright.

694
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,187
We have different taste.

695
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:41,307
Sanniang is not a regular prostitute.

696
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:42,907
Sanniang?

697
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:45,347
Xunzhou's top courtesan, Liu Sanniang.

698
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:47,146
You've heard of her too?

699
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:49,546
How did you know her?

700
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:50,787
Don't mention it.

701
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:52,347
She has an annoying brother.

702
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:53,946
A lame older brother.

703
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,426
I hate him.

704
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,426
He's making it impossible for me
to make a move on Sanniang.

705
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:01,586
A lame older brother?

706
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:04,986
Are you interested in him?

707
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:19,667
Is this embroidery from the Yanyu Tower?

708
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:23,907
Master.

709
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:26,787
Miss Liu went down to the cabin.

710
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,146
Why did she do that?

711
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:29,747
Catch her.

712
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:31,466
Catch who?

713
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,867
Do it now.

714
00:41:33,146 --> 00:41:34,106
There's a trick.

715
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,347
It can't be wrong.

716
00:41:35,986 --> 00:41:37,267
You deliver the message to Meng Wan.

717
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:39,146
I'll stay on the ship.

718
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:43,146
What's going on?

719
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,506
Let's get out of here.

720
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:49,387
Stop!

721
00:41:57,626 --> 00:41:59,667
Wu Lian, take a look.

722
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:01,267
Are you sure about this?

723
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,187
This is Sanniang you mentioned.

724
00:42:05,986 --> 00:42:07,227
You know her too?

725
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,187
My Yanyu Tower once had an embroideress

726
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:14,506
named Liu Sannv.

727
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:18,146
She looks a bit similar to Sanniang.

728
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:21,387
Sanniang, have you ever heard of her?

729
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:24,667
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

730
00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:28,946
I never had the honor
to study at Yanyu Tower.

731
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:33,747
Mr. Liu, you've crippled one leg.

732
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:36,586
Do you want to cripple the other one?

733
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,187
Who is Mr. Liu?

734
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:40,907
If you have a grudge
against a lame person,

735
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:43,586
I'm afraid
all the lame people in the world

736
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:45,426
will be your enemies.

737
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,106
Enough.

738
00:42:47,946 --> 00:42:49,267
Go get them.

739
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:52,787
What kind of feud do you have with them?

740
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:54,267
Catch them first.

741
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:55,707
I'll explain it to you later.

742
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:56,946
Mr. Zhao,

743
00:42:57,227 --> 00:42:59,267
my brother
and I entrusted our lives to you.

744
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:01,227
How can you do this to us?

745
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:02,146
I...

746
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:09,267
Catch them.

747
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:18,227
Where did these robbers come from?

748
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,586
How dare you rob my ship?

749
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:22,907
If we were robbers,

750
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,667
we naturally wouldn't dare
to board your cargo ship.

751
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:27,867
You know me?

752
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:30,667
Zhao Yin,
Minzhou Foreign Trade Bureau Supervisor,

753
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:32,546
and Wu Lian from Yanyu Tower.

754
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:35,066
You two are smuggling
and caught in the act.

755
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,827
Send them
to the capital for investigation.

756
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:38,506
You bunch of robbers.

757
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:39,867
How dare you slander me?

758
00:43:40,146 --> 00:43:41,387
Do you dare

759
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:42,867
to reveal your face?

760
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:45,227
Why not?

761
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:52,472
