(Seven years ago)

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,480
May Buddha bless him.

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,000
May he pass
the provincial examination this autumn.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
Is Mr. Wu really going
to marry Lin Rulan?

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,119
Wouldn't that be too good for her?

7
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,679
If I were her,

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,799
I would have committed suicide.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,679
She is no ordinary woman.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,960
We can't compare to her.

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,759
You're right.

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,039
We have our own pride.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,960
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

14
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,439
Xiaoling, come here.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,280
Do you think Lin Rulan will come here

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,320
after she gets married?

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,359
We don't want
to practice with her again.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,240
Neither do I.

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,119
Mencius once said,

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,159
"Speaking ill of others

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,600
will bring bad consequences."

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,159
We should not gossip
about others' affairs.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,040
Her sense of superiority

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,480
makes her really off-putting.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Right.

29
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,080
I've got a reply from your aunt.

30
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,639
She asked me to send a betrothal letter.

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
This means it's settled.

32
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,039
I've said I won't marry.

33
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,560
It is not up to you to decide.

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Do you know
what kind of person Zhao Yucheng is?

35
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
He's a complete villain.

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,759
I only know that once you marry him,

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
you will live a rich life.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,520
So you thought the same

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,319
when you married my father, right?

40
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,120
If you want me
to turn his house upside down

41
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,960
and make them regret it,

42
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,560
you can go ahead.

43
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,120
But I'm afraid by then,
you will have lost

44
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
any relationship you have
with the Zhao family.

45
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,639
Learning embroidery made you think

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,520
you are something special?

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
How can you not get married?

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,400
Do you really think
you can run away from home

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,599
and wander around the world?

50
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,879
Now even Lin Rulan can marry

51
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,319
into the Wu family.

52
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,240
But look at yourself.

53
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,759
Why do you always let me worry?

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
How did you know?

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,879
You pretended to be sick
to get me out yesterday?

56
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,600
Right, so what?

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
Who am I doing all this for?

58
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,839
I even humbled myself for you.

59
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,199
What else do you want?

60
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,480
No wonder she suddenly
changed her mind yesterday.

61
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,120
What are you going to do?

62
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,399
It's not that I'm stopping you.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,399
Rulan said she'd like to be alone

64
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,639
and didn't want to see anyone.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,000
Mrs. Lin, I really have
something to say to her.

66
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,959
I know you mean well.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,519
But Rulan will be married

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
in a few days.

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,319
It's useless to say anything else.

70
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,759
You should go back.

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,079
Are you really going to just let

72
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,680
Rulan marry into the Wu family?

73
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,480
Miss Meng,

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,199
what exactly do you want to say?

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,120
You've watched Rulan grow up.

76
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,480
You know her better than I do.

77
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,480
Do you really believe
she's slandering Wu Lian?

78
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,720
If she's not,

79
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,399
and marries him later,

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,199
how will she cope with him later on?

81
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,920
But my parents said

82
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,160
given her current situation,

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,399
this might be the best outcome.

84
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
What is good outcome?

85
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,759
It's not easy for a woman.

86
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,439
If she marries the wrong person,

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
she'll have no hope for a lifetime.

88
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,600
Besides, with her character,

89
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,959
how many years can she
hold out in the Wu family?

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
I've said before,

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,600
if she doesn't want to marry,

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,399
I'll take care of her for a lifetime.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,839
Miss Meng,

94
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,399
what do you want me to do?

95
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,920
If you return the betrothal gifts,

96
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,399
the Wu family can't
force her to marry, right?

97
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm just afraid
I can't convince my father.

98
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,079
I believe your parents truly love Rulan.

99
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,319
Give it a try.

100
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll think of other ways too.

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,240
Okay.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,079
How did you get in?

103
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,279
I spent so much time
in this tower before.

104
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,759
Of course I could

105
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,399
find a way.

106
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,279
I thought you would
never come here again.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,839
I know

108
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,360
you were with Ding Ru
in the night she died.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,399
I saw your jade pendant

110
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,920
by the well the next morning.

111
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,120
Ding Ru jumped into the well herself.

112
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,439
She may indeed have suicidal thoughts,

113
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,040
so she left the handkerchief.

114
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,720
But as to what really happened
that night,

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,519
it's hard to say, isn't it?

116
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,319
It's a pity dead people can't talk.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,720
And the jade pendant is still with me.

118
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Yes, I was one step late,

119
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,560
so you picked up the pendant.

120
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,319
But if I go beat the drum now

121
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,199
and tell Prefect Chen

122
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,639
I saw you arguing

123
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,759
with Ding Ru by the well

124
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,040
and deliberately pushing her
into the well.

125
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,720
Are you threatening me?

126
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,519
If another death occurs

127
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
in Yanyu Tower at this moment,

128
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm afraid it won't be so easy
to blindfold the people.

129
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,040
You want me to cancel the marriage?

130
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,360
It's not impossible.

131
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,840
Lin Rulan learned embroidery here,

132
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,720
but now she's ruined its reputation.

133
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,679
Shouldn't she give back

134
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,720
everything she learned?

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
How can she do it?

136
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,559
Just by damaging her fingers

137
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,799
for embroidering.

138
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,720
You can go back and tell her that.

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,759
I've paid for her.

140
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,320
You're really mad.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,559
I hope you will keep your promise,

142
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,600
otherwise, things could
get really ugly between us.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
Go and tell Lin Rulan

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,679
to be smart.

145
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,919
We will send back
the betrothal gifts soon.

146
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,360
Do you really want to let Master

147
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,320
marry Miss Lin?

148
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,480
The day he proposed marriage to you,

149
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,000
he personally promised
he would never take a concubine.

150
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,120
No woman

151
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,399
would want to let her husband

152
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
do it.

153
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,720
But to put it bluntly,

154
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm the one who failed him.

155
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,480
I feel a little guilty.

156
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Miss Lin said she would rather die

157
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,559
than marry Mr. Wu at the court.

158
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,000
She's forced to do so now.

159
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm afraid something bad
may happen in the future.

160
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,279
I really don't understand

161
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,320
why Miss Lin doesn't want to.

162
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
Even though it's being a concubine,

163
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,960
it's something
many people can't ask for.

164
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,799
Those young ladies in the school

165
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,720
all look at my husband

166
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,840
with adoration.

167
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,879
She's different after all.

168
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,639
Over these years,
you've dealt with several ones.

169
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,039
Just like Ding Ru.

170
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
She's a pitiful person.

171
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,759
Thank you, Mother.

172
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
It looks so good.

173
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's a pity

174
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,320
that I'm not qualified to wear it.

175
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,039
Mother,

176
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,919
I want to go to the Yanyu Tower.

177
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,879
I left in a hurry last time

178
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,960
and left many things there.

179
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,960
You're going to be married soon.

180
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,360
You can take them then.

181
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,279
After I'm married,
my status is different.

182
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,720
Without Mrs. Wu's permission,

183
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,600
I can't move around freely.

184
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,000
Besides, those are my private things.

185
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,720
My role will change once I marry Mr. Wu.

186
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,559
Things will be different.

187
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,080
Your brother can pick them up for you.

188
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,960
There are all ladies there.

189
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,679
I don't think it's fit.

190
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,519
If you still worry,

191
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,320
let my brother accompany me there.

192
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,802
Okay.

193
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,426
Make it quick.

194
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,666
Without Master's permission,

195
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,066
I can't let you in.

196
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,546
I came to get my own things.

197
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,625
Why can't I come in?

198
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:20,705
- Rulan.
- You just can't.

199
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:22,946
Rulan.

200
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:27,906
Let her in.

201
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,146
Yes, Madam.

202
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,666
But there are a lot of ladies inside.

203
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,546
Mr. Lin, you'd better wait outside.

204
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:41,026
I'll be back soon.

205
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,666
It's good if you can understand this.

206
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,306
Life always goes on.

207
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,306
Madam, do you have nightmares at night?

208
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,465
I often dream of Ding Ru.

209
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,625
Madam,

210
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,345
did you say the same thing
to her back then?

211
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,625
Why is she here?

212
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:37,906
She's not really going
to come back, is she?

213
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,186
She can't be that shameless, right?

214
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:41,745
Who doesn't know about her?

215
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,666
If she stays here,

216
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,345
won't that ruin our reputation?

217
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:46,225
Exactly.

218
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:48,266
How could anyone be let in?

219
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,946
This is your room. Come in.

I can't accept this.

237
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,786
You look good with it.

238
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,345
I really like it.

239
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,905
Among all the embroideresses here,

240
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:47,665
you were best
at embroidering pear flowers.

241
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,585
I always wanted to copy the essence,

242
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,105
but I just couldn't.

243
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,625
But it doesn't matter now.

244
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,986
Neither of us can
accept the fate, right?

245
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,145
On the wedding day,

246
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,585
it'll be all over.

247
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:37,625
I remember you.

248
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,026
You are the one

249
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,585
who moved into Ding Ru's room.

250
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,585
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

251
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,826
Just consider
I've never been here before.

252
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,145
Ding Ru was dead.

253
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,403
Everyone in this house

254
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,363
is afraid to go near her yard.

255
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:57,682
You live in her room.

256
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,163
Aren't you afraid?

257
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,282
There is no ghost in the world.

258
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:03,522
What is there to fear?

259
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:07,242
That's true.

260
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,603
A person is far more frightening.

261
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:14,482
I know you won't believe me now.

262
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,403
But since I've met you,

263
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,163
I'll give you a word of caution.

264
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,123
Think about Ding Ru and me.

265
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,883
Why do you have to take
such a risk by staying here?

266
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:26,803
There is not only one embroidery school.

267
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:28,722
You're new here.

268
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,163
You still have a chance to leave.

269
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,643
Why should I leave?

270
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:34,202
There is no other school

271
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:35,643
quite like the Yanyu Tower.

272
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:36,883
It's irreplaceable.

273
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:40,123
I'm here just to learn for a few months.

274
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,722
Once I'm done learning, I will leave.

275
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,762
As for the rest,

276
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:46,682
it has nothing to do with me.

277
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,282
Take care.

278
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:47,242
Has the sweet soup been sent over?

279
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:49,083
Yes.

280
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:57,522
Mother,

281
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,722
shall we

282
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:01,762
return the betrothal gifts
from the Wu family?

283
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:03,803
What are you talking about?

284
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,722
I'm very worried.

285
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,403
Whatever the truth is,

286
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:11,563
it's hard for Wu Lian

287
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,563
not to harbor resentment after all this.

288
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,202
If Rulan really marries him,

289
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:16,442
she won't live a good life.

290
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,442
I share the same concern.

291
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:26,883
I can't sleep all night.

292
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,643
But now

293
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:32,242
Rulan's reputation
in Huaizhou Prefecture

294
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:35,163
has been completely ruined.

295
00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:40,643
Which family would accept her?

296
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,242
We could ask our relatives

297
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:43,923
in the north to find a partner for her.

298
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,363
You must be honest with each other

299
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:47,522
about this kind of thing.

300
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:50,962
Otherwise,

301
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,002
that would be a despicable act.

302
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:55,242
If everything is told as it is,

303
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:59,042
the response is predictable.

304
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:00,762
Moreover,

305
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:03,042
even if Lan can't

306
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,202
win Mr. Wu's favor,

307
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:08,042
as long as she

308
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:09,522
keeps to herself in the house,

309
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,163
she can live a settled life.

310
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,123
I think Mrs. Wu

311
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:15,962
is a reasonable woman.

312
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:18,242
She probably won't
make things too difficult for her.

313
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:19,563
But Rulan's happiness...

314
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:20,643
Brother.

315
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:30,042
I am willing to marry.

316
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:31,883
Do you really think so?

317
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,202
Sure.

318
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,563
In fact,
ever since I entered the school,

319
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:38,002
I've grown fond of Mr. Wu,

320
00:23:38,563 --> 00:23:40,242
which has led to what happened later.

321
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,363
I've gone astray

322
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,803
these days.

323
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,323
I not only ruined my own reputation,

324
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:53,002
but also got you involved.

325
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,482
I'll marry into the Wu family.

326
00:23:58,242 --> 00:23:59,643
I will get what I wished for.

327
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,202
Rulan,

328
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:08,803
since it's the path you chose yourself,

329
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:13,722
I just hope you'll live
a good life in the future.

330
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:40,163
Rulan, I'll leave you two

331
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:41,603
and go to the shop

332
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:44,123
to get some ointment for Miss Meng.

333
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,202
You hurt your hand?

334
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:53,403
I know you didn't
mean to stand me up that day.

335
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,163
It was because of my mother, right?

336
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:00,242
Yes.

337
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:02,643
Forget her, and let's leave now.

338
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:03,682
It's not too late.

339
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:14,403
She did say a lot to me that day,

340
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:18,843
but it's not the real reason
why I stayed.

341
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:19,923
Then what is it?

342
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,002
I don't believe that you really want

343
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:22,803
to marry Wu Lian.

344
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:24,603
Why don't you believe it?

345
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,282
You obviously hate him that much.

346
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:28,123
I do hate him.

347
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:31,083
That's because I suddenly found
he was deceiving me

348
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,482
and that I wasn't the only one
who heard his sweet talk.

349
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:36,482
But apart from that,

350
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,522
he remains the one
with excellent embroidery skills,

351
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:41,202
whom I have admired for a long time.

352
00:25:41,883 --> 00:25:43,643
Do you still remember
what I once told you?

353
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,242
I want to be the greatest embroideress
in the world.

354
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:48,163
If I marry him,

355
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:50,363
I can practice embroidery

356
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,083
and sometimes have his guidance.

357
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:54,643
That's not bad.

358
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:57,123
You don't have to marry him

359
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,682
even if you want
to stay in Huaizhou Prefecture.

360
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,202
Wu Lian has already agreed
to cancel this marriage.

361
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:02,883
If you truly enjoy embroidery,

362
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:04,722
you can simply go to another school.

363
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:08,323
No other schools in Huaizhou Prefecture

364
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:09,923
can compare to the Yanyu Tower.

365
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,442
And no one can compare to him.

366
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,242
Have you really decided?

367
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:29,123
Don't worry about me.

368
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:30,603
You know me.

369
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:33,962
Once I make a decision,
I will not regret it.

370
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,282
It will be the Qiqiao Festival tomorrow.

371
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,403
Let's go to release lanterns once more.

372
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,242
Rulan.

373
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:14,323
Why are you hurt so badly?

374
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:16,962
My father was drunk again.

375
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,803
I got hurt when protecting my mother.

376
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,643
The injury is so serious.

377
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:39,123
It may affect your embroidery...

378
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:40,762
I was forced by my mother to learn it.

379
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,363
If I can't do it
in the future, so be it.

380
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:55,843
But you must be okay.

381
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:58,962
I will.

382
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:18,923
Rulan.

383
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,803
Rulan, after much persuasion,

384
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:23,163
our parents finally agreed.

385
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:24,682
It's the Qiqiao Festival.

386
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,163
It must be very lively outside.

387
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:27,722
You can go out to relax.

388
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:29,643
Thank you.

389
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,042
I'll get changed

390
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:32,042
and go out with you.

391
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:33,002
Brother,

392
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:36,762
I want to stroll alone tonight.

393
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:42,002
I'll be married to Wu Lian in two days.

394
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,522
I guess I would be only able
to stay in that small courtyard

395
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,803
and wouldn't be as free as now.

396
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,923
Can you indulge me one more time?

397
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:52,042
Rulan,

398
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,563
our parents will be worried
if you go out alone.

399
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:56,403
How about this?

400
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:57,682
I will go with you.

401
00:28:57,923 --> 00:28:59,042
But I will wait at a tea house.

402
00:28:59,202 --> 00:28:59,883
And then,

403
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:00,923
we'll come home together.

404
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:27,083
My lord,

405
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:31,923
in a few days,
Miss Lin will marry into our family.

406
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:35,762
Shall I empty the Wutong Yard

407
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:37,282
and clean it up?

408
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,883
After all, it is something joyous.

409
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:42,323
Why go to all that trouble?

410
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:45,282
Isn't there an abandoned room
in the backyard?

411
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:47,563
But it's been abandoned for a long time,

412
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:48,682
full of clutter.

413
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:50,682
If you have nothing to do,

414
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,202
go spend some time with your mother.

415
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:00,603
I understand.

416
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,002
What starts with a "butter"
but has no fat

417
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:50,482
and flies in the air where a cat can't?

418
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,163
Xiaoling.

419
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:01,962
Why does your clothing

420
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:04,123
have one sleeve longer than the other?

421
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:06,843
I borrowed clothes

422
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,923
from others to see you.

423
00:31:15,923 --> 00:31:16,883
I remember you loved

424
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:17,962
little bunnies as a child.

425
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:21,722
But I didn't guess it correctly.

426
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:25,603
Well, it seems I'm not destined
to win the lantern riddle game.

427
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:15,042
Actually, Miss Lin

428
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,123
is quite pitiful.

429
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,083
She does not seem

430
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:21,843
like a social climber at all.

431
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,603
Unlike Wu Lian,

432
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,522
who is clearly not a good guy.

433
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:27,762
I really can't rest easy

434
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,403
about you learning there.

435
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:32,923
I am not like her.

436
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,363
I won't let anything happen to myself.

437
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:41,363
I can't help but worry
about how Miss Lin will fend

438
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,762
for herself in the Wu family
in the future.

439
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:48,242
Perhaps she has no future.

440
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:56,123
Look.

441
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:11,282
Where are you going?

442
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:13,202
I'll win a lantern riddle for you

443
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:14,803
to release a lantern and make a wish.

444
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:16,883
You know

445
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,242
I'm skeptical of these things.

446
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,883
If a wish could be granted
by a single lantern,

447
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,202
there wouldn't be
so much suffering in the world.

448
00:33:23,722 --> 00:33:26,083
It's all just for the sake of comfort.

449
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,603
You've seen things differently
since you were a kid.

450
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:30,843
It is particularly rare among ladies.

451
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:40,123
Is it for me?

452
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:45,442
(Collection of Qiao Zhizhi)
It's from Qiao Zhizhi of former dynasty.

453
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:46,923
After he was sentenced,

454
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,643
most of his books were lost,

455
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:49,883
and it's hard to buy them.

456
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,323
How did you get one?

457
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:52,923
I know you like it.

458
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,482
My father had a copy,

459
00:33:54,762 --> 00:33:56,803
so I secretly copied one for you.

460
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:02,962
The spring breeze
touches my gauze sleeves.

461
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,042
Dew wets my silk dress.

462
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,002
My name is in it.

463
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:10,843
Don't read it now.

464
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:12,683
Well,

465
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:15,602
are you going to take
the provincial examination this year?

466
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:18,203
Of course.

467
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,082
I am preparing for it.

468
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:21,122
Trust me.

469
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:22,203
I will pass the examination.

470
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,803
By then I will propose to you.

471
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:25,482
Don't say that.

472
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:27,042
I'm serious.

473
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,162
Follow me.

474
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,346
(Clothes Shop)

475
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,482
Return your clothes.

476
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,162
With the clothes you picked for me,

477
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:57,683
who would want them?

478
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:00,602
I'm going back to the school.

479
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:01,962
It's so early.

480
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:05,763
The Qiqiao Festival
is not very interesting.

481
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:08,283
I'd rather go back to read books.

482
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:14,883
I'll walk you there.

483
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,683
It's just two blocks away.

484
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,562
If you are seen

485
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,042
by the people in the school,

486
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:22,683
it will cause trouble.

487
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,530
(May Rulan live a life
of peace and joy.)

488
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:58,203
Great!

489
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,843
Miss Lin.

490
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,042
Mr. Shen.

491
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:17,243
You

492
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:19,683
really want to marry into the Wu family?

493
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,082
I have thought it through.

494
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,683
Don't worry about me.

495
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:32,082
By the way,

496
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:34,122
I have a favor to ask.

497
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,522
Please say it, Miss Lin.

498
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,042
If one day I need your help,

499
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,323
please come.

500
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:42,162
Of course I will.

501
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:44,683
Thank you.

502
00:36:45,323 --> 00:36:46,243
You're welcome.

503
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:48,363
Great!

504
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:49,962
I'm leaving.

505
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:51,602
Take care.

506
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:53,403
You take care too.

507
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:06,843
Xiaoling,

508
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:12,203
take it.

509
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:14,562
I won this for you.

510
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:16,283
What is the answer?

511
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:19,442
It doesn't matter.

512
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:20,763
What's important is

513
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,122
no matter what you want,

514
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:24,082
I will win it for you.

515
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,243
What's wrong?

516
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:45,522
You don't like it?

517
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:46,843
The school has many rules.

518
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:49,042
If I bring this back,

519
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:50,642
the maids will scold me again.

520
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:53,482
Can you keep it for me?

521
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:58,562
Okay.

522
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,403
I will keep it safe for you.

523
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:02,122
When you finish school,

524
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:03,923
I will give it back to you intact.

525
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:05,883
It's a deal.

526
00:39:06,162 --> 00:39:06,803
Deal.

527
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:07,962
I'm going.

528
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:15,674
(Yanyu Tower)

529
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:29,283
I'm getting married
the day after tomorrow.

530
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,683
The only thing I worry about

531
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:33,562
is that in the future,

532
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,883
it may not be easy to see you again.

533
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,962
But if you ever get married,

534
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:42,243
remember to let me know,

535
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:44,082
so I can be happy for you.

536
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:46,203
I'm not getting married.

537
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:52,162
I suddenly want
to eat chestnut cakes now.

538
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,843
I still remember

539
00:39:56,803 --> 00:39:59,602
your first day in the school.

540
00:40:01,363 --> 00:40:05,562
Just a tiny chestnut cake

541
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,243
made you win my affection.

542
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,042
It was you who was craving for it.

543
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:16,602
And it's been so long.

544
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:18,042
How come you haven't
learned to make it yet?

545
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:24,962
Does it look good?

546
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:27,363
You give it a try.

547
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:50,203
Everyone in the school praises you
for your embroidery skills.

548
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,683
But you're so clumsy

549
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:53,763
in cooking.

550
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:56,683
I will just give it up.

551
00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:58,602
I don't have to learn it.

552
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:02,243
Anyway, You'll make it for me.

553
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:14,162
Awesome!

554
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:21,002
Wan, look.

555
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:23,082
What a beautiful moon.

556
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,203
What's your dream?

557
00:41:42,323 --> 00:41:45,002
I want to be the best embroideress
in the world,

558
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:48,042
have a gentle husband,

559
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:50,883
and have a son and a daughter.

560
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,602
If your mother hears this,

561
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:55,562
she will say you have no shame.

562
00:41:57,323 --> 00:41:58,803
I have already come of age.

563
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:04,002
In the future, I want
to open an embroidery shop,

564
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,122
buy a house and get my mother

565
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:09,162
away from my father.

566
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:14,562
In the house, there will be
a lot of grape vines

567
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,042
and a swing like this.

568
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:19,683
Sounds so nice.

569
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,683
I will share my children with you

570
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,082
and have them recognize you

571
00:42:24,203 --> 00:42:25,363
as the mother.

572
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:26,763
It's a deal.

573
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:28,843
Deal.

574
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:39,442
Look, a dragon lantern.

575
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:44,723
It's so lively.

576
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:46,803
So nice.

577
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:50,683
My brother is waiting at a teahouse.

578
00:42:51,162 --> 00:42:52,482
I might have to go back to him now.

579
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:54,162
You better go home and sleep early.

580
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:58,843
I don't know when we will
see each other again.

581
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:00,923
Very soon.

582
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:03,442
Oh, right.

583
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:05,082
I'll be getting married in two days.

584
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:07,082
On that day,

585
00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:10,082
please remember to deliver this letter

586
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:11,763
to Mr. Shen around 7 p.m.

587
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:16,042
The man who was just talking to you?

588
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:23,162
He has helped me several times,

589
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,642
but I haven't found
the opportunity to show my gratitude.

590
00:43:26,283 --> 00:43:27,763
Make sure to give it to him

591
00:43:28,002 --> 00:43:29,482
around 7 p.m., okay?

592
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:32,723
Alright, I will.

593
00:43:37,642 --> 00:43:40,562
In another month,
chestnuts will be ripe.

594
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,162
Then

595
00:43:42,642 --> 00:43:45,122
I can make chestnut cakes for you.

596
00:43:48,723 --> 00:43:49,562
Okay.

597
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:51,203
You should go home now.

598
00:43:51,482 --> 00:43:52,162
I'm leaving.
