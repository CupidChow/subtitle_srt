=Episode 19, Chapter 10, Part 1=
(The boy gave up his studies for embroidery)

3
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,240
Master, how should we
deal with Liu Sanniang?

4
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,639
Take good care of her.

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,759
She has a greater use.

6
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,400
Yes.

7
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:26,319
(Meng Wan)

8
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,000
(Lady, the embroidered plum blossoms
look great.)

9
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,840
(Do they look like real plum blossoms?)

10
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,639
(Yes.)

11
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:08,218
(Lady Wu, Chen Yingxue)

12
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
Lady Wu,

13
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,319
why do you embroider every day?

14
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,280
Before I got married,

15
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
I used to work in an embroidery shop.

16
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't have any other skills.

17
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,120
Only my embroidery is passable.

18
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm gonna be in this courtyard

19
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,919
for the rest of my life.

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,199
If I don't find ways to occupy myself,

21
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,680
my life will be stagnant.

22
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,520
It looks so good.

23
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,147
Lian, it's getting late.

24
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,747
You should go back.

25
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,747
I want to stay here.

26
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,522
Father and Mother fight every day.

27
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:49,642
I don't want to go back.

28
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:55,362
Lian, be good. Go back.

29
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:58,322
Your father doesn't like
you staying in this courtyard all day.

30
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:00,362
Don't make him angry.

31
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:03,123
How about this?

32
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:08,003
I'll make your favorite food,
glutinous rice balls in wine, tomorrow.

33
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,443
Would that be okay?

34
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:16,123
I'm going back.

35
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:37,043
The top-one piece of jewelry
of the Yufang Shop is truly luxurious.

36
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,042
(Wu Lian's Mother)

37
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:47,483
(Wu Lian's Father)
Leave us.

38
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:48,443
Yes.

39
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,522
You are already ten years old,

40
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,243
and you're still reading "Er Ya"?

41
00:04:58,603 --> 00:04:59,962
My teacher let us read it.

42
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:01,402
I haven't seen you

43
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,043
learn anything useful in the academy,

44
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:04,842
except to talk back.

45
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:06,683
When I was your age,

46
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,402
I already started reading
"Chun Qiu" and "Shang Shu".

47
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,603
How could my son be so wooden-headed

48
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:14,483
and be nothing like me?

49
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,123
You don't have to keep insinuating here.

50
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:18,803
Aren't you just trying to say

51
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:21,082
his mother is ignorant

52
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,402
and has disgraced your family?

53
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:25,003
Isn't it true?

54
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,683
You parade yourself
in public all day long.

55
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:29,483
What a disgrace!

56
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:30,762
And look.

57
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:32,762
Look at what you've bought.

58
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,162
This gold and silver jewelry.

59
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,762
How unbearably vulgar.

60
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,962
When you married me,

61
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:40,642
why weren't you averse to my dowry?

62
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:43,202
Y-Y-You're from a merchant family.

63
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:45,762
Marrying into my family
is marrying above your rank.

64
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,402
Since you're my wife,

65
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,402
you should learn my family's rules

66
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:51,322
and serve my mother well.

67
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,322
How much money
did you spend on this painting?

68
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,043
This is a famous painting from the past.

69
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:07,443
How could it be compared
with your vulgar things?

70
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:08,683
500,000 copper coins?

71
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,443
1,000,000 copper coins?

72
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,402
Can you return all the money
you've squandered

73
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,642
over the years to me?

74
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:19,683
Calling yourself
a scholar for generations.

75
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,123
Did any of your ancestors

76
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,883
become an imperial scholar?

77
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:27,722
And you still have the cheek
to pontificate here

78
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:28,842
with a high-and-mighty attitude.

79
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,082
Bah!

80
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,683
I made these especially for you.

81
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:01,322
I planned to give them to you
on your birthday in a few days.

82
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:04,202
Do you like them?

83
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,282
My mother has never made
such things for me.

84
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:12,603
Your mother does care about you.

85
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:15,803
She's just too busy with chores.

86
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:18,043
These embroidered plum blossoms
look really lovely.

87
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:19,683
I'm best at embroidering

88
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:20,923
plum blossoms.

89
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:42,202
From now on, plum blossoms
will be my favorite too.

90
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,762
Eat it before it gets cold.

91
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:48,642
Lady Wu,

92
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:50,603
can I try embroidery?

93
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:53,883
Can I?

94
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:58,762
Sure.

95
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,282
I'll teach you.

96
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:05,162
Look, hold the needle like this.

97
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,842
I told you to rest inside the house.

98
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:26,923
I just caught a cold at night.

99
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,043
I already took
the medicine this morning.

100
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:30,282
I'm fine now.

101
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:36,243
Lian, sit here.

102
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,123
I can sit here.

103
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:40,682
Are you afraid of me?

104
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,642
Your father was right.

105
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,083
You take after neither him

106
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:50,603
nor me.

107
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:53,922
Later,

108
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,562
when we get to the dye shop,

109
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,162
watch over Lian

110
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:58,442
and don't let him run around.

111
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,323
Madam, rest assured.

112
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:03,723
I'll take good care of the young master.

113
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:09,642
Let me pour you some water,

114
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,003
Young Master.

115
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:19,282
Young Master,

116
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:20,883
please wait for a minute.

117
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:22,522
I'll be right back.

118
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,003
Where are you going?

119
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:25,723
I'm going to the privy.

120
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,922
Please don't leave here.

121
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,483
You went to the shop
with your mother today.

122
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,562
What did you see there?

123
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,483
Tell me everything

124
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,762
you saw and heard today.

125
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:26,003
I fell asleep in the carriage
on the way there.

126
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,922
My mother left me
in the care of the maid.

127
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:32,442
When I woke up,
my mother was already back.

128
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:33,883
Didn't you go in?

129
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,402
Weren't you supposed
to follow your mother?

130
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:39,642
You...

131
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,003
Useless thing.

132
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,323
Get out.

133
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:52,762
Someone!

134
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:56,843
Master.

135
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,802
If your mistress goes out again,
have someone follow her in secret.

136
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:01,402
Why?

137
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:03,003
Just do as I told you.

138
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:06,243
If you discover anything,
report it to me immediately.

139
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:07,282
Yes.

140
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:11,522
Come back!

141
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:19,642
No need to do it. You can leave.

142
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:22,522
So should I have someone
follow the madam

143
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,363
or not?

144
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,522
Don't you understand me?

145
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:28,123
I said there was no need!

146
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,522
Yes, Master.

147
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:49,883
Lian.

148
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:53,843
Lady Wu, how's my embroidery?

149
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:00,402
It's awesome.

150
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:09,083
Shouldn't you be inspecting the shop
with the madam now?

151
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:13,243
I love embroidery.

152
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,802
Lady Wu, can you teach me?

153
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:18,562
This is not what you should learn.

154
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:19,843
Why can't I?

155
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,483
You are different from me.

156
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,642
You should focus on studying.

157
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,762
This way, you will
have a promising future.

158
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,883
But my father
has been studying all his life.

159
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,083
And then what?

160
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:34,442
Just now,
as I was sitting here stitching,

161
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,442
I felt an inexplicable tranquility
in my heart.

162
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:38,963
I seem to understand

163
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,642
why you love embroidery so much.

164
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:43,963
If you refuse to teach me,

165
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,282
I will find a way to learn it myself.

166
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,682
If I agree,

167
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,642
you'll have to promise me

168
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,442
it cannot be known to your father.

169
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:01,883
Why?

170
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:08,042
Because you are a boy.

171
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,243
Lady Wu, just relax.

172
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,123
My father won't know.

173
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:19,203
Nanny,

174
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:22,522
I've been married to my husband
for more than a decade.

175
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:24,802
You are clearest

176
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:26,802
about how he treats me.

177
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:29,162
He doesn't look up

178
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:31,442
to us merchants at all.

179
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:34,762
Back then, if the Wu family hadn't found

180
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,442
themselves financially in trouble,

181
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,483
how would he willingly marry me?

182
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,963
A few years ago, I asked for a divorce.

183
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,522
He didn't agree

184
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:48,042
and falsely appeased me for a while.

185
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,003
But it wasn't because he
didn't want to part with me.

186
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:51,522
What he can't bear to part with

187
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:53,522
is the unstoppable stream
of money from my family.

188
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:57,162
Nanny, look around.

189
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,603
All the things

190
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:03,243
in this room were my dowry.

191
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,083
If I didn't have these,

192
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,762
would he have any affection for me?

193
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,682
But you have a son.

194
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,483
You should think about him.

195
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,243
If you leave,

196
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,402
what about him?

197
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,946
(Wu's House)

198
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:33,162
Lady Wu,

199
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:34,723
Lady Wu.

200
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,442
Slow down.

201
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:38,483
Lady Wu,

202
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:41,762
this is what I've spent half a month on.

203
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:42,883
What do you think?

204
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,682
This is the first time I've seen
such realistic embroidered blossoms.

205
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:57,402
I even sneaked
into the best embroidery shop here.

206
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,442
None of their samples
are as good as mine.

207
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:01,963
Look at how proud you are.

208
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:04,483
It's all thanks to your teaching.

209
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:06,603
I'm not that capable.

210
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,802
Now, your embroidery skills
far exceed mine.

211
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,922
What happened to your hand?

212
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:16,802
Just a minor injury. It doesn't matter.

213
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:18,802
Wait. I'll get you some medicine.

214
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,522
How many times have I told you?

215
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,203
If you want to embroider,

216
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:29,083
you must take good care
of your index finger.

217
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,723
It's the most vital asset
for an embroiderer.

218
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,562
Why don't you listen?

219
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:34,922
Hand out.

220
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:39,243
Does it hurt?

221
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:40,162
A little.

222
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,483
Lady Wu, don't worry.

223
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,802
I'll take good care of them.

224
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,282
Don't get it wet for a few days.

225
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,282
Look who's coming back.

226
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:04,402
Isn't this the embroideress
of our family?

227
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:05,922
Who let you in?

228
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,203
These are the hands of an embroiderer.

229
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:12,003
Even whiter and tenderer than a woman's.

230
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:16,282
Stop!

231
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,323
How unexpected, my cousin.

232
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,123
So you have this fetish.

233
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:23,522
My uncle shouldn't have let
you go to an academy,

234
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,442
but let you go to an embroidery school.

235
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:29,603
Your embroidery skills
don't seem worse than a woman's.

236
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:35,723
Master.

237
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:38,282
This is what the brat embroidered?

238
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:44,123
Master, please don't.

239
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:45,603
You wretch.

240
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,562
You're teaching Lian

241
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:49,162
this disgraceful thing behind my back.

242
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:50,562
You want to ruin him, don't you?

243
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:53,243
Master, please let me explain.

244
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:55,123
I shouldn't have allowed you lowly maid

245
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:57,664
to be my concubine.

246
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,402
You are to be sent away tomorrow.

247
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,123
I don't want to see you again.

248
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,083
Master.

249
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:14,642
You're a man,

250
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:16,242
and you spend your days

251
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:18,043
inside the room
embroidering these feminine things?

252
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:20,482
How could I have a son like you?

253
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:21,442
Master.

254
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,482
Burn, burn them all!

255
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:25,642
Burn them here.

256
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,043
Burn them in front of him.

257
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,722
You rebel!

258
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,642
You rebel!

259
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:45,922
Who is it?

260
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:58,123
Lian?

261
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:00,722
Didn't Master order
the courtyard to be sealed?

262
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:02,363
How did you get in?

263
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:06,962
Who knows this courtyard better than me?

264
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:08,682
There is a hole behind the side door.

265
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:09,883
I crawled through it.

266
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:15,922
Did you see a doctor?

267
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:17,642
Has your wound been treated?

268
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,002
I'm fine.

269
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,242
My father hit you?

270
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,763
I'm sorry to bring trouble to you.

271
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:44,402
I've never had children in my life,

272
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,803
but the Bodhisattva had mercy on me

273
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:49,162
and sent you to me.

274
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,642
Without your accompany
every day, I don't know

275
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,962
how I would have spent
the last few years.

276
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:57,763
So you didn't bring me trouble at all.

277
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,202
Lian,

278
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:05,363
you are bright.

279
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,563
Study hard in the future.

280
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:12,043
You will surely pass
the imperial examination one day.

281
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:14,363
Lady Wu,

282
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:16,442
are you hiding something from me?

283
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,642
I'm being sent to the country tomorrow.

284
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,843
It may be hard
to see you again in the future.

285
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,123
I'm going to see my father.

286
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,242
Lian,

287
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,363
your father is mad now.

288
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,763
Don't provoke him.

289
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:37,722
In fact, living
in the country is quite nice.

290
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,603
It's peaceful and comfortable there,

291
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,803
much better than this small courtyard.

292
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,603
So you're abandoning me?

293
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,682
You will come of age in a few years,

294
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,682
and it won't be suitable for you
to come to the backyard then.

295
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:00,603
As long as I know you are doing well,

296
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,242
my heart is settled.

297
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:08,803
I will visit you when I get time.

298
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:11,123
Okay.

299
00:21:11,642 --> 00:21:13,083
Please wait for me tomorrow.

300
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:14,442
I'll see you off.

301
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:32,323
Take care.

302
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:40,122
(Pawnshop)

303
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:43,922
How much can this be pawned for?

304
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:55,202
50 taels at most.

305
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:57,083
But this is top-quality Lantian jade.

306
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:58,442
Boy,

307
00:21:58,722 --> 00:21:59,922
if you don't want to pawn it,

308
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:01,123
you can take it back.

309
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:08,922
Prepare your payment.

310
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,123
Lady Wu.

311
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:46,563
Young Master,

312
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,162
Master

313
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:50,722
asked me to seal off this yard.

314
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:53,642
Perhaps you can leave first.

315
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:55,002
Who allowed you in?

316
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:57,642
I-I-I'll leave now.

317
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:17,242
(I'm gonna be in this courtyard
for the rest of my life.)

318
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,083
(If I don't find ways to occupy myself,)

319
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:23,722
(my life will be stagnant.)

320
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:26,962
(The embroidered plum blossoms
look great.)

321
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:29,962
(I'm best at embroidering
plum blossoms.)

322
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:33,523
(From now on,
plum blossoms will be my favorite too.)

323
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,843
(This is what I've spent
half a month on.)

324
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:39,883
(What do you think?)

325
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:43,603
(This is the first time I've seen
such realistic embroidered blossoms.)

326
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:45,323
(I love embroidery.)

327
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:48,002
(Lady Wu, can you teach me?)

328
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:50,603
(This is not what you should learn.)

329
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:52,563
(You are different from me.)

330
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:54,763
(You should focus on studying.)

331
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:56,803
(This way, you will
have a promising future.)

332
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:59,402
(But my father
has been studying all his life.)

333
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:00,603
(And then what?)

334
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:05,563
(Just now,
as I was sitting here stitching,)

335
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,682
(I felt an inexplicable tranquility
in my heart.)

336
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:10,642
(I seem to understand)

337
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:13,442
(why you love embroidery so much.)

338
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,682
(Graciousness)
Lian,

339
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,563
Lian, do you really want to abandon

340
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,043
your biological mother for Lady Wu?

341
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:26,962
"Mother"?

342
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:29,682
When have you ever treated
me as your son?

343
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:31,763
My real mother died yesterday.

344
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:34,162
Stop right there.

345
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,202
If you step out of this door today,

346
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:39,563
you can never come back.

347
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:40,922
Don't worry.

348
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:42,363
I will never set foot

349
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:45,002
in this house again in this life.

350
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,482
You!

351
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:47,682
Lian.

352
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:58,426
(Wu's Yanyu Embroidery)

353
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,803
I have lived for decades.

354
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:06,682
It's my first time seeing
a man doing embroidery.

355
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:08,563
How unthinkable.

356
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:11,843
If all the men
in the world were like him,

357
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:13,603
what would happen if a war broke out?

358
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:15,482
Wouldn't the country be in jeopardy?

359
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,083
Are these embroideries
really done by you?

360
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:21,083
Yes, they are.

361
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:29,803
The embroidery
in your hand is no worse than

362
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:32,283
that of any major embroidery shop
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

363
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:35,283
What does it mean by "Yanyu"?

364
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,202
This kind of embroidery shows
different images in the misty rain.

365
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:40,843
Take the pear blossom embroidery
in your hand as an example.

366
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,722
The flowers contain

367
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:44,162
scores of shades of white.

368
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:46,642
Up close, they seem
to be about to bloom.

369
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:49,603
From a distance, you can see
the blossoms in full bloom.

370
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:50,763
Giving you a dreamlike feeling.

371
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:53,603
How unique it is.

372
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,162
I can give this embroidery to you.

373
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:58,763
You will see it
when the next rainy day comes.

374
00:26:59,083 --> 00:26:59,803
Okay.

375
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,202
I will take it home.

376
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,363
If it's really as you said,

377
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:06,123
the embroidery of my house in the future

378
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:07,603
will all be done by you.

379
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,763
Isn't that Mrs. Zhao?

380
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,482
She's from one of
the top families in Huaizhou City.

381
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:16,922
What a lucky person.

382
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,442
Even Mrs. Zhao thinks it's good.

383
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:21,402
Maybe it is really good.

384
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:25,043
What a rarity. Let me take a look.

385
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,586
(Yanyu Tower)

386
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:43,962
Sir, the matchmaker Mrs. Wang is here.

387
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:52,283
Let her in.

388
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:53,883
Yes, sir.

389
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:57,123
It's good news.

390
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,202
The Zhang is one of the noble families
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

391
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:02,563
They have had a prime minister
in the last three generations.

392
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:04,162
I am well aware.

393
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:06,442
But I am just a merchant.

394
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:09,202
But you're not an ordinary merchant.

395
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,563
The Yanyu Tower is very famous

396
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:13,722
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

397
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:15,162
Mrs. Zhang

398
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:16,883
appreciates this aspect of you.

399
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:19,083
And you have good looks.

400
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,962
The Zhang family doesn't really care
about the son-in-law's status.

401
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:23,922
They prefer to find
a suitable life partner

402
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,202
for their daughter.

403
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,603
I've been a matchmaker for years.

404
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:30,123
What kind haven't I seen?

405
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:31,283
In my opinion,

406
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,962
this is a great marriage opportunity.

407
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:37,083
Others can't even beg for it.

408
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:42,763
You're right.

409
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,363
It is lucky to have the chance to marry
the legitimate daughter

410
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:47,763
of the Zhang family.

411
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,523
That's right.

412
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:57,786
(Zhang's Mansion)

413
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:45,962
My lady, sorry for the wait.

414
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:48,682
No, not at all.

415
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,722
Mr. Zhang, please have some tea.

416
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,162
Mother, please have some tea.

417
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,482
I have only this one daughter.

418
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:05,283
You must treat her well in the future.

419
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,083
Mr. Zhang, Mrs. Zhang,

420
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:14,642
you can rest assured.

421
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:17,843
Having Rong'er as my wife
is my greatest honor.

422
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:24,962
I will treat her well.

423
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,202
He didn't notice anything, did he?

424
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,123
No, he treats me very well.

425
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:40,962
Now I can rest assured.

426
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,043
Although Wu Lian is a merchant,

427
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:46,722
he is quite famous
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

428
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:49,843
So your life won't be
too hard in the future.

429
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:55,642
Given your current situation,

430
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:58,962
this is the best you can get.

431
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:02,083
You're right.

432
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,363
I am so thankful for that.

433
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:22,563
Thank you for accompanying me
back to my parents' home today.

434
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:39,202
I intend to start an embroidery school
in the Yanyu Tower.

435
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:42,043
Starting a school?

436
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:44,083
You don't need to know too much.

437
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:49,603
All you have to do is socialize
with the women in Huaizhou Prefecture

438
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,603
to make my name known.

439
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,843
Then what do I need to do?

440
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,563
Just listen to my instructions.

441
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,242
Why hasn't Mrs. Wu arrived yet?

442
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:09,883
You shouldn't have sent
her the invitation.

443
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,843
As the daughter of the Zhang family,

444
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:13,603
she used to outrank us.

445
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,523
But it's different now.

446
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:16,843
Yes.

447
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:19,083
No matter how skilled Wu Lian is
as an embroiderer,

448
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:21,043
he is just a merchant, after all.

449
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,642
Sorry.

450
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:27,402
I am late.

451
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,464
This morning, I went to propose

452
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:32,722
marriage on behalf
of Sun Erlang to the Cao family,

453
00:33:32,883 --> 00:33:33,883
so I was late.

454
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,843
But I facilitated a match.

455
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:37,083
It's a good thing.

456
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,763
The Cao family? Which one?

457
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:41,722
The one in the north of the city.

458
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,763
No one in their generation
has been an official.

459
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,763
You may not be so familiar with them.

460
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,763
Why would the Sun family want
to be in-laws with them?

461
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,523
The elder master of the Sun family

462
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:53,962
was the Crown Prince's tutor.

463
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,002
Although he has retired now,

464
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:58,283
he's not within the reach
of a humble family.

465
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:01,843
At the beginning of the year,

466
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,523
didn't you ask the Sun family

467
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:04,843
for your daughter's marriage?

468
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:06,442
They replied

469
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:09,363
Sun Erlang didn't have
any plans to get engaged.

470
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:14,163
You must be very persuasive,

471
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,482
even able to convince the Sun family.

472
00:34:18,082 --> 00:34:19,283
No, I'm not that capable.

473
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:22,323
It's Mrs. Sun who took
a liking to Miss Cao herself.

474
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:24,323
Why would Mrs. Sun know

475
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,922
about a girl from a modest family?

476
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:28,442
Miss Cao has been practicing
embroidery at the Yanyu Tower

477
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:30,402
for some time.

478
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:33,145
Mrs. Sun had her birthday earlier.

479
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,185
Miss Cao herself

480
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:38,426
made a longevity-related embroidery
as a present.

481
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,505
As you all know,

482
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:43,386
Mrs. Sun values
a woman's needlework and virtue

483
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,665
and favors the embroidery
from the Yanyu Tower the most.

484
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:50,866
That's why Miss Cao

485
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:52,306
got some of her favor.

486
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:56,145
So

487
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,625
it was thanks to the Yanyu Tower

488
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,746
that she secured the marriage.

489
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:03,585
It's her good fortune.

490
00:35:03,986 --> 00:35:06,386
When will your school
accept apprentices again?

491
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,065
I will keep an eye out

492
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,105
for my youngest daughter.

493
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:10,306
So will I.

494
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:11,225
I've fretted

495
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:13,185
over my daughter's embroidery skills.

496
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:16,466
It would be great to send her
to your place to be influenced.

497
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:17,585
That's right.

498
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:19,906
Have a tangerine.

499
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:22,386
The dates taste good.

500
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,105
Have some, too.

501
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,818
(Yanyu Tower)

502
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,346
Sir,

503
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:40,986
the new batch of embroideresses
has been settled in.

504
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:42,585
Good.

505
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,323
Have someone prepare
an embroidery frame for me.

506
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:48,082
The bigger, the better.

507
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,482
Sir, what are you going to embroider?

508
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:57,323
Fallen plum blossoms.

509
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:02,082
Why are they fallen ones?

510
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:07,203
The plum blossoms
on the branches are too vulgar.

511
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:11,683
The ones that fall in the snow
are the most beautiful.

512
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:14,683
Yes.

513
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,082
It was ruined so badly.

514
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:45,763
What a pity.

515
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:50,482
I've spent so many years
on this embroidery

516
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,363
of falling blossoms in the snow,

517
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:55,363
and I find it more and more tacky.

518
00:36:57,562 --> 00:36:58,763
There's nothing to regret.

519
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:03,883
This time,

520
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,042
I will gather all the embroideresses
in this house

521
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:09,683
to make a more grandiose

522
00:37:10,283 --> 00:37:13,962
and impressive Yanyu Embroidery.
