(Justice comes)

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,799
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,539
I couldn't help today.

5
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,458
It is not your fault.

6
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,298
We know about Wu Lian's ability

7
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,899
to distort the truth.

8
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,499
Without you today,

9
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,378
Mr. Lou would have already left here.

10
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,058
And we wouldn't have the chance
to retry the case.

11
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,259
We don't blame you.

12
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,578
At least half of the people
hearing the case

13
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,458
have already believed what you said
in the end.

14
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:17,659
They were all cursing Wu Lian.

15
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:18,819
Exactly.

16
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,578
Wu Lian was not sent to prison today,

17
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:25,298
but his reputation
in Huaizhou Prefecture

18
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:26,819
has been ruined.

19
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,699
Wu An is a rat fink.

20
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:30,979
He tricked me.

21
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,259
I don't think
he changed his mind on the spot.

22
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,259
When he promised you,

23
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,659
he was probably already prepared

24
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:38,298
to go back on his word at this trial.

25
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:41,178
I really underestimated this loyal dog.

26
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,618
Wu Lian had the upper hand today,

27
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,819
but it's not the end yet.

28
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:48,539
We still have a chance.

29
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:01,898
Madam.

30
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,979
A trial was held today.

31
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,699
It's about the Rulan Case
seven years ago.

32
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:11,018
Wu Lian was not convicted.

33
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,618
(Ning Mansion)

34
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,458
What's the current situation

35
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,219
with Wu Lian's case?

36
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,819
It got big.

37
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,530
The Yamen has been crowded these days.

38
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,850
But there is still no progress.

39
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,491
Mr. Lou also has no way.

40
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,250
Lou Mingzhang can decide

41
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:40,690
on this case by himself.

42
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:43,291
Madam.

43
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,291
People from the palace.

44
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,931
Imperial palace?

45
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,690
It's Mr. Wang, who serves Her Majesty.

46
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,291
A decree for Mrs. Ning.

47
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,810
(Goodliness)
A decree from Her Majesty.

48
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,451
I have heard about the case of Wu Lian.

49
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,891
Mrs. Ning was deceived

50
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:08,331
by Wu Lian,

51
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,291
but you've corrected your mistake

52
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,731
and informed me of the truth in time.

53
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:16,611
So, I will exonerate you.

54
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:19,010
Mrs. Ning,

55
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,010
you must act cautiously and refrain
from repeating past mistakes.

56
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,851
Accept the decree.

57
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,931
Mrs. Ning, accept the decree.

58
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,370
I accept the decree.

59
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,091
Greeting, Mrs. Ning.

60
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,770
Mr. Wang, you must be tired.

61
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:54,370
I have prepared tea and snacks for you.

62
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,531
Thank you.

63
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:56,491
Please.

64
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,491
Please.

65
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,770
How did Her Majesty know about this?

66
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:25,171
I really underestimated Meng Wan.

67
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,531
How did she manage to do it?

68
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,651
Perhaps I'm a part

69
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,330
of her plan.

70
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,690
Remember

71
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,690
who sent me the Her Majesty's gift?

72
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:39,291
Madam.

73
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,690
The birthday gift
from Huangji Embroidery House

74
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,931
has been delivered.

75
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,370
Bring it.

76
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:45,890
Yes.

77
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,611
Greeting, Mrs. Ning.

78
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,570
It's you.

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,931
When did you start to work
for the Huangji Embroidery House?

80
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,330
I know you may not want to see me.

81
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,091
But I had no choice.

82
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,291
Please forgive me.

83
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,171
I know why you are here.

84
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,570
You and Wu Lian fight in a trial.

85
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,731
It's causing a stir in Huaizhou.

86
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,210
I do not intend to get involved.

87
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,611
You're worried
that if Wu Lian is found guilty,

88
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,250
it will implicate you.

89
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,370
Wu Lian is nothing to me.

90
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,851
He has no power

91
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,570
to take me down.

92
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,091
To protect himself,

93
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,690
he will do everything he can
to take you down.

94
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,171
If I were you,

95
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,250
I might take the initiative.

96
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,890
If you expose his crimes
to the officials,

97
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:49,130
you might be exonerated.

98
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,411
What makes you think

99
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,931
you can win this lawsuit?

100
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,890
There is always justice in this world.

101
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,810
Well,

102
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,570
I seem to have overestimated you.

103
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,370
You are not a smart person.

104
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,531
You may go.

105
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,731
Wu Lian.

106
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,931
He's completely useless now.

107
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,690
Don't you have Huai Embroidery now?

108
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,851
No one knows

109
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:49,770
how far it can go.

110
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,171
Good.

111
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,570
So,

112
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,491
I will have fewer problems
to worry about.

113
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,091
I got the news from the capital.

114
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:07,450
Her Majesty is quite satisfied
with Huai Embroidery.

115
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,010
You mean...

116
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:24,570
A new embroidery house is rising.

117
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,330
An imperial edict from His Majesty.

118
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,051
(Justice)
When I heard about the case of Wu Lian,

119
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,371
I was furious.

120
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,730
I order the inquisitor Lou Mingzhang

121
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,011
to handle the case.

122
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:40,210
This case must be strictly tried

123
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,690
to seek justice for the innocent.

124
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,411
Do it according to the decree.

125
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,051
Yes, I will.

126
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,810
I see the light in your room.

127
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,970
So I guess you're still up.

128
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:24,850
The case has not been settled.

129
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,970
I can't sleep.

130
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,570
You've never mentioned the wound

131
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:31,891
on your shoulder.

132
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,011
I'm eager to forget it.

133
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,570
How can I mention it?

134
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,810
Thank you for coming

135
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,531
to help me.

136
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:46,051
Please have a seat.

137
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,411
Li Chunfeng's was right.

138
00:09:56,411 --> 00:10:00,291
I have been deceiving myself
over the past seven years.

139
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,931
I hide behind the name of Jueming,

140
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,850
unwilling to admit
that I am Tian Xiaoling.

141
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:09,570
I thought, in that way,

142
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,891
I could let go what happened

143
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:16,171
to Tian Xiaoling.

144
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,171
But I didn't even have the courage
to face it.

145
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:23,411
How can I say I've let it go?

146
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:26,112
Many things are easier said

147
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:27,011
than done.

148
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:29,891
It's already not easy for you

149
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,411
to think this way now.

150
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,570
If I could have understood it earlier,

151
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:39,490
maybe he wouldn't have died.

152
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,291
Between these two things,

153
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,011
there are no causal relationships.

154
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,051
Why would it be blamed on you?

155
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,891
I once asked Master Huichen

156
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,490
why she hadn't shaved your head
in the past seven years.

157
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,251
Master Huichen told me

158
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:03,570
my worldly entanglements were not over,

159
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,131
and the knots were unloosed.

160
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,690
What are the knots holding you?

161
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,570
Naturally, it's Wu Lian.

162
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,490
It's you.

163
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,570
I don't understand.

164
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,450
About the incident that year,

165
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,570
are you blaming Wu Lian or yourself?

166
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:25,450
Master Huichen said

167
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,810
she understood it all

168
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,371
when she read your letter.

169
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,411
You seemed to resent Wu Lian,

170
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,810
but in reality, you took all the blame
upon yourself.

171
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,371
You hid in the Qingshui Nunnery

172
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,810
and cultivated yourself.

173
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,891
It's not only an escape
but also a self-punishment.

174
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,570
Just now, you felt guilty

175
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,131
for Li Chunfeng's death.

176
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,570
Though you already have the courage
to face the past,

177
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,690
if you can't overcome this hurdle,

178
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,011
you will only suffer more.

179
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,931
Seven years ago,

180
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,931
Lin Rulan accused Wu Lian.

181
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,490
People said she was slanderous.

182
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:08,610
I've met her.

183
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,251
I knew she was telling the truth.

184
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,771
But when I saw her,

185
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,490
she was already determined to die.

186
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,891
I pitied her,

187
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,330
but I didn't sympathize with her.

188
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,450
My father is a private tutor.

189
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,651
I read more books

190
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,570
than other girls,

191
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:35,931
so I thought I was different from them.

192
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:39,651
Though what Lin Rulan said was true,

193
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:41,970
it was none of my business.

194
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,531
I didn't care.

195
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:49,771
She trusted people too easily,

196
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,131
so she had this misfortune.

197
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:56,411
I thought I was smarter than others.

198
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:03,411
I wouldn't let the same thing happen
to me.

199
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,570
I deserved it.

200
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,131
Do you know
that Li Chunfeng once stole a name list

201
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,651
from the Yanyu Tower?

202
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:18,810
He never mentioned it to me.

203
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,330
Every girl on that list is

204
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,531
just like you and me.

205
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,210
They all have been hurt by Wu Lian.

206
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,450
Have you ever felt
that they brought this upon themselves?

207
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,771
No, I haven't.

208
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:32,850
Why do you think
you are different from them?

209
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,931
Maybe some of them, just like you,

210
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,450
always feel
that they have done something wrong

211
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,330
to deserve this.

212
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,850
Wu Lian is to blame.

213
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,251
They did nothing wrong.

214
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,610
See, haven't you already figured it out?

215
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,690
But you are completely unaware of it.

216
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,051
Have a good sleep.

217
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,210
The day will dawn.

218
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,610
I received anonymous letters

219
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,210
from the people of Huaizhou.

220
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,931
The content was appalling.

221
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:41,330
(Huaizhou)
(The letters contain)

222
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,730
(personal stories written
by those women victimized by Wu Lian,)

223
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:48,771
(or written by the victim's families.)

224
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:53,371
(Many local people came
to the Yamen to petition,)

225
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,651
(hoping to retry the case.)

226
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,210
Madame Xu.

227
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,490
I received the verbal order
from His Majesty.

228
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:05,051
Are you behind this?

229
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,371
Since he managed
to get an official position

230
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,970
through the Zhang family,

231
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,810
I have made a back-up plan.

232
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,490
You use Mrs. Ning

233
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,490
to present this letter to Her Majesty.

234
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,131
What if Her Majesty is infuriated?

235
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:24,330
I cannot allow Wu Lian
to have a chance to escape.

236
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:27,251
If Her Majesty puts the blame on you,

237
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,131
you can deny it all.

238
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,291
I will bear all the consequences.

239
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,131
I don't like to hear you say this.

240
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,610
If I was concerned about my safety,

241
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,531
I would have stayed away from you guys.

242
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,131
I'm worried

243
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,531
if Her Majesty wants to save Wu Lian

244
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,931
to save the face of the court.

245
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,450
If it really happens, what will you do?

246
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,090
This is just a gamble.

247
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,291
The outcome is uncertain.

248
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,771
Please accompany me to the Yanyu Tower.

249
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,450
There

250
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,171
will be more witnesses.

251
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:02,850
Are they crazy?

252
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,891
Those letters were anonymous.

253
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:06,651
We really can't stop it.

254
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,291
They exposed those personal affairs

255
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,850
to the public for their judgment.

256
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,610
They have no sense of shame.

257
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:16,330
Master.

258
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:17,171
What's it?

259
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,090
Mr. Lou has arrived with many officials.

260
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:21,090
They're in the front yard,

261
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,651
calling in maids for questioning.

262
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,810
I have their servitude contracts.

263
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,850
They should know what to say

264
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:29,011
and what not to say.

265
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,371
He's just an inquisitor.

266
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:35,651
I'll meet him now.

267
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,610
(Yanyu Tower)
All of you recount

268
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,291
what was seen and heard here

269
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,210
over the past years.

270
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,131
If any of you withhold any information,
I'll consider it as complicity.

271
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,970
Mr. Lou.

272
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,131
I've been working here
for over a decade.

273
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,771
I'd like to say something.

274
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,131
Too many girls have been hurt

275
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,530
in this place.

276
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,690
It's awful.

277
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:13,530
I am in charge of cleaning.

278
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,250
I've seen Mr. Wu more than once

279
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,690
going to the embroideresses' rooms

280
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,371
alone at night.

281
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,210
And me.

282
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,690
Every time Master went to a lady's room,

283
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,770
the next day,
it was always my responsibility

284
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:28,530
to change her bedsheet.

285
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,450
Do you remember
how many times it happened?

286
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,970
Too many times. I couldn't remember.

287
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,730
When Ding Ru had an accident,

288
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,411
I passed through the backyard.

289
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,091
I saw Master and Ding Ru standing

290
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,611
by the well in the backyard.

291
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:44,651
They had an argument.

292
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:48,290
Afterwards, she jumped into the well.

293
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,891
Who is Ling'er?

294
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,530
Master let Ling'er go

295
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,730
seven years ago.

296
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,811
It was Ling'er

297
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:00,970
who testified

298
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:02,811
that Rulan repeatedly

299
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,010
visited Wu Lian's study at night,

300
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,050
deliberately seducing Wu Lian.

301
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,050
She is just a maidservant.

302
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,091
A maidservant has to do
what she is told.

303
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,290
Yes.

304
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,490
Mr. Wu.

305
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,050
I'm afraid you'll have to go
to the Yamen again.

306
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,091
Take him away.

307
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:42,811
You don't need to.

308
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,171
I'll go with you.

309
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:49,882
(Yanyu Tower)

310
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:53,611
Thank you all.

311
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,210
Over these years,

312
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,611
I've been watching him do evil things.

313
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,131
I have a granddaughter.

314
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,730
Wu Lian has our indentures.

315
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,411
That's why we betrayed our conscience

316
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:10,651
and keep silent about the truth.

317
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,250
- Today, we finally spoke the truth.
- Yes.

318
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,050
And thank you
for giving our indentures back.

319
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,730
If you want to thank someone,

320
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,730
you should thank Ms. Zhang.

321
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,770
Ms. Zhang?

322
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,371
Do you mean Mrs. Wu?

323
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:26,371
Yes.

324
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,290
She gave me your indentures.

325
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,811
What do you all plan
to do in the future?

326
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:37,730
I want to return to my hometown.

327
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,690
I've saved some money over the years.

328
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,730
I might start a small business.

329
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,250
I don't know anyone here,

330
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:47,171
so I don't know where to go.

331
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,171
If anyone has nowhere to go,

332
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,651
you can go to Huangji Embroidery House.

333
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:54,931
They will offer you jobs.

334
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:59,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

335
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:00,171
Great!

336
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,450
(Yanyu Tower)

337
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:08,131
Which one of you is Mr. Wu Lian?

338
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,571
Which one of you is Mr. Wu Lian?

339
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,210
That's me.

340
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,770
Here are your appointment letter
and seal.

341
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:24,010
Thank you.

342
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,250
I need to return to the capital.

343
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:27,290
So I will take my leave.

344
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,331
See you.

345
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,891
Mr. Lou.

346
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,770
As you know,

347
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:40,091
any officials who commit a crime

348
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,931
must be sent to the capital for trial.

349
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,091
In this way,

350
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,970
I'm afraid
you can't handle this case here.

351
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,091
Whether or not I can handle it,

352
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,571
it is not for you to decide.

353
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:54,811
Take him away.

354
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,811
- You...
- Go.

355
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,050
(Three days later)
(Huaizhou Prefecture Yamen)

356
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,730
All the women present are witnesses.

357
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:13,658
(Benevolence)

358
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:17,091
Wu Lian, do you plead guilty?

359
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,571
I'm innocent.

360
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,210
Both witnesses
and physical evidence are present.

361
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,131
You have no choice but to admit.

362
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,331
Even if Wu Lian is found guilty,

363
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,371
the sentence is just three years
in prison.

364
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,331
If he accepts
corporal punishment instead,

365
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,970
after that, he will be able to leave.

366
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,690
- Isn't it too lenient for him?
- Yes.

367
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,730
Those young ladies

368
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,290
were all harmed by him.

369
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:38,730
You can't let him get away with this.

370
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,851
- Yes, don't let him off.
- Yes, don't let him off.

371
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:46,371
Here's the verdict.

372
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:54,891
Wu Lian raped women,

373
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,811
smuggling embroidered goods,
bribing officials,

374
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,331
and killing Li Chunfeng.

375
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,970
The evidence is conclusive
and charges established.

376
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,490
According to the law, he is sentenced
to the punishment of flogging

377
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:08,811
and exiled to the northwest
for three thousand miles,

378
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,530
never to be pardoned in his lifetime.

379
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:12,371
Great!

380
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,250
Lou Mingzhang.

381
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,571
You ignore the law
and seek personal revenge.

382
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,490
I'll report you
to the Censorship Bureau.

383
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,171
I received His Majesty's decree.

384
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,530
This case has a profound impact,
with unforgivable crimes.

385
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:31,811
A heavy sentence should be rendered.

386
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,651
- Good.
- Good.

387
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,331
- Great, a just ruling.

389
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:43,571
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

390
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,091
Men Wan.

391
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:57,770
Take him away.

392
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:01,331
Lou Mingzhang.

393
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:07,411
Lou Mingzhang, I'll kill you.

What are your future plans?

430
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,210
I will return

431
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:01,851
to my old life.

432
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,050
With the help of Mrs. Ning,

433
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:07,331

434
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,371
have their local identities.

435
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,131
Thank you.

436
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,171
What about you?

437
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,050
Returning to Qingshui Nunnery?

438
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,690
No.

439
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,970
Master Huichen was right.

440
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:29,050
I've been stuck in the past.

441
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,091
I do nothing wrong,

442
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,210
but I have imprisoned myself
for seven years.

443
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,250
I'm too silly.

444
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,050
In the future, I will live well.

445
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,530
I think this is what he wants.

446
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:48,611
I'm glad to hear that.

447
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,490
What about you?

448
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,571
Do you really never return
to the Xu family?

449
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,250
I only hope

450
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:01,010
he will have a happy life.

451
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,290
As for me,

452
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,331
I promised Rulan back then

453
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:08,891
to accompany her

454
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,611
to see the splendid views in this world.

455
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,091
I'll settle down in a beautiful place

456
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,250
with a small yard and a swing,

457
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,891
living a peaceful life.

458
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,611
Now, it's time to realize it.

459
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,651
Won't it be hard to meet again?

460
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,490
If it's meant to be, we'll meet again.

461
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,424
(Wait in the boudoir for seven years,
but nothing is forgotten.)

462
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:49,536
(Give a treasure hairpin to the hero.
Ignite a candle light.)

463
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,842
(The wilderness also has emotions.)

464
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:59,872
(Troubled by worldly affairs,
seeking tranquility in the mountains.)

465
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,088
(Pray to Silkworm Mother at the door.
Worship the God of Wealth inside.)

466
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:09,882
(The young man goes
with the wind and returns in time.)

467
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,450
Let's drink it up.

468
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:17,811
To Sanniang.

469
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,131
To Chunfeng.

470
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:23,611
To Rulan.

471
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:37,730
Fortunately, the officials are wise.

472
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:40,210
This time,

473
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,651
Wu Lian can never recover from this.

474
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:45,050
She saved my life years ago.

475
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:46,250
Now,

476
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:48,490
I finally have a chance

477
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:49,851
to repay her.

478
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,371
My leg doesn't get limp for nothing.

479
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,171
Now,

480
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,730
I have finally done justice to Miss Lin.

481
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,008
(An adult girl is fearless.)

482
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:30,250
(Chen Zhiyuan,
the prefect of Huaizhou Prefecture,)

483
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,770
(as the local county governor,)

484
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,010
(you're incompetent in handling cases
and neglects your duties.)

485
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,371
(Such misconduct is inexcusable.)

486
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,730
(Now, you're demoted to the magistrate
of Qingyuan County.)

487
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,611
(You shall depart
for your new office immediately.)

488
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,931
Mr. Chen.

489
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:51,210
It is getting late. Let's go.

490
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,808
(Huaizhou)

491
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,091
You are here to laugh at me.

492
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:19,131
I am here to say goodbye.

493
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:25,331
I haven't lost yet.

494
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,970
Does it hurt?

495
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:37,371
Those women felt more pain
than you do now.

496
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,891
You always compare the women
to fallen plum blossoms.

497
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:50,970
Now you have lost everything,

498
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:54,931
including the hands you value the most.

499
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:00,811
Now,

500
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,450
are you not a fallen plum blossom?

501
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,651
Wu Lian.

502
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:20,171
Have you ever regretted it
even slightly?

503
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:49,490
Lian.

504
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,131
Lady Wu.

505
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,730
You have grown up.

506
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,970
How have you been?

507
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:15,171
They all say I'm wrong.

508
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,970
Lian.

509
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,811
Don't embroider plum blossoms anymore.

510
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,331
Put down the needle.

511
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,571
Lady Wu.

512
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:41,371
Lady Wu.

513
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:09,530
Wu Lian swallowed a needle!

514
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:11,331
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

515
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:14,050
Hurry!

I owed you a favor
when I went to your pharmacy

519
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,851
to buy medicine back then.

520
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,650
Today, I finally paid it back.

521
