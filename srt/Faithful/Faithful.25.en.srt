=Episode 25, The Final Chapter=
(A Mere Dream)

3
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:23,936
(What if none of this ever happened?)

4
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,080
Eat more meat. It helps you grow.

5
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,560
As people say,

6
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,199
to be a scholar
is to be the top of society.

7
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,000
In the future,
Lian will take the imperial examination.

8
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,400
With the help of me,

9
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,639
his official career will be smooth.

10
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,840
Are you serious?

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,199
After so many years of studying,

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,159
you only passed the provincial exam.

13
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Lian will not follow your old path.

14
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,479
Listen, Lian.

15
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,120
We have so many shops.

16
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
Which one do you like?

17
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,719
In my opinion,

18
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,759
you should follow me.

19
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,639
Doing business is the best.

20
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,479
Right?

21
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,879
I think

22
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,319
it's up to Lian himself.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,639
We shouldn't force him.

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
What do you say, Lian?

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,800
The pastry shop cut corners again.

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,919
I could be a pastry cook.

27
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,408
What?

28
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,360
Lian, try this.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,759
Slowly.

30
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,280
Madam, I spent half a month

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,599
on this new recipe.

32
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,240
Please have a try.

33
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,120
I've never eaten

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840
such delicious plum blossom pastry.

35
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,919
I visited the best local pastry shop.

36
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,840
Its pastry recipe
is not as good as mine.

37
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,680
You look so proud.

38
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,400
Let your mother taste this.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,960
My mother has already tasted it.

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,479
She wants to open a pastry shop for me.

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,608
Lian.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,040
What is it?

43
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,352
Madam and Master are discussing things.

44
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,240
They're looking for you.

45
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
What is it?

46
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,600
According to Madam,

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,279
four pastry shops have been open here.

48
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,879
She and Master are planning

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
to open a new shop

50
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,360
in Huaizhou Prefecture.

51
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,720
I had this in mind too.

52
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,079
But I don't go to Huaizhou Prefecture.

53
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,199
Which place do you prefer?

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
I want to go to the capital.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,079
How much longer
until we reach the capital?

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
Sir, we'll be there by afternoon.

57
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,512
Stop.

58
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,319
Hello.

59
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,120
Young man.

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,399
Have some water.

61
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,456
(What if they didn't
have to be the witnesses?)

62
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,759
Clean it.

63
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,000
Again.

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,680
Mr. Xu is a good man.

65
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
You can't always pamper Wan.

66
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,240
Her marriage should be decided now.

67
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,879
She can decide for herself.

68
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,639
I'm not forcing her at all.

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,279
Wan is already of age.

70
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,480
It's time to set her up for a marriage.

71
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,040
So what?

72
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
I'll support her for a lifetime.

73
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,360
Mother!

74
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:08,720
Wan.

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,199
I bought you douhua.

76
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,120
It's still warm.

77
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,240
Eat it while it's warm.

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,959
I'll wash.

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
The water is cool.

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,840
Well,

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
I haven't eaten for several days.

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
Could you lend me some money again?

84
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,319
Just ten copper coins.

85
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,160
I promise you.

86
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,439
I will never bother you again.

87
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,120
We are already divorced.

88
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,600
What are you here for?

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you expect us
to support you for a lifetime?

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
You drunken man, get out of here.

91
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,656
I'm begging you.

92
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:42,976
Get out.

93
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:43,560
No.

94
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,319
- Please.
- Not leaving?

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,240
- Wan.
- Not leaving?

96
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,680
- Mother.
- What are you doing? Don't.

97
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,519
- Don't.
- Mother.

98
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,920
- Get out of here.
- Mother.

99
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,959
I can have this.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
I'll call the police next time.

101
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,000
Mother, he's gone.

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,199
Stop it.

103
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,720
This is the worst day of my life.

104
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,759
Just a bowl of douhua.

105
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,920
I'll buy you another one.

106
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll do it now.

107
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,928
Fine.

108
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,399
Let me clean up.

109
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,800
No need. I'll do it for you.
You two can go now.

110
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,872
Thank you.

111
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,408
Let's go.

112
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,079
I'll do it with you.

113
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,079
Okay.

114
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,639
Luckily, I divorced him years ago.

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,000
Otherwise, the two of us

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,000
will be suffering.

117
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,008
Mother.

118
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong?

119
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,920
Mr. Xu has come back.

120
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
I know. I saw him yesterday.

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
He told me many interesting stories

122
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,879
about Nanyang.

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,480
And he earned money
by doing business there.

124
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,439
Are you falling for him?

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,800
What are you talking about?

126
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm just thinking

127
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,600
I can't always idle at home.

128
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,480
Well,

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,240
how about I do business with him there?

130
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,439
Well...

131
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,160
Don't worry.

132
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,399
I've been planning this for a long time.

133
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,199
And I've asked a lot of people about it.

134
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,399
There are many female merchants
on the boat.

135
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Moreover,

136
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
Mr. Xu will take care of me.

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
It will be fine.

138
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,759
When is the next voyage?

139
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,279
Seven days from now,
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

140
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
We depart at night.

141
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,759
As you wish.

142
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
It will be good for you
to see more of the world.

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,399
Thank you, Mother.

144
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,416
(Douhua)
See you.

145
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
How come you are back again?

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
Didn't you just buy it?

147
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,840
It was snatched away by a stray dog.

148
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,879
Okay, have a seat.

149
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,759
It will be served soon.

150
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:08,064
(Douhua)

151
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,576
Child, find your father

152
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,799
and see why he isn't back yet?

153
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,879
Is he slacking off again?

154
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,920
Okay.

155
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,279
Father.

156
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,639
Why are you playing on the street again?

157
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,799
You finished your homework?

158
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,320
I have finished it.

159
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,080
You can ask my mother.

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,000
Alright, come back.

161
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,799
Deliver the douhua to the Hu family.

162
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,039
Don't be late.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,120
Okay, go ahead.

164
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I spent some extra time on the way back.

165
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
I bought a hairpin for you.

166
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,960
Why spend money on this?

167
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
A hairpin suits a beauty.

168
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,240
Let me put it on for you.

169
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,039
My wife is gorgeous.

170
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,480
Stop it.

171
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,879
Deliver the douhua.

172
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,519
Ms. Liu, you're finally here.

173
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,840
Why are you so late?

174
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,559
Please have a seat.

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,039
His music is extraordinary.

176
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,159
Where did you find him?

177
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,759
He is Yuan Mei, a musician.

178
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,639
A few days ago,
he came here with a theatre troupe.

179
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,600
I heard the troupe mistreated him.

180
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,720
He tried to run away several times
but was caught and brought back.

181
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,960
What a pity! Such a handsome young man.

182
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,720
Mrs. Hu, here's your douhua.

183
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,296
Sorry to keep you waiting.

184
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,600
It's okay. Thank you, Captain Liu.

185
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
I've already resigned.

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Just call me Liu Xin.

187
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll leave you ladies
to enjoy the music.

188
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,600
Take care.

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
Is he handsome?

190
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,120
He's not as good looking as me.

191
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,080
Sir, please wait.

192
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,919
May I have a word with you?

193
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,759
Miss, may I help you?

194
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,759
You're such an extraordinary musician.

195
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,639
Why do you always look so cold?

196
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,039
I'm just a performer.

197
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,720
I'm not here to entertain you.

198
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,759
Most musicians would linger
on the stage a while

199
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,840
after their performance,

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,919
enjoying the applause from the audience.

201
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,840
But why did you just turn to leave?

202
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,279
A piece of music

203
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,519
has been played a million times.

204
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,320
And I've heard the applause
a million times.

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,039
What else can be enjoyed?

206
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,799
These praises and music

207
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,559
are nothing more than cliche.

208
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,679
So are you willing

209
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,519
to be stuck in this cliche?

210
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
You got way too much free time,

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,919
trying to make fun of me.

212
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,559
Sir, you misunderstood me.

213
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,759
I just think that your talent

214
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,840
should not be wasted.

215
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,080
If you want,

216
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,919
I would like to pay your ransom.

217
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,200
In this vast world,

218
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,440
you're sure to accomplish something.

219
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
Pay my ransom?

220
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,159
Yes.

221
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,159
And what do you want me to do for you?

222
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,919
You don't have to do anything.

223
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,960
I value your talent,
and I'm not buying you.

224
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,960
My name is Liu Sanniang.

225
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,639
I live in the Dongyi Lane.

226
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,440
If you decide to leave the opera troupe,

227
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,039
you can come to see me at any time.

228
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,568
Chan.

229
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,559
I forgot my handkerchief.

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,279
You get it back for me.

231
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,759
Yes.

232
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,136
(Hu's House)

233
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,960
You...

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Who's in the carriage?

235
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,840
Who are you?

236
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,279
What do you want?

237
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,279
Did you see a masked man passing by?

238
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,759
I didn't see anyone.

239
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,559
We are arresting a fugitive.

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,679
Please do us a favor.

241
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,320
A fugitive?
What does that have to do with me?

242
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,399
Let's find it out.

243
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,759
I'm sorry. He must be nearby. Search.

244
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,000
Madam, are you alright?

245
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm fine. Let's go.

246
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,919
Thank you for saving me.

247
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,799
What are you accused of?

248
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,279
I rob from the rich to help the poor.

249
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,960
I correct the injustice of the world,

250
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,840
which is generally not accepted.

251
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,639
Don't worry.

252
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,559
I will get off soon.

253
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Where are you heading?

254
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,879
Mofeng Embroidery House.

255
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,039
What for?

256
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,360
They are smuggling embroidery goods

257
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,360
to make a huge profit.

258
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm going there to get some embroidery

259
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,320
for the disaster-stricken people
to exchange for money.

260
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,279
It truly is a heroic act.

261
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Good luck.

262
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,120
You're also righteous.

263
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
I am deeply grateful.

264
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,240
See you.

265
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,504
(Mofeng Embroidery House)

266
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,600
Mr. Feng has not shown up
for a long time.

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,519
Today, he's personally teaching us.

268
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,919
Yes, I'm expecting him
to give me some advice.

269
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,480
Do not whisper to each other.

270
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,120
Focus on your embroidery.

271
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,759
Yes, Mr. Feng.

272
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,200
Mr. Feng.

273
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,440
Bad news, Mr. Feng.

274
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,240
What happened?

275
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,679
I just saw a thief

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,319
break in.

277
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,880
Come with me.

278
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,952
Yes.

279
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,119
Who are you?

280
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,519
Are you Feng Da?

281
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,599
How dare you smuggle royal tribute.

282
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,319
Smuggle royal tribute?

283
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,480
I have always been upright.

284
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,079
Why are you falsely accusing me?

285
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,599
The evidence is right in front of you.

286
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,680
Can you deny it?

287
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,119
They're the practice works
of the embroideress.

288
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,279
Why are they all here?

289
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,759
Are you trying to justify yourself?

290
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,920
Ms. Chen, was it you?

291
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,960
Chen Wenrong.

292
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,119
Tell me the truth.

293
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,359
You're asking me?

294
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,200
Isn't it all because of you?

295
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,559
Because of me?

296
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,720
Mr. Feng.

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,359
You are so infatuated with embroidery

298
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,480
that you never care
about our financial situation.

299
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,359
Recruiting embroidery apprentices

300
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,920
could bring in some income.

301
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,559
But when poor girls came to you,

302
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,119
you don't even charge tuition.

303
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,880
We have long been unable
to make ends meet.

304
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,720
I have been trying to find a way

305
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,640
to sell these embroideries overseas.

306
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,960
Otherwise, we wouldn't even afford food.

307
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,759
And you wouldn't get this fat.

308
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,480
What can I do?

309
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,359
I have no choice.

310
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,960
Ms. Chen.

311
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,960
I was wrong to blame you.

312
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,200
Sorry.

313
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,359
I mistake you.

314
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,559
But smuggling isn't a viable strategy.

315
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,240
You'll have to seek other solutions.

316
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,519
I'll take my leave.

318
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,599
We really don't have much money left.

319
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,400
Mr. Feng.

320
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,119
Allow me to smuggle goods

321
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,799
for the last time.

322
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,839
What do you say?

323
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,680
No.

324
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,599
No way.

325
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,288
But,

326
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,680
we're going to collapse.

327
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,608
Well,

328
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,680
you go to Huangji Embroidery House.

329
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,200
Why?

330
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
The owner of Huangji

331
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,000
has always wanted
to learn my Leigong Stitch Method.

332
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,400
Give this to her.

(Leigong Stitch Method)

334
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,839
Mr. Feng.

335
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,960
It is a unique technique

336
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,880
you have studied for many years.

337
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,136
Forget it.

338
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,039
Give it to her.

339
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,240
My mind is made up.

340
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,799
Maybe if she learns it,

341
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,599
she can further promote this technique.

342
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,640
It would be a good thing.

343
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,279
Remember to charge her
100 guan of money.

344
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,559
Otherwise, do not relent.

345
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

346
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,319
It's my honor to get this from Mr. Feng.

347
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll accept it.

348
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,000
Wait, Ms. Huang.

349
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,319
According to Mr. Feng,

350
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,160
200 guan of money.

351
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,319

100.

354

160.

355

100.

356

130.

357
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,519
That's the lowest price.

358
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,079
Yunniang, see her out.

359
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,279
Wait.

360
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,680
100.

361
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,559
Sold.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Ms. Huang, Mrs. Ning is here.

363
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,648
Let her in.

364
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,640
Ms. Huang, have a seat.

365
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,559
Thank you.

366
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,240
I will set off for the capital tomorrow.

367
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,599
You've helped me a lot over the years.

368
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,000
Luckily, your Huai Embroidery

369
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,599
can please Her Majesty.

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,559
Otherwise, I would have to

371
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
stay here all my life.

372
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,240
Madam, I should thank you.

373
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,799
Without you sending Huai Embroidery
to the capital,

374
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,000
Huangji wouldn't be as successful.

375
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,440
Aren't we just helping each other?

376
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,640
I appreciate it.

377
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,079
When I leave tomorrow,

378
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,279
I don't know when I can see you again.

379
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,319
The capital is not far away.

380
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,640
I will often visit you.

381
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,680
Have you ever thought

382
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,440
about moving Huangji

383
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,680
to the capital?

384
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,079
Now you are famous.

385
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
You will get better and better.

386
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,279
I have thought about it.

387
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,240
Then you can go to the capital with me.

388
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,799
With my help,

389
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,480
you will be more successful.

390
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
Thank you for your kindness.

391
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,960
I'd better give it up.

392
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,279
Why?

393
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,519
Ms. Huang.

394
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,240
Why did you reject her?

395
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,559
The fame of Huai Embroidery

396
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
really exceeds my expectation.

397
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
I remember

398
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,559
when I opened my own business,

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,440
I hoped to make clothes affordable

400
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,720
for the common people.

401
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,119
But now Huangji uses Huai Embroidery

402
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,119
to become exclusive for the nobles,

403
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
which is not what I want.

404
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,799
So do you mean

405
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,759
we will give up Huai Embroidery?

406
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,880
No, I won't.

407
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,519
I can't give up earning money

408
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,720
from rich people.

409
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,759
But from now on,

410
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
I want to make a new team

411
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,920
and hire experienced tailors.

412
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm going to open a clothing store

413
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,920
making affordable clothes
for ordinary people.

414
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,160
Great! I knew it.

415
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
You're smart and capable.

416
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,640
You will have
the biggest embroidery business

417
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,039
and hire the best embroideresses.

418
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,079
Okay, stop buttering me up.

419
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Oh, has Ms. Tian's wedding dress
been altered yet?

420
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,279
It's been done, waiting to be delivered.

421
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,400
Go ahead. Don't delay her wedding.

422
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,119
Yunniang.

423
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,599
Mr. Tian, the wedding dress is altered.
Please have a check.

424
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,200
No need.

425
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,759
Thank you. Please return.

426
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,160
I won't get married. I said it.

427
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
None of you can force me.

428
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,519
What did that guy bewitch you with?

429
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,480
He went to the capital
to take the state exam.

430
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,960
But he's gone for three years.

431
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,359
We never had news from him.

432
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,599
And you still want to wait?

433
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,039
How long are you going to wait?

434
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,039
I will wait until I get old

435
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:58,920
and die.

436
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,799
You...

437
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,000
How could I have a daughter like you?

438
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,759
Ling, your wedding dress is ready.

439
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,880
Put it on.

440
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,119
I guess the bridal sedan chair
should be here soon.

441
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,759
I will cut it into pieces.

442
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,872
If you push me again,

443
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,880
I will go to the Qingshui Nunnery
to become a nun.

444
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,200
You...

445
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,359
Ling.

446
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,160
Let her go.

447
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,759
I'll see where she can go.

448
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,848
What?

449
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,680
Ling.

450
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,160
Chunfeng.

451
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
I knew you would come back.

452
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,200
I knew you were not dead.

453
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,000
Where have you been all these years?

454
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,119
I'm sorry. I'm incompetent.

455
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,079
Three years ago,
I failed the imperial examination.

456
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,279
So I felt too humiliated to be back.

457
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,400
I struggled in the capital
for three years, getting by as a thief.

458
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,000
The provincial examination finally came.

459
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,279
So you passed it this year?

460
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,880
I didn't.

461
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,960
On the day of the exam,
I had a stomach upset.

462
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,279
I didn't make it to the exam room.

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
My parents

464
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,359
are forcing me to marry today.

465
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,480
What should we do?

466
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,240
Ling, let me take you away.

467
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,519
I can support you.

468
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,680
You support me?

469
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,839
I can support myself.

470
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,039
Ling, I'm serious.

471
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,839
I've made good relations
with various business owners.

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,640
They will lend me anything for a living.

473
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,799
We won't worry about our life.

474
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
Why should we borrow? We can work.

475
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,599
We can make a living ourselves.

476
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,559
Okay, let's do it.

477
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,920
I'll listen to you.

478
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,359
Are you willing to go with me?

479
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:20,096
(Tian's House)

480
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,400
Let's go.

481
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,920
What's wrong?

482
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,240
Ling, what are you doing?

483
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,880
Ling.

484
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,599
Is this the family
you're going to marry into today?

485
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,480
What are you doing?

486
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,240
I slapped you because you made me
wait for you for three years

487
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,559
without any news from you.

488
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,799
And you don't trust me. You deserve it.

489
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,039
Yes, I deserve it.

490
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,799
I'll slap myself for you.

491
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,880
If I leave with you today,

492
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,519
what am I to you?

493
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,200
Ling, are you...?

494
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,720
Li Chunfeng, will you marry me?

495
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:44,880
Yes.

496
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,319
Marriage is serious.

497
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,400
If we become husband and wife,

498
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,759
we should be together and never part.

499
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,920
Yes.

500
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,640
I dream of marrying you.

501
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,880
I want to be your husband.

502
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,039
Actually, I'm not interested
in fame or success.

503
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,480
I was afraid
I'm not good enough for you.

504
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm incompetent.

505
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
After these years,

506
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,519
I failed in the end.

507
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,200
I was just scared you wouldn't agree...

508
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
Alright, cut the nonsense.

509
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,319
We'll get married today.

510
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Okay, let's get married.

511
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,039
I, Li Chunfeng,
in the presence of Heaven and Earth,

512
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,440
will take Tian Xiaoling as my wife.

513
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,440
I'll spend the rest of my life with her.

514
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I, Tian Xiaoling,
swearing by the sun and the moon,

515
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,079
will never leave Li Chunfeng.

516
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,440
I'll spend the rest of my life with him.

517
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,160
Why did you get me so much liquor?

518
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,400
I drank too much.

519
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,039
Sorry, I-I was too excited just now.

520
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,880
I scooped it too much.

521
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
Are you okay?

522
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,119
You two are...

523
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,200
Go.

524
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,559
Wait. Once you're here,
you'll be my guests.

525
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,079
Stay and have a drink.

526
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,960
We...

527
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,079
We've had it already.

528
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,848
Let's go.

529
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,480
(Happiness)

530
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,960
Comb your hair.

531
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,400
Wish you a happy life.

532
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,000
Mother, it's enough.

533
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,480
You're so handy.

534
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,440
The wedding dress looks good on you.

535
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,079
Since I was little,

536
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,480
I've been hoping

537
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,599
to wear the wedding dress
that I embroidered myself.

538
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,960
Today, I finally got my wish.

539
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,079
Once you leave home,

540
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,279
many things will change.

541
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,799
You must take good care of yourself.

542
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,224
Mother.

543
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,079
Mr. Lin and I grew up together.

544
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,319
Both our families
have been getting along well.

545
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,559
Moreover, they're just two streets away.

546
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,119
You don't have to worry.

547
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
After all, you're going to leave home.

548
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,880
I can't bear to part with you.

549
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,160
Okay, I'll come home
for dinner every day.

550
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,039
Just don't drive me away.

551
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Nonsense.

552
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,480
It's so pretty.

553
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,119
Rulan, the sedan chair is here. Hurry.

554
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,920
Father, Brother.

555
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,880
I'm leaving.

556
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,839
You're in such a hurry.

557
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,000
Watch your manner.

558
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Come on. I will carry you.

559
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,559
- Brother. I'm up.
- Come on.

560
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,759
Lin Rulan, you are so heavy!

563
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,680
Why does she look so familiar?

564
