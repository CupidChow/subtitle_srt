(A Grand Event Under Manipulation)

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,319
(Embroidery Convention)
What is the convention?

4
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,799
It's for embroidery masters
from all around

5
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
to sit together to exchange
and improve their embroidery skills

6
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,719
and for exhibition and sale purposes.

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,000
I see.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
And it's going to be held
in our prefecture this year.

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,159
In previous years,

10
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,159
many wealthy merchants
from overseas came by ship.

11
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,120
Our embroidery abroad
is a highly sought-after product.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
Everyone,

13
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,280
determined by the Embroidery Office
of the capital,

14
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,479
the convention
which is held every five years

15
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,000
will be organized
by our embroidery school this year.

16
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,759
It will kick off tonight.

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,000
Then, embroidery masters
from all over the country

18
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,879
will gather in the Yanyu Tower.

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
This conference...

20
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,000
Wu Lian must have built connections

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,960
with the Embroidery Office.

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,439
Otherwise,

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,000
how would he get this honor?

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,639
There will be also
the dancing and singing of courtesans.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
I wonder which famous courtesan Mr. Wu

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,639
has invited.

27
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,002
(Yanyu Tower)

28
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,639
How can they treat you so poorly?

29
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,159
Tonight, we will have to rely on you

30
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,319
to dance for the banquet.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Even if I die in this tower,

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,759
I will not dance for you.

33
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,479
But the news has already gotten out.

34
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,199
If you still insist on refusing,

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm afraid it would
disappoint the guests.

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
You want to use me as bait

37
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,400
to draw out Meng Wan and the others.

38
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,759
Liu Sannv,

39
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,978
of all the women in this house,

40
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,098
Meng Wan is boring,

41
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,577
Lin Rulan was ignoble,

42
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:01,577
and Ding Ru was like
a weak, vulnerable rabbit,

43
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:05,017
but only you,
having superior intelligence,

44
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:08,177
succeeded in protecting your chastity.

45
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:11,818
But what a pity.

46
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:15,737
You ended up being a prostitute.

47
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,697
You're underestimating Meng Wan.

48
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:29,737
She can see through your little trick

49
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,538
at a glance.

50
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:40,978
And so what?

51
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:43,978
They will eventually come.

52
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:49,617
You two, feed her,
apply the medicine on her

53
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:51,418
and dress her up.

54
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:52,658
- Yes.
- Yes.

55
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:11,458
This prefecture
has been quite lively recently.

56
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:16,377
Are you referring to
the Embroidery Convention?

57
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,497
Yes.

58
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:20,617
I hear that a courtesan
has been invited to liven up the event.

59
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,377
Mr. Wu is truly not an ordinary person.

60
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:26,898
If this continues,

61
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:28,858
Huaizhou

62
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:32,177
won't be big enough for him.

63
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:39,817
What's wrong?

64
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:42,898
Nothing.

65
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,898
The repair of the courtyard
is nearing completion.

66
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,817
I was going
to check it out after dinner.

67
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:49,858
Thank you.

68
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,497
The needlework is flexible,

69
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:18,817
and the style is innovative.

70
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:20,858
Congrats, Ms. Huang.

71
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,257
The gift is finally completed.

72
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,338
I've noticed you haven't gone
to Xu's courtyard recently.

73
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:29,978
Did something happen?

74
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:36,177
I completely broke up
with the Yanyu Tower

75
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,218
and took on this gift project

76
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,898
impulsively.

77
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:41,497
But now,

78
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,937
it looks like
that could spell trouble for us.

79
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,858
Are we still going
to the Ning Mansion today

80
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:49,778
to report the completion of the gift?

81
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,898
Well, I'll go there myself.

82
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,817
Mr. Shen.

83
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,057
Another urging letter from the capital?

84
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,418
Yes, someone has leaked
the news in the capital that you let

85
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,057
a criminal go for personal reasons.

86
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,418
A few of our people
have been arrested for questioning.

87
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,098
The commander has ordered you to return

88
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,298
immediately.

89
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,016
(Commander orders Mr. Shen
to return to the capital promptly.)

90
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:27,978
Mr. Shen, we really have to go back.

91
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,777
The commander said that if you didn't,

92
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,298
he would revoke your badge.

93
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:34,817
Let's not meddle
in the affairs here anymore.

94
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:41,498
I'll go get the horse.

95
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,178
Let's set off now.

96
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:43,978
Yes.

97
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,298
Mr. Li, you're here again.

98
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:02,377
This money is definitely enough.

99
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:04,257
Our accounts are now square.

100
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:06,337
Go pay your rent

101
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,217
to keep this shop.

102
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,498
This money wouldn't be...

103
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:13,257
(Sifang Bookstore)
I pawned all my family's ancient books.

104
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:14,738
It's perfectly legit.

105
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:18,298
I have to go to the eastern market
with the rest of this

106
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:20,817
to pay off those snack shops as well.

107
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,418
So you are really paying back the money.

108
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,770
What else?

109
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,810
Why the long face?

110
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,170
The gentlemen of old never

111
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,090
cease a relationship with harsh words.

112
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,810
Don't ask.

113
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:53,248
(Huashi Convoy)

114
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,009
Feng Da,

115
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,570
this cargo escort task

116
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,609
will take more than two months,

117
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,249
but the pay is quite generous.

118
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,450
It's enough to cover
half a year's salary

119
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:02,729
for your people.

120
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,249
Why the long face?

121
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,529
I know.

122
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,850
Yes, Mr. Feng.

123
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:09,170
You're familiar with the route.

124
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,769
All the gangs on the road
will do you a favor.

125
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,769
It's just a long distance.

126
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,129
Boss, you can ride
in a carriage or on a horse.

127
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:17,249
We won't make you too tired.

128
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,850
Our men are all waiting for money.

129
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,129
Alright.

130
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,210
When did you become so nagging?

131
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,009
All of you, cheer up.

132
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,570
We are leaving.

133
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:29,170
Let's go.

134
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,369
Be careful on the road.

135
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:39,098
(Wait in the boudoir for seven years,
but nothing is forgotten.)

136
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,216
(Give a treasure hairpin to the hero.
Ignite a candle light.)

137
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,584
(Pray to Silkworm Mother at the door.
Worship the God of Wealth inside.)

138
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,272
(A leaf in the vast ocean, floating
and sinking between heaven and earth.)

139
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:50,688
(The young man goes with the wind
and returns in time.)

140
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:53,248
(The path to being an official is
unpredictable as debts are hard to pay.)

141
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:55,226
(Ning Mansion)

142
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,609
(These red fireworks
can be used to signal.)

143
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,850
(When it's lit,
there will be a buzzing sound,)

144
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,970
(and it will shoot into the sky.)

145
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,050
(If any of us)

146
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,649
(is trapped in danger,)

147
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,489
(set it off.)

148
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,090
(No matter what,)

149
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,649
(the rest)

150
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,649
(must rush to the rescue.)

151
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,170
Who's setting off fireworks?

152
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,769
It's so pretty.

153
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,210
Leave it.

154
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,409
Let's drink.

155
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,930
Mr. Feng, let's go,

156
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:45,889
or we'll be late.

157
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,850
Go.

158
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,009
Go.

159
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,729
Mr. Shen, the city gate
is about to close.

160
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,330
- Let's go.
- Yes.

161
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:14,618
(Ning Mansion)

162
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,850
Master,

163
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:57,529
what brings you here?

164
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,649
Are there any others in this yard?

165
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,090
Why would you ask such a question?

166
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,850
Since a few days ago,

167
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,690
there's been some gossip
among the servants.

168
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,210
They say you go out every day

169
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,050
for the repair of this yard
on the surface.

170
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,129
But actually,

171
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,170
it's because you have an affair.

172
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,409
What do you think of the rumor?

173
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:24,970
It is completely unfounded.

174
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,594
You don't believe me?

175
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:30,995
I do,

176
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,714
so I severely reprimanded

177
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,035
those servants

178
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,115
and warned them

179
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:38,995
that if there was anyone
creating rumors again,

180
00:15:39,194 --> 00:15:40,314
they'd be kicked out immediately.

181
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,434
Then why the fuss now?

182
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,074
Just now, a maid came to report.

183
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:50,474
She claimed to have actually seen
a strange man living in this courtyard.

184
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:52,275
Do you admit it?

185
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,194
There are indeed two men living

186
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:56,194
in the rooms of this courtyard.

187
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,155
They are both friends of mine.

188
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:00,714
You admit it.

189
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:02,434
Master,

190
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,515
the identities of the men living here

191
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,515
will be revealed by a search.

192
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:08,314
So it's really you.

193
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,714
You like to pretend to be gentle,

194
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:14,314
but you're actually
ruthless and unfaithful.

195
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,395
Today I caught you red-handed.

196
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:19,554
Let's see if you can escape by words.

197
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:20,674
Shut up.

198
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,035
Master,

199
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,235
don't be deceived by this tramp anymore.

200
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:26,554
To my knowledge,

201
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,474
there are more than two strange men
living in this courtyard.

202
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,275
If we don't search now,
I'm afraid they might escape.

203
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:45,074
Let's start the search.

204
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,155
There's no need to search.

205
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:04,835
This is Shen Mu
from the Imperial Guard Bureau.

206
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,075
The Imperial Guard Bureau?

207
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,994
Now that Madame Xu
has acknowledged us as friends,

208
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:12,075
I'll stand up for her.

209
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,274
I am Li Chunfeng.

210
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,194
What are you doing?

211
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:22,635
Quite a few people.

212
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,274
Was something stolen?

213
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:26,194
Aren't you Officer Xu?

214
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,395
This is a giant misunderstanding.

215
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,875
Acting tough when you were arguing,

216
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:33,474
but one little signal from her

217
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,434
and you all rolled over.

218
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,555
How pathetic!

219
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,555
Madame Xu really isn't picky.

220
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,234
She even has an affair with me.

221
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:45,194
What does she see in me?

222
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:48,835
My ugly face or my lame leg?

223
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:51,635
Or is it my seven years spent in prison?

224
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,075
This young lady

225
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,835
seems to match me well.

226
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:57,754
We're quite a pair, one crude

227
00:17:58,315 --> 00:17:59,595
and the other malicious.

228
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,795
Why don't we try together?

229
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:10,954
Mr. Xu,

230
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:12,595
my name is Liu Xin.

231
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,115
I used to be a constable in the Yamen.

232
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,714
Now I am in distress.

233
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:18,714
Your wife has given me shelter

234
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:21,115
in this courtyard.

235
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,434
If you mind it,

236
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,994
I will pay you as compensation.

237
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,194
Who are these people?

238
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:34,994
You must tell me the truth.

239
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:37,674
Master,

240
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,514
whether I'm blamable or not,

241
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,714
I do have something important
to discuss with my friends tonight.

242
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:47,034
So could you please
trust me one last time

243
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,194
and leave for now?

244
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,635
Once tonight's matter is resolved,

245
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,355
I will come back to tell you the truth.

246
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,954
At that time,
whether you want to report me

247
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:56,994
to the Yamen or kill me,

248
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,674
it's all up to you.

249
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,754
Don't believe the cunning words
of this treacherous woman, Master.

250
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:19,954
If we don't...

251
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,155
When do you have the right
to tell me what to do?

252
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:24,954
Master, I'm sorry.

253
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:26,355
I wouldn't dare.

254
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,835
Come back early.

255
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,714
I'll wait for you.

256
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:37,595
Thank you, Master.

257
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:56,875
I highly appreciate
your coming as promised.

258
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:06,315
Who is in danger? Where is the enemy?

259
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:08,754
Take my hammer!

260
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,674
Where are the people?

261
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,555
There are two divisions
of the Dali Court in the capital.

262
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:31,395
The Left Court re-examines charges
from all places and questionable cases.

263
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:34,674
The Right Court tries criminal cases
involving the officials in the capital.

264
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,155
After Wu Lian got to
the capital this time,

265
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:40,474
he first secretly met someone
in the Right Court,

266
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,234
then he went to the Imperial Guard camp

267
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,434
to seek a position
of the director of Embroidery Office.

268
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,194
His intention is clear.

269
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,635
He wants to make himself
an official of the capital

270
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,395
through the Embroidery Convention
tonight.

271
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:52,595
Even if it's a petty official position,

272
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,274
once we allow him to succeed,

273
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:56,875
all the cases involving him
will be handed over

274
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,155
to the Right Court

275
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:01,795
and he'll be completely out of the grasp

276
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,115
of Mr. Lou and us.

277
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,155
Wu Lian

278
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,434
made it public that Liu Sanniang
would perform at the convention.

279
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:08,434
It must be intentional.

280
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:10,994
He wants to...

281
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:13,674
Lure us inside.

282
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,795
To trap us in.

283
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:18,194
Wu Lian knows we can see through him,

284
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,954
but he knows we have to go.

285
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,034
No matter what,

286
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,595
we can't let the convention

287
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:25,954
end successfully

288
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:28,954
or just leave Liu Sanniang in there.

289
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,795
This banquet is a trap,

290
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,954
but we have to risk our lives.

291
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,714
What's your plan?

292
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:43,875
This is petroleum.

293
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:45,875
You are going to...

294
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,434
We have only two missions tonight.

295
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:49,954
One is to save Sanniang.

296
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:52,555
The other is to burn the house.

297
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:16,474
People from the Huangji Embroidery House
sent some embroidery.

298
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,714
They want to participate too.

299
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:20,234
Since they are here, let them in.

300
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:21,115
Yes.

301
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:25,395
Director Yan,

302
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:28,714
I didn't let you down, did I?

303
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:32,194
You are quite impressive.

304
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:36,234
It might even surpass
those held in the capital before.

305
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:39,714
Mr. Wu, they're here.

306
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:43,635
Commander Xie, thanks a lot.

307
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:52,714
These soldiers are all

308
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,395
at your disposal tonight, Mr. Wu.

309
00:22:57,754 --> 00:22:58,714
Gentlemen,

310
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:01,395
once the lion dance

311
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:03,355
in the front yard starts tonight,

312
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:04,714
you take advantage of it

313
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:07,034
and surround
the main building of this house.

314
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:09,635
Don't let a single fly out.

315
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:10,714
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:13,954
If this conference
doesn't conclude successfully

317
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:15,954
or win the praise of the whole court,

318
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,994
I'm afraid I won't be able

319
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:20,795
to help you with the position you want.

320
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:23,555
At that time, don't come to me again.

321
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,075
Please rest assured.

322
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,155
Everything has been arranged well.

323
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:30,994
There will be no mishaps.

324
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:35,315
The bait is already in the water.

325
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,954
Anyone willing to take the bait tonight?

326
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:55,915
Stop trying.

327
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:57,835
You just can't unlock it.

328
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:06,835
Behave yourself.

329
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,434
Don't do anything stupid.

330
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:10,194
Even if

331
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:13,234
I were to die here tonight,

332
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,155
I would never let them fall

333
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:20,034
into your trap to save me.

334
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:24,434
Now that you're in this house,

335
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,714
your life is no longer in your control.

336
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:28,474
Stay put.

337
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,234
You are here.

338
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,555
This way, please.

339
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:16,858
(Yanyu Tower)

340
00:25:29,514 --> 00:25:30,595
This is quite exquisite.

341
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,674
May I ask you where the restroom is?

342
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:48,075
Lady, please follow me.

343
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,234
This way.

344
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:58,194
Please watch your step.

345
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,034
What's wrong?

346
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:04,994
Are you okay?

347
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:12,915
Where is Liu Sanniang?

348
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:15,315
P-P-Please spare me, sir.

349
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:18,034
I've never heard of the name.

350
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:21,315
She's the courtesan Mr. Wu invited over.

351
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,954
S-S-She's locked on the top floor.

352
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,274
Where is it?

353
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:26,315
How's she?

354
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:27,355
Where's the key?

355
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:28,835
She's alive.

356
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:30,795
Mr. Wu always carries the key with him.

357
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:32,395
You can't rescue her.

358
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,795
Which penthouse is it?

359
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:39,875
The highest one.

360
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:41,514
Really taking your time.

361
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,875
This embroidery mainly features

362
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:54,875
the Yanyu Embroidery technique,

363
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:58,395
as well as all the other techniques,

364
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,155
such as vertical stitching,

365
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:02,395
interlaced stitching,

366
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,795
flat stitching,

367
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:08,234
and even the layering stitching method
of the Miao nationality.

368
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:10,474
I present such an embroidery today

369
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:12,434
because as the organizer

370
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,514
of this event,

371
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:18,234
I want to integrate
the strengths of all schools,

372
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:21,754
and pay tribute to others in the field.

373
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:24,155
Moreover, through this piece,

374
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:25,674
I want to prove to the world

375
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:27,315
that a true master of embroidery,

376
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:30,034
while skilled in various techniques,

377
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,875
is only devoted
to perfecting one of them.

378
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:35,754
- Great.
- Well said.

379
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,395
Using needles and thread
instead of brushes and ink,

380
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:40,595
the embroidery Mr. Wu made

381
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:43,635
is even better
than the original painting.

382
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,674
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:48,234
I see landscapes at varying distances.

384
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:50,835
The building is of great grandeur.

385
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:54,155
The flowers and birds
exhibit charming postures.

386
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,595
Producing something so excellent,

387
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:57,954
you have truly gifted hands.

388
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:00,994
I truly admire you.

389
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:01,875
Yes.

390
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,474
Mr. Wu, this is a masterpiece.

391
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:04,555
You all overpraise me.

392
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:07,075
This is the most beautiful piece
I've seen tonight.

393
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:08,274
Is it for sale?

394
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:09,474
Mr. Wu,

395
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,155
the envoy is very fond of your work.

396
00:28:13,754 --> 00:28:15,555
May I ask if it's for sale?

397
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:17,274
Thank you for your appreciation.

398
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,075
It is not for sale now,

399
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,994
but there are many better ones here.

400
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,875
If you're interested,

401
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:28,194
you could stay here for a few days.

402
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:31,395
Later, I would personally
show you one by one.

403
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,915
- Thank you, Mr. Wu.
- Thank you, Mr. Wu.

404
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:36,315
Congratulations, Mr. Wu.

405
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:39,795
I'm curious about the reason
why you prefer fallen plum blossoms.

406
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,234
I find the ones on the branches

407
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,595
too kitsch.

408
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:48,434
Only when they fall piece by piece
are they the most beautiful.

409
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:50,194
I don't agree.

410
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,434
Who is this person?

411
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,315
She looks strange to me.

412
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,034
Which shop is she from?

413
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,555
A lady once told me

414
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,115
the blossoms blooming proudly
on the branches

415
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:06,115
are prettier than those fallen ones.

416
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:14,034
Let's take a look.

417
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,555
The embroidery is extraordinary.

418
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:21,234
We are from the Huangji Embroidery House
in this prefecture.

419
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,474
This is made using
our unique Huai Embroidery skill.

420
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:26,555
The locals

421
00:29:26,835 --> 00:29:28,635
must have heard about it.

422
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:31,555
This embroidery is called
the Plum Blossoms in Huaizhou.

423
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:32,754
No hidden meaning.

424
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,315
It's just the plum blossom forest
outside our city gate.

425
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:38,635
In early spring, you can smell
the fragrance from afar.

426
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:42,315
It's utterly vulgar.

427
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:51,115
What do you think?

428
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:52,875
An incomparable piece of work.

429
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:55,875
What are they saying?

430
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,714
The envoy thinks

431
00:29:58,754 --> 00:29:59,754
that this embroidery

432
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:02,954
is unlike all other ones
at the event today.

433
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,555
Not only is it unique,

434
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:06,994
the skills shown in it are also superb.

435
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:09,514
He wants to buy it

436
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:12,234
to present it to their queen.

437
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:40,595
I knew there would be an ambush.

438
00:31:06,474 --> 00:31:09,635
Everyone, please wait here for a moment.

439
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,835
I will be back soon.

440
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:22,434
Sanniang.

441
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:25,595
- Sanniang.
- Sanniang.

442
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,155
Run. It's a trap!

443
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,994
- Hurry.
- Sanniang, come on.

444
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:32,395
Come on.

445
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,674
You fools.

446
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,674
This is a trap set by Wu Lian.

447
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,234
A lot of soldiers are downstairs,

448
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:43,875
who were brought
by Wu Lian from the capital.

449
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:45,954
We know it's a trap,

450
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:47,674
but we cannot just sit by
and do nothing.

451
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,994
Since we invited you from Xunzhou,

452
00:31:50,155 --> 00:31:51,595
we have to send you back safely.

453
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:57,994
What are you holding in your hands?

454
00:31:58,315 --> 00:31:59,234
Petroleum.

455
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:00,795
The fate of the Yanyu Tower

456
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,954
is going to end tonight.

457
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:08,155
Dear guests, please move to the front.

458
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:10,155
The lion dance and the fireworks show

459
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:11,714
are about to begin.

460
00:32:12,034 --> 00:32:12,835
There's a lion dance!

461
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:14,274
- Come on.
- Let's go.

462
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,434
- Go.
- Let's watch the show.

463
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:24,595
Li Chunfeng,

464
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:25,795
is it the key or not?

465
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:26,954
Why can't I open it?

466
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:28,795
I searched all over Wu Lian

467
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:29,994
only to find this key.

468
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:32,115
Rat! Darn it.

469
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:34,595
Feng Da, smash it!

470
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,538
(Yanyu Tower)

471
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:52,754
Go ahead.

472
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,674
Yes, sir.

473
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,315
Don't waste your energy anymore.

474
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:08,555
Just knowing

475
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,635
you were willing to come save me

476
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,355
makes me content enough.

477
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:18,954
Hurry and go!

478
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:20,194
There's not much time left.

479
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:21,434
Hurry up!

480
00:33:23,395 --> 00:33:24,274
Sanniang.

481
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:29,234
Meng Wan, you're the decider.

482
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,355
Don't hesitate. Leave here!

483
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:33,994
That's forcing us

484
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:35,754
to be disloyal.

485
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:38,954
At worst, let's perish with them.

486
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:42,754
You think that's heroic?

487
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,754
Perishing together?

488
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:46,875
That's asking for death for nothing.

489
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:48,595
Can you kill Wu Lian?

490
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,075
Can you avenge your lame leg?

491
00:33:53,194 --> 00:33:55,555
If we all die here tonight,

492
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,434
it will only make
Wu Lian's plot succeed.

493
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,274
The ultimate winner will be him.

494
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:02,795
All our efforts will be wasted.

495
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:06,674
Don't be foolish again.

496
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,195
Hurry up and leave!

497
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:10,915
Leave!

498
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:21,594
- Don't!
- Sanniang.

499
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:32,634
(Yanyu Tower)
Awesome!

500
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:41,114
- It's good.
- Great!

501
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,395
- Good.
- Great.

502
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:50,994
- Amazing.
- Wonderful.

503
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:54,434
Li Chunfeng,

504
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:56,434
I once told you

505
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:59,315
great things couldn't be achieved
without sacrifice.

506
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:00,514
You didn't believe it.

507
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,954
Today, I am proving it

508
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:05,474
with my own life.

509
00:35:06,994 --> 00:35:08,795
Why did you have to be so foolish?

510
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:13,755
Meng Wan,

511
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,235
please take good care

512
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:19,915
of the man and the peacock in Xunzhou.

513
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:23,434
In fact, seven years ago,

514
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:26,954
when I stood in court with Rulan,

515
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,915
I was already prepared
to make the sacrifice.

516
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,395
You don't have to feel guilty.

517
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:37,795
Promise me. Go downstairs now, okay?

518
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:42,195
Burn this whole building to ashes.

519
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:46,315
Burn this foul place to the ground.

520
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,715
Completely ruin the embroidery event.

521
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:53,434
You mustn't let Wu Lian succeed.

522
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,755
I promise you.

523
00:35:57,474 --> 00:35:58,315
Liu Xin,

524
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,034
I have something else to ask of you.

525
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,994
If you really want
to be a hero for me once,

526
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,034
run away,

527
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:08,474
bring Wu Lian to justice
and seek revenge for me.

528
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:09,994
Will you?

529
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:12,594
I tried the shoes you gave to me.

530
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:15,554
They fit.

531
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:21,954
I'll take them as your payment.

532
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:26,434
Last time, I spoke out of anger

533
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:28,795
in the courtyard.

534
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,675
Don't take it seriously.

535
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,994
A life

536
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:36,835
for this house.

537
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:39,315
It's worth it.

538
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:42,994
A life

539
00:36:45,114 --> 00:36:46,715
for the friendship with you.

540
00:36:50,915 --> 00:36:51,715
It's worth it.

541
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,195
Go!

542
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:57,675
There's a fire.

543
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,634
- Fire.
- Fire.

544
00:37:59,795 --> 00:38:00,715
What...

545
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:05,195
What's happening?

546
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:09,554
Go put it out.

547
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:10,675
Yes, sir.

548
00:38:10,715 --> 00:38:11,875
My work is still inside.

549
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:13,074
My Night Feast Embroidery.

550
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,315
Let's put out the fire.

551
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:15,275
Come on, everyone.

552
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:16,315
My work is still inside.

553
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:19,434
