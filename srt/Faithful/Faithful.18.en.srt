(Seven years later)

3
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,722
It's been seven years.

4
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,883
If I make innocent people
lose their lives

5
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:35,803
because of the old case,

6
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:38,922
it'll be my fault.

7
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:44,282
But should I give up

8
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,282
all these years of hard work

9
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:51,443
because of that?

(The Seven Righteous Ones Split Up)

12
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:12,003
Was Mrs. Zheng brought back?

13
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:13,243
She's still unconscious.

14
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,202
At noon yesterday,

15
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:17,482
she swallowed
a lot of oleanders from the yard.

16
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,362
Fortunately, her husband
discovered in time,

17
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,123
and forced licorice water
down her throat,

18
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,042
which saved her life.

19
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:29,322
Who went to see Mrs. Zheng
a few days ago?

20
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:32,683
It wasn't me.

21
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:34,322
And it wasn't me.

22
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:35,683
Ms. Huang,

23
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:38,443
why are you asking this now?

24
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:41,563
You want to send the person to the Yamen

25
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,163
and charge the one with murder?

26
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:46,202
Sanniang, that's not what I meant.

27
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,042
Madame Xu,

28
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,123
what exactly are you thinking?

29
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,522
Can you be clear about this?

30
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,243
For the past seven years,

31
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,522
I've kept myself on a constant edge.

32
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:02,642
It isn't entirely unselfish,

33
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:04,762
but I think it is justified

34
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,403
because it's for a righteous cause.

35
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:08,602
However,

36
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:10,802
the matter about Mrs. Zheng

37
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:12,723
struck me

38
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,522
and made me begin doubting it.

39
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:17,642
So,

40
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,883
you will give up
looking for Tian Xiaoling?

41
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:23,402
Sanniang, to be honest with you,

42
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:25,363
I haven't figured out

43
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:26,762
how to solve the current dilemma.

44
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,923
I've been thinking all the way
out of the Qingshui Nunnery yesterday.

45
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,043
If I go to beat the drum alone,

46
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,722
will I end up like Rulan,

47
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:38,683
following the same path again?

48
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:41,762
So, are you afraid?

49
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:43,363
Yes, I am.

50
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:46,322
But I'm not afraid of death.

51
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:47,883
I'm afraid my death is not worth it.

52
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,282
I fear that our self-righteous actions

53
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,522
will instead push the women

54
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:52,803
who have barely gotten over it

55
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:54,522
and started a new life

56
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:56,842
back to the abyss.

57
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,465
Those who have achieved great things

58
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,425
must be both kind

59
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:09,026
and decisive.

60
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,186
With such indecision,

61
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,545
how can you help Rulan take revenge?

62
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:17,626
Forget it.

63
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,026
If there's no way,

64
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,305
just ambush in the Yanyu Tower at night.

65
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:22,465
With a sack on top,

66
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,345
we just take revenge

67
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:25,586
and kill him.

68
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:26,826
Feng, let's go.

69
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,425
It should have been this way.

70
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,465
Today, I will avenge Miss Lin's death.

71
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:33,026
What do you mean?

72
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,026
I caught Wu Lian on the boat.

73
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:38,146
If we split up today, he is mine.

74
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,305
Shen Mu!

75
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,386
Everyone.

76
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,266
Everyone, keep calm.

77
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,146
At least we've got
the Falling Blossom Embroidery.

78
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,066
That's the key evidence in this case.

79
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,865
I will send it to the Yamen later

80
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,345
and ask about Mr. Lou's opinions.

81
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,386
If looking for the victims to testify
for us is a fruitless attempt,

82
00:05:58,465 --> 00:05:59,946
we'll think of another way.

83
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:01,345
How can it be fruitless?

84
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,465
You just tried it once,

85
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,345
and then you concluded that?

86
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:06,985
Madame Xu,

87
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,706
people don't believe
the testimony of prostitutes.

88
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,626
But Master Jueming

89
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,706
will surely make them believe

90
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,266
and stir up a huge wave.

91
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,186
Have you realized it now?

92
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:21,225
She is our trump card

93
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,026
and our only hope.

94
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:24,665
Of course I know it.

95
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,665
But if we harm the innocent for that,

96
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,266
then what'll be

97
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:32,386
the difference between us and Wu Lian?

98
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,266
Great things can't be achieved
without sacrifice.

99
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:39,203
Since we can face the past,

100
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,843
why can't Tian Xiaoling?

101
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,563
If you don't want to be the bad guy,

102
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,003
I'll do it for you.

103
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:45,963
I'm going to Qingshui Nunnery right now.

104
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,794
No matter what, I have to bring her

105
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:50,315
down from the mountain.

106
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,034
Great things can't be achieved
without sacrifice.

107
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,714
Why can't the person
who makes sacrifices be you?

108
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:06,914
How do you want me to do it?

109
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,315
By sleeping with someone

110
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,394
or by becoming someone's concubine?

111
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:13,034
If it can be done,

112
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,955
even if it means going
to the ends of the earth, I'll do it!

113
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,675
You lowly woman!

114
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,315
How dare you compare yourself to her?

115
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,515
Mr. Li.

116
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,394
I don't care
if you're going to harm others,

117
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:32,195
but you can't do it to Tian Xiaoling.

118
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:34,315
I absolutely won't let her

119
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:36,195
be harmed by this matter even slightly.

120
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:38,034
If she wants to cover her ears,

121
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,075
I'll destroy my ears
and stay out of this.

122
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,794
If she wants to be a nun for life,

123
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:45,755
I'll go to the Qingshui Nunnery
to hit the morning bell every day.

124
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,195
If you have any intentions
towards her again,

125
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:56,115
it is forcing me
to fight you with my life.

126
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:25,632
(Troubled by worldly affairs,
seeking tranquility in the mountains.)

127
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,435
Lady, this is a letter sent
by a servant earlier.

128
00:08:58,202 --> 00:08:59,450
(To Liu Sanniang)

129
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,675
Who knows I live here?

130
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,395
That servant didn't say it.

131
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,234
He just handed me the letter and left.

132
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,698
(Let's meet around 5 p.m.
at the Tianshui Teahouse.)

133
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:18,234
(Tianshui Teahouse)

134
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:32,275
I knew it was you.

135
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:34,075
Lady Sanniang,

136
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,955
you're truly smart.

137
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:39,955
It doesn't need to be so smart.

138
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,114
The letter

139
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,994
has a faint smell of putrefying flesh,

140
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,555
which is difficult to hide.

141
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,874
I guess in Huaizhou Prefecture,

142
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,675
only you

143
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,155
stink.

144
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,754
Please sit.

145
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,834
I just underestimated you.

146
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:04,395
I didn't expect

147
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:08,315
that you would know where I stay.

148
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:14,275
Meng Wan from the Xu family.

149
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,675
The former Captain, Liu Xin.

150
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,714
Huang Jiaojiao
from the Huangji Embroidery House.

151
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,195
Shen Mu of the Imperial Guard Bureau.

152
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:23,155
Feng Da of the Huashi Convoy.

153
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:25,514
The famous thief
in the eastern market, Li Chunfeng.

154
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:26,594
And you,

155
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,035
Xunzhou's top courtesan, Liu Sanniang.

156
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,754
Are there any mistakes?

157
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:32,234
Within just one day,

158
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:34,594
you've uncovered so much

159
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:36,795
about us.

160
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:38,874
I am not that capable.

161
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:41,874
Someone felt
that Madame Xu may not succeed

162
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,915
and feared that they will regret it,

163
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,675
so he pledged allegiance to me.

164
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,874
Sanniang, you're smart.

165
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,915
Meng Wan is hard to succeed.

166
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:54,275
It's not too late to come to my side.

167
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,195
You're trying to deceive me?

168
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,435
Let me say a few more words.

169
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,234
This morning,

170
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:06,634
you seven people met at Xu's house.

171
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:08,795
Meng Wan was indecisive.

172
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:10,754
You wanted to go
to the Qingshui Nunnery,

173
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,075
but Li Chunfeng opposed
and drew his sword.

174
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:14,754
You finally disbanded in discord.

175
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:16,874
Who tipped you off?

176
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,395
It doesn't matter.

177
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,395
The facts are right in front of you.

178
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:23,435
It's up to you to make the decision.

179
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,818
(A leaf in the vast ocean,
floating between heaven and earth.)

180
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:04,555
What's wrong?

181
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:07,874
Liu Sanniang,

182
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,435
what were you doing

183
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:11,474
this afternoon?

184
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:14,035
Sanniang,

185
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,714
just tell the truth.

186
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:17,754
Li Chunfeng saw it.

187
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,275
What did he see?

188
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,634
Terrace on the second floor
of the Tianshui Teahouse.

189
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:24,275
You and Wu Lian
were in joyful conversation.

190
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:37,555
Are you doubting me?

191
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:38,834
Don't get mad yet.

192
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,395
Just provide an explanation.

193
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:41,834
I trust you.

194
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,634
Sanniang,

195
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:47,675
just now I wanted to give Mr. Lou
the Falling Blossom Embroidery,

196
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,594
only to find it disappeared.

197
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,514
It is the only evidence
we currently have in hand.

198
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,354
What does this have to do with me?

199
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:58,754
I don't doubt you,

200
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,035
but I still hope you can explain clearly

201
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,514
why you went to see Wu Lian.

202
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:04,795
This afternoon, someone sent a letter,

203
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,874
inviting me to a teahouse.

204
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:10,275
Upon arrival,
I discovered it was Wu Lian.

205
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,555
I intended

206
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,395
to discuss it with you
when I entered the yard.

207
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:17,114
Believe it or not.

208
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:23,634
Did he say anything?

209
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,714
Someone has been bribed

210
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,594
to spy for him.

211
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,035
All the background information about us

212
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:33,955
has been given away.

213
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,754
Could this be

214
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:38,594
his trick?

215
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:39,955
I didn't believe it at first.

216
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:42,874
But every word we said
and every single action we performed

217
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,594
in this courtyard

218
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:46,994
are known to him.

219
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:49,234
If there is no spy,

220
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:50,634
could it be

221
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:53,594
that he possesses
supernatural hearing and sight?

222
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,195
If he had someone stalk us

223
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:01,474
to this courtyard

224
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,354
and spy on us,

225
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,122
he would easily find it out.

226
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,282
If someone has been turned against us...

227
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:12,282
Ms. Huang,

228
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,762
we had a talk the other day.

229
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,922
Now Huangji Embroidery House
and the Yanyu Tower

230
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:18,961
are fierce competitors.

231
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,042
If we cannot topple Wu Lian,

232
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,922
your house and the embroideresses
working for you

233
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,802
would be hanging by a thread.

234
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,762
You didn't make a backup plan

235
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:30,441
for your business, did you?

236
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:31,642
What do you mean by it?

237
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:33,882
I do have such worries.

238
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:35,522
But if I betrayed you,

239
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,441
would I still discuss that with you?

240
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:38,922
I was just asking.

241
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:40,481
Why are you nervous?

242
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,002
If you are doubting me,

243
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,201
you might as well ask Feng

244
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,841
about what he has done recently.

245
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,122
What have I done?

246
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,242
The husband of one of our embroideresses

247
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,441
also works for the Huashi Convoy.

248
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:55,841
Didn't you just grab a job escorting

249
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:57,201
the shipment for the Yanyu Tower

250
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,402
and make a lot of money?

251
00:14:58,402 --> 00:15:00,361
Yes, I did grab the job
and make the money.

252
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,522
But I don't know

253
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:03,242
it's the shipment from the Yanyu Tower.

254
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:06,201
Are you truly a fool or just pretending?

255
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,402
What do you mean?

256
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,522
Stop arguing.

257
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:09,882
The words about the spy

258
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,882
are just the one-sided words
of Liu Sanniang.

259
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,162
Who knows the real reason

260
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,481
why she met Wu Lian today?

261
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,802
Who knows if her words today

262
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,321
were meant to cause discord?

263
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,961
Wu Lian was right.

264
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:28,162
You are nothing

265
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:32,201
more than a rabble of disorderly people.

266
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:35,242
The leader is full of worries.

267
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,882
The others are all fools.

268
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,522
Wu Lian is now in the shadows
while we remain exposed.

269
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,601
We may finally die
before even knowing it.

270
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:46,081
I think it's better to disband now.

271
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:48,841
Sanniang.

272
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,201
You guys carry on playing.

273
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,681
I'll quit it.

274
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:06,442
Let's split up.

275
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,322
Since we all have our self-interests,

276
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,282
there's no need to force anything.

277
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,282
Let's split up.

278
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,361
Alright,

279
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:15,761
then let's see who can take him down.

280
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:17,802
Shen,

281
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:19,841
I'll take Wu Lian's life.

282
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,241
Let's see who can do it.

283
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:25,241
Wait. How could we split up?

284
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:26,962
You got me involved

285
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:28,241
and made me Wu Lian's enemy.

286
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:29,802
If we split up,

287
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,601
what about Huangji Embroidery House?

288
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,521
What about my embroideresses?

289
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,682
You're all fools.

290
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:37,282
Stirred up so easily by a few words.

291
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,682
Let's just

292
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:40,442
leave this matter alone!

293
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,761
Lady, the luggage
has been loaded onto the cart.

294
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,241
Shall we set out now?

295
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,041
Let's go.

296
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:12,081
Sanniang.

297
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,442
No more words, Madame Xu.

298
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,041
I knew it would be
exceedingly difficult.

299
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,642
I'm not surprised

300
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,761
it turned out this way.

301
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:25,481
I don't believe there is a spy
among the seven of us.

302
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:28,481
Neither do I believe
you colluded with Wu Lian.

303
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:30,442
There's something fishy.

304
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,442
It might be a trap set by Wu Lian.

305
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:33,521
We...

306
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,402
No matter who stole
the Falling Blossom Embroidery

307
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,481
or who delivered the message to Wu Lian,

308
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,682
it's none of my business.

309
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:42,922
Sanniang,

310
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:46,241
is this said out of anger
or do you really mean it?

311
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:47,842
I'll handle my issues

312
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:50,162
with Wu Lian myself.

313
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,801
Madame Xu, hope we meet again.

314
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,081
Where's Sanniang?

315
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,241
She really left?

316
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:20,842
Madame Xu, what's wrong with you today?

317
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:23,122
Were you enjoying
the show sitting aside?

318
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:24,682
Don't be anxious, Mr. Liu.

319
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,402
Our priority

320
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,241
is to lure out Wu Lian's spy.

321
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:32,882
The argument that happened
in the yard today

322
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:34,962
may not be a bad thing.

323
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,001
Spy?

324
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:39,481
Have you noticed any suspicious persons?

325
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:41,761
You leave now

326
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,602
and secretly watch around the yard.

327
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,402
If you find anyone suspicious,

328
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,001
follow discreetly

329
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:48,642
to see who they are.

330
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:09,602
Chan,

331
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:10,922
stop here.

332
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:23,761
Wait here for me.

333
00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:25,402
I'll be right back.

334
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,602
Yes. Please be careful.

335
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:44,481
Sanniang?

336
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,321
It's really you!

337
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:51,721
You scared me.

338
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,842
Lower your voice.

339
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,241
What did Wu Lian promise you

340
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,682
to make you betray us?

341
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,922
I betrayed you?

342
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:04,362
None of you fools seems to be

343
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:07,041
bought over by Wu Lian,

344
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:09,122
there must be someone eavesdropping.

345
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:11,721
After what happened in the yard,

346
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:14,842
the spy is bound to act.

347
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,442
That's why I came here to listen.

348
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,642
Really?

349
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,162
No.

350
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,122
If I were eavesdropping,

351
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:28,122
why would I do it outside?

352
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,402
Wouldn't it be more convenient

353
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:31,922
to do it in the yard?

354
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,001
How stupid.

355
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,521
Alright, lower your voice.

356
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:38,682
I'll believe you.

357
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,122
Since you've come
to the same conclusion as Madame Xu,

358
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,682
you just keep a close eye here.

359
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,162
I'll take a look to the east.

360
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,362
Such a fool.

361
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:34,122
Mr. Wu is grateful to you
for helping him retrieve the lost thing.

362
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:35,962
Liu Sanniang from Xunzhou

363
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,521
has already set off for home.

364
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:40,682
And suspicion has arisen
among the other ones.

365
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,842
Their alliance probably won't last long.

366
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,041
These are rewards
from my master for you.

367
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:49,362
Do you like them?

368
00:21:50,962 --> 00:21:52,481
I've never asked for these,

369
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:53,761
and I'm not interested.

370
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:55,882
When can Mr. Wu

371
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,122
finally get rid of the vicious Meng Wan?

372
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:01,602
Be patient. She only has
seven people on her side.

373
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,721
But we have

374
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,402
300,000 people backing us.

375
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:07,162
Surely we can kill them.

376
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,402
Where do 300,000 people come from?

377
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:11,202
Tomorrow Mr. Wu will go
to the capital to attend a feast.

378
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,162
If this trip goes well,

379
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:15,561
the Yanyu Tower will
have grander possibilities.

380
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,481
When he returns,

381
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,481
those in Xu's courtyard

382
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,642
will have no chance of surviving.

383
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:26,801
So

384
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,122
the vicious Meng Wan

385
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:30,321
might not have much time to live.

386
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,241
Why are you here?

387
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,249
Mr. Liu said you turned back

388
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:50,770
to investigate the spy.

389
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,810
I was worried about you,

390
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:54,890
so I came back to find you.

391
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,409
The spy

392
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:00,050
is a young lady.

393
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,290
She kept calling you vicious one

394
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,249
and wanted to get rid of you
with the help of Wu Lian.

395
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,810
A lady?

396
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,689
And Wu Lian will leave for the capital

397
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:14,169
to attend a banquet tomorrow morning.

398
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,929
He said he had
300,000 people backing him

399
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:19,409
and that when he returned
from the capital,

400
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:21,530
that would be our end.

401
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,489
Madame Xu,

402
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,050
I've done all I could for you.

403
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,890
What you do next

404
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:33,610
is up to you.

405
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,009
You're still leaving?

406
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:37,729
You once told me,

407
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,570
"If 1,000 people unite,

408
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:43,130
they have the strength of them.

409
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:46,169
If the people don't unite,

410
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,530
it's useless even if it's ten-fold."

411
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:50,409
We haven't united

412
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,130
from the beginning.

413
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:54,610
Now,

414
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,209
we don't have to stay together anymore.

415
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,290
Madame Xu,

416
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,009
this is for Liu Xin.

417
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,130
Please give it to him.

418
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:26,050
Thank you.

419
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:34,770
Let's go.

420
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,249
Go.

421
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,649
Chan,

422
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,770
do people have to pass

423
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,890
through Xunzhou to get to the capital?

424
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,649
Yes.

425
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,530
Are you going to the capital?

426
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:05,130
Let's return to Xunzhou first.

427
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,130
Where's Sanniang?

428
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,090
Where's she?

429
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:13,770
She was just here a moment ago.

430
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,770
Nothing unexpected has happened, right?

431
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,169
This is what she asked me to give you.

432
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:32,929
Now that you have new shoes,

433
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,209
could you run an errand for me tomorrow?

434
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,729
Can't you delegate someone
more physically capable?

435
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,489
Sir,

436
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,810
they have fallen out.

437
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,290
We must not be negligent.

438
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,570
We still need to be on guard.

439
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:02,850
Go get the carriage ready.

440
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,009
Accompany me to the capital tomorrow.

441
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,570
It's time for the next step.

442
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,729
Yes.

443
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:22,490
(Xunzhou Prefecture)

444
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:34,138
(Gentle Breeze)

445
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,489
Sanniang.

446
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,689
Sanniang,

447
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,130
come to look.

448
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:50,850
Isn't this peacock beautiful?

449
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,130
It has just spread
its feathers earlier.

450
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,449
The feathers are incredible.

451
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,409
As long as you're happy.

452
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,009
You look a little haggard.

453
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,090
Have you had enough sleep?

454
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,090
Sanniang,

455
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,009
can you do the cooking today?

456
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,929
I miss your dishes.

457
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:16,530
Alright.

458
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,330
Madam,

459
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,090
I just asked the young men
from the capital

460
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,050
about 300,000 soldiers.

461
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,009
They all said they didn't know.

462
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,530
The Imperial Guard
claims to have 800,000 soldiers.

463
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,130
But in fact, it's less than half of it.

464
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,689
There are 300,000 soldiers.

465
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,850
The Imperial Guard

466
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,449
of the capital.

467
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,810
I once heard Miss Luo Qiong
of the Shihua House

468
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,330
had become quite popular in the capital

469
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,850
and even had a lover in the military.

470
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,449
Yes, someone mentioned this before.

471
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,530
Could her lover

472
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,290
be one of the Imperial Guard?

473
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,409
Well, you can leave now.

474
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,969
Are you going to the capital?

475
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:34,370
Do you want me to go?

476
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:36,249
Why did you ask such a question?

477
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,330
If it's important, then go.

478
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:42,249
If it's not important, then don't go.

479
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:45,489
As long as you won't regret it.

480
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,209
What if

481
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,449
I can't come back?

482
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:56,169
Then I'll ride a peacock
and fly to the sky.

483
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,009
We will go find you together.

484
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,689
We'll fly to the sky

485
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,449
to find you.

486
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,489
Let's fly.

487
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,050
Let's fly.

488
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,209
We'll go to find you.

489
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,290
I've made him suffer

490
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:30,810
all these years.

491
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,169
I should have closed
the Peacock Garden long ago

492
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,209
to spare him from the ordeal

493
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,810
of being bothered
by those ruffians every day.

494
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,834
(Gentle Breeze)

495
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:57,409
Let's set off.

496
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,290
Yes.

497
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,370
Sanniang.

498
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,090
Sanniang.

499
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,770
Sanniang,

500
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,929
are you really going to the capital?

501
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:15,090
Yes, Master.

502
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,850
You really have to go?

503
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,689
Yes.

504
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,770
It's not just for you.

505
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:25,130
It's also for my own sake.

506
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:01,312
(Capital)

507
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:13,130
Sir, we've arrived in the capital.

508
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,249
Go to the Dali Court.

509
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,130
Go to the Dali Court.

510
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:21,649
Yes.

511
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:35,770
(Dali Court)

512
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,409
Mr. Wu, Vice President Wang
has been waiting for you.

513
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:54,290
Please come in.

514
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:01,810
Vice President Wang.

515
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:08,810
Mr. Wu,

516
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,649
the vice president
likes quietness usually.

517
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:13,050
The tea has been prepared.

518
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:14,249
This way, please.

519
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,570
What is he here for?

520
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,850
To surrender?

521
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:35,449
Wu Lian?

522
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,729
What grudge do you hold against him

523
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:40,130
that made you approach him
with such painstaking efforts?

524
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,209
I can't say much about the specifics.

525
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,570
Nor do I have the time
to explain it to you in detail.

526
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,090
It is a matter of many people's lives.

527
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,449
Tonight,

528
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,729
(Pipa Player Luo Qiong)
I must get into that Guard camp.

529
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,370
You must help me with this.

530
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:58,610
Who did you hear the rumor from?

531
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:01,409
I don't know anyone
of the Imperial Guard.

532
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,209
Luo Qiong.

533
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:08,249
Don't forget

534
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:12,009
my kindness to you at the Shihua House.

535
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,409
Even the tune you just played

536
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:17,090
was taught by me.

537
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:18,370
Yes.

538
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,449
You are still so impatient.

539
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,890
Can't you let me finish my sentence?

540
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,050
Do you have a way then?

541
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,610
I don't know anyone in Imperial Guard,

542
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,610
but I'm familiar with the courtesans.

543
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,290
Every time there is
a banquet in the camp,

544
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,169
there must be courtesans serving aside.

545
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,090
If you can be sure

546
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,009
there's a banquet at the camp tonight,

547
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,770
I will have someone take you there.

548
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:42,929
To be honest,

549
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,009
I'm not sure.

550
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,770
But

551
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:48,810
I still want to try my luck.

552
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,130
Then you just prepare.

553
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:51,770
I'll arrange it

554
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,169
for you in a bit.

555
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:18,409
Wait a moment.

556
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,129
Alright, you all follow me.

557
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,330
Don't be scared and be flexible.

558
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,770
You three, over here.

559
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:33,049
You, over there.

560
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,609
Sir,

561
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,810
why is a banquet being held today?

562
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,409
And what do the guests prefer?

563
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,609
I'll choose suitable tunes.

564
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,609
No need for that.

565
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,170
It's a banquet that Commander Xie

566
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,449
is throwing for Director Yan
from the Embroidery Office.

567
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:51,850
Just make sure to serve them well.

568
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,770
Are they the only two guests?

569
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,170
Why do you have so many questions?

570
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:56,449
Listen to me.

571
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:58,009
Stay put in this camp tent.

572
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,049
Don't move around at will.

573
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,449
If there's any problem,

574
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,569
you'll be held responsible.

575
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,129
Director Yan, please.

576
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,089
- Mr. Xie.
- Mr. Xie.

577
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:12,969
- Mr. Yan.
- Mr. Yan.

578
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:16,290
Mr. Xie, you've spent a lot again.

579
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,009
Please sit down.

580
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:19,129
- Please.
- Okay.

581
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,250
You're more and more charming.

582
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,290
I heard the envoy
from the Abbasid Caliphate

583
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,009
would come
for the Embroidery Convention.

584
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,810
As well as a lot of foreign traders.

585
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,129
(Director Yan of the Embroidery Office)
They all want to see our embroidery.

586
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,690
Is it still held at the Wanshou Hall
in the capital as usual?

587
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:37,810
Yes.

588
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:41,770
Embroidery masters
from different places will gather.

589
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:45,009
We will need to bother you
to dispatch personnel

590
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,890
and to make this grand event
successful with us.

591
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:50,370
Don't be polite.

592
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,250
This is all part of our jobs.

593
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:53,049
Commander,

594
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,089
Wu Lian from Huaizhou Prefecture
requests a meeting.

595
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,730
You're in a quite good mood.

596
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,810
Wu Lian, what are you here for?

597
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,370
How pitiful Zhao Yin is.

598
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,850
He is still detained
in the prison of Huaizhou Prefecture

599
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,290
and guarded by the inquisitor Mr. Lou.

600
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,489
He might be decapitated at any time.

601
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,548
(Mr. Xie, Deputy Commander
of the Imperial Guard)

602
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,730
You may go.

603
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:20,850
- Yes.
- Yes.

604
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:27,969
Wait.

605
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,850
You're not here

606
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:34,089
for the courtesans, are you?

607
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:43,929
Okay.

608
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,969
Mr. Wu, just say it straight, please.

609
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,489
You two were

610
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:56,929
complicit

611
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,690
in the smuggling operation.

612
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:02,009
The money earned from it
was always split equally.

613
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,129
Now you want to pin
all the blame on Zhao Yin.

614
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,690
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

615
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,810
Don't be nervous.

616
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,089
I've already had someone
pass a message to Zhao Yin in jail,

617
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:22,409
saying we're working hard

618
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,129
to save him.

619
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:27,890
Wu Lian, what exactly do you want to do?

620
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,250
Director Yan, please resign

621
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,730
from the Embroidery Office
tomorrow morning.

622
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:35,049
And then what?

623
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,290
Recommend me to succeed.

624
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,730
Do you know the duties
of the Embroidery Office?

625
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,049
There are more than 300 embroideresses

626
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,730
who specialize in embroidery
for the royal and noble families.

627
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,049
Whether it is the robes
of the emperor and empress,

628
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,449
officials' clothes and boots,

629
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,129
big stuff like canopies and flags,

630
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,489
or small stuff
like fan bags and sachets,

631
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,290
it's all made within
the Embroidery Office.

632
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,330
Since you're clear about this,

633
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,449
why do you insist
on getting this tough job?

634
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,690
There's not much real power,
yet the duties are not few.

635
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:15,449
You are modest.

636
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,129
The Embroidery Office is the pinnacle
in the hearts of people who embroider.

637
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,850
It's also my aspiration to get into it.

638
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,089
The Embroidery Office is attached
to the Imperial Household Department,

639
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:30,969
and it's in the capital.

640
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:34,170
You did send
some embroidery to the palace,

641
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,449
but in the end,

642
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,569
you're just a merchant.

643
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,210
Even if Director Yan resigns,

644
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:42,929
how could it possibly be you
to take over?

645
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,129
So, I will become an official
through hereditary appointment.

646
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,210
I've already made my rounds
and got the nods.

647
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,330
Now I just need a title

648
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:54,730
and a reputable qualification.

649
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,290
Director Yan,

650
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,730
how about handing over

651
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:03,170
this year's Embroidery Convention
to me to organize?

652
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,890
I will definitely make it brilliant.

653
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:08,569
When you recommend me to His Majesty,

654
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,690
it would then be more logical.

655
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:14,650
Recommending you to His Majesty?

656
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,810
Once I take over the Embroidery Office,

657
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,330
I'll make it more influential.

658
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:20,650
Vice President Wang

659
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,609
from the Right Court of the Dali Court
was involved in smuggling too.

660
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,250
Why don't you ask him

661
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:29,250
to quit his position?

662
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,489
He will serve a purpose in due time.

663
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,449
I just came over from there.

664
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,650
Wu Lian,

665
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,170
what exactly attracted you
to the Embroidery Office?

666
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,170
No more words.

667
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:47,009
Leave it to me to organize
the Embroidery Convention

668
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,730
and let me take the position.

669
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,489
I'll make Zhao Yin

670
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,609
silence forever.

671
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,170
I guarantee that both of you
will have no worries.

672
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:00,810
Wu Lian,

673
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,049
are you threatening me

674
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,049
in my camp?

675
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:17,170
Do what you want to me.

676
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,770
But

677
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:22,049
if I don't walk out tonight,

678
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:23,929
the Censorship Bureau

679
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,969
will receive a book of accounts
early tomorrow morning.

680
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,009
I'll be glad

681
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,489
to have you accompany me to death.

682
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:41,489
What are you doing?

683
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:00,449
How are you?

684
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:02,049
I'm fine. Where are we?

685
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:04,049
After we just came out of the camp,

686
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,370
we were placed here.

687
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:06,890
The others have already returned.

688
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:07,770
Any brush and paper?

689
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,609
Yes, there are.

690
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,569
What's it?

691
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:14,609
Commander.

692
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,890
The pipa player sent over

693
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:17,489
was behaving suspiciously outside.

694
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,330
I called her
and she immediately ran away.

695
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,690
Pipa player?

696
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,009
Bring her back immediately.

697
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:22,969
Yes.

698
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,129
- Come on.
- Come on.

699
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,009
- Go.
- Go.

700
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:48,170
Take it.

701
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,290
Wu Lian doesn't know you.

702
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:50,569
Go to Huaizhou by water.

703
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,370
You must deliver
this letter to Meng Wan soon.

704
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,089
Do you understand?

705
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,250
Let's leave together.

706
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:55,609
Wu Lian won't touch me.

707
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:56,850
My life isn't in danger.

708
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,009
I'll distract them.

709
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,770
Otherwise, we both can't escape.

710
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:01,210
Hurry up. There's no time.

711
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,690
You go this way.

712
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,569
Lady.

713
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:14,969
Don't turn back.

714
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:16,690
Hurry. Go.

715
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:24,250
She's there!

716
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,210
- Stop.
- Stop.

717
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,330
Who are you?

718
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:40,129
Commander Xie, don't worry.

719
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,170
She's an old acquaintance of mine.

720
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,409
She is here because of you?

721
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,810
Sanniang,

722
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:51,609
we really are destined.

723
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,969
We had tea in Huaizhou the other day

724
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,009
and met again in the capital today.

725
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,569
Well,

726
00:42:58,129 --> 00:43:00,210
are you here to perform?

727
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,009
Let me congratulate you
on your promotion in advance.

728
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:05,370
I was once your teacher.

729
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:07,770
Why not come back
to the Yanyu Tower with me?

730
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,250
I'll teach you more needle techniques.
How about it?

731
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:12,290
You want to take me back?

732
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,210
Why don't you let me

733
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,529
take you to the underworld?

734
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:42,210
Chan.

735
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,650
Mr. Liu.

736
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,370
Sanniang was captured by them.

737
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,770
Who captured her?

738
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,210
Wu Lian and those in the army camp.

739
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,529
Mr. Liu, you can't go back.

740
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,049
Sanniang said there would be
no threat to her life.

741
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,290
You must deliver this letter
to Huaizhou as quickly as possible.

742
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,089
Let's go, Mr. Liu.

743
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,529
Go.

744
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,129
Let's go back to Huaizhou.

745
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,866
(Wu Lian plans to become
the director of Embroidery Office.)

746
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,569
Madame Xu,

747
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:27,730
you've read these few lines many times.

748
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,129
What are your thoughts exactly?

749
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:30,650
Sanniang's life is at stake.

750
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,370
She is waiting for us to rescue her.

751
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,049
We must save her.

752
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,330
But we can't confront

753
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,170
the 300,000 soldiers directly
no matter what.

754
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,730
We have to outsmart them.

755
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:42,690
So we need to figure out first

756
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,929
what Wu Lian's actual plan is.

757
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,250
For such a low-level position,

758
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:52,409
why does he have to go to such lengths

759
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:53,969
to get it?

760
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:00,810
Right, what gains have you made
from this trip to the capital?

761
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,810
I followed him all along

762
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:07,290
to the Dali Court.

763
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,810
He met Vice President Wang.

764
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:12,850
As for the rest, I have no clue.

765
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:14,089
Right, I've asked around.

766
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,409
Vice President Wang is in charge
of the Right Court.

767
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,730
The Right Court.

768
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,250
The director of Embroidery Office.

769
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,770
What a cunning plan.

770
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,449
What tricks
is Wu Lian playing this time?

771
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:47,890
The Right Court.

772
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:54,250
It tries the criminal cases
involving the officials in the capital.
