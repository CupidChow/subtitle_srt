=Faithful=
(Adapted from the novel "Faithful")

00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:46,272
=Episode 22, Chapter 11, Part 2=
(Face the Past)

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,239
If you don't care about your dignity,

4
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,319
I will make it public.

5
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,000
And I will dump Zhang Rong'er,

6
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,000
an unfaithful wife.

7
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,680
The good reputation of your family,
the good name of ladies

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,280
in your mansion, and the prestige
you've built up over the years.

9
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,439
Can they still...

10
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,960
Shut up! Just tell me what you want.

11
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,199
It's simple.
I'm not making things difficult for you.

12
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,520
I know your family does not
have deep connections at the court.

13
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,199
However, you have a relative serving
in the Ministry of Personnel for years.

14
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
I have prepared enough money
and the best carriages,

15
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,000
so that you can go
to the capital to pay him a visit.

16
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,360
I don't need a high-ranking position.

17
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,159
I just want to be the director
of Embroidery Office.

18
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,840
If you're willing

19
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,840
to ask him for this,

20
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,479
you will save me.

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,759
And you will also save your daughter.

22
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,240
Wu Lian, you sign
the divorce settlement first.

23
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,960
Otherwise, my family will not help you.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,800
Zhang Rong'er, if you're
from an ordinary family,

25
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,759
divorce doesn't matter at all.

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,439
But in your family,

27
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,080
I am afraid your mother
will be the first one to disagree.

28
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,360
I agree.

29
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,919
After the matter is done,
you must immediately divorce Rong'er.

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,560
In that case,
you should set off immediately.

31
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,159
Upon your successful return,
I will provide the divorce settlement.

32
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,360
Mother.

33
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,720
Rong'er.

34
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,160
Are you really going?

35
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,079
Rong'er, you tell me.

36
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,759
What happened in the Yanyu Tower before

37
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,839
is all true?

38
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,160
Mother, I was wrong.

39
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,040
I helped Wu Lian

40
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,480
to harm many people.

41
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,959
Although I was forced
to do it at the beginning,

42
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,279
later on,

43
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
to have a place in the family

44
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,079
and make him recognize me as his wife,

45
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,360
I lost myself...

46
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,879
Mother, my sins are beyond redemption.

47
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Rong'er, I harmed you.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,319
I always told you

49
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,399
there is no perfect marriage.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,879
And I told you to tolerate it,

51
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,040
but I didn't expect

52
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,720
that you've been suffering.

53
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,839
I thought that you would blame me.

54
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
It's not your fault.

55
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,120
You should have told me the truth
much earlier.

56
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,120
All these years, I thought

57
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,600
you valued the reputation
of the Zhang family

58
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,920
over me.

59
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,720
It turns out that I was wrong.

60
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,439
It's all my fault.

61
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,360
I have made you suffer.

62
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
I will set off right away.

63
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,319
I can stand begging others.

64
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,560
If it can get out of your predicament,
it will be worthwhile.

65
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
Mother.

66
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,519
Thank you for your help.

67
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,000
I await your good news.

68
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:02,241
(A few days later)

69
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:05,216
(Rong'er, it's done. You can break up
with Wu Lian and return home.)

70
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,319
You've read my mother's letter.

71
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,240
It's settled.
Give me the divorce settlement.

72
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,399
Tomorrow will be Qiqiao Festival.

73
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,639
Don't you want to celebrate it with me?

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
What do you mean?

75
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,040
The letter of appointment
will arrive three days later.

76
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,839
When I get it

77
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,519
and take my official seal
in the capital to secure my position,

78
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,360
you'll get the divorce settlement.

79
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,519
- What?
- No rush.

80
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,039
If you miss your mother,

81
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,559
you can go home. I won't stop you.

82
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:48,720
(Invitation to
the Embroidery Convention)

83
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,559
The Embroidery Convention was ruined.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
But what's going on now?

85
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,399
Wu Lian is really omnipotent.

86
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,799
He is a mere merchant.
He failed in the Embroidery Convention,

87
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
but he got a position in the capital.

88
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,799
I guess he bought it.

89
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,679
Mrs. Ning helped him?

90
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,600
There must be someone else.

91
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,000
Except for Mrs. Ning, he is now...

92
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,039
Anyway,

93
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,120
since he has become the director
of Embroidery Office,

94
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,519
Huangji may soon be in danger.

95
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
How's the birthday gift for Her Majesty?

96
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,159
It's done. As you told me,

97
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,759
I won't deliver it to the Ning Mansion

98
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,399
until the last day.

99
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,799
Mrs. Ning urged me three times a day.

100
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,240
She almost sent someone
to live in my place.

101
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,799
Let's delay it a bit more.

102
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,039
Her Majesty's birthday is
at the end of July. It's soon.

103
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,919
Madame Xu, the risky plan
you mentioned before

104
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,519
has been in planning for a while.

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,799
Should we use it
if there is no other choice?

106
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,720
Since it's risky, we should only use it
in a desperate situation.

107
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,240
It's not the right time yet.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,960
Three days later,
Mr. Lou will leave for the capital.

109
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,799
Then we will go to court

110
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,559
for appealing three days later.

111
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,399
Where is Li Chunfeng?
He hasn't gone to the Qingshui Nunnery?

112
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,559
We have looked for him.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,799
He has been staying at home,

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,919
preparing a gift for Tian Xiaoling.

115
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,799
I don't know what he's thinking.

116
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,000
I will go find him.

117
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,080
Mrs. Wu, where should I put this outfit?

118
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,759
Leave it here.

119
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,039
Besides my own dowry,

120
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,720
I don't want anything from this place.

121
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
I see.

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,879
Wait.

123
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
Don't call me Mrs. Wu anymore.

124
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,320
Yes, I got it.

125
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,519
Bad news.

126
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Bad news.

127
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
Bad news.

128
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,320
Wu Lian is going
to be an official in the capital.

129
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,519
We know it, Captain Liu. Don't worry.

130
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,159
I'm about to look for Li Chunfeng

131
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,679
to ask about his situation.

132
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm worried. His long-unseen wife

133
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,279
has already packed her stuff and left!

134
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,159
Zhang Rong'er? Where did she go?

135
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,519
She's on her way to the capital.

136
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,679
Where else could she go?

137
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,000
Which way did she go?

138
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,840
She just got out of the alley.
It looks like she went south.

139
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,639
That's not right.
If so, she should go west.

140
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,039
She is going back home.

141
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,000
How strange.
Her husband is going off to the capital,

142
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,000
but she's going back
to her parents' home.

143
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,799
Looks like a faithless man

144
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,200
abandons his wife.

145
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,799
That's not right.
There's something fishy.

146
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,600
Where could she be now?

147
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,399
She has heavy luggage, hard to travel.

148
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,559
I guess she just got out
of the city gate. Shall we chase her?

149
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,639
Yes.

150
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,240
Mr. Liu, are you sure
you remember correctly?

151
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
Don't worry. No one knows the roads
in Huaizhou Prefecture better than I do.

152
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,679
We're definitely faster than her.

153
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,600
Here they come.

154
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,559
Who are you?

155
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
We're here to see Mrs. Wu.

156
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,960
Mrs. Wu.

157
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,000
And you?

158
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,399
My name is Meng Wan.

159
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,159
Do you still remember this name?

160
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,480
I don't.

161
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,799
Seven years ago, I studied embroidery
at the Yanyu Tower.

162
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,080
You really don't remember?

163
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,279
There are too many embroideresses
studying in Yanyu Tower.

164
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
How can I remember each of them?

165
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,960
Mrs. Wu, I heard...

166
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,159
Don't call me Mrs. Wu.

167
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,279
I am not now.

168
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,759
I heard
that you've been a believer for years.

169
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,279
The Qingshui Nunnery is nearby.

170
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,440
There is a master
who is proficient in Buddhism.

171
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,000
Why not pay a visit?

172
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,799
I won't go.

173
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,039
Please forgive me.

174
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,039
You guys should stay here.

175
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,559
We will be back soon.

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
What are you doing, you bandits?

177
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,200
Mrs. Wu, please sit still.
I have to do this.

178
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
Please rest assured.

179
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,120
If we were bandits,

180
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,200
we would not bring you to this place.

181
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,919
What is your intention after all?

182
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,639
Tell me clearly, or I will leave.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,559
Seven years ago
when I was studying embroidery,

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,919
I heard you're the descendant
of a famous family

185
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,519
with a prime minister as an ancestor.

186
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,440
That's true, right?

187
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,320
So what?

188
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,440
So, Wu Lian can now become the director
of Embroidery Office.

189
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,000
You paved the way for him

190
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,279
to buy an official position, right?

191
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,159
Seven years ago,
Lin Rulan died at the Yanyu Tower.

192
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,679
After that,

193
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,480
you moved to a secluded courtyard
and no longer handled the housework.

194
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,480
If I guess correctly,

195
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,440
you're not a bad person.

196
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,279
Your conscience must be troubled, right?

197
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,360
That night, the thief
who sneaked into the secluded courtyard

198
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,960
was with you?

199
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,120
You helped him buy an official position,

200
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,840
and he gave you the liberty.

201
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,480
It's really a good deal.

202
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,960
What do you want to do?

203
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Do you still remember her?

204
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,720
Her dharma name is Jueming,
and her real name is Tian Xiaoling.

205
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,840
She has been living here
for seven years.

206
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,839
Tian Xiaoling?

207
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,240
You must have remembered.

208
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,960
I don't know her.

209
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,039
Let go of me.

210
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,640
You have been married
to Wu Lian for years.

211
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,480
Has he ever truly treated you as a wife?

212
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,440
You are so protective of him,
indulging him

213
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,000
and even pleasing him. Why?

214
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,200
You have been a believer in the Buddha,

215
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,000
just to find peace in your heart.

216
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,359
If you really want
to atone for your sins,

217
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,440
now is the best opportunity.

218
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,440
Alright, I will tell you why.

219
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,599
Back then, when I was young,

220
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,319
I was deceived by my cousin

221
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,759
and forced to lose my virginity.

222
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,720
From that day, my life

223
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,079
has been controlled
by one person after another.

224
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,920
I accepted it all.

225
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,680
If I am to be blamed,

226
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,880
my sins have been paid off these years.

227
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,240
Now, I finally have the opportunity

228
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,119
to control my own destiny

229
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,200
and get rid of the past,

230
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,160
why can't you all leave me alone?

231
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,960
If I let you go now,

232
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,079
what about the women

233
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,720
who died in the Yanyu Tower?

234
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,880
Even if I let you go today,

235
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,519
you will just move from the Yanyu Tower

236
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,640
to your parents' house.

237
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,200
And the sins you have made

238
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,839
will haunt you for a lifetime.

239
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,000
If you really let them go,

240
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
you can leave.

241
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,599
What do you want me to do?

242
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,799
You know it well.

243
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes, I recorded all account expenditures

244
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,279
of the Yanyu Tower.

245
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,480
Besides a large account book,

246
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
I actually have a small one.

247
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
The accounts in it are all related

248
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,039
to Wu Lian's dirty deeds,

249
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,200
from getting a doctor
for a pregnant embroideress,

250
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,000
buying abortion pills, silencing those
who caused trouble,

251
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
to bribing local officials,

252
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,640
including the bribery
for buying a position this time.

253
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,720
I have them all recorded.

254
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,559
The money went out from me.

255
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,519
The small account book
is wrapped in yellow cloth.

256
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,440
It's put in the Buddha shrine.

257
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,119
For seven years,
I have lit countless lamps

258
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,759
only in hopes of atoning for the sins.

259
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,440
You now have it with you?

260
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,240
Wu Lian has never known
about this account book.

261
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,799
You get it.

262
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,200
It's not your fault.

263
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,920
- Today is a big day.
- Yes, indeed.

264
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,240
Mr. Zhu.

265
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,920
Mr. Zhu, are you also heading
to the Yanyu Tower?

266
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,720
Yes, I heard of the good news.

267
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,799
The nobles of Huaizhou

268
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,880
should celebrate with Wu Lian

269
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,039
to show him some support.

270
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,560
Sir.

271
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,559
Sir.

272
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,200
May I ask about the good news?

273
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,920
Wu Lian is marrying again?

274
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,400
How long have you not left your house?

275
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,240
Mr. Wu is appointed the new director
of Embroidery Office.

276
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,000
- He's holding a big banquet.
- Let's go.

277
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,279
Madame Xu.

278
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Are you going to Yanyu Tower alone?

279
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,240
Your presence would be noticeable.
It might alert Wu Lian.

280
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,759
After all, he invited me.

281
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,839
It would be normal for me to be there.

282
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,119
I better go in person.

283
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,119
I've advised you all the way,

284
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
but you didn't listen to what I said.

285
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,279
Madame Xu, you are the decision maker.

286
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,440
If something happens to you,

287
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,519
we would lose a leader.

288
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,319
Yanyu Tower is crowded tonight.

289
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,759
In the public,

290
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,039
he wouldn't dare make a move
on me. Don't worry.

291
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,400
Well, you enter from the front door
and I'll go through the back.

292
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,599
If you don't come out after a long time,

293
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,079
I'll go and rescue you.

294
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,448
Okay.

295
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,559
(Yanyu Tower)

296
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,799
Congratulations.

297
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,519
Please.

298
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,839
Congratulations.

299
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,000
Congratulations.

300
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,912
Mr. Wu.

301
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,759
Mrs. Wu and Meng Wan talked secretly
at the Qingshui Nunnery.

302
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,400
Meng Wan is eloquent.

303
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,400
Eventually, she made Mrs. Wu speak.

304
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,680
What did she say?

305
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,640
In the Buddha shrine in the main hall,

306
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,079
there is an account book
wrapped in yellow cloth.

307
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,920
Mrs. Wu recorded every expense

308
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
that should not be known to others.

309
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,319
I just got the account book.

310
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,820
(Account Book)

311
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,839
What a kind-hearted woman.

312
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,640
They must come to look for it.

313
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,880
Put it back where it was.

314
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,319
What?

315
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,799
I'll do it right away.

316
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,039
Please.

317
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,079
(Yanyu Tower)
Liuji Embroidery.

318
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,088
Okay.

319
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,920
I put it here.

320
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,800
Okay.

321
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,680
Master got an official position.

322
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,240
Will he give us more rewards?

323
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,359
I think he will.

324
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,559
You guys come with me. Hurry up.

325
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,799
Mr. Wu, he's here.

326
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,640
- Start now.
- Yes.

327
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,576
Come with me.

328
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,279
Give me the account book.

329
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,839
Maybe I can spare your life.

330
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,000
Mr. Wu, please spare me.

331
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,880
The account book is in my clothes.

332
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,240
You can just take it.

333
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,960
Master.

334
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,424
Hit him!

335
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,359
Stop.

336
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,079
So, you're here.

337
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,240
Are you here for this account book?

338
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,559
You have already got it.

339
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,039
You can let us go now.

340
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,880
What if I said no?

341
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,799
Mr. Lou is still in Huaizhou.

342
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,680
I have your invitation.

343
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,720
If the two of us die here,

344
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,319
you will be to blame for it.

345
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,519
You have the invitation,
but what about him?

346
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,119
A thief broke into my house

347
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
and stole my stuff.

348
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,680
Even if he gets beaten to death,
so what?

349
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,559
We are catching a thief,

350
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,480
but you suddenly step in.

351
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,680
If you broke a leg or lost an eye,

352
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,079
wouldn't it be normal?

353
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,279
How dare you!

354
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,928
Hit him.

355
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,400
Stop!

356
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,319
Stop!

357
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,039
Stop!

358
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,472
Wait.

359
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,039
Even though you try to hold me hostage,

360
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,720
you still can't escape.

361
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,664
Release them.

362
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,599
Go quickly. Don't worry about me.

363
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
Go.

364
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,720
Even if you manage to escape today,

365
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,000
I will catch you one day.

366
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,559
- Mr. Wu.
- Chase.

367
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,680
Wait.

368
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,400
Chasing here will disturb the guests.

369
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,920
You chase from the front door.

370
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,599
Captain Liu, hold him.

371
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,792
This way.

372
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
They must be nearby.

373
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,039
- You two, go over there.
- Yes.

374
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,599
Everyone else, search.

375
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

376
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,440
Do you have any wound medicine?

377
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,799
Li Chunfeng.

378
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,279
Li Chunfeng.

379
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Li Chunfeng, Tian Xiaoling is waiting
for you at Qingshui Nunnery.

380
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,920
You can't disappoint her.

381
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,680
The... the study.

382
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,359
The study.

383
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,720
My lantern.

384
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,319
Is this it?

385
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Madame Xu.

386
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:18,720
I sent a letter
to Qingshui Nunnery yesterday.

387
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,079
I told...

388
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,519
I told Tian Xiaoling

389
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,680
tomorrow is Qiqiao Festival.

390
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,319
I want to meet her.

391
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,359
Okay.

392
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,920
I can't go anymore.

393
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,440
Can you meet her for me?

394
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,680
What are you talking about?

395
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,519
We will accompany you up the mountain.

396
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,559
Hold on.

397
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,599
After they leave,

398
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,359
I will go and find a doctor for you.

399
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,160
Listen.

400
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,480
I really want to take Ling
to enjoy the Qiqiao Festival.

401
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,240
Okay.

402
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,920
The gift

403
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:21,319
I have prepared for her is on my bed.

404
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,599
On the desk in the study,

405
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,319
there's a letter I wrote to her.

406
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,880
I... I can't hold on anymore.

407
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
Li Chunfeng.

408
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,960
Deliver it to her for me.

409
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:57,839
If Ling is unwilling
to leave the mountain,

410
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,400
don't force her.

411
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,640
Otherwise,

412
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,519
I will never forgive you.

413
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,000
I swear. I won't push her.

414
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,800
Here it is.

415
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,960
I remember you loved bunnies
when you were little.

416
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,480
But I didn't guess it correctly.

417
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,239
Forget it.
I'm not meant to have this lantern.

418
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,000
Qiqiao Festival.

419
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,704
(Double seventh festival,
Qiqiao Festival)

420
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,800
Li Chunfeng asked us to give you this.

421
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,119
He did it all for you.

422
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,960
(Ling, how are you?)

423
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,559
(We have finally met again
after seven years.)

424
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,519
(Recently, I've been thinking
at midnight.)

425
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,679
(Back then, if I had asked you)

426
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,000
(to spend a little more time with me,)

427
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,679
(maybe everything
that followed wouldn't have happened.)

428
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,079
(If so, what would we be like now?)

429
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,599
(We would probably live
in a secluded place.)

430
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,119
(We would be self-sufficient,
with a son and daughter,)

431
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,639
(living in a small house.)

432
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,320
(It would be a simple life.)

433
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,320
(But we can't go back in time.)

434
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,760
(This time, I don't want
to miss the opportunity again.)

435
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,239
(Tomorrow at noon,
I will be waiting for you at home.)

436
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,119
(If you are willing to come,)

437
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,679
(we will get married.)

438
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,039
(If you are not, I won't blame you.)

439
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,920
(And I won't bother you anymore.)

440
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,760
(Human nature is indeed strange.
I've been stealing,)

441
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,719
(but I never dare
to admit that I'm a thief.)

442
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,079
(Your name is Tian Xiaoling,)

443
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,480
(but now you insist you're Jueming.)

444
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,000
(My scholarly title is just)

445
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,239
(like your Qingshui Nunnery.)

446
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,519
(We are hiding behind them,)

447
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:21,199
(thinking we can muddle through life.
In fact, we are deceiving ourselves.)

448
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:52,222
(Yaoshi Hall)

449
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:44,192
(Divorce settlement, by Meng Wan)

450
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:03,119
Back then, I forced him to join us.

451
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,039
It was me who got him killed.

452
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,239
Brother, all men will die.

453
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,960
When we meet in the underworld,

454
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,320
I will apologize to you.

455
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,559
(Li Chunfeng's account book)
I will pay it all off for him

456
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,199
to give him a good reputation.

457
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Count me in.

458
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,679
Noon has passed.
Should we continue to wait?

459
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,239
The mountain road is difficult.
Let's wait a little longer.

460
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,159
If she comes, what do you plan to do?

461
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,960
We go together to beat the court drum.

462
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Or else, go directly to the city gate

463
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,039
to stop Mr. Lou's carriage.

464
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,424
Here she is.

465
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,559
Madame Xu's maid is here.

466
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,599
What? She's here.

467
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,119
Madame Xu, a man sent a message.

468
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,000
Mr. Lou invites you all
to the Zuixian Restaurant.

469
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,079
Wu Lian holds the office
of Embroidery Office.

470
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,639
Once the letter of appointment arrives,
he will be an official in the capital.

471
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,960
Even if you have any evidence,

472
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:42,920
his case must be handled
by the Right Court of Dali Court.

473
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,280
There's nothing I can do then.

474
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:51,119
I heard the Dali Court is overwhelmed
with old and new cases.

475
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,719
They are always understaffed.

476
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,679
The key is, if this case
is handed over to the Dali Court,

477
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,760
we won't be able to do anything.

478
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,920
So, are we going to let Lin Rulan,

479
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,519
Liu Sanniang,
and Li Chunfeng die in vain?

480
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,599
Mr. Lou, you once said
that you are a good official.

481
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,559
So I always trust you.

482
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:18,280
But now, you can't think of escaping.

483
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,480
I admire your integrity,

484
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,880
but as an inquisitor,

485
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,679
I must serve all the people.

486
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,320
I cannot only think
for the people of Huaizhou.

487
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,519
Now, allow me to take this drink

488
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,400
as an apology to you all.

489
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,559
Tomorrow, I will leave for the capital.

490
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,400
If there is any progress in this case,

491
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,320
I will definitely come back.

492
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,840
Thanks for your recent help, Mr. Lou.

493
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,639
I don't think we can eat this meal.

494
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,400
After today,

495
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,719
I believe we will meet again soon.

496
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,800
Every time I think
of Miss Lin's indictment,

497
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,719
I will feel sad.

498
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,920
It's so heartbreaking.

499
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
But in the end,

500
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,199
the truth didn't come out.

501
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,960
You're really a useless inquisitor.

502
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,960
Let's go back to report my duty first.

503
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,880
Put this case aside for now.

504
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:44,880
The appointment letter is on the way.

505
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,840
What can we do now?

506
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,159
You have all done enough.

507
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,639
Next, it's my turn.

508
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:57,400
Madame Xu, you need to think it clearly.

509
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,079
If we stop Mr. Lou's carriage

510
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,400
in broad daylight,

511
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,360
there will be no way back.

512
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,559
I will not turn back.

513
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,239
Think about your husband's reputation.

514
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:11,800
Before going out,
I have left my divorce settlement.

515
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,599
You're truly a heroine.

516
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,360
I admire you greatly.

517
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,039
Guys, I will take my leave.

518
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,199
What happened?

519
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,760
Mr. Lou, someone is stopping us.

520
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,320
I, Tian Xiaoling,
accuse Wu Lian of rape.
