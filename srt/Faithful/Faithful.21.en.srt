(Fleeting Glimmer of Hope)

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,200
Madame Xu,

4
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,959
she buried lots of good wine
in this courtyard.

5
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,599
Would you like to taste some?

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,159
She was

7
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,840
a rebellious woman.

8
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,360
She never cared for worldly customs

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
and lived a free and happy life.

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,599
I can't compare with her.

11
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,560
But her free and happy life

12
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,759
was achieved through countless injuries,

13
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,039
so she had a sense of detachment.

14
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,479
Maybe she also wanted

15
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,049
to live an ordinary and stable life.

16
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,970
She said she didn't have many friends.

17
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,850
I was one of them.

18
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,169
But in the end,

19
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,210
I couldn't protect her.

20
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,130
Let's go.

21
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,690
Let's give her a final toast.

22
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,250
Let's go.

23
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,289
I still need to fulfill
my promise to her.

24
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:33,434
(The Grave of Liu Sanniang)

25
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,930
Sanniang,

26
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,449
thanks to your timely message,

27
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,609
we won this lost battle.

28
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,769
All this was achieved
through your sacrifice.

29
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,650
We won,

30
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,609
but we are deeply in pain.

31
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,729
What we owe you in this life,

32
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,289
I'm afraid we can't repay even
in the next one.

33
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,929
(The Grave of Liu Sanniang)

34
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:28,850
Sanniang,

35
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:30,770
I take some responsibility
for your death.

36
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,249
I owe it to you.

37
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,090
I have it all in my account book.

38
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,850
I will avenge Xiaoling

39
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:38,609
as well as your death.

40
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,169
I'll make him pay for it myself.

41
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,650
Sanniang,

42
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:44,850
we'll kill Wu Lian
as a sacrifice for you

43
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,129
once we return to the city.

44
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:47,369
Feng Da,

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,890
don't mention this again in the future.

46
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,330
Why?

47
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:56,890
With these new shoes on,

48
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,489
I feel that I'm not lame anymore.

49
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,530
No more vengeance for my broken leg.

50
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,570
Before Sanniang's death,

51
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:05,609
I made a promise to her

52
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,809
that we'd bring Wu Lian to justice.

53
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:09,929
Madame Xu is right.

54
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,249
He shouldn't die
by the sword of his enemies.

55
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,890
He should die for his own guilt.

56
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,929
Only then
would we have truly upheld justice.

57
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,770
Everyone,

58
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,330
I got you involved in this.

59
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,770
The tears,

60
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:30,890
and the drops of blood you shed

61
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,010
have reflected my culpability.

62
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,570
I have let you down,

63
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,809
especially Sanniang.

64
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,410
The road ahead

65
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,289
will only become more dangerous.

66
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,489
What do you mean by that?

67
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,489
Wu Lian's plan was crushed by us.

68
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,289
Now we should seize the opportunity.

69
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:50,729
Don't you want us

70
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,650
to disband now?

71
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,970
Madame Xu,

72
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,289
you were the one who got us involved.

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,289
You can't give up halfway through.

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,570
I've pledged my badge
to the Imperial Guard Bureau.

75
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:02,650
If I return to the capital empty-handed,

76
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,570
I think I will lose even my position.

77
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,369
No.

78
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,210
I want to tell you all

79
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,729
that we have already paid a heavy price.

80
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,210
If anyone wants to quit,

81
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:17,609
bring it up today.

82
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,689
But if anyone is

83
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,090
irrational and distrust each other

84
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,770
after today,

85
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,970
I will be the first to disagree.

86
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,049
Sanniang,

87
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:57,650
rest in peace.

88
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,809
(The Grave of Liu Sanniang)
May you be reincarnated

89
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,570
as a plant

90
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,489
other than a mortal.

91
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:08,489
Sanniang,

92
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,890
may you be a deer in your next life,

93
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,530
living in the mountains

94
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,489
and enjoying a lifetime of tranquility.

95
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,890
Or be a sparrow

96
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,809
with a pair of wings,

97
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,650
so you can go wherever you want.

98
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,410
People often say,
"Be as free as the wind."

99
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,570
If one can really choose,

100
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,090
wouldn't it be better
to be a gust of wind?

101
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,330
Why not be a beautiful dress instead?

102
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,090
Ironed when wrinkled,

103
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,210
mended when torn,

104
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,410
and perfumed every day.

105
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,249
Sanniang,

106
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,330
may you be an ordinary person
in your next life,

107
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,729
living a simple and peaceful life.

108
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,530
If fate allows us to meet again,

109
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,249
let's be buddies.

110
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:02,289
(The Grave of Liu Sanniang)

111
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,249
Rest in peace.

112
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:05,890
No need to worry about us.

113
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,410
In this battle,

114
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,570
we will surely win.

115
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,729
What's our next plan?

116
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,890
Though the Yanyu Tower is destroyed,

117
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,770
why not take advantage of it

118
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,890
and add fuel to the fire for Wu Lian?

119
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,169
(Prosperity)
So fierce.

120
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,689
8,000 taels are just gone.

121
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,570
Such a grand event

122
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,170
has turned out like this!

123
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:35,810
My dozens of embroideries

124
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,009
could have been exchanged
for several houses

125
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,690
in the most prosperous area
of the capital.

126
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:41,330
But now,

127
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,769
they're all gone.

128
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,369
You're not alone.

129
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,170
I just landed an order yesterday.

130
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,850
Before we had a chance to sign,

131
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,690
the fire started,

132
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,889
and all the merchants
scattered and fled.

133
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,489
The prospective buyer
can't be found anymore.

134
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:55,649
Tell me,

135
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,009
what do we get out
of Embroidery Convention?

136
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:02,170
I've invested all my wealth in it.

137
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,930
Born of a scholarly family,

138
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,129
he prefers needlework over books.

139
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,649
As gentle as jade,

140
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,090
he possesses a genteel spirit
that outshines all the scholars.

141
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,090
A tall building was erected here,

142
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,009
housing what ladies
eagerly paid high prices for.

143
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,009
Famous for his Yanyu Embroidery
in the capital.

144
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,249
He is unparalleled

145
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,450
Mr. Wu.

146
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:27,369
But today,

147
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,170
Wu Lian is in trouble.

148
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,369
What does it mean?

149
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,090
It's about Wu Lian.

150
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,850
Wu Lian wielded power
to hold a grand meeting.

151
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,729
The lanterns were as bright as day.

152
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,450
But things didn't play out as imagined.

153
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,570
The raging fire

154
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,649
reduced all the treasure
to ashes overnight.

155
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,170
This has filled the gentlemen
with utter fretfulness.

156
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,290
You don't understand.

157
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,290
I am too naive,

158
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:55,409
not knowing how rich Wu Lian is.

159
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,529
He's Mrs. Ning's guest of great respect,

160
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,009
and the Supervisor of Minzhou
is his close friend.

161
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,369
He's received numerous rewards
from the court

162
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,609
and has made a fortune
from smuggling on the sea.

163
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,050
He possesses countless treasures.

164
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,810
Even his toilets are gold-plated.

165
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,769
Even other great merchants

166
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,609
have to call him Mr. Wu respectfully

167
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,930
when they see him.

168
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:19,489
Wu Lian

169
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,330
has been involved
in smuggling on the sea?

170
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,609
How can we take the words

171
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,129
of a storyteller seriously?

172
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,769
Whether it's true or not,

173
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,769
Wu Lian has to pay us.

174
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,210
The Embroidery Convention
was organized by him.

175
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,729
Shouldn't we go to him

176
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,489
to compensate us for our losses?

177
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,210
You're right.

178
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:42,609
She's right.

179
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,529
We should go to Wu Lian
for compensation.

180
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,009
Let's go to the Yanyu Tower now.

181
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,930
Go.

182
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,489
- Yes.
- Let's go to the Yanyu Tower.

183
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,609
(Yanyu Tower)

184
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:10,649
I failed to fulfill my duties.

185
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,090
Please punish me.

186
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,249
Wu An.

187
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,409
Do you know what this fire means?

188
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,649
It means

189
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:23,930
the reputation and prestige

190
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,649
that I spent nearly 20 years
on establishing

191
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,609
through my hard work

192
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,529
collapsed in an instant.

193
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:34,889
All is gone.

194
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,090
So are our ties with Ning Mansion

195
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,210
and Embroidery Office.

196
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,290
If this goes on,

197
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:44,769
our lives will be gone soon too.

198
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:47,850
Ever since I left home at 14,

199
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,970
I've always been

200
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,769
a manipulator.

201
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,450
I've never been manipulated by others.

202
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,570
Now, I'm being played

203
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,330
by my prey.

204
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,930
I made a mistake.

205
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,769
Please punish me.

206
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,450
You didn't do anything wrong.

207
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,970
I underestimated them.

208
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,930
I underestimated their hatred for me.

209
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,729
They could even set such a big fire,

210
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,170
watch their ally being burned alive

211
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,450
and flee.

212
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:28,290
Sir,

213
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:30,330
anyway, we've figured out

214
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,609
their identities.

215
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,930
Why not just kill them

216
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,090
to avoid future troubles?

217
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,090
Idiot, you think I don't want to?

218
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:38,489
But don't forget.

219
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,930
Mr. Lou is still in Huaizhou Prefecture.

220
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,489
Since what happened last night,

221
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,570
he has had his people watch us,

222
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,649
trying to find reasons to accuse us.

223
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,409
If we act rashly at this moment,

224
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,850
it would be a dead end.

225
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,489
- Compensate!
- Compensate!

226
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,529
Don't go in.

227
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,330
Don't stop me! Move aside!

228
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:58,489
Compensate!

229
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,090
Get out of the way!

230
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,930
Mr. Wu,

231
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,330
you must give us an explanation today.

232
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,450
What explanation do you guys want?

233
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,769
Mr. Wu, we are all embroiders.

234
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,330
You know the value
of a piece of embroidery.

235
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,290
The fire last night

236
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:19,729
burned all the embroideries

237
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:21,009
we brought here.

238
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,889
Shouldn't you give an explanation?

239
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:26,570
The fire was deliberately set
by someone.

240
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,690
Everyone has seen that.

241
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,649
My tower has been burnt down.

242
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:32,970
If we're talking about losses,

243
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,930
mine are greater than yours, right?

244
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,050
You can't say that.

245
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,930
We were all here

246
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,649
because we got your invitations.

247
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,889
You should take responsibility for this.

248
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,570
The invitations you received

249
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,850
were sent by the Embroidery Office
in the capital.

250
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,769
I just forwarded them.

251
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,729
If you want an explanation,

252
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,210
you can go to the capital
to see His Majesty.

253
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,330
To see His Majesty?

254
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:58,769
How can he talk like that?

255
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,210
Mr. Wu.

256
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,889
You just said

257
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,930
the fire was started by someone.

258
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,570
So who was it?

259
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:12,690
Ms. Huang,

260
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,529
you can go to the Yamen
to ask the officers.

261
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,009
I may accompany you there.

262
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,009
Mr. Wu, don't scare me.

263
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,369
It's clear that the one
who burned Yanyu Tower

264
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,529
was deliberately targeted at you.

265
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,489
It's your personal grudge

266
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:27,889
that brought about the trouble.

267
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,009
But we suffered together with you.

268
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,090
How can this be blamed
on the Embroidery Office?

269
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,570
Guys, isn't that right?

270
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,690
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

271
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,529
That makes sense.

272
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,729
Mr. Wu,

273
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,489
why must we get dragged

274
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,850
into your own conflicts?

275
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,529
Right, you have to pay us.

276
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,970
Our embroideries
were burned at your place.

277
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,690
You must give us an explanation.

278
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,850
What Yanyu Embroidery?

279
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,570
I think you are scamming people.

280
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,729
I've heard you have
also engaged in smuggling.

281
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,249
At worst, we can go to the capital
and sue you at the court.

282
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,489
No one will get off easy.

283
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:04,690
Ms. Huang,

284
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,690
I see now.

285
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,609
This is another scheme led
by Madame Xu, isn't it?

286
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:12,450
What Madame Xu?

287
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,529
I don't know her.

288
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,210
Then how about you take the lead?

289
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:17,729
Let's discuss this matter in my study.

290
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:19,249
Wu An.

291
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,690
Ms. Huang, please.

292
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:25,810
Mr. Wu.

293
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,810
If you want to discuss it in detail,

294
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,690
we can go instead

295
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,769
of Ms. Huang.

296
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:35,810
What's there to discuss in detail?

297
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,129
Just compensate.

298
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,570
- Right.
- Just compensate and it's over.

299
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,450
Wu Lian, stop making excuses.

300
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,889
Or else we all go
to the capital to file a complaint.

301
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,649
- Right.
- File a complaint.

302
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,129
- Sue him!
- Yes!

303
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,930
- File a lawsuit if he doesn't pay.
- Make him pay us!

304
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,009
Everyone,

305
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,649
please go back to the inn for now.

306
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:56,570
Within seven days,

307
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,930
I guarantee I'll give you
a satisfactory answer.

308
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:03,290
Wu An,

309
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,529
see them out.

310
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,649
- Don't leave!
- Don't leave!

311
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:07,690
Everyone, please return.

312
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,170
- Pay us!
- Pay us!

313
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:25,609
Why are you here?

314
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:28,729
Wu Lian,

315
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,690
given the circumstances,
what do you plan to do?

316
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,050
What's your opinion?

317
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:37,210
My opinion?

318
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,529
The foreign envoy was frightened.

319
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,249
The precious embroideries
of the masters and businessmen

320
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,369
were all burnt.

321
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,609
You turned the Embroidery Convention

322
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,050
into such a mess.

323
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,529
Hoping to take over
the Embroidery Office after that

324
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:52,850
is delusional, isn't it?

325
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,290
Not to mention if this incident

326
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,529
is spread to the capital by those people

327
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,850
and the smuggling is known to more,

328
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,970
both you and I cannot
escape the consequences.

329
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,169
I am going to return
to the capital immediately.

330
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,129
I can only hope that the punishment
from His Majesty won't be too severe.

331
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,250
I also hope you will keep your promise

332
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,010
and quickly get rid of
Zhao Yin in the prison

333
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,090
to avoid further trouble.

334
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,449
When it comes down to it,

335
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,409
the director of Embroidery Office

336
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,330
is just a minor official

337
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,969
with no real power.

338
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,689
Other than embroiderers like us,

339
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:36,810
few people value it.

340
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,889
Since you disdain it so much,

341
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,010
why bother at all?

342
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,010
Director Yan,

343
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,290
you can just go
to the Imperial Household Department

344
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,290
as we planned before and resign.

345
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,530
As for how I quell this disturbance

346
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,090
and get the position,

347
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,850
you don't need to worry.

348
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,169
You still haven't given up?

349
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,050
Do you want to go ask Mrs. Ning

350
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,889
to buy a title for you?

351
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,209
Don't ask too many questions.

352
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,169
I'll land

353
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,209
the office director position.

354
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,689
As you said,

355
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,449
I have already sent people
to closely monitor the Yanyu Tower

356
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,290
and purposely alarmed Wu Lian.

357
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,570
He must be apprehensive

358
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,129
and wouldn't act rashly against you.

359
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,490
Thank you for your help, Mr. Lou.

360
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,609
Let me toast you with tea.

361
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,490
Madame Xu,
you don't need to be so formal.

362
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:46,010
Please sit down.

363
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,290
I also did it
for the sake of peace in Huaizhou.

364
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,209
It is my duty.

365
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,730
I came today to express my apologies.

366
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,850
You are busy with official duties,

367
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,449
and you should go to the capital.

368
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:05,609
But you've been delayed here for months.

369
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,810
Since Wu Lian
escaped from the court last time,

370
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,689
other righteous people and I
have been looking for evidence,

371
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,929
but we kept being frustrated,

372
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,209
which caused no progress in the case,

373
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,929
almost allowing Wu Lian

374
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,010
to be promoted in the capital.

375
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,209
Madame Xu, you are overstating.

376
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,090
It's hard to break a new case now,

377
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,409
let alone an old case
that happened seven years ago.

378
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,649
I've been wanting to find a chance
to talk to you these days.

379
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,649
The capital
has been urging me repeatedly.

380
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,010
I'm afraid

381
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,969
I can't stay here much longer.

382
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,290
May I ask how much time can you give us?

383
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,050
At most ten days.

384
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:58,730
Okay.

385
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,969
Within ten days,
there will definitely be new witnesses,

386
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,570
and we will sound the drum again.

387
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,969
The Embroidery Conference
was made a mess,

388
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,409
which prevented Wu Lian from being
the director of Embroidery Office.

389
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,969
His house was surrounded
by angry people,

390
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:17,330
which bought us more time.

391
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,609
But Mr. Lou

392
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,929
can't stay any longer.

393
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,969
What should we do next?

394
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,570
On the day Mr. Lou
sets off after ten days,

395
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:29,850
I will personally stop him

396
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,090
to accuse Wu Lian.

397
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:32,889
Without evidence,

398
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,169
how do you do it?

399
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:36,850
There's not much hope,

400
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,050
but if all of you help,

401
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,010
we will still have a chance
to turn the tables.

402
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,929
How can we help?

403
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:50,810
There are four letters here.

404
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:51,929
In each one,

405
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,969
a person's name and address is written.

406
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:57,530
They are all closely related
to the Rulan case of that year.

407
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,850
The six of us split into four groups
to look for these four people.

408
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:02,850
Let's try our best to ensure

409
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,250
that they will stand in court
with me in ten days.

410
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,730
Madame Xu,

411
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,010
among these four people,

412
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,290
is there Tian Xiaoling?

413
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:13,969
Yes, there is.

414
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,850
But I promise you

415
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,810
that if she doesn't want to stand up,

416
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,449
she won't be forced.

417
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,490
This is a letter I wrote to her.

418
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:28,889
Please send it to her.

419
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,609
If she agrees to testify
after reading the letter,

420
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,609
our chances of winning will increase.

421
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:36,290
If she doesn't want
to dredge up the past,

422
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,209
then let it be.

423
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,969
Madame Xu,
just forget about this letter.

424
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,449
It's only a letter.

425
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,530
Are you still unwilling to help?

426
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:01,850
That's not what I meant.

427
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,490
Sanniang once said

428
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,330
a prostitute's testimony
was likely to be discredited,

429
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,129
while that of a monk or a nun

430
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,209
was more easily trusted by people.

431
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,490
Sanniang also said once

432
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:17,369
great things couldn't be achieved
without sacrifice.

433
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,129
She was right.

434
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:22,010
I should bravely face my past.

435
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,530
Are you planning to write
a letter yourself?

436
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,570
Yes.

437
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,409
I can't make the decision for Xiaoling.

438
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,929
But the Qiqiao Festival is approaching

439
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:34,250
and I would like to go
to persuade her myself.

440
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,850
She'll decide for herself
if she wants to stand up for us.

441
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,850
If she really comes to vouch for us,

442
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,090
I won't let her stand up alone.

443
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,050
I'll do some preparation
in the coming days.

444
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:54,449
Don't bother me unless it is important.

445
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,730
Ms. Huang, Mr. Shen,

446
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,850
I need you two to go to Linzhou City.

447
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:09,770
Mr. Feng,

448
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:12,169
I need you to go to Hu'an County.

449
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,090
Alright.

450
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:19,050
Mr. Liu and I
will deliver this last letter.

451
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,129
Alright, we will set off now.

452
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,490
Hold on.

453
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,730
Before we set off,
I need to go back home.

454
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,570
That female spy

455
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,770
needs to be dealt with appropriately.

456
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,889
Is it really true?

457
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,209
Rulan is dead.

458
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,050
I wouldn't joke about such a matter.

459
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,467
But

460
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:55,187
I've been deceiving you for seven years.

461
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,667
I know it is not right
to do such risky things

462
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:00,227
in the name of Madame Xu.

463
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:01,826
Seven years ago,

464
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,066
you agreed to marry me as a concubine.

465
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,026
Was it also your plan?

466
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:12,586
Seven years ago,

467
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,707
I heard from the maids
in the embroidery house

468
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:19,786
that your wife
was seriously ill and intended

469
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:21,627
to take a concubine for you,

470
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:23,987
yet she hadn't been able to find

471
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:25,867
a woman who is fearless of her disease

472
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,187
and could care for her.

473
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,467
After we met in the Yanyu Tower,

474
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,627
not long after,

475
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:38,066
you sent betrothal gifts to my house.

476
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:50,147
My mother didn't want me
to be a concubine,

477
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:52,707
but my father,

478
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:56,987
preoccupied with calculating
the value of the betrothal gifts,

479
00:24:58,106 --> 00:24:59,826
didn't care about my future.

480
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:03,667
On the day of my wedding,

481
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,427
my mother rushed out of the house

482
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:12,066
and slipped a small wooden box
into my hand.

483
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:19,427
It might have been one
of the last ways she could think of

484
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:23,066
to protect me.

485
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:43,187
Seven years after my marriage to you,

486
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,467
I finally became Madame Xu,

487
00:25:46,387 --> 00:25:48,546
(Ning Mansion)
and finally be able to enter

488
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,066
the Ning Mansion and serve Mrs. Ning.

489
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:55,066
Manshu knew everything long ago.

490
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:59,707
She used the last bits of her life

491
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:03,266
to give you a hand. Is that so?

492
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,187
I've paved the road for you.

493
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,546
Don't let me hold you back anymore.

494
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,066
Her great kindness to me

495
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:16,066
can never be repaid.

496
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,026
If you had told me earlier,

497
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:20,867
I would certainly have helped you.

498
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:27,075
It was all my fault. Please punish me.

499
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:30,835
Never mind.

500
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:34,994
You get up.

501
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,075
Taking you as a concubine back then

502
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:49,075
was not really an act of love.

503
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:52,515
I just wanted to find a woman

504
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:56,474
who is kind-hearted
and not afraid of her illness

505
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:57,914
to take care of Manshu

506
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,234
and keep her company.

507
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,795
So, over these years,

508
00:27:03,474 --> 00:27:05,355
I've only been treating you
as a family member,

509
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:07,394
and neglecting you.

510
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:11,954
We both have our own aims.

511
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:14,795
It's fair to say it's a draw.

512
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:18,515
But

513
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,755
you have to go out today?

514
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:25,795
I have an appointment with my allies.

515
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,954
I'll stay out in the courtyard
for the next few days.

516
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:29,954
Once this matter...

517
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:30,914
Meng Wan.

518
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,954
You've been waiting for seven years

519
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:38,075
for that to succeed.

520
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:41,234
I don't think my words
can easily stop you.

521
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:47,035
But

522
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,474
if you can let go of the past

523
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:56,634
and promise to spend the rest
of your life with me,

524
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,595
I will pretend

525
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:01,515
it has never happened.

526
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:03,875
Okay?

527
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:11,954
I'm sorry, Master.

528
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:15,875
If I give up now,

529
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,835
not only Rulan will be let down.

530
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:35,154
I knew you would answer like this.

531
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,115
You just leave.

532
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:45,755
I'll leave that maid Xiaoyue

533
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:48,154
to you to deal with.

534
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:53,154
A carriage has been prepared
for you outside the gate.

535
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:56,394
Be careful.

536
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,434
Thank you.

537
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:04,634
Zhiyang.

538
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,154
What are you going to do?

539
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,714
What kind of benefits
did Wu Lian promise you

540
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,555
to make you work for him?

541
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:05,075
You think it was Wu Lian who came to me?

542
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:06,835
You're wrong.

543
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:09,555
I offered to do it for him
after I heard your plot

544
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:11,075
in that courtyard.

545
00:30:11,994 --> 00:30:13,954
He didn't promise me a thing.

546
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:15,634
I don't care either.

547
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,115
I just want you dead.

548
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:22,035
Xiaoyue, you better be honest.

549
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:24,315
I used to work for the Yamen.

550
00:30:24,674 --> 00:30:26,194
I have many ways to deal with you.

551
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:36,674
Xiaoyue,

552
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,954
I've long noticed
your feelings for Master.

553
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:43,194
But one should
maintain a clear conscience.

554
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,595
You behave in such a despicable manner,

555
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:47,394
demeaning yourself

556
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,954
all for the love of a man.

557
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:51,914
Is it worth it?

558
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:54,555
Whether it's worth it or not,
it is none of your business.

559
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,315
Today, I lost to you.

560
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,315
Do whatever you want.

561
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:02,474
Mr. Liu,

562
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:06,954
hide her in a house outside the city.

563
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:08,634
Have someone watch her

564
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:11,595
and don't let her cause
any more trouble.

565
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:15,154
What tricks are you up to?

566
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:18,555
Just stay there.

567
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:20,474
Don't think about escaping.

568
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:22,595
Once my business is done,

569
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:25,275
I will let you live.

570
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,202
(Cross Lane, Quan Village, Bo City)

571
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:59,194
Mr. Liu, let's set off.

572
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:03,234
Let's go.

573
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:05,994
I'll be waiting for your good news.

574
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:08,555
Let's go.

575
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:28,275
Rong'er,

576
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:31,795
as we are separated by a wall,

577
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:35,154
it's been two or three years
since we last saw each other, right?

578
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:41,394
I always see maidservants
delivering candles and lamp oil here.

579
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:43,315
I didn't expect

580
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,515
you would be so devout.

581
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:48,194
Seems that it's your prayer
that has brought

582
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,555
prosperity to the tower
these past few years.

583
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,954
I only have this last pure place
where I can find peace.

584
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,515
I beg you to leave here.

585
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:01,394
No, today I am here to beg you.

586
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:05,714
Though not of aristocratic rank,

587
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:08,315
your family is distinguished.

588
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,875
After all, there was a prime minister
among your ancestors.

589
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:14,154
You still have some connections
in the capital now.

590
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:16,714
I've long ceased to care about those.

591
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:20,194
I'll devote the rest
of my life to prayer.

592
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:22,634
Don't come to me
for those matters anymore.

593
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:23,914
Please go back.

594
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,394
Don't be foolish, Zhang Rong'er.

595
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:29,315
If I were to fall,

596
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,394
would you

597
00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:33,994
still live such a leisurely life?

598
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:36,315
When karmic seeds ripen,

599
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:38,755
we naturally bear the consequences.

600
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,234
Even if I fall into the Underworld,

601
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,394
I will not be afraid.

602
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,355
That's what I deserve

603
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:49,194
and what you deserve.

604
00:33:57,914 --> 00:33:59,315
Since seven years ago,

605
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,474
Lin Rulan died in this tower,

606
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,954
you've left all the household affairs

607
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:09,114
and hidden in this secluded courtyard
to practice Buddhism.

608
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,594
I've never said a word, have I?

609
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,155
Now I need your help,

610
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,594
you should step forward obediently.

611
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:18,554
Even if it costs you your life,

612
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,235
you should be unhesitating.

613
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:23,394
Today I'm taking you back
to your parents' house

614
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:25,795
to see your mother.

615
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:27,034
What do you think?

616
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,074
Wu Lian, I know all

617
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:35,474
about all the despicable acts you did

618
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:36,875
after I married you.

619
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:38,795
If you provoke me again,

620
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:40,835
I'll destroy you completely.

621
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,795
You helped me

622
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:48,554
in each and every one

623
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,835
of those despicable things.

624
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:54,994
If you destroy me, it'll destroy you

625
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:58,914
and the whole Zhang family too.

626
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,195
I really want to see

627
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,474
how you could go back to your family,

628
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,355
and face your honorable mother.

629
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,155
Rong'er,

630
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:13,275
if you don't want to lose face
in front of your parents,

631
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:16,835
get dressed up

632
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,554
and accompany me there later.

633
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,282
(Hu'an)

634
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:47,706
(Hu'an)

635
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,986
(Linzhou)

636
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:19,002
(Linzhou)

637
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:27,275
Madame Xu, we're at Cross Lane.

638
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,624
(Herbs Shop)
They haven't been heard from for seven years.

639
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,514
Are you sure they still live here?

640
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:39,474
Mr. Liu,

641
00:36:40,195 --> 00:36:41,275
I haven't done nothing

642
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:43,594
these past seven years.

643
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:46,034
Selling goods!

644
00:36:46,195 --> 00:36:47,155
Is that him?

645
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,795
Bargains!

646
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:54,114
Come on, take a look!

647
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:55,675
Discounts!

648
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:56,755
Father.

649
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:00,034
Nianlan, my little girl,
why are you here?

650
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:02,755
Why are you coming home so late today?

651
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,434
Mother has already made the dinner.

652
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:05,835
I didn't sell much goods today,

653
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:07,195
so I walked a little farther.

654
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,434
Since you're here,
I'm gonna call it a day.

655
00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:10,474
Let's go home for dinner.

656
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:11,074
Okay.

657
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:11,994
Alright.

658
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:16,315
What would you like?

659
00:37:16,474 --> 00:37:17,474
I have various goods.

660
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:19,434
Mr. Lin,

661
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:21,315
I am Meng Wan.

662
00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:23,875
Do you remember me?

663
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:38,114
It's been a long time.

664
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:39,835
I don't expect you're an officer's wife.

665
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:42,394
I didn't recognize you just now.

666
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,514
My wife has cooked fish.

667
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:44,795
Have dinner with us.

668
00:37:45,235 --> 00:37:46,315
No need for that.

669
00:37:47,074 --> 00:37:48,954
Mr. Lin, you don't have to bother.

670
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,155
Where are your parents?

671
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,074
Are they still at the pharmacy?

672
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,554
They passed away a few years ago.

673
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,434
My sister was the apple of their eyes.

674
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,715
After she died,

675
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:07,034
they got seriously ill one after another

676
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,195
and then...

677
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:11,795
Mr. Lin,

678
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:14,994
please accept my condolences.

679
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:18,275
Let's not talk about it.

680
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:20,554
Miss Meng,

681
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:22,434
I just remembered a thing.

682
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:24,355
I don't know if I should ask you.

683
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:25,835
Please go ahead.

684
00:38:27,635 --> 00:38:28,715
Since two years ago,

685
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:30,755
I have frequently received

686
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:31,875
a large amount of money,

687
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:34,755
which is said to be from Rulan's friend.

688
00:38:35,114 --> 00:38:36,594
I try hard but I can't figure out

689
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:38,474
which of her friends

690
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:39,554
would do such a thing.

691
00:38:39,994 --> 00:38:41,635
I was like a sister to Rulan.

692
00:38:42,474 --> 00:38:45,434
I should take care of her family
after she passed away.

693
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:49,235
Unfortunately, I didn't find you
until two years ago,

694
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:51,355
when your parents had passed away.

695
00:38:54,155 --> 00:38:55,755
I feel extremely regretful about it.

696
00:38:58,155 --> 00:38:59,594
It was really you. I...

697
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:02,514
Please don't feel pressured and refuse.

698
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:04,675
Otherwise,

699
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,074
I would feel guilty.

700
00:39:08,074 --> 00:39:09,195
Why do you feel guilty?

701
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,554
I should bear some responsibility

702
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:14,114
for what happened to Rulan back then.

703
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:16,835
It is for this reason

704
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:22,034
that I came to visit you today.

705
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:23,994
What do you mean by that?

706
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,835
If seven days later,

707
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:29,835
the Huaizhou Yamen will have
a retrial of Rulan case,

708
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,034
I wonder if you'll testify in court.

709
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:36,954
A retrial?

710
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:39,635
Yes,

711
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:42,195
until Rulan's grievances are redressed,

712
00:39:43,434 --> 00:39:47,074
and the evil man is punished by the law.

713
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:48,715
If I attend court,

714
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:51,434
how should I testify?

715
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:53,114
According to the law,

716
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:57,835
a lawsuit requires the person involved
in the case to be present in person.

717
00:39:58,715 --> 00:40:00,434
If they can't for some reason,

718
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:04,675
they need to entrust
relatives directly involved to appear

719
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:06,394
as the main plaintiff.

720
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:08,994
Otherwise, the Yamen will not accept it.

721
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:12,594
Even punishments may be applied.

722
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:27,594
Okay, I will go.

723
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,514
You agreed so quickly.

724
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,155
Why wouldn't I agree?

725
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:34,355
Why don't you ask us

726
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:37,795
why the case needs to be reviewed
or what the chances are?

727
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:39,835
If I had insisted back then

728
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:42,074
and stopped Rulan marrying Wu Lian,

729
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,514
maybe she wouldn't die.

730
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:47,954
I think you and I have the same feeling.

731
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,355
Though seven years have passed,

732
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:53,635
every time I think of Rulan,

733
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:56,914
I can't sleep at night and my heart
aches like being cut by a knife.

734
00:40:57,394 --> 00:40:58,954
So you came to find me

735
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:00,954
to vindicate her.

736
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:02,914
Her close friend is like this.

737
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,434
I should do no less as her family.

738
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:07,594
Even if there's ten percent chance,

739
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,355
I will insist to the end.

740
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:12,914
Meng Wan,

741
00:41:13,235 --> 00:41:14,315
having such a close friend,

742
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:16,675
Rulan lived not in vain.

743
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:20,875
On her behalf and on my family's behalf,
thank you very much.

744
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,402
(Zhang Mansion)

745
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:30,755
Mrs. Zhang,

746
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:33,155
I've been busy with the business

747
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,635
and haven't brought Rong'er back
to see you for a long time.

748
00:41:36,074 --> 00:41:36,994
I'm sorry for that.

749
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:40,954
Mother, I brought
some top-quality ginseng for you.

750
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:43,715
It's beneficial for health
when boiled and drunk.

751
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:47,275
I have always been in good health

752
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:49,554
without diseases.

753
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:52,275
You don't need to worry about me.

754
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:56,434
How about you two lately?

755
00:42:02,434 --> 00:42:04,795
We...

756
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:07,875
Mrs. Zhang, you have
lived through so much.

757
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,114
Your knowledge

758
00:42:09,554 --> 00:42:11,474
has put ours to shame.

759
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:14,355
To be honest,

760
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:15,875
actually, I came here today

761
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,394
for something I would like
to consult with you.

762
00:42:20,275 --> 00:42:21,474
Do tell us.

763
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:24,835
My Yanyu Tower

764
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:27,755
isn't doing so well.

765
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:31,315
Thanks to the good reputation
we've built up,

766
00:42:31,914 --> 00:42:33,155
we've managed to sustain these years.

767
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,195
But the youth will overtake us.

768
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:40,275
More and more embroidery houses
have sprung up in recent years,

769
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:41,954
making our business even worse.

770
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,875
I'm afraid that Rong'er and I
are going to be stretched thin

771
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,195
and we're forced
to consider our response.

772
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,275
As a housebound woman,

773
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:55,715
I've been trapped
in this large mansion for years

774
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:58,235
and know nothing
about managing a business.

775
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:01,594
You're asking the wrong person.

776
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:04,235
I'm willing, but powerless.

777
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:09,074
Mrs. Zhang, have you heard
about the Embroidery Office?

778
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:13,074
Yes. Why do you ask?

779
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:15,875
I have an old acquaintance
with the director of that office.

780
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,074
He's getting old,

781
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,114
and recently,
he's been thinking of retiring.

782
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,034
He suggested I take over his position.

783
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,715
If I become the director
of Embroidery Office,

784
00:43:27,114 --> 00:43:28,715
Yanyu Tower and I

785
00:43:29,114 --> 00:43:30,474
will be able to soar to new heights.

786
00:43:30,954 --> 00:43:32,434
That's a cause for celebration!

787
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:36,474
However, I'm not competent enough.

788
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,594
I know no one in the capital.

789
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:41,275
Just the recommendation
of the former director

790
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,074
might not be sufficient
to secure the position.

791
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:47,835
That's truly a pity.

792
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:51,875
Our Zhang family, though once mighty,

793
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:55,315
has now faded into obscurity.

794
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:59,315
Otherwise, we could've been

795
00:43:59,434 --> 00:44:01,074
of some help in this matter.

796
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,034
Still,

797
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,394
I'm sure you can help.

798
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:14,235
It depends on if you want to.

799
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,474
What do you mean by that?

800
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:36,155
I'm sure you understand my meaning.

801
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,635
There's no need for me to repeat it.

802
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:40,914
Impudent!

803
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:43,715
Wu Lian, even though our Zhang family

804
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:45,114
now only consists of women,

805
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,835
we will not tolerate your insolence!

806
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,355
I see it now.

807
00:44:54,914 --> 00:44:58,594
The people of Zhang family like to make
things harder than they have to be.

808
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:03,994
In the past, I married your daughter

809
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:07,914
who had lost her chastity.

810
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:14,235
I helped you cover up a scandal.

811
00:45:16,434 --> 00:45:17,715
How should you thank me?

812
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:19,114
You!

813
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:23,394
I was puzzled at that time.

814
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:26,275
I was just a humble embroidery lad

815
00:45:26,594 --> 00:45:29,155
without much success and fame.

816
00:45:29,434 --> 00:45:32,675
Why would I somehow catch the eye
of your rich family?

817
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:35,514
That move was really brilliant.

818
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:37,675
Mrs. Zhang,

819
00:45:38,594 --> 00:45:39,954
your family has

820
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:42,994
many chaste and virtuous women,

821
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:47,034
and what you value most
is women's reputation.

822
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:50,034
If you don't care about your dignity,

823
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,235
I will make it public.

824
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:56,914
And I will dump Zhang Rong'er,

825
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:59,954
an unfaithful wife.

826
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:02,434
The good reputation
of your family,

827
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:04,554
the good name of ladies in your mansion,

828
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:06,074
and the prestige

829
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,394
you've built up over the years.

830
00:46:08,755 --> 00:46:09,394
Can they still...

831
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:10,875
