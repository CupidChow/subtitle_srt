00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,650
Ms. Chen.

5
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,769
You came in here without knocking.

6
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,420
You signed the contract with Xiao Jie?

7
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,459
Yes, we just signed.

8
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,780
The contract is on the table.
Read it yourself.

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,379
(Endorsement Fee: 1.2 million yuan)

10
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,650
1.2 million?

11
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,220
Is there a problem?

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,739
I was recommended to negotiate
with Xiao Jie

13
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
because it was inconvenient for you
to take part.

14
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,929
Why did you take over?

15
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,690
Are you questioning my work?

16
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,579
If you have decided

17
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,300
to sign Xiao Jie for 1.2 million,

18
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,810
what was the point of my negotiation?

19
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,900
Xia Guo, don't forget

20
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,090
your name is still
under the Marketing Department.

21
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,369
Is this the right attitude

22
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,579
to talk to your superior?

23
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,649
What kind of superior
will set up her subordinate?

24
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,250
What did I do to you?

25
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,769
You were dawdling
and couldn't seal the deal.

26
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,899
That's why I step in.

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,579
Your quotation

28
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,209
was meant to support my work.

29
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,489
Is there any problem?

30
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,810
It's fine if you want me
to collaborate with you.

31
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,300
But you should at least inform me
in advance.

32
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,089
Do you know

33
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,370
how much effort I have put into this?

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,459
Do you really think Mr. Xue

35
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,299
sincerely guides you?

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,369
He asked you
to offer the lowest price at 800,000

37
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,020
because he never wanted you to succeed.

38
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,530
I took you in.

39
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,209
If you mess up your work,
it means I chose the wrong person.

40
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,609
He is using you against me,

41
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,090
do you understand?

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,580
No one has ever compelled me.

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,090
You pushed me away.

44
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,650
I pushed you away?

45
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,900
Or you have changed your heart
long ago?

46
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,970
You are well aware of this.

47
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,220
Of course,

48
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,690
people always aim higher.

49
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,970
I won't stop you.

50
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,340
Ms. Nan, something has happened!

51
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,419
Why are you panicking?

52
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,740
What has happened?

53
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,369
Go on.

54
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,739
I went to apply
for the payment for Xiao Jie just now.

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,180
However, Mr. Yang said
the group couldn't approve this contract.

56
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,929
Why?

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,220
Because they have already approved
the other contract signed by Mr. Xue.

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,370
Who did he sign?

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,609
A young Olympic champion

60
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,180
who has a high public reception.

61
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,019
Xue Yuming, what on earth are you up to?

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,459
Did you knock?

63
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,740
Why didn't you tell me
you signed another ambassador?

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,960
Are you deliberately trying
to make me break the contract?

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,769
Besides, did you use Xia Guo

66
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,369
to drive down Xiao Jie's price

67
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,960
and make her fall short
in the negotiation,

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,460
so that you have enough time
to sign a new person?

69
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,809
Ms. Chen,

70
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,360
how could you accuse me of using her
when the subordinate is meant

71
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,769
to report her progress to a superior?

72
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,579
It's Xia Guo's job

73
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,769
to report her work to me.

74
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,619
I don't have the duty

75
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,850
to report mine to her.

76
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,050
I would like to ask you,

77
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,289
why did you suddenly raise the price

78
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,019
when the negotiation between Xia Guo
and Xiao Jie was about to settle?

79
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm very curious about
what you are trying to do?

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,220
- I did that for the company's interest.
- Both of us want the best for the company.

81
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,260
I didn't use anyone.

82
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,209
And I hope you don't as well.

83
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,209
Can you say

84
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,849
you had no personal motives at all?

85
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,780
As the general manager,

86
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,700
my motive is perfectly aligned
with the group's interests.

87
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,899
As you can see,

88
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,970
the group is very satisfied
with the result.

89
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,820
And that's my motive.

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,090
Have you learned anything?

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,970
Fine. Well played.

92
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,969
It's not what you think it is.

93
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,850
So, Xiao Jie was never your target, right?

94
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,020
What trick is this?

95
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,289
Achieving your goal
by planning out my failure?

96
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,410
Xia Guo,

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,059
I simply sign a more valuable ambassador

98
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,170
for the company at a suitable price.

99
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,329
I never said

100
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,209
Xiao Jie was the only option,

101
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,899
right?

102
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,410
You never trusted me.

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,619
Whatever you taught

104
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,020
was just using me
to bring Ms. Chen down.

105
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,329
I didn't.

106
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,649
Can you trust me?

107
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,490
One treats me like a pawn,

108
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,730
while the other treats me like an idiot.

109
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,780
Lesson learned.

110
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,920
(Xue Yuming)

111
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,499
If I could

112
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,970
have an assistant like Xia Guo,

113
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,900
it would be great.

114
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,939
Do you really want

115
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
to be Xue Yuming's assistant?

116
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,090
I... I don't.

117
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,529
By the way, I introduced
a doctor to you last time.

118
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,530
Have you visited him yet?

119
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,699
I don't have time yet.

120
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,939
It's fine.

121
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,899
(If you need a doctor,)

122
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,209
(I can do you this favor.)

123
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,459
(But please)

124
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,780
(stop all those funny business.)

125
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,940
Got scolded?

126
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,580
Mr. Xue.

127
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,289
You are smart.

128
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,940
Don't do anything you will regret.

129
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,899
Bye-bye.

130
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,170
Bye-bye.

Why?

155
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,499
She resigned?

156

Two tigers can't stay

Ever since Xia Guo joined Mr. Xue,

Ms. Chen has become difficult.

159
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,409
Could she be doing something
behind the scenes?

160
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,610
It's very likely.

161
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,649
She used Ms. Chen as the stepping stone,

162
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,099
and kicked her away.

163
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,010
Ms. Chen was the one
who brought her here.

164
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,289
It reminds me of the story

Xia Guo isn't that kind of person.

- Xia Guo.
- Morning.

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,060
Guo,

171
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,769
they are just talking nonsense.

172
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,420
Don't take it to heart.

173
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,060
What's wrong? Are you upset?

174

about Mr. Xue's recruiting.

177

180
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,619
you are Mr. Xue's assistant.

181

Starting today,

185
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,340
you should work overtime

186
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,979
when Mr. Xue sees you.

187
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,640
I guarantee you will be promoted
in no time.

188
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,580
Larry.

189
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,619
You know what?

190
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,019
I really need your help

191
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,139
to pick out my newest summer clothes.

192
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,340
Will you help me?

193
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,219
Sure.

194
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,169
I'm good at this. Wait for my news.

195
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,099
Thank you.

196
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,490
Bye, Guo.

197
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,580
Guo,

198
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,169
did you hear that TNE Group

199
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,180
sent us an email
to cancel the cooperation?

200
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,730
Why?

201
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,979
The contract

202
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,219
has already been confirmed.

203
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,890
Besides, the strangest thing is

204
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,409
that half an hour before the email arrived,

205
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,850
Ms. Chen resigned.

206
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,649
Don't you think

207
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,090
the timing is too coincidental?

208
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,490
Do you mean that Ms. Chen poached this project
and took it to her new company?

209
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,920
I didn't say that.

210
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,120
But poaching the project
from the previous company

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,420
and causing them great loss

212
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,460
is a serious mistake in this industry.

213
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,379
If Ms. Nan really takes this risk,

214
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,449
her reputation

215
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,010
could be completely ruined.

216
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,139
Mr. Xue,

217
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,379
let me negotiate with TNE

218
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,499
to get back the project.

219
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,340
Why didn't you answer my calls yesterday?

220
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,409
I have prepared all the documents
and figured out what happened with TNE.

221
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,610
Let me try.

222
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,770
I thought you left together
with Chen Nan.

223
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,689
We lost the deal for no reason.

224
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,139
So, as long as there is a slim chance,
I must give it a try.

225
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,449
But there is one thing
I must warn you early.

226
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,809
You step up to take on this task
at a period like this.

227
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,099
If you can't secure the deal,

228
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,619
everyone in the company might suspect

229
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,379
that you are Chen Nan's spy

230
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,499
behind this incident.

231
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,770
Can you handle that?

232
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,420
I won't give them a chance
to slander me.

233
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,180
Hello?

234
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,099
I would like to meet Ms. Lin.

235
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,769
I'm Xia Guo from Haowei.

236
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,569
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,460
She is not in the office right now.

238
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,769
I see.

239
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,809
Could you please pass a message to her?

240
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,139
We met before. She knows me.

241
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,529
I have a very important matter
to discuss with her.

242
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,219
I would like to make an appointment with her.

243
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,339
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,219
But Ms. Lin's schedule is fully booked

245
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,580
in the next three months.

246
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,890
Uh...

247
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,130
Look forward to our next collaboration.

248
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,569
Ms. Lin,

249
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,899
here's your takeaway coffee.

250
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,180
Decaf.

251
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,859
I'm Xia Guo from Haowei.

252
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,250
We met before.

253
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,770
What are you doing here?

254
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,449
I know you come here
to drink two cups of coffee every day.

255
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,180
One to drink here, one to take away.

256
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,220
Xia Guo,

257
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,289
are you aware

258
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,970
that you are invading my privacy?

259
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,929
Let me be honest,

260
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,370
whatever you do is useless.

261
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,720
The company has decided
to call off the collaboration with you.

262
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,580
Ms. Lin, can we talk?

263
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,569
If there is anything
you want to complement,

264
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,130
we will do our best to fulfill it.

265
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,929
You have seen

266
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,649
our commitment

267
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,649
and creativity before.

268
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,340
We sincerely want to work with you.

269
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,529
I warn you,

270
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,890
if you keep pestering me,

271
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,449
our company will never work

272
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,850
with Haowei anymore.

273
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,739
Ms. Lin.

274
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,610
Please reconsider, Ms. Lin.

275
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,300
Please come again.

276
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,660
Ms. Nan.

277
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,130
- Excuse me, here's your water.
- Thank you.

278
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,680
Are you insane?

279
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,080
Why did you invite me
to an expensive place like this?

280
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,420
Can you get reimbursed for this?

281
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,490
You can't call me here
just to catch up, right?

282
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,420
Ms. Nan,

283
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,130
I need your help.

284
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,250
This is not a casual talk.

285
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,490
Go on.

286
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,770
TNE called off the collaboration with us,

287
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,820
but I want to get it back.

288
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,300
Sorry,

289
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,090
but I can't help you with that.

290
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,859
I have nothing

291
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,449
to do with Haowei now.

292
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,770
You led me on this project
at the beginning.

293
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,569
I believe you want this to succeed

294
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,220
more than anyone else.

295
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,529
The business world

296
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,090
is a place without empathy.

297
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,139
Besides, you have seen

298
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,449
what Xue Yuming did to me.

299
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,379
I didn't stab him in the back,

300
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,610
that was the kindest thing
I have done to him.

301
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,610
Ms. Nan,

302
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,000
I remember you told me

303
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,640
that there is no absolute right or wrong
in the workplace.

304
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,289
To me, what Xue Yuming did

305
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,169
was to maximize

306
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,250
the interests of the company.

307
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,610
Also, it's not a bad thing
for you to leave.

308
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,560
The workplace doesn't exist
in black and white.

309
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,010
You taught me this.

310
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,340
It seems you have learned a lot.

311
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,700
How about considering leaving with me?

312
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,099
I just joined Haowei,
and I haven't proved myself yet.

313
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,300
Do you want to prove yourself,

314
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,060
or is it for Xue Yuming?

315
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,060
Ms. Nan,

316
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,529
after this incident,

317
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,770
I have seen clearly
what kind of person he is.

318
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,460
Besides work,
I won't approach him in any way.

319
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,970
Do you know,

320
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,979
I have worked at Haowei
for eleven years.

321
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,259
I witnessed it with my own eyes

322
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,049
how the company developed step by step

323
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,610
and came this far.

324
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,770
I did once feel

325
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,569
that the honor and shame of it

326
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,220
are closely related to me.

327
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,289
However, the group sent Xue Yuming

328
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,700
to be the general manager.

329
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,019
How could a parachuted general manager

330
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,689
feel attached to the company?

331
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,370
What he values is merely the KPI.

332
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,700
So, I figured it out later

333
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,739
that it's either he stays here temporarily,

334
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,139
or I leave the company.

335
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,460
It's simple as that.

336
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,010
That's why you used me to defeat him.

337
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,060
Ms. Nan,

338
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,220
to be honest,

339
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,850
you are different to me than Mr. Xue.

340
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,340
You brought me to Shanghai from Leshan.

341
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,580
In Shanghai, you are the person I rely on

342
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,610
and trust.

343
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,090
I don't care how Mr. Xue uses me.

344
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,130
But if you do that,

345
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
I feel hurt.

346
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
Well,

347
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,180
I owed you to that.

348
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,700
You might view the workplace
from another angle.

349
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,250
Be it a pawn

350
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,850
or cat's paw,

351
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,460
these roles

352
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,019
can change depending on the situation.

353
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,130
Nothing is permanent.

354
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,289
Maybe one day,

355
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,460
Xue Yuming might become your pawn.

356
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,409
I heard

357
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,019
that Xue Yuming is tight

358
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,820
with the chairman of Huanshi Group.

359
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,449
The sales performance in malls like them
ranks among the top in the nation.

360
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,019
Many international first-tier brands

361
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,050
compete to collaborate with them.

362
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,000
Getting a spot in their mall
is very difficult.

363
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,379
The main strategy of TNE this year

364
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,490
is to enter Huanshi.

365
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,010
Point taken.

366
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,860
Thank you, Ms. Nan.

367
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,460
No, you should thank yourself.

368
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,250
Did I hear you right?

369
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,050
You want me to help TNE
to enter Huanshi?

370
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,220
Precisely.

371
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,420
Xia Guo,

372
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,009
you have learned

373
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,409
to use your superior.

374
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,330
Why?

375
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,100
Am I not allowed to do that in return?

376
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,720
Are you trying to mean something else?

377
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,249
You used me to sign another ambassador.

378
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,579
So, it's my turn now

379
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,249
to use you to deal with Huanshi.

380
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,530
It's fair.

381
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,929
Stores in Huansi are in high demand.
I can't guarantee that.

382
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,449
If the TNE project falls through,

383
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,900
the responsibility isn't on me,

384
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,900
but you.

385
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,140
Not only have you learned to use me,

386
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,250
you have also learned to threaten me.

387
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,770
You are bold enough.

388
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,420
How could I stay beside you if I'm not?

389
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,599
Go and revise the proposal.

390
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,539
All right.

391
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,940
- Mr. Xue.
- Anything else?

392
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,460
If this pans out well,

393
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,490
do I get a bonus?

394
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,379
And?

395
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,810
And I will treat you to a big meal.

396
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,139
All right.

397
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,010
I will revise the proposal now.

398
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,720
(Yu Jian: Working overtime?)

399
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,860

401
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,050

Look forward to our collaboration.

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,810
- Please have some tea.
- Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

407
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,969
I have made some amendments.

408
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,380
What do you think?

409
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,900
Pretty good.

410
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,970
Did you hear that?

411
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,050
This girl is really something.

412
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,940
How so?

413
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,940
What were you saying? Louder.

414
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,180
Don't you know your own son?

415
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,730
No one can change his design.

416
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,489
Move the hanging cabinet below
to the right

417
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,810
to give space for
the tool storage hanging area.

418
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,969
No problem.

419
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,139
She changed his design,

420
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,940
and he said it was no problem. See?

421
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,449
You are overthinking it.

422
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,900
It's pointless to talk to you.

423
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,220
Dad, Mom.

424
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,689
If you have nothing else later,
we are going out.

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,409
Mrs. Yu,

426
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,299
Yu Jian and I will go
to check out the site.

427
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,099
Go ahead.

428
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,059
Wen Ya, wait here.

429
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,619
I want to take something from my room.
We can send a parcel later.

430
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,570
All right.

431
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,929
Guo, your coffee.

432
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,050
Thanks.

433
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,099
I was so worried for you.

434
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,449
Had you failed to secure the deal,

435
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,010
you might have been tortured
by the office gossip.

436
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,169
It would happen either way.

437
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,449
I would rather take a chance
and make some money.

438
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,379
That's more practical.

439
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,579
It's good now.

440
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,619
Even if you take Ms. Nan's place,

441
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,209
no one can say anything.

442
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,689
You are the big shot in Haowei.

443
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,489
You can't simply say that.

444
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,050
I never thought of that.

445
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,649
Besides, the competition

446
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,059
between Ms. Chen and Mr. Xue

447
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,530
reminds me that powerful people
are always lonely.

448
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,379
But that's common for powerful people.

449
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,330
Still, everyone wants to achieve that.

450
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,779
Guo, believe in yourself.

451
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,290
You have the facility.

452
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,420
Let me be honest with you.

453
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,250
I just came to Shanghai

454
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,010
to make money for a few years

455
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,380
before I go back to my hometown
and marry my boyfriend.

456
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,420
If it wasn't for his dad's injury
and he had to look after him,

457
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,299
he should've been

458
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,779

459

We would go have hotpot

460
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,490
What is G. Archi?

461
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,899
It is a top design firm.

462
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,970
It's very famous.

463
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
My boyfriend got the offer letter.

464
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,530
It's a shame
that something came up at home.

465
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,660
You see,

00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,460

I have an uncle who lives there.

473
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,520
I used to go there a lot
when I was a kid.

474
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,570
Really?

475
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,969
I have photos from that time in my phone.

476
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,570
Let me show you.

477
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,559
Give me a moment.

478
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,020
This one. Is it cute?

479
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,530
This is Nanjing Road Walkway.

480
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,620
It's like a movie set.

481
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,380
(Guo, I will be frank with you.)

482
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,970
(You have been doing so well now.)

(Probably, your boyfriend
back in the hometown)

484
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,380
(can't keep up with you anymore.)

485
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,209
I can introduce you

486
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,579
to some young and talented man.

487
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,539
They are handsome.

488
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,489
Pick anyone you like.

489
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,810
What for?

490
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,420
What do you mean?

491
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,339
You should

492
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,169
consider it for yourself.

493
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,530
You can't wait for this one guy.

494
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,969
Besides, it's always good

495
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,139
to meet more friends.

496

The men I introduce
are in good condition.

497
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,860
They are from a rich family
and are local here.

498
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,570
It's surely a good choice.

499
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,409
I will give you one word:

500
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,050
Absurd.

502
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,940
(I have been hesitating.)

503
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,860
(Still, I decided to send you this picture.)

504
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,100
(I just want to give you a heads-up.)

505
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,140
(In this moment,)

506
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,900
(my worries become a reality.)

507
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,379
(I have once confidently believed)

508
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,700
(that I could have both career and love.)

509
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,649
(However, I have overlooked the fact)

510
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,970
(that distance has created
blind spots between us)

511
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,970
(In somewhere I can't see,)

512
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,380
(who should I trust?)

513
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,059
It's fine.

514
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,730
I can walk myself.

515
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,299
I hold the brake.

516
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,619
I can really walk. Trust me.

517
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,900
Let go.

518
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,730
Where is she?

519
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,139
Jian, you are home.

520
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,530
Didn't you bring her back?

521
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,299
I tried to talk to her,
but she didn't want to see me.

522
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,810
What can I do?

523
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,779
It's better to let her cool down.

524
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,059
It's not a big deal, though.

525
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,810
Why did she want to break up with you?

526
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,810
You can't even bring
your girlfriend back after so many days?

527
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,530
Well,

528
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,010
stop meddling in this, all right?

529
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,530
We have been watching Guo

530
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,460
since she was little.

531
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,010
I don't think

532
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,299
they will break up.

533
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,139
Am I right, Jian?

534
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,620
Focus on your practice.

535
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,380
You are so troublesome.

536
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,929
I'm telling you this, Yu Jian,

537
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,169
she is my only daughter-in-law.

538
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,009
Oh, my. You are getting ridiculous.

539
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,250
Enough.

540
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,530
Give me some peace, will you?

541
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,249
I need to do my work now.

542
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,900
- I will look for her after that, okay?
- Fine.

543
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,530
Why do you keep torturing Jian?

544
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,339
Think about this.

545
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,050
You started this mess

546
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,730
because you demanded the household deed.

547
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,330
I think

548
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,660
you should go to see her yourself.

549
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,290
Tomorrow?

550
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,899
I can't. I'm busy tomorrow.

551
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,619
You haven't found a job yet.

552
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,009
How come you are busy?

553
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,420
I will send the address to you.

554
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,970
Hello?

555
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,420
Mrs. Yu?

556
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,620
Guo.

557
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,660
Guo,

558
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,490
why did you find a place

559
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,249
like this?

560
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,250
Can't you go home?

561
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,339
Listen to me.

562
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,819
Let's go home, all right?

563
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,940
Let's go home.

564
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,660
I will pack your luggage now.

565
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,169
Mrs. Yu, please don't.

566
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,899
I will pack your things up.
It won't take long.

567
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,689
Let's go back now.

568
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,649
You can't stay here.
This place is not comfortable.

569
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,460
Mrs. Yu, I'm not leaving.

570
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,900
Yu Jian couldn't eat or sleep well

571
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,250
since your argument.

572
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,099
He made a mistake,

573
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,620
and he should bear the responsibility.

574
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,099
How could he send you to plead for him?

575
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,660
That's unreasonable.

576
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,490
To be honest, it's not Yu Jian's fault.

577
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,339
It was my idea
to swap the household deed

578
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,409
and change the name.

579
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,249
I just want you both to have a place
to live after getting married.

580
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,940
I didn't have other intentions.

581
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,449
I can't understand

582
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,460
why your mom did that.

583
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,139
Other people's mothers would

584
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,539
help their own children

585
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,929
when they have a hard time.

586
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,169
But she hogs the house

587
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,539
and makes you pay the rent.

588
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,449
I have never seen a mother like her.

589
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,299
Mrs. Yu, it's her house.

590
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,299
She has the right

591
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,290
to do anything with it, right?

592
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,209
Besides,

593
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,330
you don't have to worry about that.

594
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,220
Yu Jian and I can live well
without a problem.

595
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,100
Yes, you can.

596
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,620
But as your parents,

597
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,330
who else can we worry about
except for you?

598
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,970
You can focus on yourself.

599
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,969
What's there to do with me?

600
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,169
I can eat and drink well.

601
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,409
I have a pension.

602
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,969
I go to play mahjong when I'm happy.

603
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,689
There is nothing to worry about myself.

604
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,009
But both of you...

605
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,250
There are many things you can do, Mrs. Yu.

606
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,379
You see,

607
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,409
you can go to a hot spring,

608
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,660
go hiking,

609
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,490
or hang out with your friends.

610
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,539
There is a new mall at Sansu Road.

611
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,779
It's big and beautiful.

612
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,660
And also restaurants along Chunxi Road.

613
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,010
That's the place for young people.

614
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,530
I won't go there.

615
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,859
You can go see a movie.

616
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,339
Guo,

617
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,689
the movies these days are all gory.

618
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,810
I don't really understand them.

619
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,209
I heard Andy Lau

620
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,729
has a new movie.

621
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,970
Who does he play?

622
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,299
Forget it. Movie tickets are expensive.

623
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,099
It's enough to buy a meal
for the family.

624
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,169
I... I won't go.

625
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,490
Mrs. Yu,

626
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,009
our living standard has improved.

627
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,770
We can afford to see movies.

628
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,409
We need to live

629
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,420
a colorful life, shouldn't we?

630
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,489
Even if you have grown old,

631
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,940
you still have your own life.

632
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,770
You have been toiling most of your life,

633
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,220
it's time to enjoy.

634
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,810
Guo,

635
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,339
when you grow up, you will realize

636
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,779
that worries are part of life.

637
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,899
We can't indulge in pleasure every day.

638
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,059
All we parents want is

639
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,209
that you both can

640
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,099
get married sooner and have a baby.

641
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,649
I would be happy

642
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,899
when I have a grandchild.

643
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,970
I will have a focus in life, right?

644
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,379
Mrs. Yu,

645
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,570
I have said what I needed to say.

646
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,570
As I told you before,

647
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,330
Yu Jian and I

648
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,810
should handle our problem ourselves,

649
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,380
all right?

650
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,180
You are back.

651
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,660
Can't they just make up already?

652
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,010
What are you doing?

653
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,330
I'm looking up some information.

654
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,620
What happened?

655
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,810
Why all the fuss
when you just got come?

656
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,660
Who made my wife angry?

657
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,940
The books are all over the place.

658
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,299
Don't move them.

659
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,539
I... I'm reading.

660
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,100
Don't mess them up.

661
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,640
(Outstanding Designer, Yu Jian)

662
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,010
What is this?

663
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,810
You forgot?

664
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,099
We signed up

665
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,860
for a tour group

666
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,250
to Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.

667
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,290
You bought it from there.

668
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,960
You really liked it. Did you forget?

669
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,220
I had time to go traveling?

670
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,810
When was this?

671
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,970
When Jian was in his senior year

672
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,380
and the year Yan went to the US.

673
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,040
Hadn't you mentioned it,
I would have forgotten.

674
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,970
Probably,

675
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,180
this is the early sign of dementia.

676
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,169
You should stop

677
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,330
sticking your oar in them.

678
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,570
Let them be.

679
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,860
We will focus on ourselves.

680
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,010
Isn't that good?

681
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,970
I have been abroad too.

682
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,579
I have arrived.

683
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,689
I can't see you.

684
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,929
Call his number.

685
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,050
I will send it to you.
He should be there.

686
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,050
Hello?

687
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:44,969
Me?

688
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,180
Are you Xia Guo?

689
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,940
I'm Zhong Jie.

690
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,290
Hi, but do I know you?

691
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,180
Well, we know each other now.

692
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,570
Please take a seat.

693
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,139
Madam Wang texts me.

694
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,380
She will be here soon.

695
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,530
This is my business card.

696
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,890
Let me introduce myself.

697
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,220
I work at a bank.

698
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,700
I'm a business manager.

699
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,890
I own a 120-square-meter house
in downtown.

700
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,620
It's not big, but the debt is clear.

701
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,580
I have a Passat.

702
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,379
A moderate car.

703
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,930
I have used it for five or six years.

704
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,529
I plan to switch to a bigger green car

705
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,890
before I get married.

706
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,730
I also have some savings in the bank.

707
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,580
My income is stable.

708
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,500
Together with the year-end bonus,
the total is about...

709
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,810
Excuse me, hold on.

710
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,330
Did my mom call me here
for a blind date?

711
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,500
Don't you know?

712
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,660
Probably, she tricked you
into coming here.

713
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,580
It's fine.

714
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,049
We can have a chat.

715
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,859
I'm sorry.

716
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,410
My mom likes

717
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,100
to play pranks.

718
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,620
No worries.

719
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,819
Perhaps Madam Wang wants
to give you a surprise.

720
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,049
Boy, come.

721
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,089
Do you like this balloon?

722
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:20,969
Yes.

723
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,100
Can you do me a favor?

724
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,899
It's a surprise

725
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,580
to see an interesting side of yours.

726
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,049
Yeah.

727
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,180
Sometimes, I do something

728
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,220
I wouldn't expect of myself.

729
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,850
You are a smart lady.

730
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,770
I'm sure many men like you.

731
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,529
What are you doing?

732
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,259
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,330
So sorry.

734
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,659
Apologize to him.

735
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,100
It's fine. He's just a kid.

736
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,969
We are so sorry.

737
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,450
- It's fine.
- How could you do that?

738
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,140
Please excuse me. I need to clean this.

739
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,969
Go on.

740
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,060
All right.

741
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,730
What...

742
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,410
What are you doing?

743
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,930
Ten wholes days.

744
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,250
You screened my messages and calls.

745
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,280
Turns out you are going on a blind date.

746
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,250
Why?

747
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,899
Can't I go on blind dates
after breaking up?

748
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,450
Did I agree to break up?

749
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,179
Do you think things can be resolved
if you avoid me?

750
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,540
How should we resolve it then?

751
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,290
Should we experience another round
of those messes again?

752
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,859
I texted you to apologize
for hundreds of times.

753
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,489
Why can't you

754
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,339
give me a chance

755
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,009
to apologize to you in person?

756
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,810
I hate it when people do that.

757
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,089
If I don't let it slide,

758
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,770
I would be blamed
for not being generous and I'm at fault.

759
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,540
I know

760
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,220
I have disappointed you.

761
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,620
For you,

762
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,980
I think I have lost my sense
of doing the right things.

763
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm stupid. I can't speak nicely.

764
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,859
But there is one thing

765
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,770
I'm confident I didn't do wrong.

766
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,140
That is, I want to marry you.

767
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,360
I promised I would give you happiness.
Surely, I will keep to my word.

768
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,920
If we don't have a house,
let's rent one.

769
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,520
If we don't have money,
let's make money.

770
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,220
I swear I won't give up
on this relationship.

771
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,220
But seeing you sitting here today,

772
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,659
do you want me to think
that the only thing I did right

773
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,890
was actually wrong?

774
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,450
That man is of means, isn't he?

775
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,930
Right.

776
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,330
If I had a house in downtown,

777
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,450
I wouldn't need to change
the household deed,

778
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,449
I wouldn't get cold feet

779
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,980
when your mom made demands,

780
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,290
nor would I have to furiously say
that you looked down on me and my family.

781
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,850
Argh, stupid mouth.

782
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,899
Who are you? Why are you sitting here?

783
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,250
I warn you, Xia Guo is my wife.

784
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,620
Stay away from her.

785
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,330
Is that funny?

786
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,370
I have seen people like you before.

787
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,410
You pass yourself off as a gentleman,

788
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,810
but you harbor evil plans inside.

789
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,730
Listen up,

790
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,770
if it wasn't for my upset her yesterday,

791
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,020
she wouldn't even meet you today.

792
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,049
Get this.

793
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,180
I can console

794
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,180
my wife.

795
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,180
You must be Yu Jian.

796
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,330
Did you check up on me?

797
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,450
No.

798
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,449
Xia Guo told me

799
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,500
she has a boyfriend named Yu Jian.

800
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,410
He is an excellent designer.

801
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,370
She also said...

802
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,290
This guy looks stuffy

803
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,129
and quiet.

804
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,489
But when it's something
related to Xia Guo...

805
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,410
He becomes different.

806
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,250
He tries in every way to make me happy.

807
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,250
To be honest, I have a boyfriend.

808
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,140
Yes.

809
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,930
His name is Yu Jian,

810
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,100
a very, very excellent designer.

811
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,100
We are childhood friends.

812
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,339
(In spring, he picks)

813
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,009
(the freshest strawberries,)

814
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,049
(arrange them into a heart shape,)

815
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,859
(and feed me.)

816
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,180
(When I finish them,
he says I ate his heart.)

817
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,969
(In summer, he brews soups
with all kinds of herbs.)

818
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,179
(He says summer is the time
to ward off cold in my body.)

819
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,259
(My sweat)

820
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,730
(smells like herbs.)

821
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,180
(But he says it smells better
than perfume.)

822
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,850
(In autumn, he takes me
to pick Osmanthus.)

823
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,730
(We make osmanthus wine at home)

824
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,140
(and drank it
during the Mid-autumn Festival)

825
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,129
(while hearing the story of Wu Gang
chopping the tree)

826
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,980
(and Chang'er flying to the moon from him.)

827
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,129
(In winter, he keeps a bag of chestnuts
in front of his chest to keep it warm.)

828
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,180
(He peels them one by one for me.)

829
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,100
(I feel bad for him,
and I pretend to be angry.)

830
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,180
(But he doesn't get upset.
He continues to peel.)

831
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,980
(Though there are times
when he has a temper)

832
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,739
(or does something wrong)

833
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,730
(to please others,)

834
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,129
(he still is)

835
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,049
(the most reliable person in the world,)

836
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,410
(the man who loves me the most,)

837
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,370
- Guo.
- (and I want to spend my life with.)

838
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,500
Guo!

839
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,129
I messed up your meal

840
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,890
and made you come here.

841
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,730
I'm to blame again.

842
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,320
You are eating the original flavor again?

843
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,660
Aren't you tired of it?

844
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,100
Other flavors were sold out.

845
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,500
Try the rose flavor.

846
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,930
The store owner said it's new. Try it.

847
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,540
No. I only want mine.

848
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,850
That's good.

849
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,140
Then, don't change your flavor
ever again.

850
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,700
All right?

851
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,580
It depends on my mood.

852
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,330
So, you lie

853
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,850
when you are in a bad mood.

854
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,020
I learned it from you.

855
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,770
Why are you staring at me?

856
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,540
You have your own dessert.

857
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,370
Eat it.

858
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,980
I like the original flavor too.

859
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,330
Can I taste it?

860
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,980
You can have it.

861
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,850
It's finished.

862
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,700
There is only one way now.

863
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,520
I know what happened
about the blind date.

864
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,930
I'm wrong again.

865
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,850
You can throw a tantrum.

866
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,620
But no matter how mad you are,

867
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,410
you are still the person
I love the most.

868
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,850
Guo,

869
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,850
let's get married.

870
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,620
I want to live a good life with you

871
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,660
for the rest of my life.

872
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,410
Come. Let me take you somewhere.

873
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,569
Where?

874
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,890
Come with me.

875
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,500
Please come in.

876
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,450
How do you like this place?

877
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,220
This is a first-hand
furnished apartment.

878
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,140
I think the decoration is pretty good,
so I rented it for three years

879
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,859
as our matrimonial home.

880
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,020
If you like it,

881
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,850
we can buy it.

882
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,089
If you don't,

883
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,699
I will find a bigger

884
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,770
and better place.

885
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,049
This is a fine house.

886
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,449
How much is the rent?

887
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,839
Let's not talk about money now.

888
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,540
Look at this floor-to-ceiling window.

889
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,489
When the sun sets,

890
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,770
you can witness

891
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,700
the most beautiful sunset from here.

892
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,450
I will put

893
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,489
a big sofa here.

894
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,219
When you are free,

895
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,129
you can sit here to drink coffee

896
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,290
and play with your phone.

897
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,500
And here,

898
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,980
I will put

899
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,890
a big dining table

900
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,020
where I can draw and read books.

901
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,859
Our baby

902
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,020
will crawl around at our feet.

903
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,540
Isn't that a wonderful scene?

904
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,100
How did you manage
to find a fine house like this?

905
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,770
Don't forget

906
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,739
that I'm a famous designer.

907
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,100
I post it on Moments,

908
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,049
and good houses will wait in line
for me to choose.

909
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,580
Don't brag.

910
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,140
This is the only thing

911
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,850
I have done right so far.

912
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,060
Can't you let me brag?

913
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,569
Let's make a deal here.

914
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,850
We will share the rent equally.

915
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,250
Why are you talking about money again?

916
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,620
You will become my wife soon.

917
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,220
What's mine

918
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,980
is yours.

919
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,219
I have good news for you too.

920
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,009
What is it?

921
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,129
I got an interview.

922
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,969
Shuangli Company invited me
for an interview.

923
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,250
Really? That's great.

924
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,450
(People say)

925
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,450
(that time is the greatest enemy of love.)

926
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,620
(But I think it's misunderstandings.)

927
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,620
(To clear the misunderstandings
between two people in love,)

928
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,330
(they must rely on a firm gaze
and heart for each other.)

929
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,020
(However, when we are miles apart,)

930
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,730
(the only thing we can do)

931
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:08,500
(is to strive to make ourselves stronger.)

932
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,370
Let's go.

933
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,700
I need to think about

934
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,290
what food to demand from you.

935
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,660
Yes, you should.

936
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,500
Thank you.

937
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,370
Can you tell me

938
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,660
who taught you that?

939
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,700
Ms. Nan.

940
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,100
Aren't you surprised?

941
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,529
I would be surprised

942
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,330
if it wasn't her.

943
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,980
Honestly, Ms. Nan has deep feelings
for the company.

944
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,009
Why can't you

945
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,620
make peace with each other?

946
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,890
Chen Nan is a capable person.

947
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,980
Give the devil her due,
she is competent.

948
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,930
Sometimes, the relationship between people
can be subtle and unclear.

949
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,730
We can't work together.

950
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,500
Maybe we just can't sit with each other.

951
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,489
Mr. Xue,

952
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,739
the first co-branded product

953
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,739
of our company and TNE

954
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,700
have entered the production line.

955
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,410
Well,

956
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,899
the bonus you mentioned before...

957
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,220
It's already in the process.

958
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,810
Thank you so much. Here's to you.

959
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,250
I will do the grilling.

960
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,850
This is

961
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,250
for you.

962
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,339
Me?

963
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,810
Yes, open it.

964
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,890
Uh...

965
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,929
You helped me

966
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,450
and the company a lot.
You made quite a progress.

967
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,060
So, I think you deserve this necklace.

968
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,250
I hope you will like it.

969
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,410
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

970
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,969
But this necklace is too valuable.

971
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,250
I can't accept it.

972
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,850
Thank you for your kindness.

973
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,009
This is a personal gift from me.

974
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,450
It won't be deducted from your bonus.

975
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,049
I... I didn't mean that.

976
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:31,819
I know.

977
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,620
But this gift is too valuable.

978
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,580
You should take that.

979
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,609
I'm sorry.

980
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,770
It's fine.

981
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,409
(Are you)

982
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,500
(surprised?)

983
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,779
(Guo,)

984
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,409
(your birthday gift is about
to board the plane.)

985
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,409
(It will arrive)

986
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,810
(before 12 AM.)

987
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,540
What's wrong?

988
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,540
It's my boyfriend.

989
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,060
He is coming to Shanghai.

990
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,450
Are you

991
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,980
going to meet him?

992
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,819
Guo, something happened at home.

993
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,089
I need to hurry back.

994
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,620
I can't come to Shanghai.

995
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,810
