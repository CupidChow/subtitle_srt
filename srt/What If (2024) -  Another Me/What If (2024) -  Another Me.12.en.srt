(Give and take, lose and gain)

4
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,470
Here's 100,000 yuan.

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,600
I gathered enough money,
to pay you back.

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,600
This is your advance payment.
Why are you giving it back?

7
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,240
Thanks to your money,

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,270
I managed to overcome the difficulties.

9
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,549
The debt has almost been paid off,

10
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,960
Guo found a job,

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,750
and Yiming's projects became stable,

12
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,150
which helped me a lot.

13
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,990
So, I want to repay you the money.

14
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
It's good to keep things clear
between us.

15
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,200
Yu Jian, do you really see me
as your client?

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,270
What's wrong?

17
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,800
Nothing.

18
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,030
I want to rest a bit and spend some time
with my wife.

19
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,150
I don't want her
to have unnecessary worries.

20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,550
I understand.

21
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,870
I won't disturb you and your family.

22
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,800
Wen Ya,

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,270
I'm very grateful that you trust me.

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,590
Thank you for helping me

25
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,920
when I had a tough time.

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,080
I will never forget this.

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,240
Once the blueprint is done,

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,199
I will have the most reliable colleague

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,199
to take over.

30
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,310
It will be done in good quality.

31
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,120
All right.

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,430
If you get tired

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,520
and want a listener

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,120
or just someone
to sit beside you quietly,

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,640
you must come to me.

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,430
Thank you.

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,949
I'm leaving. Bye.

38
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,800
Sure. Bye.

39
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,030
Dear.

40
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,430
Should we think of a name for our child?

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,030
We don't know
whether it's a boy or a girl. How?

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,120
What do you think about Yu Xingchen?

43
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,080
Or Yu Dahai?

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,800
That works.

45
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,200
Yu Dahai.

46
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,460
Why don't you call it Pang Dahai?

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,150
The pet name will be Luo Hanguo.

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,590
If it's a girl,
let's call it Jin Yinghua.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,120
I think,

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,480
whether it's a boy or a girl,

51
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,079
the name should include "Chen".

52
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
Why?

53
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,269
Think about it.
The pet name sounds better.

54
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,200
Chen.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,120
Chen?

56
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,960
Chen.

57
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,879
Chen.

58
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,759
That sounds pretty good.

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,240
Chen, have you eaten yet?

60
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,240
Chen.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,629
Chen, how is your test?

62
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,070
Why did you mess it up again?

63
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,630
You went for groceries?

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,950
Xiaoqin.

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,550
How's your daughter-in-law doing?

66
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,309
Not bad. But it's tiring

67
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,240
to look after her all by myself.

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,799
My daughter-in-law is quite opinionated.

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,719
My daughter-in-law

70
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,620
always drives me crazy.

71
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,480
She doesn't annoy me.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,159
But Yu Jian
always takes his wife's side.

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
He never agrees with me.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,519
Sons always forget their moms
after getting married.

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,039
That day, I saw Xia Guo

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,429
eating in a noodle house,

77
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,189
she added a lot of chili.

78
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,390
Is she still throwing up?

79
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,919
Not much.

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,519
I had a lot of morning sickness
when I was pregnant with my son.

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,749
Oh no.

82
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,840
Don't be nervous.

83
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,550
Though we can't be sure of it,

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,359
but just in case,

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,380
you need to find a method.

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,839
(Does this thing work?)

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,600
(It works like a charm.)

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,309
I secretly prepared some

89
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,240
for my daughter-in-law.

90
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,720
Guo.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,159
Mom.

92
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
It's late now.

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,840
Why haven't you taken a shower?

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,510
I'm waiting for Yu Jian.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,550
Thanks, Mom.

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,990
I don't think he will be back so soon.

97
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,390
I told him

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,359
not to work in a private company.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,309
They expect their staff
to work 24 hours a day.

100
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,549
But he wouldn't believe me.

101
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,510
Look, he works all day long

102
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,310
and forgets his wife and mom.

103
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,510
Guo, you are so sensible.

104
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,990
After I asked you not to use
the computer, you stop using it.

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,280
I say heels are dangerous,
you stop wearing them.

106
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,630
Also, you weren't mad at me

107
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,550
when I cut the power.

108
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,390
You understand me.

109
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,359
If the mom is careful,

110
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,360
the baby won't have any accidents,
right?

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,990
Mom.

112
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,120
I understand why you did all this.

113
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,959
But we should also believe in science,

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,839
shouldn't we?

115
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,309
Look, I have been reading this lately.

116
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,800
(Ten-month Pregnancy Guide Book)
It's really good.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
You can read it when you have time.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,390
All right. You read it yourself.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,629
I have been through this.

120
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,430
I believe in experiences.

121
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,840
You take the folic acid tablet
every day?

122
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,720
Yes, every day.

123
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,040
Well, hurry and take a shower.

124
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,480
All right, Mom.

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,390
Get rest early.

126
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,950
Are you sure you don't want
to continue Wen Ya's project?

127
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,070
You can get a handsome bonus afterward.

128
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,920
I told you many times.
My mind is made up.

129
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,240
Well, I won't try to convince you then.

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
Tang,

131
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,750
you should start training new designers.

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,680
You can't depend on me only.

133
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't deflect.

134
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
You don't want Guo to misunderstand you.

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,630
You think I don't know?

136
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,870
How about this?

137
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,630
You have been working too hard
these days.

138
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,630
Go on a short trip with Guo around here

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,070
and relax a bit.

140
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,630
Where have you been? It took so long.

141
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,270
I bought you some food.

142
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,720
The train doesn't sell food.

143
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,440
Nice. Where did you buy them?

144
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,790
Over there.

145
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,440
It was five years ago
when we came here last time.

146
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,510
The little train doesn't change.

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,270
The nanohana field remains too.

148
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,510
As brilliant as it used to be.

149
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,790
We are also the same.

150
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,030
Guo,

151
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,990
I have been thinking about

152
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,560
why I gave you the wrong idea

153
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,870
and why you feel insecure.

154
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,360
It's all because

155
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,840
I have neglected your feelings.

156
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,960
You are pregnant now.

157
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,120
And I'm preoccupied with my work

158
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,480
I didn't notice the problem.

159
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,630
You are a good mom

160
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,990
and wife.

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,960
But me,

162
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,360
I haven't even learned

163
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,080
to deal with these subtle changes.

164
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,990
It's my fault.

165
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,750
From now on,

166
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,360
I won't make you worry.

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,990
You feel terrible?

168
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,240
I shouldn't have bought you ice cream.

169
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,120
It's not that. My stomach feels painful.

170
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,189
What should we do?

171
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,750
Should I get you some hot water?

172
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Honey,

173
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,150
take me to the hospital.

174
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,519
(Leshan Maternity and Infant Hospital)

175
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,790
Does it still hurt?

176
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,480
Yu Jian!

177
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,240
- Mom.
- How many times

178
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,319
do I have to tell you

179
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,829
to be very careful?

180
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,499
Why wouldn't you listen?

181
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,549
The baby is the one
who gets hurt in the end.

182
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,560
Mom.

183
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,949
Guo, can you listen to me?

184
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,899
You can't be stubborn
as you like, right?

185
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,079
You are pregnant now,

186
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,829
and you still insist on going to work.

187
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,899
Do they give you overtime pay?

188
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,829
They won't.

189
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,719
You will wind up hurting yourself
and the baby.

190
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,119
- Right?
- Mom, enough.

191
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,030
What's the point of saying this now?

192
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,080
Guo didn't do it on purpose.

193
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,790
That's enough.

194
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,399
Go and pay the bills.

195
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Let Guo rest.

196
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,030
I was scared.

197
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,750
Sorry, Guo.

198
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,119
I apologize

199
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,390
for what Mom said just now.

200
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,630
All she cares about is the baby.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,360
My body also gets hurt.

202
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,670
I know.

203
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,560
Guo, how about this?

204
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,720
For your health,

205
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,829
can you please

206
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,960
not take on a demanding job like that?

207
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,910
I will earn money to provide
for you and the child.

208
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,960
Maybe you should
take a folic acid tablet first.

209
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,320
Here.

210
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,270
You are Xia Guo?

211
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,589
Do you feel better

212
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,670
after the progesterone injection?

213
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,270
I'm better now.

214
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,560
Have you strained yourself lately?

215
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,360
Did you take any supplements?

216
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,240
Lately?

217
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,279
I take this.

218
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,119
Let me check.

219
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
What is this?

220
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,670
Folic acid.

221
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,750
This one.

222
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,189
This is the thing that hurts you.

223
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,560
Who gave you this?

224
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,829
Isn't that folic acid?

225
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,120
No.

226
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,589
I don't know why this thing

227
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,270
suddenly spreads around here.

228
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,279
They say if one takes it,

229
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,120
they can decide the gender
of the babies.

230
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,879
This is ignorant.

231
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,399
Gender is determined

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,949
during conception.

233
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,599
How could it be changed casually

234
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,240
by eating such a thing?

235
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,429
The content

236
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,720
of this pill is unknown,

237
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
and yet they dare to give it
to pregnant women.

238
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,949
Considering your constitution,

239
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,349
you are likely to have a miscarriage
if you eat more supplements.

240
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,999
Besides, you have high blood pressure.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,549
Even if you don't eat this,

242
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,279
given your current condition,

243
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,870
I suggest you rest.

244
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,390
Don't do strenuous work.

245
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,840
Don't get anxious and rest well.

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,270
Let's go.

247
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,949
Mom, this is unbelievable.

248
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,639
How could you believe

249
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,039
in that nonsense?

250
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,519
You can't choose
the gender of the baby.

251
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,560
We almost lost the baby.

252
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,189
Who are you doing this for?

253
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,429
The doctor said

254
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,039
it's no use eating this kind of thing.

255
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,119
Why did you have to do that?

256
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Are you happy if the baby is gone?

257
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,999
Miss Xia, your results
of all the assessments

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,709
have met the requirements
of the company.

259
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,360
Congratulations,
you have become a regular employee.

260
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,919
The project you work on

261
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,239
has officially launched.

262
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,119
Next, you will be sent on
a business trip for a period

263
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,399
of research work.

264
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,990
It might be tough for you.

265
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,429
I see.

266
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,829
I know this is a special period for you.

267
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,949
To be frank,

268
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,910
this is a good opportunity.

269
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,239
Two people above you
were just transferred.

270
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,670
If you accomplish the project,

271
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,519
it's easy for you

272
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,120
to get a promotion.

273
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,600
How about this?

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,670
For your health,

275
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,949
can you please

276
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,030
not take on a demanding job like that?

277
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,150
I suggest you rest.

278
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,480
Don't do strenuous work.

279
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,840
(ID Card)

280
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,349
Guo, you are finally back.

281
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,429
I was worried sick.

282
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,080
Hurry and rest.

283
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,469
How do you feel now?

284
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,039
I wanted to pick you up
from the hospital.

285
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,560
But Yu Jian said
you wanted to go to your office.

286
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,200
Do you feel uncomfortable?

287
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,790
I'm good.

288
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,879
I... I'm preparing your lunch

289
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,829
and thinking

290
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,390
if I should deliver it
to your workplace.

291
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,910
I'm afraid it might bother you.

292
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,270
Why did you leave work so early?

293
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,520
Mom,

294
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,670
I'm going to resign.

295
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,470
Resign?

296
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,800
Guo,

297
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,039
please don't take my word for it.

298
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,109
I didn't mean that.

299
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,679
Please don't overthink.

300
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,199
I... I have thought it through.

301
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,059
From today on,

302
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,759
you can do anything you like.

303
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,279
Go to work if you want.

304
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,059
If you don't,

305
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,139
ask Yu Jian to take you on a trip.

306
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,179
Your emotion is the priority now.

307
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,870
Mom, it's not that.

308
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,000
It doesn't concern you.

309
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,149
(Two people above you
were just transferred.)

310
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,520
(If you accomplish the project,)

311
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,439
it's easy for you

312
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,280
to get a promotion.

313
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,710
I'm sorry,

314
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,430
but I can't do this job.

315
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,909
I want to take care
of myself and my child.

316
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,589
(Shuangli Trading Co., Ltd.)

317
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,670
She wants to quit?

318
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,430
Are you sure?

319
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,080
Before I got pregnant,

320
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,230
I always heard people say,

321
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,150
"You haven't been pregnant before,
you wouldn't understand."

322
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,080
I thought to myself

323
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,600
that why they became so timid

324
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,870
after having a baby.

325
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,320
I even thought

326
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,710
if I got pregnant one day,

327
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,560
I would never become someone like them.

328
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,069
But the moment

329
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,390
I'm pregnant with this baby,

330
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
I suddenly realize

331
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,870
some changes have happened naturally.

332
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,520
My mother-in-law was right
about one thing.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
She said

334
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,000
the moment you get pregnant,

335
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,150
you shoulder a responsibility and mission
that can't be replaced by others.

336
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,470
If I hurt my baby because of the work,

337
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,039
I think I will regret it for my life.

338
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,840
(ID Card)

339
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,600
Guo, you are so sensible.

340
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,479
From now on, I won't force my opinions

341
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,710
on you anymore.

342
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,470
Mom, I'm also a mother now.

343
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,470
I understand your concerns.

344
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,710
I believe

345
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,230
you will take good care of yourself

346
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,190
and the baby inside you.

347
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,670
Mom.

348
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,520
Hi.

349
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,910
Is anyone sitting here?

350
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,760
No. Please sit.

351
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,150
What a coincidence.

352
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,430
We ordered from the same restaurant

353
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,120
and the same meal.

354
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,760
You are right.

355
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,870
This restaurant serves
good and fresh takeout.

356
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,320
Oh, right. Last night,

357
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,390
did Migao meet her dad?

358
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,120
It's a rare chance for us
to return here.

359
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,430
I just got to comfort this little tyke.

360
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,109
So, you came back here

361
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,840
together with your husband?

362
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,000
We didn't get married.

363
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,040
This is also his first time
meeting Migao.

364
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,589
Back then,

365
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,149
after working in the company here
for a few years,

366
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,000
I was given a chance to study abroad.

367
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,000
He decided to stay here and work.

368
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,430
Naturally, we broke up.

369
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,390
After we broke up, I found out

370
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,190
that I was pregnant.

371
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,870
So, you had never told

372
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,470
Migao's dad about this?

373
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes.

374
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,390
I was willful, right?

375
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,470
Back at that time,

376
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,630
I was more proud than I am now.

377
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,760
I didn't want to stay for him,

378
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,910
and he wouldn't leave for me either.

379
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,909
Both of us

380
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,760
couldn't compromise for each other.

381
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,760
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

382
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,360
Never mind.

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I broke up with him.

384
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,910
Isn't it said

385
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,150
that the one who breaks it off
suffers less?

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,710
Now, my second advice to you.

387
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,710
The one who breaks it off...

388
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,320
The one who breaks it off suffers less.

389
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,950
I was told

390
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,190
that he suffered a lot after that.

391
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,910
So,

392
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,320
do you want to get back
together with him?

393
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,670
That would be great if it were possible.

394
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,910
I was impulsive,
and I regretted my decision,

395
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,150
especially when watching Migao grow up.

396
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,630
I think

397
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
it would be perfect

398
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
if I could give her a perfect family.

399
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,080
Father's love is important, right?

400
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,190
Indeed.

401
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,630
Have you mentioned it to him?

402
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,040
What if... I mean, if.

403
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,560
What if he has

404
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,800
a new partner now?

405
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,000
So what?

406
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,470
He is Migao's dad.

407
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,320
No one can change that.

408
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,950
Do you still love him?

409
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,710
I mean, Migao's dad.

410
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,420
Can we not talk about

411
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,390
complicated and heavy things like this?

412
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,190
Eat up. We are hungry.

413
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,710
(Actually, I know)

414
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,320
(I always have a place in his heart.)

415
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,950
He has been seeing
some women these years.

416
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,040
(But no one could really
make him settle down.)

417
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,870
(So he changes the password)

418
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,670
(of his door lock every two months.)

419
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,670
(But Migao is different.)

420
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,150
Migao is his daughter.

421
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,360
I also believe

422
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,430
(he will stay for Migao.)

423
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,870
(Xue Yuming: Why aren't you
at the office? At home?)

424
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,279
(I forgot to tell you this morning.
I changed the password.)

425
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,320
(378926.)

426
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,460
Door unlocked.

427
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,840
♪Don't you see my light?♪

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,720

(I hope I can be the honor

435
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,000
(You will. By Man)

436
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,040
(I can't decide)

437
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,670
(whether or not he
will choose another person.)

438
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,439
(But I won't give up so easily)

439
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
(like I did before.)

440
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,239
I will try my best
to keep him by my side.

445

(Xue Yuming: Why did you ignore my calls?)

446
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,560
(Xia Guo: Thanks for your care these days.)

447
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,549
(I have transferred the rent to you.)

448
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,360
(Spend more time with your family.)

449
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,840
(Besides, I request a transfer.
Please approve.)

450
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,040
No matter what has happened,

451
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,870
don't lose yourself.

452
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,470
Right.

453
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,950
Why bother putting
so much effort into things

454
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,560
are not meant for me?

455
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,710
Actually, we should cherish
the happiness we have,

456
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,800
even if it's a little bliss.
We should cherish it.

457
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,760
What about you? Have you found yours?

458
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,230
I'm feeling the baby grow up each day.

459
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,950
I'm contented.

460
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm truly happy for you.

461
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,560
Even since I have him,

462
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,560
I feel

463
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,710
a connection with another life.

464
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,950
It's amazing.

465
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,080
Though I get anxious sometimes,

466
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,360
I will protect him well.

467
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,150
I surely will.

468
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,280
You are brave.

469
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,670
Don't be dejected.

470
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,360
You will find your own happiness.

471
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,230
In life, you have to give and take.

472
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,760
I will put myself together.

473
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,600
(Can't you really go with me?)

474
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,710
(Tell me. Can't you leave for me?)

475
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,520
It has been a long while, Brandon.

476
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,000
Was it a smooth journey?

477
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,150
This is my daughter, Xue Nuo, or Migao.

478
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,840
Six years old.

479
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,239
Sweetie, you wanted
to look at Dad's picture

480
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,280
while you were on the plane.

481
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,390
Why are you silent
when you see the real person?

482
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,760
Come. Say hi to Dad.

483
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,390
Dad.

484
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,869
Hello, Ms. Ping.

485
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,039
Director Xia, you have changed.

486
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,109
Why didn't you tell me
when you returned to Leshan?

487
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,799
I just got back.
I went to the mountain for my research.

488
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,430
I thought of calling you
when things were done.

489
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,199
Are you free tonight?
Let's have dinner.

490
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,320
Sure. See you then.

491
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,320
Okay. See you then.

492
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,149
(Welcome to Zhanggong Bridge Food Street)

493
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,360
Cheers.

494
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,080
I was afraid to tell you

495
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,840
that their wedding is
at the end of this month.

496
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,560
Guo, let it go.

497
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,430
You are the past to him.

498
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,120
Can one really let go
of their past relationship?

499
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,190
I understand your hard feelings.

500
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,719
After all, you have been together
since childhood.

501
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,230
It's unfortunate that it ended.

502
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,630
All I can say is love relationships

503
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,480
are flimsy.

504
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,480
So is marriage.

505
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,400
Many marriages

506
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,000
are sustained

507
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,710
by children.

508
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,480
I'm an example.

509
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,120
Do you think the relationship

510
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,270
between two people might change
because of children?

511
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Definitely yes.

512
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,440
Feelings just go away over time.

513
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,670
But if they have children,

514
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,120
they will have a common goal.

515
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,350
They hope the children will
grow up happily and healthy.

516
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,750
In a marriage,

517
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,400
familial love occupies more.

518
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,150
Is it good or bad

519
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,830
for a marriage
to be led by familial love?

520
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,670
Guo, Yu Jian is getting married soon.

521
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,830
Get over it.

522
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,790
It wasn't about Yu Jian.

523
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,230
I just wonder.

524
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,509
(Allen)

525
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,670
I found a suitable place for you.

526
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,230
Do you have a boyfriend?

527
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,559
No.

528
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,559
It's my friend.

529
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,920
He's looking for an apartment for me.

530
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,120
You should find a boyfriend soon.

531
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,310
Don't stay single for too long, right?

532
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,639
You know what,
this apartment is perfect.

533
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,799
Even though it is in the suburbs,

534
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,350
the rent is low.

535
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,000
Right here.

536
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,710
No. 510. Remember the door number.
Don't forget.

537
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,199
I have cleaned up the place

538
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,799
and have the property management staff

539
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
to fix whatever that needs repairing.

540
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,710
This is great.

541
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,150
You are a speed fiend.

542
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,079
I'm very familiar
with this kind of staff.

543
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,759
I live right next door, No. 509.

544
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,400
Knock on my door if you need anything.

545
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,670
You can also knock on the wall.

546
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,120
You live next door?

547
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,120
What a coincidence.

548
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,029
Actually, I was thinking that
you didn't even have to rent this place.

549
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,079
My house is spacious.

550
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,949
I can give you a room.

551
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,670
Well, no. This place is good. Thank you.

552
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,310
New neighbor, please look out for me.

553
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,710
You too.

554
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,799
Anyway,

555
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,309
thank you for finding me this place.

556
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,440
If not, I would still
be living in the motel.

557
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,150
Buy me a meal, then.

558
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,830
Sure. What do you want to eat?

559
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,349
Let's eat at my place.

560
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,230
I will cook, but it's your treat.

561
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,520
Sure, no problem. I will buy groceries.

562
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,309
No need, I bought everything.

563
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,429
Just come over.

564
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,580
So, you are still paying for this.

565
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,349
Let's just consider it as your treat.

566
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,469
Is there anything you don't eat?

567
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,790
I eat everything.

568
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,559
You are fast.

569
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,230
I can't wait when it comes to food.

570
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,480
Your place is big.

571
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,429
Did you own this?

572
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah.

573
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,879
I was joking. It's my friend's.

574
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,319
He goes to Antarctica to see penguins,

575
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,200
so I look after his house.

576
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,799
I was taken aback.

577
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,350
Let me look at the view here.

578
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,349
You live next door.

579
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,960
The views can't be different.

580
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,520
You are right.

581
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,880
I used to think

582
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,639
that even if I strived
to open another window,

583
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,150
my life would be very different.

584
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,000
But now I realize

585
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,830
that no matter how many windows I open,

586
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,600
what I can see is more or less the same.

587
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,440
When you come to this place
from next door,

588
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,560
at least you have received
a glass of wine.

589
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,270
Consider whether or not
it is worth opening this window.

590
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,949
You are interesting, young man.

591
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,159
You have a way with words.

592
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,960
There is a lot more interesting
about me.

593
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,190
You will find out later.

594
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,120
You have such a facility
for mixing drinks.

595
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,159
At first, I thought
it was just your hobby.

596
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,349
Yet, you put so much effort into it.

597
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,469
It's fun for me.

598
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,719
I dream of opening

599
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,080
my own bar one day.

600
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,790
So I must do it seriously.

601
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,480
Are young people nowadays so driven?

602
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,120
Of course, we want to make money.

603
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,190
But you don't have to be like me.

604
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,120
You can choose an easy path.

605
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,440
Why?

606
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,560
You have a high-flying boyfriend, right?

607
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,960
What happened? You quarreled?

608
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,790
Is he married?

609
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,750
He cheats? He has a child?

610
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,239
No, stop guessing.

611
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,429
I'm right, then.

612
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,719
You didn't respond

613
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,869
to any of my questions,

614
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,920
but you got anxious
when I mentioned children.

615
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,869
What a risky game you play.

616
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,909
That's not true.

617
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,469
Young man, just mind your own business

618
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,559
and focus on your startup plan.
Don't be nosy.

619
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,710
Are you saying that to yourself too?

620
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,790
Let's give a toast to Xia Guo
for her career.

621
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Jeez.

622
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,790
Here's to our hard-earned life. Cheers.

623
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,350
Come.

624
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,349
- You are back, Guo.
- Yes.

625
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:12,429
It has been a long time.

626
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,079
I bought something nice.
Let's share it at lunch.

627
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,440
Sure.

628
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,949
Guo, you are finally back.

629
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,989
You didn't tell me where you went.

630
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,520
I went back to my hometown.

631
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,949
Did you go and

632
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,120
secretly meet your boyfriend?

633
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,799
I didn't. Don't talk nonsense.

634
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,120
We had already broken up.

635
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,469
I went for research.

636
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,710
When did that happen?

637
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,120
Tell me in detail.

638
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,190
Does it have anything to do
with quitting as Mr. Xue's assistant?

639
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,799
Of course not.

640
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,750
Then why did you break up with him?

641
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,350
You have been trying so hard
to maintain the relationship.

642
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,400
Well,

643
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,230
another long-distance relationship
fell through.

644
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,599
Inform the team
to come to the meeting room.

645
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,710
Yes.

646
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,600
We have a meeting later.

647
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,000
Xia Guo, you are back.
Is the journey smooth?

648
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,829
Yes.

649
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,150
I'm almost done with my proposal.

650
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,270
Good. Mine too.

651
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,120
By the way, does Mr. Xue know
you are back?

652
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,230
Do I have to report
my business trip to him?

653
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,350
Of course not.

654
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,960
But he asked me about you yesterday.

655
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,310
Please tell him, then.

656
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
Please excuse me. I got to go.

657
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,040
I smell something is going on
between you and Yvonne.

658
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,270
You have a better nose than dogs.

659
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,279
The competition between you both
is about to start.

660
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,440
Having mind games is predictable.

661
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,670
Don't exaggerate it.

662
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,480
Fair warning.

663
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,230
Yvonne

664
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,230
seems to be quite close with Mr. Xue.

665
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,989
I have seen them sitting together
several times

666
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,600
when I went downstairs for lunch.

667
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,040
You said they graduated
from the same university.

668
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,040
It's normal that they are close.

669
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,949
You know what?

670
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,750
When they sit together,

671
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,989
they look quite compatible.

672
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,750
If they were ten years younger,

673
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,750
they would be like
the smartest and prettiest couple.

674
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, stop gossiping about others.
Just mind your own business.

675
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,429
I'm not gossiping.

676
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,400
I'm worried about you.

677
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,239
If something really happens
between them,

678
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,670
you might lose your chance.

679
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,119
Just think about
the Spring Morning case.

680
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,710
Obviously, you are out of favor.

681
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,400
On top of that, you are transferred.

682
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,279
Otherwise,
you could've had first dibs on it.

683
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,960
At least, it could be helpful for you.

684
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,040
I don't need that.

685
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,380
Silly.

686
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,000
Hi.

687
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,560
Is she asleep?

688
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,710
Come in.

689
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,920
Let me do it.

690
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,440
You have been either working
or being with Migao these days.

691
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,190
Won't your girlfriend get angry?

692
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,350
You know what it is about.

693
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,310
Seriously?

694
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,480
What am I supposed to know?

695
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,230
You know very well what you have done.

696
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,630
I don't know
what you are talking about.

697
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,960
It's late now. I should get going.

698
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,750
It's quite a day for you. Sit for a while.

699
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,150
Hold here.

700

(Haowei Food Group)

701
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,710
Hi,

702
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,000
haven't you left yet?

703
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,080
I just had the proposal revised.

704
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,920
I bought you some food. It's still hot.

705
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,230
I have eaten. Thank you.

706
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,560
Can we talk?

707
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,440
Is it about the work?

708
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,350
If not, there is nothing else
we can talk about.

709
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,630
I'm busy.

710
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,960
Well, I will leave you to it then.

711
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,000
(You should've told me so.)

712
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,520
(I was struggling for the past few days.)

713
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,920
(You are happy now?)

714
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,350
I am.

715
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,670
Can you stay with me a bit longer?
