Guo, is it convenient
for us to meet now?

29
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,460
Yeah, please come inside.

Guo,

32
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,130
I'm truly sorry.

33
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,410
It all happened
because of my willfulness.

34
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,899
That's why you had to...

35
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,220
Enough already.

36
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,810
Yan, don't bring it up.
It's all in the past now.

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,060
I don't blame you for it.

38
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,459
I'll be honest with you.

39
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,050
I feel terrible when I see the situation

40
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,260
between you and Jian.

41
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,209
Now that I think about it,

42
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,820
I know you felt desperate back then.

43
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,970
After all, two lives were at stake.

44
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,259
But Jian saw blood
all over the floor in my room.

45
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,139
I'm sure he panicked.

46
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,650
That's why he couldn't tend to you.

47
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,610
I know that.

48
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,340
Chen.

49
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,090
Look at who's here. It's your aunt.

50
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,849
Say hi to your aunt.

51
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,580
Say hello to her.

52
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,900
He's tiny.

53
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,580
Do you want to carry him?

54
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,780
You can give it a try.

55
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,019
You must be happy
that your aunt is carrying you.

56
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,289
Chen is such a good boy.

57
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,019
He's smiling.

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,260
Are you happy?

59
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,610
He's smiling.

60
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,969
He's a good boy.

61
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,090
He can already sleep soundly now.

62
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,840
And, he doesn't cause trouble
late at night either.

63
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,410
That's great. He's so cute.

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,530
Your aunt is praising you. Look at her.

65
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,940
Here, Chen.

66
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,769
Here's a gift from your aunt.

67
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,019
In the future, I'll spend

68
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
all my money on you, okay?

69
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,580
You're thanking her, huh?

70
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,940
I'll get you a gold chain in the future.

71
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,170
Yan,

72
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,340
you'll have a child too.

73
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,730
Wait for me to finish
the divorce case in the U.S.

74
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,970
After that, I'll finish
my postgraduate studies.

75
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,050
I can lead a good life
even when I'm alone.

76
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,580
Okay.

77
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,820
Everything will get better.

78
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,940
Look, he's staring at you.

79
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,340
Why the rush?

80
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,380
Your blood pressure will rise
due to this, you know?

81
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,290
The child will come back eventually.

82
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,220
He's back.

83
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,260
I'll heat your meal.

84
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,940
I already had dinner with my colleagues.

85
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,970
I thought Guo allowed you
to go back to her house.

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,850
You're triggering him again.

87
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,410
You're something else.

88
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,529
You should've told us

89
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,580
that you weren't having dinner
with us tonight.

90
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,530
My phone's battery was flat.

91
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,490
No wonder.

92
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,760
Yan called us and told us
that his phone was switched off.

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,409
Your sister wanted me to tell you

94
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,579
that the divorce case was over.

95
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,289
She found a unit

96
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,769
together with her coursemate
near the academy.

97
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,170
She said it was a safe place.

98
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,499
That's great.

99
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,490
Her troubles are finally over.
What about you?

100
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,800
My first grandson will celebrate
his one-month birthday tomorrow.

101
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,139
Do you expect Guo to live there

102
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,259
together with Chen forever?

103
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,259
I can't just abduct them, right?

104
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,580
Why did I give birth
to a useless son like you?

105
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,730
Didn't you watch videos of him?

106
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,090
That's different.

107
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,499
We want to see the real deal.

108
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,360
We want the real baby!

109
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,650
The real baby.

110
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,580
I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

111
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,939
In-law, long time no see.

112
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,170
We're here to visit them.

113
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,290
Mom, we're here to visit Guo and Chen.

114
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,460
Let me see. You're making
this sweater for Chen, right?

115
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,259
It's cute. It's white and clean.

116
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,410
I know how to do this too. Let me do it.

117
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,380
It's fine, Mom. You don't need to.

118
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,220
It's no trouble.

119
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,529
Mom, aren't you here
to visit Guo and Chen?

120
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,819
Why are you knitting a sweater?

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,850
You see,

122
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,379
I'm not just here to visit Chen.

123
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,409
I'm here to visit Guo too.

124
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,379
You can have Chen's sweater.

125
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,260
Guo, let me take a good look at you.

126
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,530
You look healthy.

127
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,320
You look like your body
has recovered considerably.

128
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,730
Your recovery is going well.

129
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,090
Mom,

130
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,580
Chen is sleeping. The maternity nurse
is taking care of him.

131
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,340
That's good.
It's good for him to sleep more.

132
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,300
Mom, Guo,

133
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,420
my mother and I are here

134
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,460
to discuss something with you two.

135
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,580
We hope that you and Chen could
go back and live with us for a few days.

136
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,660
The confinement period is finally over.

137
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,250
That's why we're here to visit Guo

138
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,340
and my eldest grandson.

139
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,499
Don't you think it's time for you
to leave after seeing the child?

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,049
In-law, why the rush?

141
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,409
It's rare for us to visit you.

142
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,769
I brought Yu Jian here

143
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,850
so that he could
apologize to Guo in person.

144
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,180
Mom, Yu Jian already apologized to me.

145
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,090
But you haven't forgiven him.

146
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,340
If you don't forgive him,

147
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,130
I'll kick him out of the house, then.

148
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,130
Enough.

149
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,850
Stop trying to push everything to Guo.

150
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,460
To be honest with you,

151
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,099
we made Guo spend
her confinement period here

152
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,490
because you had
to take care of your daughter.

153
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,339
How could you tend to

154
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,850
a wife who just gave birth

155
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,180
and a new baby at the same time?

156
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,820
You're right.

157
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,929
Miss, the baby is awake.

158
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,340
He's awake. Let me carry him.

159
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,180
Mom is here.

160
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,580
Chen.

161
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,730
You're awake.

162
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,259
He's awake.

163
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,289
Did you sleep well?

164
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,490
Guo,

165
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,890
can you let Mom carry him?

166
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,580
Chen.

167
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,610
I finally saw you in real life.

168
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,220
Am I right?

169
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,420
Did you see Grandma? I'm over here.

170
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,809
You saw me, right?

171
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,099
Grandma is over here.

172
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,610
You don't know who I am, right?

173
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:28,929
Guo,

174
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,769
his eyes and nose resemble yours.

175
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,820
Look. He has big and beautiful eyes.

176
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,340
He'll be gorgeous in the future.

177
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,060
You'll be a handsome guy
in the future, right?

178
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,850
Yeah. Grandma does miss you.

179
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,289
You still don't know me, huh?

180
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,540
Guo,

181
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,890
may we speak in private?

182
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,660
Come inside.

183
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,090
Look at my precious baby.

184
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,940
I'm your grandmother.

185
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,660
Why are you still standing there?
Pack these things up.

186
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,250
Guo,

187
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,850
have you stopped blaming me for it?

188
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,890
Blame you? For what?

189
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,099
Should I blame you for
carrying Yan to the hospital?

190
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,010
Or should I blame you for abandoning me?

191
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,370
I'm not blaming anyone for it.

192
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,339
Yan was in danger back then.

193
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,090
I'm sure you had to save her.

194
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,890
But I...

195
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,490
Dear, I'm sorry.

196
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,250
It's all my fault.

197
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,580
It hurts so much.

198
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,540
Dear, it hurt so much back then.

199
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,370
I was terrified.

200
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,529
I know.

201
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,060
You don't.

202
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,460
The doctor said

203
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,610
we had to do a C-section
because the fetus lacked oxygen.

204
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,689
The fetus lacks oxygen.
The fetus is at risk of asphyxia.

205
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,200
We need to perform surgery
on you immediately.

206
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,970
Where's your family?

207
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,250
I came here alone.

208
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,130
But none of you were by my side.

209
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,250
I had no choice but to
sign the agreement myself.

210
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,820
I was afraid that
I might've died back then.

211
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
(Individual or Representative: Xia Guo)

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,540
Dear, it's all my fault.

213
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,820
Why don't you hit me, then?

214
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,490
You can inflict the pain

215
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,099
you felt to me, okay?

216
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,370
Come.

217
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,540
Does this hurt?

218
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,700
It was 10,000 times
more painful back then!

219
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,730
If so, you can pinch me 10,000 times.

220
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,259
This time, I promise

221
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,540
I won't make a sound. I swear.

222
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,610
You still have 9,996 times to go.

223
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,289
Does it hurt?

224
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,540
It doesn't.

225
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,490
Dear, you're finally smiling.

226
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,180
I truly know my fault now.

227
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,730
Dear, can we go home?

228
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,420
I can't live without you and Chen.

229
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,130
I haven't agreed to it yet.

230
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,890
I know you're not willing
to come to my house.

231
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,970
If so, can you let me stay?

232
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,220
Let me take care of you two, okay?

233
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,130
I don't agree.

234
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,219
Why do you object

235
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,890
to all of my decisions?

236
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,220
It's not that easy to raise a child.

237
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,739
The maternity nurse has left.
Yu Jian has to work every day.

238
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,169
What can he do to help you out?

239
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,820
He's just duping you.

240
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,259
At most, I can raise him myself.

241
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,730
What about your work?

242
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,379
Do you intend
to raise him all your life?

243
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,180
Chen will grow up, you know?

244
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,490
If it doesn't work out,
I can hire a nanny.

245
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,820
I already told you before.

246
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,610
Although Zhang Xiaoqin
isn't a great person,

247
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,809
she should be able to take care

248
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,420
of her grandson without any issues.

249
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,259
Just return
to your mother-in-law's house.

250
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,220
This way, you can spare yourself
from all the trouble.

251
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,370
You're just reluctant to
part with that rental income of yours.

252
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,289
I'll pay you the rent.

253
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,019
Just like before.

254
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,890
I'll rent it from you, okay?

255
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,769
I don't want your money.

256
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,220
I just want you to move into her house.

257
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,169
Mom, it's not like
you didn't see for yourself

258
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,689
when I was giving birth.

259
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,220
She has so many people to take care of.
She won't be able to cope with it.

260
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,610
Instead of relying on other people,
I would rather rely on myself.

261
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,370
Isn't that what you always advocated?

262
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,770
Now, I have decided to rely on myself.

263
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,660
Fine.

264
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,700
Anyway, it's your choice.

265
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,340
I'll stay out of your life
in the future.

266
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,529
Mom, we're just worried
that you might be too tired.

267
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,739
We want you to focus on Dad.

268
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,010
You do make it sound nice.

269
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,660
Guo is just blaming me for the incident.

270
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,499
No. I came up with the suggestion.

271
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,569
I'm sure she and her mother
forced you to relay the message.

272
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,220
If I must say,
she's a terrible mother-in-law.

273
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,649
She even wants you to pay her rent.

274
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,019
She's a grandmother now.

275
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,700
She wouldn't think about
something like that.

276
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,689
Besides,

277
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,130
even if it's paying her,
I'm willing to do so.

278
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,420
Right now, Guo's comfort is my priority.

279
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,619
Once Guo lives comfortably,

280
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,649
you can visit Chen from time to time,

281
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,289
am I right?

282
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,979
We can

283
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,900
also bring Chen back home
from time to time.

284
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,730
I understand now.

285
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,660
You're just saying that I'm not
good enough to raise my grandson.

286
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,050
How is that possible?

287
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,220
If I must say,

288
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,489
you see, in the end,

289
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,490
if both Guo and I have to work,

290
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,169
you'll have a valid reason

291
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,409
to help us take care of our child,

292
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,460
am I right?

293
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,140
You're taking things for granted,
aren't you?

294
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,489
We just want you and Dad

295
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,220
to enjoy your lives.

296
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,900
Fine. I'll stay at home
and enjoy my life.

297
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,139
Now,

298
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,620
your wife is making the call anyway.

299
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,250
Now that you have a wife,
you forget about your mother.

300
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,059
That's not true! Mom, that hurts!

301
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,730
I dare not forget about you.

302
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,559
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

303
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:12,040
(Osmanthus Tower
Community Fitness Center)

304
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,139
Dad, Mom.

305
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,009
Our eldest grandson is back!

306
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,970
Call Grandpa and Grandma.

307
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,649
Come, Chen.

308
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,570
My baby grandson is back.

309
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,209
Look at Guo.

310
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,440
She did a great job
in raising our grandson.

311
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,619
Turn around and let me take a look!

312
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,100
Your mother has done
a great job here, am I right?

313
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,250
Dad, how's your recovery going?

314
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,050
I'm doing great.

315
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,689
I can throw these crutches away

316
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,180
in just a few more days.

317
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,380
You can carry him.

318
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,770
Forget it. He might
slip out of my hands.

319
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,539
Pass Chen to Guo.

320
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,969
Let's enjoy our reunion dinner.

321
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,180
Okay.

322
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,730
Did he poop?

323
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,810
It's time.

324
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,099
The diaper is here. Come.

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,409
Prepare some warm water for me.

326
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,449
- Let's go.
- Okay.

327
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,970
- Let's go.
- Let me change into the slippers.

328
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,409
He's upset now.

329
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,579
That's why he pooped.

330
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,970
We'll be done soon.

331
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,729
Look.

332
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,490
(This tiny and precious living being)

333
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,380
(brought two generations
of people together.)

334
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,900
(It showed me
the definition of a family.)

335
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,970
(There's food on the table,)

336
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,810
(flowers by the wall,)

337
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,250
(whispers of advice in my ears,
and warmth in one's embrace.)

338
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,940
(I started to hope)

339
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,420
(that the sunlight can turn warmer)

340
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,220
(and that our days can pass slower.)

341
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,339
Say, why did the main characters

342
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,299
have to play

343
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,900
this game of dare?

344
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,810
It's because they're cowards.

345
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,970
They don't dare
to confess to each other.

346
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,970
But doesn't that mean
they'll hurt each other?

347
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,539
Look at them.

348
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,770
In the end, they didn't get married.

349
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,140
Marriage might not necessarily
be the endpoint of a relationship.

350
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,339
You see, hurting people

351
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,770
might sometimes be
an expression of love too.

352
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,050
But they'll miss out on each other.

353
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,140
If so, they should
just leave it to time.

354
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,080
It's just like the message
behind the movie.

355
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,810
Time can prove everything.

356
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,169
Of course, time can decipher
the meaning of love too.

357
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,660
I don't think so.

358
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,050
I think

359
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,249
both parties should cherish each other

360
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,729
and hold on to every opportunity

361
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,140
when love is at its peak.

362
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,940
We shouldn't escape or be afraid.

363
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,250
It's because you have no way
of predicting what will happen next.

364
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,860
Isn't that the meaning of life?

365
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,250
You'll never know
what will happen tomorrow.

366
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,009
There'll be many surprises.

367
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,250
For example, you.

368
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,779
How could I have possibly
celebrate New Year's Eve with you

369
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,700
had you not come here from Leshan?

370
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,330
That's why I'm very happy.

371
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,290
New Year in Shanghai is pretty quiet.

372
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,050
There are no firecrackers at all.

373
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,050
Yeah.

374
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,490
It's very quiet.

375
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,100
Are you homesick now?

376
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,620
Not really. I just think

377
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,579
that I would be lonely

378
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,859
if I had to celebrate New Year

379
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,299
by myself here.

380
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,490
There's no ifs.

381
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,490
We were destined to meet each other.

382
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,729
Do you believe in destiny that much?

383
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,970
I do.

384
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,420
Even so, you can't just
believe in destiny for everything.

385
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,899
You at least need to have a goal.

386
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,520
After that, you need
to work hard to achieve it.

387
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,480
We need to do our best,
and leave it to God for the rest.

388
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,929
I'm talking about love.

389
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,730
You're talking about work.

390
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,059
One year passed by
in the blink of an eye.

391
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,810
I have to plan out my future somehow.

392
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,539
You're already very hardworking.

393
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,570
If you keep this up,

394
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,380
you'll suffer a breakdown.

395
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,050
Let's not talk about work, okay?

396
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,010
Staying in the same spot
is the same as deteriorating.

397
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,779
Who said so?

398
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,460
Me.

399
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,220
The Marketing Department
doesn't have a HOD yet.

400
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,200
I wish to give it a try.

401
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,649
You'll definitely be fine
with the job scope.

402
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,900
However, your qualifications
are a bit lacking.

403
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,660
You just need to
let things happen naturally

404
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,139
and wait for your opportunity.

405
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,900
Work isn't the only thing
that matters in life.

406
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,860
You have to enjoy your life too.
Just like me.

407
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,530
I enjoy the days I spend with you.

408
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,180
That's right.

409
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,379
If so, I wonder who's the person

410
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,339
who said the headhunters

411
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,530
would flood his phone with calls
after he resigned?

412
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,729
How many days has it been?

413
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,299
- Are you despising me now?
- That's not true.

414
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,619
- No, you're despising me.
- That's not it.

415
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,489
I can feel it.

416
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,420
A man like me was despised
by you right after losing my job.

417
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,379
I'm so pitiful.

418
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,770
You're a little pitiful.

419
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,490
If so, I have to work harder.

420
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,099
If not, I can't afford to support you.

421
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,859
And, I'll feel guilty if you just
let your career go downhill from this.

422
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,440
Alright now.
You don't need to feel guilty.

423
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,810
Charles already gave me
plenty of chances.

424
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,100
It's just that they didn't
meet my expectations.

425
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,100
We'll have plenty of opportunities
in the new year ahead.

426
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,570
Come. It's New Year's Eve.

427
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,570
May we have a lucky year.

428
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,730
That'll definitely come true.

Thank you.
Remember to prepare a red packet for me.

450
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,299
And, it must be a huge one.

451
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,530
Of course.

452
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,010
Have you booked the hotel
in Maldives, then?

453
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,539
Don't bring it up.

454
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,729
This Tim is putting me
in charge of everything.

455
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,010
I'm so tired.

456
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,860
Isn't it good for your husband
to listen to you in everything?

457
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,420
That's great.

458
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,579
If I must say,

459
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,899
we two do have an affinity
with each other.

460
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,409
Look. Our secret relationships
were discovered.

461
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,249
And, both turned out pretty well.

462
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,970
That's why you have to hurry too.

463
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,169
Guo, I have something to ask you.

464
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,619
Will you be terrified if Mr. Xue

465
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,860
doesn't want to marry you?

466
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,810
What's with the question?

467
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,379
Actually,

468
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,539
me and my colleagues
have discussed this before.

469
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,929
We think that Mr. Xue

470
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,620
should be a non-marriage advocate.

471
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,449
Think about it. He's an outstanding man.

472
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,449
Even so, he's unmarried at this age.

473
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,899
I can't think of a valid reason

474
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,220
except for the fact
that he fears marriage.

475
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,530
Just look at them.

476
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,660
In the end, they didn't
marry each other.

477
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,140
Marriage might not necessarily
be the endpoint of a relationship.

478
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,209
Actually,

479
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,729
sometimes, you need to force men to act.

480
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,010
Look at me. I succeeded, right?

481
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,159
Yeah, yeah. You're the smartest.

482
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,520
(Tim)

483
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,140
Hello? I'm outside.

484
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,050
I'm with Xia Guo.

485
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,579
What's there to worry about

486
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,220
when I'm with Guo?

487
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,649
Fine. I'll go back.

488
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,050
I'll go back right now, okay?

489
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,409
Guo, sorry about this. I have to go.

490
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,620
Go now.

491
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,220
Goodbye.

492
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,970
- Goodbye. Go now.
- Goodbye.

493
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,290
Let's keep in touch.

494
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,860
Goodbye.

495
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,620
What's wrong?
Did her words reach your heart?

496
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,640
Are you trying to use this
as a springboard again?

497
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,810
You see,

498
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,420
that bosom friend of yours
does have a point.

499
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,290
However, you don't need
to heed her words.

500
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,050
What kind of logic is that?

501
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,180
Your bosom friend's husband
is a good-for-nothing, right?

502
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,420
He's even putting your bosom friend
in charge of their wedding.

503
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,619
Even when she's out for a drink,

504
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
he called her back in a hurry.

505
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,620
He's irresponsible
yet has a strong sense of control.

506
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,570
In my opinion,
their marriage won't last long.

507
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,649
They'll get married soon, you know?

508
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,929
Don't jinx them.

509
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,250
I'm not jinxing them.

510
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,169
I just want to tell you

511
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,920
that you shouldn't heed
your bosom friend's advice

512
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,280
and force that bossy CEO
to make a stand.

513
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,729
Your bosom friend truly
wanted to help you out and support you.

514
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,249
However, she had no confidence

515
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,460
in her own marriage as well.

516
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,379
And, I realize women like you all

517
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,420
always have an inexplicable fear of men.

518
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,570
You guys also pay great attention
to your marriages.

519
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,660
If I must say,
when you're strong enough,

520
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,810
it doesn't matter if he fears marriage
or advocates non-marriage.

521
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,969
You're a kid, you know?

522
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,010
Where did you learn
all this nonsense from?

523
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,660
You're making me confused here.

524
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,220
You're confused, huh?

525
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,660
If so, I'll help you to sober up
with a drink.

526
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,379
Wait, you should stop hesitating.

527
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Your conditions are literally impossible
to fulfill in a place like Shanghai.

528
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,460
Besides, the market
isn't doing well now.

529
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,689
It's hard for me to find

530
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,010
a great position like this
with a high salary.

531
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,680
And, it's one of
the top 500 companies in the world.

532
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,860
It's already good enough.

533
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,220
But the workplace is based in Singapore.

534
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,220
What's wrong with Singapore?

535
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,729
Isn't it good for you

536
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,579
to gather some experience overseas
at this stage?

537
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,920
You have leadership experience in
prominent domestic private enterprises

538
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,199
and is coupled with a background
in international corporate environments.

539
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:52,899
Brandon.

540
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,009
I think you shouldn't miss out

541
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,490
on this opportunity.

542
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,330
My girlfriend is in Shanghai.

543
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,460
I need to consider her feelings.

544
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,250
Wait, Xue Yuming.

545
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,489
Since when were you

546
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,250
tied to your relationship?

547
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,579
Are you worried that a long-distance
relationship between you and her

548
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,810
might make her upset?

549
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,700
It's more than just a long distance.
We're in different countries.

550
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,010
So what?

551
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,489
Are you sure you can maintain

552
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,139
this relationship

553
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,970
without a good job or wage?

554
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,929
How many women do you think

555
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,730
are able to truly share
wealth and woe with their men now?

556
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,050
If you say that out loud,

557
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,010
women will bash your head in.

558
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,180
I'm being realistic here.

559
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,940
It's already spring.

560
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,579
The number of staff for this position is
recruited from the Asia-Pacific region.

561
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,009
If you don't fight for it,

562
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,730
someone else might take it.

563
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,620
Once you miss out on it,
you might have to wait one year for it.

564
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,290
Do you truly wish to keep waiting?

565
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,169
What is this?

566
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,570
It's Lucy's wedding invitation.

567
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,620
She asked us when
we would book our flight tickets.

568
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,620
Oh, her wedding
will be held in Maldives.

569
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,900
Maldives, huh?

570
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,460
I was just going to tell you
that I might not be able to make it.

571
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,480
- You might not be able to make it?
- It's because I need to go to Singapore.

572
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,810
But why?

573
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,420
There's a summit over there.

574
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,379
They wish to invite
veterans of the industry

575
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,649
to be their guest speakers.

576
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,539
Charles knew that I was free lately.

577
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,970
He registered it for me.

578
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,290
I'll be paid for it.

579
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,810
I'm sorry. I can't
attend the wedding with you.

580
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,960
If you're not attending it,
I won't attend it either.

581
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,700
Come. Follow me.

582
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,490
Don't be angry, okay?

583
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,819
Let's give it a try first, okay?

584
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,100
Try it on.

585
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,330
You look gorgeous.

586
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,940
You do look gorgeous in it.

587
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,100
What should we do?

588
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,460
You're attending your friend's wedding,

589
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,100
but you'll steal the limelight from her.

590
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,420
Stop it.

591
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,160
Don't think that I won't be angry at you
just because you bought this for me.

592
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,970
You look gorgeous
even when you're angry.

593
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,420
Let's go and buy a wedding present
for your friend later, okay?

594
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,330
Thank you.

595
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,330
It's my pleasure to serve you.

596
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,899
Ms. Ping, you crossed the line.

597
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
You didn't tell me that you were coming.

598
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,490
I wanted to give you a surprise.

599
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,860
It's my fault. I rarely contact you.

600
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,120
Both of us are busy.
I can understand your feelings.

601
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,770
HQ is different indeed.

602
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,530
It's fast-paced,
and the pressure is tremendous.

603
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,059
I only finished an afternoon's lesson,

604
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,530
yet I'm all giddy.

605
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,660
Here, Ms. Ping.

606
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,009
May you become
the manager of our branch soon.

607
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,180
Hopefully that'll come true.

608
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,180
Didn't your husband say anything
about your trip here?

609
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,700
My family was in a messy state

610
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,660
for the past six months.

611
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,700
When you came back,

612
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,490
my husband's company went bankrupt.

613
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,330
He did nothing at home for two months.

614
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,860
My children are either busy with school
or busy crying their hearts out.

615
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,970
He finally understood
how tough it was for me back then.

616
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,810
Yeah. You complained about him
every day back then.

617
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,209
During crucial moments, your husband
is the most thoughtful person around.

618
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,530
You call that thoughtful?

619
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,730
It's just a change of role.
Now, he has empathy for me.

620
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,730
But to be honest,

621
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,730
I've readjusted

622
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,380
my state.

623
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,619
My husband found a new job.
He didn't need to go on business trips.

624
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,619
He could share
the family chores with me.

625
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,620
Now, I can be a workaholic again.

626
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,940
That's great.

627
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,169
If I must say, men and women

628
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,380
should share their burdens
with each other.

629
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,009
When technology advances further,

630
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,579
men might be able
to give birth to children too.

631
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,200
Society will be harmonious by then.

632
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,299
It's nice when
you think about it, right?

633
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,530
I was just joking.

634
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,810
Ms. Ping,

635
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,010
I'm truly happy for you.

636
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,140
Now that you're doing great in Shanghai,

637
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,570
I'm happy for you too.

638
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,940
Who said I'm doing great?

639
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,209
I'm sure you'll do a better job than me

640
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,940
if you came to Shanghai instead of me.

641
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,180
Shanghai's environment
is very stressful.

642
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,410
I don't think I can persevere.

643
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,699
Don't you think you have
to tell me something?

644
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,730
What is it?

645
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,049
Your legendary tales with Mr. Xue

646
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,450
were spread to Leshan long ago.

647
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,020
How is it?
When will you guys hold the wedding?

648
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,810
It's too early to say.

649
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,220
Yu Jian is going to have a child soon.
You should work harder.

650
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,450
You can do it.

651
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,100
I can do it.

652
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,140
I can do it.

653
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,980
Hello. What can I do for you?

654
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,179
We want to buy
a wedding present for our friend.

655
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,770
Okay. Over here, please.

656
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,980
This is our latest series.

657
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,770
What about this necklace?

658
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,899
It looks good.
You know her better than me.

659
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,739
May I take a look?

660
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,980
Of course.

661
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,049
It's pretty good.

662
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,890
It's white.
She has a fair complexion too.

663
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,890
I think this will do.

664
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,339
Really? We'll take it, then.

665
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,009
Okay. The latest series is over there.

666
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,259
Do you wish to take a look?

667
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,409
- I'll go and take a look.
- Okay.

668
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,410
Over here, please.

669
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,540
Over here is the Tiffany Classic Series.

670
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,449
These are our classic

671
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,450
Tiffany Wedding Ring Series.

672
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,890
So, this is the ring area?

673
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,219
Yeah. Miss, do you wish
to check out our diamond rings?

674
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,179
We've recently acquired
a batch of diamonds

675
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,770
with exceptional color and clarity.

676
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,370
The designs are classic too.

677
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,259
These are the best presents
for weddings and engagements.

678
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,730
I can show them to you guys.

679
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,290
It's fine. We're here to buy
a present for our friend.

680
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,620
Okay, mister.

681
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,290
Get me the bill.

682
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,770
This light is portable.

683
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,620
You can move it anywhere. Look.

684
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,450
The thing is, there's an app for it.

685
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,540
Once you connect it to your phone,

686
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,129
you can turn it on

687
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,379
even when you're not home yet.

688
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,060
Let me demonstrate.
I'll turn it on first.

689
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,290
Like this.

690
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,930
Now, I'll use the phone.

691
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,020
Let's get married.

692
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,100
Give me a second.

693
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,890
Oh no.

694
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,060
The bulb is fused.

695
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,810
They didn't even prepare a spare bulb.

696
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,850
I'll go and buy a new one.

697
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,330
Sorry. What did you say just now?

698
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,850
It's nothing.

699
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,360
(Li Qiuman is
inviting you to a voice call)

700
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,969
Hello, Migao?

701
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,330
Hi, Dad. Where are you?

702
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,410
I'm at Ms. Xia Guo's house.

703
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,180
Is Paris cold?

704
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,620
Yeah. Mom got me
some thicker clothing.

705
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,129
Is today your first day of school?

706
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,819
(I'm not trying to scare you here.
Mr. Xue has a child.)

707
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,179
(What if, I'm saying what if,)

708
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,659
he needs a lover

709
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,699
instead of a wife?

710
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,330
What will you do by then?

711
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,930
But I might be working.

712
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,409
You can come back.

713
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,250
I'll go and pick you up
when you're back, okay?

714
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,700
You're back.

715
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,220
Is Chen asleep?

716
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,500
What did you have for dinner?

717
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,850
I had dinner with my colleagues.

718
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,540
How was your interview today?

719
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,859
I didn't go. My mother was too busy.

720
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,609
[Take care of child,
send child to and pick up from school]

721
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,040
You're looking for a nanny already?

722
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,620
We have to hire one eventually.

723
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,580
That's why I'm checking it in advance.

724
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,129
Didn't we agree that we would hire a nanny
based on your expected salary

725
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,100
after you found a job?

726
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,299
A good nanny is hard to find.

727
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,940
If you don't search for them in advance,
you won't be able to hire one by then.

728
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,410
I heard that nannies are very costly.

729
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,859
Maybe your monthly salary

730
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,850
isn't as high as theirs.

731
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,620
What do you mean by that?

732
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,540
Are you telling me to stay at home
instead of working?

733
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,089
You see, it's tiring to work nowadays.

734
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,179
You have to stay outside. And...

735
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,290
So?

736
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,250
I've been home for too long.

737
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,009
I'll be detached from society

738
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,930
if I don't go out and work now.

739
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,770
Take your time, okay?

740
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,180
When I'm free, I'll do the interview
together with you.

741
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,620
I'll go and take a bath first.

742
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,250
Tang,

743
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,660
what's with the low dividend
this time around?

744
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,220
Yu Jian,

745
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,890
the company hasn't
been doing well lately.

746
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,330
I'm sure you know that too.

747
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,410
And, you were tending to your family

748
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,330
more often in the past year.

749
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,500
The company shared your burden with you.

750
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,580
I can't just let them work for nothing,

751
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,850
don't you agree?

752
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,330
What about this?

753
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,410
You should assign
all the required jobs to me next time.

754
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,140
I'll complete them no matter what.

755
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,730
I need to make a living here.

756
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,770
I understand.

757
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,620
You need a lot of money since
you just had a child.

758
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,529
Your wife isn't working

759
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,140
and you're the sole breadwinner now.

760
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,140
But you need time to take care
of your wife and child.

761
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,449
I don't want to tie you up

762
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,980
with our projects every day.

763
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,850
My child is growing. It'll be fine.

764
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,250
You don't need to work so hard.

765
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,730
This studio is yours, too.

766
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,290
We have plenty of time.

767
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,700
I'll make sure you receive

768
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,219
every single cent of the dividend once
you resume the normal work schedule.

769
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,009
But now, you need to help Guo
take care of your son.

770
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,410
That's your priority.

771
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,700
You can complete your projects
at home too, you know?

772
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,609
Are you short on cash?

773
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,060
If so, you must tell me.

774
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,850
Don't worry.
I'll seek your help if it's necessary.

775
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,140
Alright.

776
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,140
Mr. Han.

777
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,089
That's right.

778
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,330
What do you think about
the proposal I sent to you?

779
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,250
What do you mean?

780
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,100
Understood. That can be amended.

781
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,020
Yu Jian, long time no see.

782
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,020
I'll hold a housewarming party
for my new shop tomorrow.

783
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,180
You must attend it, okay?

784
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,410
Dear, have you turned into
a full-time housewife?

785
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,730
Hello.

786
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,049
Who are you?

787
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,290
I'm Nanny Qian.

788
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,620
Nanny?

789
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,730
Nanny.

790
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,020
- Coming.
- I think Chen peed himself.

791
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,020
Be careful.

792
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,879
Be careful. Support his head.

793
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,519
Okay.

794
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,000
Chen, let's change your diaper.

795
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,540
Guo.

796
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,250
Why did you hire a nanny this soon?

797
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,730
I have a lot of job interviews lately.
I went out often too.

798
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,890
You can't just apply for leave
every day, right?

799
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,370
Chen is still very young.

800
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,370
Can you rest at ease
if you entrust him to a stranger?

801
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,540
Besides, since he's our child,

802
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,089
we have to be responsible for him.

803
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,730
How am I being irresponsible?

804
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,739
Do you think I'm being responsible
by taking care of him

805
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,760
as a free nanny every day?

806
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,449
There you go again.

807
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,609
Who said you were a free nanny?

808
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,580
Just tell me directly
if you don't want me to go and work.

809
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,739
Stop beating around the bush.

810
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,370
Who said I was beating around the bush?

811
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,540
I'm doing this for
you and Chen's sake, you know?

812
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,180
Fine. Since you already hired a nanny,

813
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,980
I'll go to work now.

814
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,330
It's pretty lively in there.

815
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,330
Tang, I'll stay here for an hour, okay?

816
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,859
There are potential clients in there.

817
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,890
Wen Ya held this party
on purpose, you know?

818
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,180
We should stay here longer
when we have the chance.

819
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,560
- I need to look after my son.
- I know that.

820
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,730
Seniors.

821
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,609
Go inside.

822
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,049
Here, this is for you.

823
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,569
- Thank you.
- It's a present for you.

824
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,409
Go inside.
We're enjoying some games now.

825
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:41,859
Come on.

826
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,679
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

827
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,660
- Let's go inside.
- Come on.

828
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,770
I'll only stay here for a while.

829
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,659
Yeah, I know that.

830
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,730
Hurry up.

831
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,250
Let me introduce them to you.

832
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,730
These two
are the heroes behind my shop.

833
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,370
Tang Yiming and Yu Jian,
they're designers, quite famous.

834
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,009
Welcome.

835
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:02,899
She flatters us too much.

836
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,739
It was an group effort.

837
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,489
They are my seniors
from the same course.

838
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,379
You guys may look for them

839
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,899
if you require help
in designing or renovations.

840
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,640
You'll get the best service
with the most affordable price.

841
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,129
Yu Jian is my junior

843
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,410
and my studio partner.

844
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,100
He received a huge award
on the year he graduated.

845
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,969
He's amazing.

846
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,660
This is my name card.

847
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,580
Our company can handle
indoor decoration, outdoor design,

848
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,930
landscaping, even old house renovation.

849
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,219
Please take care of us.

850
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:29,969
Thank you.

851
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,280
- Thank you.
- Alright.

852
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,480
Please take care of us.

853
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,730
Yes. They're young and talented.

854
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,700
Let's resume the game.

855
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,489
- Okay.
- Alright.

856
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,779
The name of this game is "I Have Never."

857
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,850
Each of us will raise five fingers.

858
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,859
After that, we'll talk about the things
we never did before.

859
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,009
Those who did it before
will subtract one finger.

860
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,899
The person with
all five fingers subtracted

861
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,009
has to drink.

862
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,409
I know that game.

863
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,739
- I played it before.
- Come on, then.

864
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,609
Raise your hand.

865
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,890
I'll start first.

866
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,930
I have never gotten married before.

867
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,700
Me too.

868
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,980
We have no chance now.

869
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,699
Yu Jian,

870
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,330
since you're married,
you need to subtract one finger.

871
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,450
Like this?

872
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,259
He's married at such a young age?
What a shame.

873
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,140
It's fine. I'm still here.

874
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,850
Okay. Don't move now.

875
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,540
Give me a kick.

876
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,660
Okay.

877
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,339
It stinks.

878
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,500
I'm sure you feel better now.

879
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,250
I'll be done soon.

880
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,330
I'll drink on his behalf.

881
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,969
Wait.

882
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,220
I was the one who raised the issue.

883
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,540
Yu Jian, what are you doing here?

884
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,980
I drank too much.
I'm here to take a breather.

885
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,410
You can't hold your liquor well, right?
Why did you drink so much?

886
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,250
Everyone was in a happy mood.
I didn't want to spoil their mood.

887
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,370
It's been so long since we met as well.

888
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,810
How have you been?
Is your family doing okay?

889
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,660
They're doing fine.

890
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,529
I heard you've taken some
impressive design projects again.

891
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,580
They were even on the cover
of Home Living Magazine.

892
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,540
I knew I was right about you.

893
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,660
Since I took their money,

894
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,400
I have to provide them
with the best service.

895
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,060
You're a sincere person indeed.

896
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,540
Not beating around the bush at all.

897
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,930
Very nice indeed.

898
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,569
You're amazing yourself.

899
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,739
You already own two shops at this age.

900
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,220
You have a successful career.

901
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,899
It's because I found myself.

902
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,540
I'm trying to realize
the life I dream about.

903
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,810
Wen Ya, I want to know something.

904
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,930
What does it mean for a woman

905
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,850
to find herself and realize her dream?

906
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,660
Does it mean that you have to work?

907
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,410
I understand now.

908
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,290
Is Guo trying to work?

909
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,220
How do I put it?

910
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,730
Initially, I thought

911
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,620
that working for other people is tough

912
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,020
and that men should handle that.

913
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,620
Women can tend to their affairs at home.

914
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,100
It's important for her
to raise her child too.

915
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,540
You reap what you sow.

916
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:04,060
And, she can watch over
her children as they grow up.

917
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,220
Isn't it great?

918
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,100
In the end? She doesn't want that.

919
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:11,250
She insists in joining society
to suffer with the rest of us.

920
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,700
I didn't want her to suffer.

921
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,370
Do you know what she said? She said
I'm playing make-believe with her.

922
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,330
Let me ask you this, then.

923
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,819
How long has it been since

924
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,930
someone addressed Guo by her name?

925
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,060
I mean her full name.

926
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,700
I...

927
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,140
I never addressed her
by her full name before.

928
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,020
I guess I had when we argued.

929
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,929
If so, let me explain

930
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,330
what it means to be oneself.

931
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,850
It's when people address her,

932
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,819
she's not the daughter of someone,
someone's wife,

933
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,890
or someone's mother.

934
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,500
She's not an accessory.

935
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,060
It's herself.

936
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,770
With a complete name.

937
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,980
That's what we mean by being oneself.

938
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,659
People often address you

939
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,060
by your name directly at workplaces.

940
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,409
Therefore, getting a job
is the quickest way

941
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,450
to find oneself.

942
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,250
Wait.

943
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,180
Is it that important for people
to address you by your name?

944
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,290
Let me put it this way.

945
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,370
It's just like how
you chose your major back then.

946
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,770
Wasn't it because
you were passionate about

947
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,100
coming up with the greatest designs?

948
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,489
And, your designs

949
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,500
are connected to your name, right?

950
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,660
Isn't it like realizing one's dream?

951
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,179
That's right.

952
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,500
Just like how opening
a florist is my dream.

953
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,969
I'm very happy with it.

954
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,770
It doesn't feel tiring to me at all.

955
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,299
I'll be even happier

956
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,850
if I can make money with it.

957
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,370
I guess that's what Guo is thinking.

958
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,620
If that's the case,

959
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,180
that means it was my negligence.

960
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,060
Guo has her own dreams too.

961
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,180
Yu Jian, in my heart,

962
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,250
you're 100% a good husband.

963
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,339
(I've been home for too long.)

964
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,659
I'll be detached from society

965
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,500
if I don't go out and work now.

966
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,620
Just tell me directly
if you don't want me to go and work.

967
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,180
Stop beating around the bush.

968
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,859
That's not true.

969
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,770
I always make her angry.

970
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,290
Wen Ya, thank you.

971
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,730
I think

972
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,620
I sorted my issues out
after chatting with you.

973
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,299
You can come to me

974
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,580
if you need any help in the future.

975
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,219
Even if I can't help you out,

976
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,770
you can still confide in me.
