(Jiangsu Road)

5
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,670
Jiangsu Road, Yuyuan Road.

6
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,700
(Yuyuan Road)

7
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,350
Jiangsu Road, Yuyuan Road.

8
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,670
It feels like old Shanghai.

9
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,950
Old Shanghai, huh?

10
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,230
Mr. Xue, here's your document.

11
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:55,100
I hope it's not the wrong one.

12
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,350
Nope. Thanks.

13
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,460
It's my duty.

14
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,657
Do you need anything else?

15
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,190
I saw your girlfriend

16
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,430
downstairs just now.

17
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,860
She was looking for you.
She looked like she was in a hurry.

18
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,630
Who?

19
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,380
Emma.

20
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,350
Who said I had a girlfriend?

21
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,980
Weren't you guys...

22
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,980
I thought...

23
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,220
It's okay. I'll resume my work.

24
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:27,771
Please call me if you need anything.

25
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,070
Emma?

26
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,630
What are you doing?

27
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,571
Are you dating someone online?

28
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,630
You scared me.

29
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,820
This isn't it.

30
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,470
This is an underground relationship.

31
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,380
Underground relationship?

32
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,630
That's irresponsible, you know?

33
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,910
Why is your shirt dirty?

34
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,780
Let's go. I'll clean it up for you.

35
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
Hurry.

36
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,660
(Pork Hock)

37
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,630
Another 8,000.

38
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,070
Isn't this Tim?

39
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,350
Be quiet!

40
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,030
You mustn't tell anyone about this!

41
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,580
I'll let you go now.

42
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
Since when did you two get together?

43
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,990
Give me a second.

44
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,070
I'm a little confused.

45
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,070
Did you court him? Or did he court you?

46
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,670
How could I not tell before this?

47
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,670
You...

48
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,820
Did you know his identity before this?

49
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,630
Of course.

50
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,628
Why did you think
I chose him in the first place?

51
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,310
So, you fell for his money?

52
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,240
You can't just say that.

53
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,550
My honey is quite cute too.

54
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,790
Your relationship is fueled by money.

55
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,110
Is it even reliable?

56
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,430
Are you sure all relationships
not fueled by money are reliable, then?

57
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,500
Everyone can tell their partners
that they love them.

58
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,110
But how can you prove your love?

59
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,810
It depends on whether you can
afford a house in the Inner Circle,

60
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,140
if you can go on at least
two overseas trips per year,

61
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,700
or if you can
hold a romantic wedding for me.

62
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,900
Don't you think you're too realistic?

63
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,230
What's wrong with

64
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,140
being realistic?

65
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,260
If not, your life will be filled with
issues related to trivial affairs.

66
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,580
You'll argue every day.

67
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,630
No matter how much you
love each other, it'll disappear.

68
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,390
You'll only hate him
when you look at him.

69
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,110
You'll think that he ruined your future
and hate him for it.

70
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,790
How could you be so pessimistic?

71
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,340
As long as we trust each other,

72
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,500
we can overcome all kinds of obstacles.

73
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,500
Guo,

74
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,750
did you watch too many idol dramas?

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,260
Don't tell me you think you can survive

76
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,140
with pure love by itself.

77
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,380
Anyway, you'll know

78
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,310
that I'm right
after you encounter this issue.

79
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,190
However, you mustn't

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,260
tell anyone about this.

81
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,310
Please keep this a secret.

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,885
Did he tell you to keep it a secret?

83
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,020
He's just trying
to protect himself here.

84
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,110
He's not acting like a man.

85
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,000
And, I'll tell you my honest feelings.
Don't hate me for this.

86
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,580
I think he's not reliable.

87
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,640
Enough, Guo.

88
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,900
I know you're worried about me.

89
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,310
But don't worry.

90
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,070
Only I, Lucy, can bully people

91
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,380
in my relationships.

92
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,140
No one can bully me.

93
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,750
Don't worry.

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,100
Alright, I won't worry about you.

95
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,940
You better don't come crying to me.

96
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,310
I won't.

97
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,900
You better prepare your red packets.

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,630
Everything is under my control.

99
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,990
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,900
Honey,

101
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,110
I was busy just now.

102
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,790
I couldn't reply to you.

103
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,750
See you at the usual place later.

104
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,990
Yam Head, I need to tell you something.

105
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,340
I've been really busy lately.

106
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,020
We might have to cut down

107
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,630
on the number of video calls.

108
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,820
Is that okay with you?

109
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
How long, then?

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,140
Is it once per week?

111
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,940
Or is it once per month?

112
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,460
What? I didn't hear you just now.

113
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,070
Guo,

114
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,430
can you be focused

115
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,110
during our video call?

116
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,180
(Management)

117
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,120
Alright, alright.

118
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,820
Sorry about that.

119
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,460
I've been super busy lately.

120
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,580
I have plenty of exam questions
to go through later.

121
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:16,742
Are you so busy that you can't even
spare ten minutes for our video call?

122
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
What about this?

123
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,820
I'll give you a video call

124
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,630
during mealtime.

125
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,260
Or, I'll give you a video call
when you're sleeping.

126
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,580
You can sleep under my watch.

127
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,700
Fine. Just forget what I said.

128
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,260
By the way,

129
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
do you remember Emma,

130
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,340
the girl we encountered

131
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
in Shanghai?

132
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,790
It's the girl
who's always beside Mr. Xue.

133
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,630
I think

134
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,700
they must be a couple.

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,500
I thought they had
an unusual relationship

136
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,340
when I first met them.

137
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,670
I think

138
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,260
you should keep some distance

139
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
from that Mr. Xue.

140
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,142
You do have a point.

141
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,790
Why was I so nosy today?

142
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,260
Why don't you request
a position transfer?

143
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:00,285
I can't rest at ease
when you work for him.

144
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Why are you kicking up
such a huge fuss over it?

145
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,380
Actually, Mr. Xue isn't that bad.

146
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,790
He helped me out a lot.

147
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,085
After that, he sent me
to this business academy as well.

148
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,790
You shouldn't judge
a book by its cover.

149
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,914
Did he fork out the money?

150
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,790
It's the company's money.

151
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,670
Isn't that the same thing?

152
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,230
How is it the same?

153
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,550
He doesn't own the company.

154
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,480
What I meant was,

155
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,940
attending this business academy
is a great thing for me.

156
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,360
I can learn plenty of things there.

157
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,990
Aren't you happy for me?

158
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,310
Fine, then. You can do your revision.

159
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,270
Rest early.

160
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,270
I'll hang up first.

161
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,460
He hung up already?

162
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:53,620
I'll be leaving now.

163
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,030
May you recover soon.

164
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,580
(Leshan General Hospital)

165
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:57,910
Okay.

166
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,510
Thank you, doctor.

167
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,700
Thank you so much.

168
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,340
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

169
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,860
Rest well.

170
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,580
Yu Jian, let's go.

171
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,860
Goodbye.

172
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,030
I'll be leaving now.

173
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,430
May you recover soon.

174
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,670
Mr. Yu,

175
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,430
you look so happy today.

176
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,150
I am.

177
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,220
I missed my bed.

178
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,790
Mrs. Yu has already

179
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,190
dried your sheets under the sun.

180
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm sure you'll be able to
sleep well at home.

181
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,030
Guo,

182
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,670
it's been tough on you two.

183
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,310
Mr. Yu, it's our duty.

184
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,085
It must've been tough for you too.

185
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,550
You guys are going to get married soon.

186
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,220
When I think about that,

187
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,670
all my sufferings vanish.

188
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,460
Guo, our family isn't rich.

189
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,190
Due to that, you two

190
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,740
have to rent a unit outside.

191
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,940
Dad, what are you saying?

192
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,980
Mr. Yu,

193
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,820
we can come back and visit you.

194
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,510
We'll visit you every day.

195
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,820
You can call us anytime

196
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
when you miss us.

197
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,270
Okay.

198
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,740
I won.

199
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm so lucky today.

200
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,310
Nine Bamboo.

201
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,220
I won.

202
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,220
You won?

203
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,700
Darn it.

204
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,460
In-law.

205
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,620
Let's play Mahjong.

206
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,460
I need to pick my grandson up.

207
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,550
Great timing. You can have my seat.

208
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,030
- Come.
- You're unlucky today.

209
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,240
You should leave early.

210
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,100
Forget it. He's a sore loser.

211
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,190
One Tile.

212
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,820
Wang Yan,

213
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,580
our children will get married soon.

214
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,620
I was rude back then.

215
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,860
I meant well,
but it turned out the opposite.

216
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,940
Let me apologize for that.

217
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,270
Don't take it to heart, okay?

218
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,220
They're going to get married soon?

219
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,220
Congratulations.

220
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,550
Yu Jian and Guo
should've gotten married long ago.

221
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,940
Aren't they childhood friends?

222
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,820
You're apologizing to me?

223
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,910
I guess the sun
rose from the west today.

224
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,820
I was trying to...

225
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,740
Did you come up

226
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,285
with another idea to pick on me again?

227
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,940
Look at what you're saying.

228
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,580
I'm doing this for Guo's sake,

229
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,550
don't you agree?

230
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,310
You're her mother.

231
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:29,890
Are you willing to let her live with us
after she gets married?

232
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,600
You still have your eyes
on my house, huh?

233
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,550
Your son is the one
who wants to marry Guo.

234
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,390
If he wants to depend on a woman,

235
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,030
doesn't that make him a kept man?

236
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,310
We didn't ask Guo for rent

237
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,220
when she lived with us, you know?

238
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,828
No one is as heartless as you.

239
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,620
Besides,

240
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,030
Guo sponged off us

241
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,310
when she didn't have a job.

242
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,860
Did we say anything about that?

243
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,100
How could you say

244
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,390
that my son was a kept man?

245
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:56,910
It's a self-drawn win.

246
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,620
Look at you. You're indeed lucky.

247
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,740
Wealth revolves around you.

248
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,550
Why did you save money
in the first place?

249
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,940
It's for the children, am I right?

250
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,030
I'm different from you.

251
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,550
I earn money for my own sake.

252
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,114
I'm not giving them to my children.

253
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,580
You shouldn't be so selfish.

254
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:12,790
What do you mean by that?

255
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,342
So, you think I'm not selfish
if I give you all my money?

256
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,114
Listen, I'll make things clear with you.

257
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,820
Whether Guo marries into
your family or not is her business.

258
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,542
I won't give her anything.

259
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,910
If you think

260
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,700
you're at a disadvantage
because I'm not giving Guo my assets,

261
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,971
you guys can choose
not to let them marry each other.

262
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,340
Anyway, I already told Guo
to be cautious.

263
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,700
This game is no fun at all.

264
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,580
I quit.

265
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,700
Here, you guys can have them.

266
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm going to the beauty center.

267
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:46,860
Let's play again next time.

268
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,550
Okay.

269
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,980
Do you truly intend to let the kids

270
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,700
live in Wang Yan's house?

271
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,910
What else can I do?

272
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,070
If I must say,

273
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,510
the groom

274
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,700
has to prepare enough money

275
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,670
and a house before they get married.

276
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,030
If you're seeking her help
because of this,

277
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,980
you're just asking for people
to laugh at you.

278
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,700
But speaking of which,

279
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,430
Xiaoqin's family is going through
a difficult period at the moment.

280
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,550
Their kids are going to get married,

281
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:15,680
yet they're arguing
about the assets and dowries.

282
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,670
I think it's pointless.

283
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,390
Precisely.

284
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,270
We spent all of our money
managing our finances.

285
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,150
We can't take them out.

286
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,657
Now, they're going to get married.

287
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:23,860
Since we're a good in-law,

288
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,310
we should discuss it together, right?

289
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,342
We should help each other.

290
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,480
But look at the in-law I got.

291
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,457
She only knows how to
show off in front of people.

292
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,390
What should they rent a unit?
She has a house.

293
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,771
Why must they waste their money?

294
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,460
It's not like you don't know Wang Yan.

295
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,340
She's penniless herself.

296
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,580
When she needs money,

297
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,150
she'll go and find that Zheng...

298
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,700
Zheng Tuqiang.

299
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,070
That's right. And Zheng Tuqiang
is taking charge of her life.

300
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,620
I think she doesn't even

301
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,100
dare to mention this
in front of Zheng Tuqiang.

302
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,390
Besides,

303
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,510
not a single mother

304
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,860
doesn't care for their daughters.

305
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,550
Listen,

306
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,980
if Xia Guo

307
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,100
can make the call
in relation to the house,

308
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,620
Zheng Tuqiang

309
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,220
cannot do anything about it.

310
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,310
You see,

311
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,860
it's quite simple

312
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,100
if you think about it.

313
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,070
Just tell Wang Yan

314
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,270
to remove her name from the title deed.

315
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,580
Everything will be fine by then.

316
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,550
- That's right.
- It's very simple.

317
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,340
Remove her name.

318
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,628
- I think that'll work.
- Yeah.

319
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:16,270
There's a solution for everything.

320
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,380
The three of us can play.

321
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,220
Does she think
we can't play without her?

322
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,580
(Architectural Design Institute)

323
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,620
Mom, how did you come up with that idea?

324
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,700
Tell me, then.

325
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,460
How can you make Guo remove her mother's
name from the title deed?

326
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,150
You can try to persuade her
in every way you can.

327
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,430
Guo will understand us.

328
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,057
This is for your sake and Guo's sake.

329
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,910
What about my dignity, then?

330
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,142
Anyway, I will
never tell her about that.

331
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,270
Guo and I are already
searching for units.

332
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,510
We plan to rent one.

333
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,428
And, I even told her
that it was your intention.

334
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,400
Now, it's too late for me
to take back my words.

335
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,670
I can't afford to disgrace myself.

336
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,910
How is this disgracing yourself?

337
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,460
Come back!

338
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,070
Mom!

339
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,771
Mom, what's wrong with you?

340
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,580
Mom, what's wrong?

341
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,030
I feel giddy.

342
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,610
I think my blood pressure
is acting up again.

343
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,610
Take your medicine.
I'll take you to the hospital.

344
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,550
No.

345
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,314
Mom, why didn't you take medicine
in such a terrible condition?

346
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,371
I have to keep taking medicine
once I start to take them.

347
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,430
I don't want to survive on drugs.

348
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,700
It's pointless to head to the hospital.

349
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,580
My heart is troubled.

350
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,220
A certain individual would rather
let her house be vacant.

351
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,550
She would rather let you two
live on the streets.

352
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,340
My heart is...

353
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,620
Mom, why are you doing this again?

354
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,070
All parents want the best
for their children, you know?

355
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,980
Why am I unlucky enough
to have an in-law like her?

356
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,910
And, my son doesn't understand me.
He even scolded me.

357
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,910
Mom, since when did I scold you?

358
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,150
I dare not scold you.

359
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,620
No one understands me.

360
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,580
No one takes pity on me.

361
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,940
My son only sides with outsiders.

362
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,340
I'm so pitiful.

363
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,580
Don't get agitated, okay?

364
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,460
You don't go to the hospital
or take your medicine.

365
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,430
This won't do.

366
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,910
Yu Jian,

367
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,580
change the name of the title deed.

368
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,790
I'll be cured by then.

369
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,940
Mom,

370
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,220
let me consider it, okay?

371
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,270
Mom, why don't...

372
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,510
Take your medicine first.
I'm begging you here.

373
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,171
I won't take them unless you promise me.

374
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,510
Fine.

375
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,980
I promise you, okay?

376
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,740
I promise you.

377
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,285
Hello, what's the matter?

378
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,030
Guo.

379
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,310
It's like this.

380
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,285
I have something to discuss with you.

381
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,270
Can you...

382
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,620
What is it? Speak up.

383
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,790
I have an interview later.

384
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,120
It's...

385
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:22,457
My father will go for
his follow-up checkup in two days.

386
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,270
Can you join me in picking him up?

387
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,460
Isn't that obvious?

388
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,740
You didn't need to call me
for something trivial as such.

389
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,228
We could've talked about it later.

390
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:32,350
Alright now, I need to hang up.
I'll go for the interview now.

391
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,270
Goodbye.

392
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,857
Did you see the news headline today?

393
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:39,990
What happened?

394
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,100
A guy forged three title deeds

395
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,740
to cheat women
of their bodies and money.

396
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,550
He succeeded the first two times.

397
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,140
Nowadays, fake certificates

398
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,270
are everywhere.

399
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,650
You have fake title deeds, qualification
certificates, and divorce certificates.

400
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,514
You can just download
a random template online

401
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,270
and change the name of the recipient.

402
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,330
However, you can only
dupe ordinary folks with that.

403
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,180
You'll be caught
if it's a professional organization.

404
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,070
Falsification of documents
is a serious crime.

405
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,070
You're right.

406
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,020
(Xia Guo, Sole Ownership)

407
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,100
This is great.

408
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,710
This is great.

409
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,380
I told you already.

410
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,100
I said Guo was a sensible child,
am I right?

411
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,340
But I didn't expect
Wang Yan to agree to it.

412
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,790
She did surprise me with this.

413
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,140
Why doesn't it look like
a real title deed?

414
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,750
Really?

415
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,085
Doesn't it look like one?

416
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,660
This is real, you know?

417
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,340
I didn't say it was a fake.

418
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,230
But you already got a new title deed.

419
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,980
Can't you bring it back
and show it to me?

420
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,720
Am I right?

421
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,580
Pictures are still pictures.

422
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,140
It's not as good

423
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,380
as the real deal.

424
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,920
Mom,

425
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,900
can you not expect so much from us?

426
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,470
If we don't return the title deed

427
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,760
to Guo after taking it,

428
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,028
she might think that
we have our eyes on her house.

429
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,070
Just a glance!

430
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,550
We'll be a family soon, you know?

431
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,160
Guo isn't as inflexible as you.

432
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,740
(Xia Guo, Sole Ownership)

433
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,620
Fine.

434
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,860
You've completed your mission this time.

435
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,230
I'll make something nice
for you to reward you

436
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,070
and my future daughter-in-law.

437
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,028
What do you want?

438
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,470
Mom, you can reward me all you like,

439
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,580
but you mustn't bring this up
in front of Guo.

440
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,860
But why?

441
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,580
Think about it.

442
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,470
Guo and her mother
already have a terrible relationship.

443
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,100
Although Guo's mother
did give her the nod,

444
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,270
I'm sure she'll feel a little affected.

445
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,510
Because of this, both Guo and I

446
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,720
do feel a little affected too.

447
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,380
And, if you show off in front of Guo,

448
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,270
don't you think it'll...

449
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,420
Got it.

450
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,657
I'll keep a low profile.

451
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,860
Alright.

452
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,030
We'll discuss your marriage
when your father is back.

453
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,180
Mom, are you happy now?

454
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,285
I'll head to my room now.

455
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,740
(Beiyan Nanfei)

456
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,140
In-law.

457
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,750
Eight Bamboo.

458
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,380
I was rude to you some days ago.

459
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Please forgive me.

460
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,180
I have to express my sincerity,

461
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,980
am I right?

462
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,685
I'll treat you to a meal.

463
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,950
There's no better time than now.

464
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,457
Why don't we have lunch tomorrow?

465
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,030
At Hilton Hotel.

466
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,420
Six Character.

467
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,140
(Baiyan Nanfei: Okay.)

468
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,620
You're here. Have a seat.

469
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,100
You don't know
how to make an order. I'll do it.

470
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,340
I do.

471
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,580
It's the same thing.

472
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,420
Have the cod roes from Siberia arrived?

473
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,820
Yes, Madam Wang.

474
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,180
We've reserved them for you.

475
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,470
Thank you.

476
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,257
How many sets would you like?

477
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,790
Do you want it?

478
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,550
Sure.

479
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:29,380
You don't need to
stand on ceremony today.

480
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,428
Order whatever you like.

481
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:31,550
If so, give us four sets.

482
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,470
Okay.

483
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,200
Can you finish
all three sets by yourself?

484
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,380
Yu Jian and Guo will be coming too.

485
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,270
Who said so?

486
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,828
Yu Jian made an appointment with me too.

487
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:43,257
Didn't you two
make the same appointment?

488
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,550
Mom?

489
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,230
What are you doing here?

490
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,550
Both you and your mother

491
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,950
invited me here unintentionally.

492
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,380
Why isn't anyone speaking?

493
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,100
Ms. Wang, it's like this.

494
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,820
I invited you here today to tell you

495
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,990
that Guo and I will get married soon.

496
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,270
I hope we can receive your blessings.

497
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,285
Of course I will give you my blessings.

498
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,180
But let's be realistic here.

499
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,710
The banquet, dowries,

500
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,100
diamond rings,

501
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,710
and a house, have you
prepared all of them?

502
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,620
Mom, you don't need to worry about that.

503
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,820
You should be quiet today.

504
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,180
Marriage is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

505
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,270
The wedding must be formal.

506
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,310
I don't expect you

507
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,230
to provide Guo with a grand wedding.

508
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,600
However, what others have,

509
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,580
Guo must have as well.

510
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,510
Since when have we treated Guo badly?

511
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,340
We treat Guo just like our own daughter.

512
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:08,270
You're her biological mother, you know?

513
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,340
How dare you bring up
all these conditions?

514
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,900
Mom!

515
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,380
Can you speak decently for once?

516
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,180
I assume you're not here
to argue with me today.

517
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,900
Speaking of which,

518
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,750
I want to ask you this.

519
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,180
You have a daughter yourself.

520
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,171
Why didn't she visit her father
in the hospital?

521
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,070
Guo had to visit the hospital
so many times because of you.

522
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,660
You were mistreating her.

523
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:29,990
I did so of my own accord.

524
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,300
Can you stop saying that?

525
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,860
Shut up.

526
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,550
They're mistreating you,
yet you're still speaking up for them.

527
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,180
Unlike you.

528
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:36,914
You only have eyes for money and houses.

529
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,750
Where will you live
after getting married

530
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,340
if you don't have money or a house?

531
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,610
Will you live on the streets?

532
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,070
Guo is sensible indeed.

533
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,371
As the saying goes:
"Like mother, like daughter."

534
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,660
However, Guo, you're entirely different

535
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,100
from your mother.

536
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,140
Isn't it strange?

537
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,510
Stop talking.

538
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,140
You're strange yourself.

539
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,420
Since you guys invited me here,

540
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,790
let's make things clear.

541
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,820
If you can't pass my criteria,

542
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,990
let me remind you of something.

543
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,070
I have Guo's hukou with me.

544
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Wang Yan,

545
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,420
do you know how old you are?

546
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,380
Why are you still acting like a child?

547
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,790
You should tell us
if you regret your decision.

548
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:18,057
You didn't need to
take such a huge detour.

549
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,950
Mom, why are you getting carried away?

550
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,030
Let's go home.

551
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,100
Regret what decision?

552
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,030
The house was yours for a long time.

553
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,950
You feel heartbroken
now that someone else owns it.

554
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,650
I'd act the same
if I were in your shoes.

555
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,857
However, it's not an outsider.
It's your own daughter.

556
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,270
Mom, I'm begging you.
Let's go home.

557
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,380
Let go of me!

558
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,710
Wang Yan, stop pretending.

559
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,180
Guo's name is stated clearly

560
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,310
on the title deed.

561
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,990
That means it belongs to Guo now.

562
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,820
It's too late for you to regret it.

563
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,580
What title deed?

564
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,070
I don't understand you at all.

565
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,790
Yu Jian, what have you done?

566
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,140
Mom,

567
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,030
that picture of the title deed,

568
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,900
it's fake.

569
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,180
What's fake?

570
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,070
The title deed itself is fake.

571
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,100
I downloaded the picture
from the Internet.

572
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,620
I edited the name and address.

573
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,100
What download? What do you mean by edit?

574
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,750
Anyway, it's fake.

575
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:34,340
The title deed still has Guo's name

576
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,580
and Ms. Wang's name on it.

577
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,660
It's untouched.

578
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,710
Guo,

579
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,420
look at their family.

580
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,400
Are you sure you want
to marry into their family?

581
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,820
Guo?

582
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,900
Guo?

583
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,900
Don't leave.

584
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,660
It's your treat today.

585
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,914
You haven't footed the bill yet.

586
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,990
Put Guo as the sole owner of the house

587
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:16,750
and I'll foot the bill for you.

588
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,950
In your dreams.

589
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,310
Guo, listen to me.

590
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,070
Don't touch me!

591
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,750
Guo!

592
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,070
I'm sorry.

593
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,070
Listen to me.

594
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,310
You didn't let me down.

595
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,070
You let your mother down.

596
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,070
Mom wanted to remove Ms. Wang's name

597
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,230
from the title deed

598
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:44,380
so that we could move
into your house officially.

599
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,790
I was worried that she might trouble you
because of it.

600
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,240
That's why I edited
the picture and lied to her.

601
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,180
Will you agree to all of
the unreasonable requests

602
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,314
your mother brings up?

603
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,310
Who said I agreed to it?

604
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,260
I was thinking of
a solution for the issue.

605
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,660
My mother isn't that healthy.

606
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,840
She has high blood pressure.

607
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,590
And, she's not willing
to take her medicine.

608
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,314
What if I cause another issue by irking
her when she's in such a condition?

609
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,330
Were you even trying
to resolve the issue?

610
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,771
You were just compromising with her.

611
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,580
You see, sometimes,

612
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,230
we have to compromise with our family.

613
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,030
What's the point of making a big fuss

614
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,900
and being on edge
for every little thing?

615
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:15,950
And, what's the result?

616
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,270
Tell me.

617
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:20,270
You could've rejected her outright.
Why did you lie to her?

618
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,990
How can I trust you in the future?

619
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,990
Wait.

620
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,100
I lied to my mother.
I wasn't lying to you.

621
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,380
Why are you being so emotional?

622
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,270
You brought me here
so we could see my mother.

623
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,140
Didn't you lie to me?

624
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,140
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

625
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,180
It's a surprise.

626
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,380
She's your mother.

627
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,710
I wish to marry you.
I have to get her permission.

628
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,750
Don't bring that up.

629
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,590
You're too smart for your own good.
You think you can please both sides.

630
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,100
Marriage is a huge deal.

631
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:43,300
Do you think you can manage it
just by lying to people?

632
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,950
That's not it.

633
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,860
Tell me, then. How can I resolve it?

634
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,470
You want me to do the same thing
like what you did with your mother?

635
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,580
Even so, it's better than
trying to coax your mother.

636
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,310
How could you be such a coward?

637
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,030
Your mom didn't want us
to go to Shanghai,

638
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,740
you had no choice.

639
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,030
Your mom didn't want us to live with her

640
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,140
after getting married,
you had no choice.

641
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,510
Now, she has her eyes on my house,

642
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,410
and you're saying
that you have no choice here.

643
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,400
Can you please have some principles
and a sense of responsibility?

644
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,340
Yes.

645
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,080
I do admit that my mother
does the wrong thing sometimes.

646
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,420
But at least her intention

647
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,180
was good, you know? It was for our sake.

648
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,140
How could you

649
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,419
disrespect my mother like that?

650
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,270
Yu Jian,

651
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,750
I'm talking about you now.

652
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,142
I'm not talking about your mother.

653
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,340
What I want is an honest husband
who can stand tall

654
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,030
instead of a cowardly mommy's boy.

655
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,820
Do you understand?

656
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,950
Of course I do!

657
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,750
You're just like your mother!

658
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:26,750
You look down on me!

659
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,340
You look down on our entire family!

660
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,140
Is that what you think of me?

661
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,030
Fine.

662
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,380
If so, don't marry me, then.

663
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,030
Yu Jian is pretty smart.

664
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,380
He actually downloaded a picture
to dupe his mother.

665
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,950
How is that smart?

666
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,914
He said he did it to console his mother
and stop her from causing a mess.

667
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,500
Even so, he can't just lie to her.

668
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,230
That's despicable.

669
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,900
It's an issue with his character.

670
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,030
Don't kick up such a huge fuss.
It's tough enough for people to survive.

671
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,270
For certain things,

672
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,580
telling white lies

673
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,660
might make things easier.

674
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,257
Such white lies
act as lubricant in life.

675
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,230
I would rather he did
what his mother asked him to do

676
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,257
and forced me to make a stand
than lie to her.

677
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,860
Once you tell a lie,

678
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,971
you'll keep telling lies.

679
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
I don't wish to live with

680
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,580
a liar.

681
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,100
If he did follow what his mother
told him to do

682
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,990
and forced you to make a stand,

683
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:44,542
would you find other excuses
to condemn him?

684
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,790
He just wants to be impartial

685
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,049
and not offend either side.

686
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,850
That's the sign
of a person with high EQ.

687
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,230
High EQ?

688
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,140
He has no stand or guts at all.

689
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,900
I remained here

690
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,428
all because I was too soft-hearted.

691
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,860
Wait, Guo.

692
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,140
Judging from that,

693
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:07,310
you're still upset over the fact
that you couldn't go to Shanghai.

694
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,990
If so, I want to speak up for Yu Jian.

695
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,550
Who could've predicted
his father to fall?

696
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,620
Am I right?

697
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:15,950
You were the one
who wanted to remain here in the end.

698
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,140
He didn't force you.

699
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,750
Yes, I deserved it.

700
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,990
I made the choice myself.

701
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,140
Enough already.

702
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,380
Stop talking out of spite.

703
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,550
You criticized him
so harshly this afternoon.

704
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,070
You've damaged his pride utterly.

705
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,860
He would never have tolerated it

706
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,470
had he not loved you.

707
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,380
As if I care.

708
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,620
This concerns my future.

709
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,510
I will never be soft-hearted again.

710
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,950
After hearing that,

711
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,030
you don't intend to get married to him?

712
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,580
How could I?

713
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,710
Enough. Stop talking out of spite.

714
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,657
You're having a breakdown
because of a trivial affair as such?

715
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,950
What will you do about
all the trivial affairs you'll face

716
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:00,340
after getting married, then?

717
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,750
Even if you don't
get married to Yu Jian,

718
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,570
you'll still get married
to another person.

719
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,600
No matter who you get married to,
you'll face the same thing.

720
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,340
Guo, heed my advice.

721
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,580
Although Yu Jian

722
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,510
is a little meek,

723
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,420
he's a nice guy.

724
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,100
You two were childhood friends.

725
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:18,828
And, your relationship lasted until now.

726
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,510
You should give him a chance.

727
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,660
(I know)

728
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,420
(that most of our moments in life
are unsatisfactory.)

729
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,340
(After all the chaos,)

730
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,990
(we still have to move on.)

731
00:31:38,257 --> 00:31:40,580
(Reasons and lectures
are always meant for other people.)

732
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,620
(But when you're alone late at night,)

733
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,100
(you fall back into
a cycle of negative emotions)

734
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,420
(and you cannot escape from it.)

735
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,620
(Yam Head)

736
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,860
Guo.

737
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,750
Look at their family.

738
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,200
Are you sure you want
to marry into their family?

739
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,457
You're just like your mother!

740
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,380
You look down on me!

741
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,057
You look down on our entire family!

742
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,180
(Let's break up)
(I naively thought)

743
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:29,230
(that Yu Jian would be the person
dearest to me in this lifetime.)

744
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,620
(I could tell him anything,)

745
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,950
(and he would do the same.)

746
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,240
(Only now, I realize)

747
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,280
(that the distance between us)

748
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,950
(is very far.)

749
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
(Ms. Ping is right.)

750
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,380
(If I'm having a breakdown because
of something as trivial as this,)

751
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,550
(is there even a future for us?)

752
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,790
Hello, Ms. Xiao.

753
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,860
Hello, Ms. Xiao. I'm Xia Guo.

754
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,550
We already met during

755
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,942
your first live stream.

756
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,100
Is that so? I don't remember.

757
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:16,020
Your coffee is still on its way here.
There's a jam.

758
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,228
I'll go and pick it up.

759
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,580
I know Ms. Chen very well.

760
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,450
But she's not here
to discuss the deal with me.

761
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,750
I'm taken aback.

762
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,860
Ms. Chen has been very busy lately.

763
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,750
I'll report the details of our meeting

764
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,140
to her when I get back.

765
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,710
Actually, it doesn't matter who's here.

766
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,714
You tried to make an appointment
with my PA numerous times.

767
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:40,371
If so, I won't beat around the bush.

768
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:41,914
What does your company offer?

769
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,140
How long are the working hours?

770
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,000
How much will you pay
for the endorsement fee?

771
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,514
Ms. Xiao,
since you're being straightforward,

772
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,860
I'll do the same.

773
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,030
Our company holds this collaboration

774
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,820
in high regard.

775
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,580
For the endorsement fee,

776
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,171
we'll offer you 800,000 yuan
for the first year.

777
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,070
800,000 yuan?

778
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,070
Did I hear wrongly?

779
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,350
Ms. Xiao,

780
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,510
our company is being
very sincere with this offer.

781
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,800
800,000 yuan

782
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,550
is already the highest offer

783
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,740
in the live stream industry.

784
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,300
Sincerity means nothing to me.

785
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
I believe that sincerity

786
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,510
isn't the only thing
that Haowei depends on for it

787
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,180
to grow into such a huge company.

788
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,220
Naturally.

789
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:34,800
Sincerity is the base of our services.

790
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,830
The ultimate goal of our cooperation

791
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,300
is to bring traffic and monetization,

792
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,030
achieving a win-win situation
for both sides.

793
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,470
I suggest you go back
and do your homework.

794
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,510
You can understand whether live-stream
e-commerce creates a win-win situation

795
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,030
or only creates a situation where
the brand dealers gain endless profits.

796
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,828
Her rejection was
within my expectations.

797
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,800
I didn't think that I could
close the deal in one meeting either.

798
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,180
So, what's your next preparation?

799
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,300
My preparation, huh?

800
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,390
Although she rejected me mercilessly,

801
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,620
she told me plenty of things.

802
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,870
She also confided in me.

803
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,470
Live streamers like us

804
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,870
were the ones who sold the products

805
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,085
of brand dealers like you all
within a minute or two.

806
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:15,685
We even helped you guys
to make pre-sale orders.

807
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,390
But you guys think that
live streamers like us have an easy job.

808
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,260
Sometimes, it's quite disappointing.

809
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,510
However, I can't rest at ease

810
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,742
if I don't help out the clients
who requested my help.

811
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,350
I persevered until now

812
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,740
on account of the money I make.

813
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,470
She emphasized to me time and time again

814
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,140
that the offer must be high enough.

815
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,510
That's why I think

816
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,140
we stand a chance.

817
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,700
To me, she doesn't have that kind

818
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,070
of commercial value.

819
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,030
Regarding her commercial value,

820
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,950
the current traffic she brings

821
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,260
is quite commendable.

822
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,030
And, according to what I know,

823
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,660
several other brands
are trying to get a deal with her too.

824
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,430
Do you know

825
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,470
what a brand ambassador
actually represents?

826
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,990
They represent the image and
philosophy of the company.

827
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:02,200
Don't you think
we're being short-sighted

828
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,100
if we're just focusing
on the traffic they bring?

829
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,180
Isn't that the mission
the company has assigned to me?

830
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,100
Mr. Xue. I have to
accomplish my mission.

831
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,950
You're right.

832
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,140
Although I think
offering them a 50-50 split

833
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,390
makes sense in the negotiation,

834
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,140
these influencers are sharp-witted.

835
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:17,685
They would never accept the deal.

836
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:19,571
You've already done a great job.

837
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,700
So, tell me.

838
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,620
What do you plan to do next?

839
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,260
What's your next step?

840
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,350
A raise of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan

841
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,960
will make us look petty.

842
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,580
And, she might
lose her patience with us.

843
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,300
I think we should

844
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,371
offer a 100,000 yuan raise for now.

845
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,260
If she's as sharp-witted
as what you said,

846
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,510
she won't agree to it easily
until the last moment, am I right?

847
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,542
At this moment,
if you allow her to make her offer,

848
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,942
it's likely that you might end up
in a battle of attrition

849
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,140
regarding her wage.

850
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,990
Time is the one thing
we can't afford to waste.

851
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,390
If so, what should...

852
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,740
I think money

853
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,657
might not be the only way
to win her heart.

854
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:08,285
Try changing your perspective.

855
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,990
What is it, then?

856
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:12,470
(Finish the stream after this.)
Our hot water dispenser is sold out.

857
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,140
See you later.

858
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,460
- (Money may not be her only weakness.)
- Goodbye. Love you all.

859
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,510
(For example, you can
target her habits, hobbies,)

860
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,070
(her friends, social circle,
connections, and so on.)

861
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,580
(You can find one's weakness
all around the place.)

862
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,100
(If you focus on that,)

863
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,771
I believe that you'll reap
twice the result with half the effort.

864
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,800
Alright, then.
I'll put it in another way.

865
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,910
Appeal to her preferences.

866
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,070
Ms. Xiao, good job.

867
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,550
I bought you some coffee.

868
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,910
Thank you.

869
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,350
Are you a newcomer?

870
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,940
No, I work for Haowei.

871
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,910
I came here to negotiate
a deal with you before.

872
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,350
I don't have any impression.

873
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,990
But thanks for the coffee.

874
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,580
Don't mention it.

875
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,740
Hello?

876
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,660
It's open today?

877
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,580
But I'm busy right now.

878
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,430
I can't leave now.

879
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:08,990
Is someone from your side free?

880
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,950
Why don't you find someone
to queue up for me?

881
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,430
No one here can do it for me.

882
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,990
They aren't that free.

883
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,070
All of my employees are busy.

884
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,580
Wait.

885
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,140
I found someone.

886
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,780
Wait.

887
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,470
Ms. Guo, you're so nice.

888
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,390
It's nothing.

889
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,870
I was already queuing.

890
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,830
It's no problem.

891
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,700
That's how Ms. Xiao is.
Please don't take it to heart.

892
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,030
It's fine.

893
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,580
Everyone has their own personalities.

894
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,950
Eat up.

895
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,740
By the way, it seems like Ms. Xiao

896
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,300
has a lot of hobbies.

897
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,260
What else does she like?

898
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,070
My goodness!

899
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,910
Is this for real?

900
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:59,700
Is this Michael Jordan's true signature?

901
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Isn't that the signed Jersey No. 45?

902
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,140
That's a rare find.

903
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,430
How did you get it?

904
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm responsible for
coming up with ideas.

905
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,990
You just need to enjoy the surprise.

906
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,910
You're so nice.

907
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,100
Your name is Xia Guo, right?

908
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,580
- Yeah, I'm Xia Guo.
- Thank you.

909
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,910
Don't mention it.

910
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,780
Ms. Xiao, our live stream
will begin soon.

911
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,390
Coming.

912
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,660
Wait here.

913
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,140
We can chat after the live stream.

914
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,260
- Okay. Please go ahead.
- Okay.

915
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,220
Next, I'll talk about

916
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,830
this new cold beverage flask set.

917
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,990
Right now,

918
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,620
we're doing a promotion.

919
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,550
If you buy this flask,

920
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,100
you'll get two cute cups for free.

921
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,620
What are you doing?

922
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,620
I'm coming up with designs.

923
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,700
Why do you sound so tired?

924
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,030
Have you eaten?

925
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,950
I ate my workplace meal.

926
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,350
Mr. Xue told me

927
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,700
to get a deal with an influencer.

928
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,660
It was so exhausting.

929
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:13,070
Is it very troublesome?

930
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,260
It's quite tough.

931
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,030
But I'll do my best.

932
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,510
Guo is
the most resourceful person I know.

933
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,857
I'm sure everything be fine.

934
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,350
By the way, your birthday is nearing.

935
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,685
How do you plan to celebrate it?

936
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,350
I don't have time
to think about that now.

937
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,390
Moreover, you're not by my side.

938
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,950
What about this?

939
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,260
I'll make a wish.

940
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,430
Maybe I can get a deal

941
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,020
with this influencer
as soon as possible.

942
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,771
After that, I'll apply for leave
and celebrate my birthday with you.

943
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,100
Okay.
