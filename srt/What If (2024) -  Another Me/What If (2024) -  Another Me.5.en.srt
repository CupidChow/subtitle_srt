4
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,228
They're already in the middle
of a transit. Where are you?

5
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,180
You should depart quickly.

6
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,320
You can continue with your task anytime.

7
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,390
It's rare for your sister
and brother-in-law to come back.

8
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,540
You should go.

9
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,390
Take care, okay?

10
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,830
No, Guo.

11
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,660
Hurry up. Stop mopping.

12
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,390
Put down the mop.

13
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,200
Mrs. Yu, what's wrong?

14
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,780
Chinese New Year is nearing.

15
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,440
I have a present for you.

16
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,910
I kept this for a long time.
It's bird's nest.

17
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,180
It's top-tier bird's nest.

18
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,160
It's a waste for me to have it.

19
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,600
You should have it as nourishment.

20
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,820
Mrs. Yu, you're too courteous.

21
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,780
I should be the one
buying presents for you.

22
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,620
- Keep it.
- Take it.

23
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,830
You should keep it for yourself.

24
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,171
- You've been keeping it all this while.
- Just take it.

25
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,740
Guo,

26
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,030
it's been years since you celebrated
Chinese New Year with your mother, no?

27
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,600
Mrs. Yu,

28
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,840
I celebrate Chinese New Year

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,180
with you guys every year.

30
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,070
That's right.

31
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,990
But Yan is coming back.

32
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,620
She's suddenly coming back

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,390
after so many years.

34
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,510
I'm elated. That's why I was
reminded of your mother.

35
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,350
Why don't you head back and celebrate
Chinese New Year with her?

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,220
Yeah.

37
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,580
Mrs. Yu, you're right.

38
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,340
If so, I'll head back home and
celebrate the occasion with my mother.

39
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,200
Guo, you're sensible indeed.

40
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,100
I don't mean to chase you away.

41
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,800
You know it too.

42
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,740
Yeah, Mrs. Yu. That's fine.

43
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,910
You see,

44
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,940
my mother texted me about it too.

45
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,830
I'll go back.

46
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,990
Okay.

47
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,000
You must take this with you.

48
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,910
You can have it.

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,260
Send my regards to your mother.
I'll buy some vegetables.

50
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:55,380
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

51
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,700
You should leave early too.

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,520
Okay.

53
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,070
Mrs. Yu, you're back.

54
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,100
Let me do it.

55
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,580
Come.

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,470
Guo.

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,100
The water is boiling.

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,180
Come and help me out.

59
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,780
Coming.

60
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,390
Guo,

61
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,550
when do you plan to leave?

62
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,700
I'll leave after
bidding farewell to Yan.

63
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:22,480
Everyone will be at home later.

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
You should watch the time.

65
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:24,971
Okay.

66
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:26,910
Tomorrow's the first day
of Chinese New Year.

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,142
You can come over tomorrow.

68
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,990
I don't know how long Yan
will stay with us either.

69
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,300
Got it, Mrs. Yu.

70
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,660
Let's have a lively Chinese New Year.

71
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:43,210
Don't tell me he doesn't
want to come back at all.

72
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,260
That can't be.

73
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,542
He already said that he would
come upstairs after smoking a cigarette.

74
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,950
That's what you told me just now.

75
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,350
But did you go upstairs?

76
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,390
Mom!

77
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,180
I missed you!

78
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,300
You're back.

79
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,840
Why have you lost so much weight?

80
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,520
You said you weren't
going to go on a diet.

81
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,480
I didn't.

82
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,140
Guo, Happy New Year.

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
Yan, you're back.

84
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,940
You're finally back.

85
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,520
I'll get you some water.

86
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,100
Zhang, Happy New Year.

87
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,030
Happy New Year.

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,470
Who is she?

89
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,100
Madam, don't you recognize me?

90
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,220
This is Yan. She's back.

91
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,171
Can't you recognize her?

92
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,500
I couldn't.

93
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,520
You've grown prettier.

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,140
Look at how thin she is now.

95
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,700
She didn't eat well
when she was abroad.

96
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,980
Now that she's back. you have to
cook her delicious food.

97
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,880
Of course.

98
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:30,950
Yan,

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,550
come and visit me upstairs later.

100
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,580
Sure.

101
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,580
She'll teach your grandchild
English later.

102
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,510
That's great.

103
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,260
Of course.

104
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,430
I'll head back first, then.

105
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,740
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

106
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,140
Where's An?

107
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,420
You mean Andrew?

108
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,550
He's smoking downstairs.
He'll come up soon.

109
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,740
Ask him to come upstairs.

110
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,780
Just stay out of this.

111
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,780
Here, Yan, have something hot.

112
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,780
Guo,

113
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,171
I brought you guys some presents.

114
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,430
Wasting money again.

115
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,028
Do you think money falls from the sky?

116
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,620
All of these are branded goods.

117
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,070
They're hard to get overseas.

118
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,485
Mrs. Yu, it looks great on you.

119
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,510
Here's a handbag.

120
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,180
It's very expensive.

121
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,100
Is this that expensive?

122
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,470
Mrs. Yu, that handbag looks great.

123
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,390
It suits you well. Yan has great taste.

124
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,430
Guo,
these skincare products are for you.

125
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:26,910
You bought presents for me too?

126
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:27,780
Thank you so much.

127
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,390
We're a family. Don't be so courteous.

128
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,100
Yan,

129
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,350
are all of those just presents?

130
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,870
Where's your baggage?

131
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,830
They're with Andrew.

132
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,220
Yu Jian, did you hear her?

133
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
Help carry their baggage.

134
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,970
You shouldn't let Andrew
carry them alone.

135
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,660
Hurry.

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,430
Go now.

137
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,990
Don't you intend to tell Mom the truth?

138
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,700
What's the matter?

139
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,740
What's the matter?

140
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,910
It's nothing.

141
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,550
It's just that I might have to leave
after staying here for a short while.

142
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,100
I have to accompany Andrew
to Chengdu to meet his clients.

143
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,857
Are you not joining us
for the reunion dinner tonight?

144
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,580
Americans don't celebrate
Chinese New Year.

145
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,030
Besides, he's very busy too.

146
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,350
Stop flattering him.

147
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,971
Mom, did you know something?

148
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,180
Just now, Andrew was

149
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,260
at the hospital's entrance.

150
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,685
Even so, he didn't go and visit Dad.

151
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,870
Isn't that preposterous?

152
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,750
Stop it.

153
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,950
Yu Yan, our parents yearn
for your return every year.

154
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,670
You only come back once every year.

155
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:22,870
Dad is already hospitalized.

156
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,070
It's okay that you can't help.

157
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,540
But you're leaving us alone?

158
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,340
What do you mean?

159
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,620
He has to meet his clients.
What can I do about it?

160
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,300
What has that got to do with you?

161
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,950
Can't you just stay home and
celebrate New Year with parents?

162
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,420
Enough. Stop shouting.

163
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,410
It's rare for your sister
to come back, you know?

164
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,300
Yu Yan, let me ask you this.

165
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,750
Does Andrew have respect
for you as your husband?

166
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,790
Does Andrew have respect
for his parents-in-law?

167
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,460
He's a foreigner. He doesn't
understand these customs.

168
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,540
What foreigner?

169
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,420
Isn't his mother Chinese too?
Stop pretending.

170
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,910
Enough. Stop it.

171
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,030
Jian, don't you think
that was too mean of you?

172
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,942
What has it got to do with you
whether he's a foreigner or a Chinese?

173
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:08,590
What has it got to do with you

174
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,790
whether I come back or not?

175
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:11,440
You have so much free time
on your hands.

176
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,420
Try to keep yourself in check here.

177
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,590
I'm keeping myself in check.
No need to worry about it.

178
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,140
I already kept Mom and Dad in check.

179
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:18,830
Now, I want to keep you in check!

180
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,100
How? Do you expect me to get a divorce?

181
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,910
Don't say that
during Chinese New Year!

182
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,030
Touchwood!

183
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,100
Will you be happy after I get a divorce?

184
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,750
Who'll support me after that?

185
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,750
Will you support me?

186
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,180
You can sustain my living
with that low wage of yours?

187
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,070
What's wrong with my wage?
How is it not enough?

188
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,990
We still managed to pull through
even though days were tough in the past.

189
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,971
I want to ask you this.

190
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,990
Are you happy living
with that pretentious guy?

191
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,830
Isn't it exhausting?

192
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,600
What do you mean by that?

193
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,990
Enough! Stop it!

194
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,100
I'm already married!
Now, you want me to get a divorce?

195
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,140
Why didn't you stop me
before I got married, then?

196
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,790
Did you listen to me
when I stopped you?

197
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,670
You want me to leave

198
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,910
and stay at your whim!

199
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:00,590
And you're saying that I'm unfilial.
You're not an elder brother!

200
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,590
Enough! Can you guys stop arguing?

201
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,670
I'm begging you guys!

202
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,070
Enough. Sit down.

203
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,540
You have to join us
for the reunion dinner.

204
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,420
Mom.

205
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll get the door.

206
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,220
An.

207
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,740
Happy New Year. Come inside.

208
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,180
Come.

209
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,340
Come.

210
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,340
Guo.

211
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,500
- Sit.
- Sit down.

212
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,710
- Sit down.
- It's okay.

213
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,100
- Tea.
- Okay. I'll get some tea.

214
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,420
Sit down. Come inside.

215
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,180
Are you ready?

216
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,180
Can we go now?

217
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,790
Let's go.

218
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,630
What's wrong? Let's go.

219
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:49,830
What's taking you so long?

220
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,220
This is my family.

221
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,460
Would you please respect my family?

222
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,950
I'm here because I respect your family.

223
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,750
What are you talking about? I haven't
been home for ten years already.

224
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,070
It's different in China.

225
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,380
What are they arguing about?

226
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,590
They're discussing
whether they stay here.

227
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,630
You want to leave
without saying hello to my family?

228
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,460
You crossed the line.

229
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,540
How am I crossing the line?

230
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,500
Yan!

231
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,340
Speak nicely.

232
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,870
Mom, be quiet.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,950
I made dumplings for your mother

234
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,600
in the U.S. last year, you know?

235
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,460
Dumplings?

236
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,670
So what if you made dumplings?

237
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,670
So what?

238
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,710
This is my home, you know?

239
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,830
I didn't want to come.

240
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,100
We're arguing because we're here.

241
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,220
You just had to drag me here.

242
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,100
You're arguing with me.

243
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,140
I don't wish to argue with you.
I'm tired of it. Okay?

244
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,109
Are you guys done or not?

245
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,180
Go out if you wish to argue.
Don't argue in my house!

246
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,420
What are you doing?

247
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,540
Are you going to leave?

248
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,030
I'm going to leave.

249
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,260
Take care, okay?

250
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,828
All of these are your favorites.

251
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,370
We gave you some preserved sausages,
preserved meat, and so on.

252
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,500
You can't buy them in the U.S.

253
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,180
Mom, we're not returning
to the U.S. directly.

254
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,057
It'll be troublesome
to bring them with me.

255
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,590
Mom,

256
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,380
let's not be worried for nothing.

257
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,885
Just treat it as if
you don't have a daughter.

258
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,460
Come here.

259
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,500
Yan.

260
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:18,750
You shouldn't add fuel to the flame.

261
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,340
Mrs. Yu, I'll deliver these to her.

262
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,300
Yan, you should take these with you.

263
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,100
It's a token
of her appreciation after all.

264
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,520
She does this every time.

265
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,000
She never cared about
whether it was convenient for us or not.

266
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Sorry about that, Guo.

267
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,140
It was embarrassing.

268
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm fine.

269
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,750
The main thing

270
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,140
is that Mrs. Yu must feel terrible

271
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,885
after witnessing you two
have an argument.

272
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,910
I didn't want to argue with him either.

273
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,630
I'll be honest with you.

274
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,790
Andrew thinks

275
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,030
that our family is poor.

276
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,500
That's why he has no respect for me.

277
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,971
Don't think about him like that.

278
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,490
I'm sure you two got married
because of love in the first place.

279
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,542
That was all in the past.

280
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,820
Issues start to appear as time passes.

281
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm not someone to be trifled with.
I'll put up a resistance too.

282
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,180
Now, my family isn't happy to see me.

283
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm caught in a dilemma.

284
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,790
Don't you know your brother well enough?

285
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,140
His bark is worse than his bite.

286
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,630
He just felt sorry for you.

287
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,070
I'll stop here. I need to go.

288
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,070
You should go back.

289
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,180
Okay. Go now.

290
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:28,285
Remember to tell us
when you arrive in Chengdu.

291
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,950
What are you doing?

292
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,830
(Everyone has to make choices.)

293
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,220
(Some are decisive.)

294
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,420
(Some are hesitant.)

295
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,100
(But some are reckless)

296
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,910
(while some are slow to act.)

297
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,300
(Life is just like the water we drink.)

298
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,870
(Only we know
its temperature inside out.)

299
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,990
I couldn't understand
their argument at all.

300
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,540
It's Chinese New Year.

301
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,030
Other families are
celebrating it happily.

302
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,590
Only our family is in chaos.

303
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,140
Mom, you should stop worrying about her.

304
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,870
She was the one who chose that path.

305
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,030
Your father would've been infuriated

306
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,750
if he was at home.

307
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,500
Guo has been away for so long.

308
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,710
Why isn't she back yet?

309
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,070
Guo is...

310
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,200
She went back to join
her mother for their reunion dinner.

311
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,220
I would've let Guo join us for dinner
had I known this would happen.

312
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,340
Didn't Guo celebrate
New Year with us every year?

313
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,670
That's right.

314
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,260
Mom,

315
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,500
did you chase Guo away?

316
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,420
You see, Yan has to sleep in her room.

317
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,540
It's because Yan came back.

318
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,260
Mom!

319
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,140
How could you be so muddle-headed?

320
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,030
Her relationship
with her mother was terrible.

321
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,870
How could you do this?

322
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,950
Why are you shouting at me?

323
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,590
Guo is the most sensible child
among you guys. You're just like Yan.

324
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,700
Both of you are insensible!

325
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,260
You!

326
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,870
You can't just bully Guo
just because she's sensible.

327
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,990
How am I bullying her?

328
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,100
I gave her bird's nest!
Do you consider that bullying?

329
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,830
You gave that...

330
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,910
I cannot reason with you.

331
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,560
Where are you going?

332
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,942
I'm going to bring her back!

333
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,940
(Luck and Success)

334
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,340
(When we leave the family
we survived on)

335
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,750
(and devote ourselves
to the bustling world,)

336
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,950
(we explore)

337
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
(and grow.)

338
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:22,000
(Yu Jian)
(We encounter obstacles)

339
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,750
(and all kinds of love.)

340
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,542
(Xia Guo)
(Where are you? I'm back for dinner.)

341
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,340
(Wang Yan)
(You said you weren't coming back.)

342
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,100
(Leshan Qiangsheng Hotel)

343
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,400
(Yu Jian)
(Hurry and come back.)

344
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,228
(I apologize to you
on my mother's behalf.)

345
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,220
(Xia Guo)
(I've arrived at my mother's place.)

346
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,630
(You can keep Mrs. Yu company.)

347
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,950
Guo. Didn't you say
you weren't coming back?

348
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,300
Guo, you're here.

349
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,340
Mr. Zheng.

350
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,260
Come here.

351
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,100
Guys, let me introduce her.

352
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,500
This is my daughter, Guo.

353
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,220
She's an executive in a top company.

354
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,260
She's so busy that
she has no time to come.

355
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,040
Today, she's here to join us
for the reunion dinner.

356
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,870
Let's welcome her.

357
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,030
Great!

358
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,790
Happy New Year, everyone.

359
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,180
Let me introduce them to you.

360
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,540
That's Third Grandpa.

361
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,420
That's Second Grandma.

362
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,220
Hello.

363
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
That's First Uncle.

364
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:03,750
There are too many people.

365
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,857
She can't address them all.

366
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:07,100
They'll get closer after drinking.
Here, sit down.

367
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,100
Have a seat.

368
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,830
Here.

369
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,750
Mr. Zheng, I don't take alcohol.

370
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,750
It's New Year.
How could you not drink?

371
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:17,750
I don't take alcohol.

372
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,420
No one knows
how to take alcohol from birth.

373
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,510
You'll get used to it.

374
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,830
- Drink up.
- Here.

375
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:24,910
Enough already.
She doesn't take alcohol.

376
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,500
Don't force her.

377
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,420
Be quiet.

378
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,500
I'll say something today.

379
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,540
Today, I, Zheng Tu, am very happy.

380
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,380
I made some profit in my business.

381
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,830
And, Guo is back too.

382
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,710
She's showing me a lot of respect.

383
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,180
Come. Let's have a toast!

384
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,100
Come!

385
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,750
Okay!

386
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:43,830
I wish you the best
in achieving your dreams

387
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,630
and may you grow rich out of the blue!

388
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,220
Next year,

389
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,500
that means tomorrow.

390
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,460
I'm going to make more money

391
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,710
and buy a huge villa for my wife.

392
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,660
I'll demolish
all the old houses in the village

393
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,460
and turn it into
the Zheng family's clubhouse,

394
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,520
- okay?
- Okay.

395
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,380
Come. Cheers.

396
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,180
Dear.

397
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,870
Stop fiddling with your phone. Come.

398
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,260
Stand up.

399
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,630
You see,

400
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,540
my wife endured
plenty of hardships in the past.

401
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,260
She was lucky to be married to me.

402
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,500
My next goal

403
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,670
is to have
another plump child with my wife.

404
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,990
You must be drunk.

405
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,260
What are you talking about?

406
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:26,790
There are many people here, you know?

407
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,830
This is so embarrassing.

408
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,750
Cut the crap.

409
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,457
All of these are my relatives
who watched over me as I grew up.

410
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,140
Sit down.

411
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,460
You see,

412
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,460
all of them know

413
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,260
my personality well.

414
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Today's Chinese New Year,

415
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,830
and I'm very happy.

416
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,070
It's good as long as you're happy.

417
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,220
Today's Chinese New Year.

418
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,300
I wish you guys happiness!

419
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,750
Come.

420
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,630
Wait.

421
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,590
One cup isn't enough.

422
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,030
Guo, you and your mother
should offer the elders a toast.

423
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,670
She can't take alcohol.

424
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,285
If so, you should drink on her behalf.

425
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,260
You drink two cups.

426
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,710
Stop putting her on the spot.

427
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,030
I'll drink two cups.

428
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
It's fine. I'll take it.

429
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,910
Here. Happy New Year, everyone.

430
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,910
Bottoms up.

431
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,140
Look.

432
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,940
You said she couldn't drink?

433
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,820
I think she's almost on my level.

434
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,380
Here, have some more.

435
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,830
- Enough already. She can't drink.
- It's fine.

436
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,750
You see, Guo is just like her mother.

437
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,300
She's very beautiful.

438
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,380
And, she's outstanding in her field too.

439
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,540
Guo, give everyone a toast.

440
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,100
She can't drink.
Stop putting her on the spot here.

441
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,460
Cut the crap.

442
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,285
You're not the only one
concerned about her?

443
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,340
It's New Year.
Since my child is back,

444
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,260
we should drink until we drop.
Come, Guo.

445
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,670
Offer everyone a toast.

446
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,180
That's right.

447
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,070
Guo, let's have a toast.

448
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,380
Come, I'll join you.

449
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,520
Happy New Year.

450
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,571
- Happy New Year.
- Come.

451
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,830
You shouldn't drink so much.

452
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:58,140
Offer Mr. San a toast.

453
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,500
Okay. Let's offer Mr. San a toast.

454
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,420
Don't take this.

455
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,540
Take this.

456
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,910
How could I finish that?

457
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,500
- You're drunk.
- It's a joyous occasion.

458
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,630
We're happy. Here.

459
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,300
Whose princess is this?

460
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,630
Seems like she's sitting
on the pavement upset.

461
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,950
She reeks of alcohol.

462
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,590
I don't think this is Guo.

463
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,910
Guo, where are you?

464
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Guo,

465
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,950
where are you?

466
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,750
Alright now.

467
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,910
What about this?

468
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,950
You can hit me

469
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,142
and vent your frustration.

470
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,340
Alright now.

471
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,990
Don't be angry at me.

472
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,030
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,750
You suffered because of me.

474
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,630
I have no idea

475
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,500
about the kind of life she's leading!

476
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,380
I can't do anything about it!

477
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,260
They're a family!

478
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,990
I don't know where to go!

479
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,380
I really don't know what to do!

480
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,340
I don't know what to do.

481
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,340
I was late.

482
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,030
It must've been tough on you.

483
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,460
I'll stay by your side in the future.

484
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
I promise you

485
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,420
that this yam head

486
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,540
will watch over you

487
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:14,070
and protect you all the time, okay?

488
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,830
If so, let's head back
for the reunion dinner, okay?

489
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,750
Alright now, stop crying.

490
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,914
That sounded like a squeal.

491
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,990
Here, get on the horse.

492
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,540
Can you help me button my collar?

493
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,460
Yeah, I'll button it for you.

494
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,460
Here, give me a smile.

495
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,260
Come.

496
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,590
Get on the horse.

497
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,260
Let's go home.

498
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,420
Guo, you're back.

499
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,260
Mrs. Yu.

500
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,260
The dishes got cold. I'll heat them.

501
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,180
No need for that, Mrs. Yu.
It's late now.

502
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,990
You should rest.

503
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,260
We still have
to celebrate Chinese New Year, right?

504
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,420
It won't take long.

505
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,870
It'll be done in a second.

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,500
Let's keep up the good work this year.

548
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,750
To get a bigger red packet
at the end of the year! Okay?

549
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,070
Okay!

550
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,100
Thank you, Ms. Nan!

551
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,590
Thank you, Ms. Nan!

552
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,070
Come. Let me introduce her.

553
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,460
This is Xu Li, our new colleague.

554
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,340
Hello, everyone.
I'm Xu Li, Ms. Nan's new PA.

555
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,090
Please take good care
of me in the future.

556
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,750
Welcome!

557
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,180
Xu Li,

558
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,830
tell Xiao Jie's PA

559
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,340
that we'll be late by half an hour.

560
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,660
Then head to the PR Department
and get the new samples.

561
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,910
I'll wait for you at B2.

562
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,710
Okay.

563
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,670
Ms. Nan, weren't I in charge

564
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,342
of coordinating with Xu Jie before this?

565
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,750
Why is Xu Li doing my job now?

566
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,420
In the future, Xu Li will
handle the online section.

567
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,571
You just need to manage
the warehouse and its affairs.

568
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,340
Ms. Nan,

569
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,220
was I not good enough

570
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,460
in certain regards?

571
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,540
That's not it.

572
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,990
It's just a division of labor.

573
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,420
Don't overthink it.

574
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:03,028
Okay. Time to distribute the gifts.

575
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,910
- Come.
- Everyone, come.

576
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,870
Time for gifts.

577
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,630
Here, take it.

578
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:13,990
(Yu Jian)
(Today's your first day of work.)

579
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,780
(I sent Dad
to a rehabilitation hospital.)

580
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,260
(I'll send Yan to the airport later.)

581
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,220
Hello, Lucy?

582
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,340
Are you at the company?

583
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,500
Call Wang for me.

584
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,100
I'm at the warehouse.

585
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,590
I need to confirm something
with him,

586
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,750
but I couldn't reach him.

587
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,885
But we're in the middle
of a department meeting.

588
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:46,020
I'll reply to you later.

589
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,260
Let me ask you something.

590
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,140
What kind of result do you
wish to obtain?

591
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,990
What if she says this:

592
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,590
"Yes. Our department
no longer requires you.

593
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,600
Please hand in
your resignation letter tomorrow."

594
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,710
What will you do by then?

595
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,590
But...

596
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,180
But what?

597
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,760
Listen,

598
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,030
Rebecca, who was fired before this,

599
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,910
her sales performance
was the last of the bunch.

600
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,910
After that, she went to Ms. Nan
and asked her about the obvious.

601
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,950
You mustn't be that silly

602
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,540
and deliver the knife to her

603
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,342
so that she can give you
the killing blow.

604
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,420
But why is Ms. Nan
treating me like this?

605
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:24,857
I don't understand it at all.
Can't I even inquire about it?

606
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,910
Did you take

607
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,100
Mr. Xue's red packet?

608
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,500
How did you know?

609
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,220
That's why I said you were silly.

610
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,990
Although our company is quite big,

611
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,750
each department

612
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,220
is closely connected to one another.

613
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,790
There are no secrets in the company.

614
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,100
Think about it.

615
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
Mr. Xue sought out a doctor for you.

616
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,300
Mr. Xue told you to be his assistant.

617
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,300
And, he even gave you a red packet.

618
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,114
To think that you were silly enough
to accept his red packet too.

619
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,500
My goodness.

620
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,180
I don't know what you're thinking.

621
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:59,171
Didn't you even consider the fact
that you should try to avoid suspicion?

622
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,540
It's Chinese New Year.

623
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,220
I didn't think that much about it.

624
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,100
You'll be the death of me.

625
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,420
Let me tell you another secret.

626
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,670
What secret?

627
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,070
Did you know why

628
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,500
you were the only one punished

629
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,790
for the live stream incident?

630
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,550
Did you know why you had to pay
3,000 yuan instead of getting the sack?

631
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,380
Why?

632
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,371
Do you remember
the surname of our chairman?

633
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,750
Is Tim the chairman's relative?

634
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,950
Is Tim his son?

635
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,485
Is he the young master of the company?

636
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,590
So,

637
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,340
Ms. Nan sent Tim there on purpose, huh?

638
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,870
Even if something does go wrong,

639
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,540
Mr. Xue can't do anything about him.

640
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,420
Bingo.

641
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,540
You see,

642
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,180
Tim actually helped you out.

643
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,030
You know?

644
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,340
Infighting is common in workplaces.

645
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,742
We have to rack our brains
just to deal with that, you know?

646
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,180
If so, does that mean
I have to thank Tim for that?

647
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,670
No way. He's disgusting.

648
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,830
Actually, Tim isn't that detestable.

649
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,970
There's no need for you
to hold a grudge against him.

650
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,870
Must we pick a side?

651
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,850
Isn't it good enough
for us to do our own things?

652
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:10,710
Of course you have to pick a side.

653
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,670
The company can't
accommodate two leaders.

654
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,380
As Ms. Nan's subordinates,

655
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,790
of course we have to
express our stand clearly.

656
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,790
If so, what should I do, then?

657
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,180
What else do you think?

658
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,830
There's always a solution
to every issue.

659
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,540
It's fine.

660
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,100
Let's finish our drink

661
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,220
and relax for a second.

662
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,300
I'll help you think of a way

663
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
to get back
to the meeting room after this.

664
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,030
Cheers.

665
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,070
Cheers.

666
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,980
Ms. Chen.

667
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,460
Xu Li, tell everyone that we have
a meeting in 20 minutes.

668
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,300
Okay.

669
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,910
Guys, get ready.

670
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,990
There's a meeting in 20 minutes.

671
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,140
Okay.

672
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,460
Coco, what's the matter?

673
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,630
Ms. Chen just notified us

674
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,371
that there's a meeting in 20 minutes.

675
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,500
Mister, I need to make an order.

676
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,990
I need three lattes,

677
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,590
one with sugar and two without.

678
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,590
After that, I need three
Taro Bubble Tea

679
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,540
with cheese foam.

680
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,460
Five Milk Green Tea.

681
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,085
No ice for all the drinks.
I'll pick them up immediately. Thanks.

682
00:33:45,628 --> 00:33:47,250
Miss, you're delivering
beverages, right?

683
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,540
You should take the next ride.

684
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,950
I'm not a delivery rider.

685
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm an employee in the company upstairs.

686
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,800
Please make way.

687
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,100
An important client will be here.

688
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,540
You're holding so many beverages.

689
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,290
It'll be troublesome
if you spill them later.

690
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,380
This is an elevator,
not a roller coaster.

691
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,030
They won't spill
if I hold them properly.

692
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,670
I'm in a rush.

693
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,140
This elevator
can accommodate you?

694
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:05,400
Stop causing trouble
and take the next ride.

695
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:06,857
You're wasting our time here.

696
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,540
Xia Guo.

697
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,420
Mr. Xue.

698
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,285
You can take this elevator.

699
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,630
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

700
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,340
Get in.

701
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,700
(VIP Elevator)

702
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,457
Mr. Xue, no need for that.

703
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,500
I think I'll wait for the next elevator.

704
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,750
It's fine. Get in.

705
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,990
It's inconvenient.

706
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,100
Yours is the VIP elevator.

707
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,180
Thank you.

708
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,870
I'll wait for the next elevator.

709
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,790
But thank you anyway.

710
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
Ms. Nan, these are
the two text proposals

711
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,950
we made for Sunny Kid.

712
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,910
One of them is...

713
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,070
Here's yours.

714
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,860
- Thanks.
- Here's your latte.

715
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,630
No sugar.

716
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,380
Your Taro Bubble Tea.

717
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,950
Ms. Nan, I'll make some adjustments.

718
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,540
This is your hot Milk Green Tea.

719
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
- No sugar.
- Xia Guo.

720
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,070
What are you doing?

721
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,220
I'm distributing beverages.

722
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,260
Don't you see that we're in a meeting?

723
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,628
Why are you distributing beverages?

724
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,220
Sorry about that, Ms. Nan.

725
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,514
I wanted to distribute them
before the meeting initially.

726
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,790
Our meeting today is related
to the main businesses.

727
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,742
It's not related to you.
You should leave first.

728
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,380
Ms. Nan,

729
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,340
I'm a member
of the Marketing Department too.

730
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,340
Can I join the meeting too?

731
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,460
If so, you should know

732
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,028
that the first rule of a meeting
is that no one should be late.

733
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,630
You should leave.

734
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,710
Don't waste our time.

735
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,220
Alright. You guys are
done with the discussion, right?

736
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,030
I wish to hear your opinions.

737
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,220
Do you guys have any ideas

738
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,830
regarding the design of Sunny Kid?

739
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,590
What's wrong?

740
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,220
No one is going to talk?

741
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,950
All of you better
pull yourself together!

742
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,100
Xu Li, you can go first.

743
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,200
How is it? Have you completed
the spreadsheet for this quarter?

744
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,830
I've completed the rest.

745
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,857
I'm doing it
for the last-place elimination system.

746
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,210
Last-place elimination system?

747
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,670
You guys performed well this quarter.

748
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,420
Do you dare to say that
in front of Mr. Xue?

749
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,228
You want him to
make an exception this time?

750
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,950
If so, I guess those who are at risk

751
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,030
should be the newcomers.

752
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,228
Isn't there one from
the Marketing Department?

753
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,070
Are you talking about
the girl from Sichuan?

754
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,290
I heard that
she's not doing well lately.

755
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,070
The Marketing Department
is ostracizing her.

756
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,990
Doesn't that make her another Rebecca?

can I be your PA?

769
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:54,540
Why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

770
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,830
I don't want to return to Leshan.

771
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,180
The tissue is on the table.

772
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,590
Since Ms. Nan
brought me here from Leshan,

773
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,990
that proves that I'm capable.

774
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,380
And, you saw

775
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,630
my performance for yourself
in the past few months.

776
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,300
