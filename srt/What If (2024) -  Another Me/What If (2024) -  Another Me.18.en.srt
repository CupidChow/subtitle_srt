(A Farewell Without A Goodbye)

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,730
(Xue Yuming: Xia Guo, are you busy?
Reply to me when you're free.)

5
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,659
(Xue Yuming: Move to my house.)

6
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,359
(I'm still renting it.)

7
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,959
(Xia Guo: Thank you. No need.)

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,959
(Xue Yuming: Have you eaten?)

9
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,999
(Xue Yuming: Are you up?
Xia Guo: Yeah.)

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,039
(Xue Yuming: Are you asleep? Goodnight.)

11
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
(Xue Yuming: Guo, take some time off.)

12
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,679
(You haven't used your annual leave
over the years.)

13
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,000
(Are you okay?)

14
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,779
Alright.

15
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,660
This is the modified proposal.

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,760
See if you have any comments.

17
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,450
- I look forward to working with you.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,260
That's great.

19
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,409
Implement these as soon as possible.

20
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,340
Especially the end of the year.

21
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,820
Ms. Xia, do you want to check that out?

22
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,130
I'm fine.

23
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,499
Everyone must focus.

24
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,019
Don't ever lose focus.

25
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,010
Get motivated. Got it?

26
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,820
Got it.

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,890
Ms. Xia!

28
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,129
The doctor recommends
that you get hospitalized.

29
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,619
Take the doctor's advice.

30
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,459
Your stomach problem, bronchitis,
and high blood pressure

31
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,130
are too serious.

32
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,540
No. I have a lot of work on my hands.

33
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,450
Alright.

34
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,300
Come in.

35
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,940
Mr. Wu.

36
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,180
Ms. Xia, can I help you?

37
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,890
I just finished a meeting this morning.
I want to report some things to you.

38
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,500
What happened to your voice?

39
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,530
I just have a cold and a little cough.
I'm fine.

40
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,179
Well...

41
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,450
Ms. Xia.

42
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,530
You don't have to work so hard.

43
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,859
We know

44
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,130
all about your mom.

45
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,619
You can use this time

46
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,009
to take a long holiday.

47
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,450
Get some rest and refresh yourself.

48
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,820
I'm fine, Mr. Wu.

49
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,420
Thank you for your concern.

50
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,889
But the marketing department
hasn't met your expectations.

51
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,570
How can I rest?

52
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,420
You're too stubborn.

53
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,300
You're not the only one
in the marketing department.

54
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,369
Sorry.

55
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,299
I know

56
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,690
you're trying to become official.

57
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,210
This puts a lot of pressure on yourself.

58
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,940
Of course, this is coupled with
my high expectations for you

59
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,260
and the marketing department.

60
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,180
It's beyond your abilities.

61
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,809
I understand.

62
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,369
You've worked very hard.

63
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,860
I can see that.

64
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,420
So take some time to relax.

65
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,060
Release your tension.

66
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,890
Pay attention to work-life balance.

67
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,180
Okay, I got it, Mr. Wu.

68
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,300
I'll think about your suggestion.

69
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,980
I'll tell you about work

70
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,500
another time.

71
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,820
Take your time. Take your time.

72
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,620
Take good care of yourself.

73
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,210
Okay.

74
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,560
(Chen Nan: We haven't talked
for a long time.)

75
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,010
(Do you have time to meet tonight?)

76
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,380
(No. 18, Bund, Huangpu District.)

77
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,330
What's wrong?

78
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,820
You're so pale.

79
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,530
Are you sick?

80
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,329
I'm fine. I just have a little cold.

81
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,860
I'll be fine after resting for a few days.

82
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,210
Alright. Stop pretending.

83
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,500
Didn't Wu just satirize you?

84
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,530
You found out?

85
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,209
I don't think I can stay
in Haowei any longer.

86
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,130
Don't stay if you can't stay.

87
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,180
I came here today to poach you.

88
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,569
I joined a jewelry company

89
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,500
and want you to come with me.

90
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
This...

91
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,330
This is so sudden.

92
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,500
Can I do it?

93
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,689
There's no doubt

94
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,770
that you can't do it
in your current state.

95
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,690
Xia Guo, do you know

96
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,260
what I like most about you?

97
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,449
It's your relentlessness.

98
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,499
Whoever it is,

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,130
you don't care.

100
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,180
Now great.

101
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,539
When I saw you today,

102
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,650
you became a total coward,

103
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,619
You let reality beat you.

104
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,249
You were defeated by Wu.

105
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,000
You lost your aggressiveness.

106
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,570
Maybe?

107
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,130
I'm just a little scared.

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,940
You were right.

109
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,500
This job is more important
than fairness.

110
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,420
The more you're scared of others
bullying you,

111
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,940
the more they will bully you.

112
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,689
The more you fear losing,
the more you'll lose.

113
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,059
But I think I've worked very hard.

114
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,330
That means
you're not working hard enough.

115
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,650
Actually, everyone wants results.

116
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,419
Only you should know the process.

117
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,580
Do you have to explain to others?

118
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,689
Do you want people to pity you

119
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,930
and comfort you?

120
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,209
Fine.

121
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,220
Come to me when you
can't make a living for yourself.

122
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,380
I'll make sure you can make a living
wherever I can make a living.

123
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,969
If you don't have a place to live,

124
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,059
come to my house.

125
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,530
The couch is yours.

126
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,299
Will you come?

127
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,419
Ms. Nan, how can you
make something so sweet

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,380
sound so bad?

129
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,779
I just want to vent to someone.

130
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,100
I can't tell others.

131
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,260
Tell others? Who are you gonna tell?

132
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,290
Do you want me to introduce you
to some elites?

133
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,209
You're still single yourself,
and you want to introduce me?

134
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,810
I'm happy to be single.

135
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,050
I'm comfortable on my own, okay?

136
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,290
Comfortable, comfortable.

137
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,380
I'm not trapped by love like you.

138
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,050
Are you still thinking about Xue Yuming?

139
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,010
No.

140
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,740
But honestly, I suggest you

141
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,100
to forget about him.

142
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,530
Really. Because I know him too well.

143
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,379
He's your standard

144
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,050
refined egoist.

145
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,010
Do you think someone like him
is worth your energy and time?

146
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,689
You'd better pull yourself together

147
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,050
and fight with me, okay?

148
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,810
Okay.

149
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,650
I'll pull myself together.

150
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,860
Hurry and eat. The food's getting cold.

151
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,339
Who are you looking for?

152
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,499
I'm here for Allen.

153
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,259
Who?

154
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,060
Get Allen for me.

155
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,820
Allen, Allen, someone's here for you.

156
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,010
Coming.

157
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,649
Why are you here?

158
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,259
I was about to find you.

159
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,929
What are you doing? It's so noisy.

160
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,820
I'm having a party on the weekend,
of course.

161
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,409
You're not sleeping so early, are you?

162
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,250
I can't sleep even if I want to.

163
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,460
Since you can't sleep, come in.

164
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,529
This is the dress code

165
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,090
for our party today.

166
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,580
Pajamas.

167
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,970
Do people really hold such parties?

168
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,619
Don't you guys sleep?

169
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,569
We've been going to bed
before dawn for a month.

170
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,339
So we need to celebrate it, of course.

171
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,569
Is that worth celebrating?

172
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,420
Of course.

173
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,569
Aren't you going to
break your streak today?

174
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,700
Who cares? It's fun.

175
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,169
Are these all your friends?

176
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,580
Yeah, these are my best friends.

177
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,420
How energetic.

178
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,219
These are all people I met at the bar.

179
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,139
Zhang Sen.

180
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,569
His ancestors made Nv Er Hong
in Shaoxing.

181
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,409
He's amazing.

182
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,979
When he was 16,
he came to Shanghai alone

183
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,409
to learn mixology.

184
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,370
Pretty lady.

185
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,529
This is my neighbor.

186
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,099
This is my neighbor, Xia Guo.

187
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,370
Who?

188
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,259
It doesn't matter. Let's dance!

189
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,820
Okay.

190
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,809
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

191
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,099
Here's to Xia Guo!

192
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,300
Cheers!

193
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,340
Did you get your heart broken?

194
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,210
Look at you.

195
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,540
I know what's going on
without you telling me.

196
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,250
Long-distance relationships

197
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,889
are sad, nerve-racking and don't work.

198
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,660
No, we're just contacting lesser.

199
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,139
So I think it's pointless.

200
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,689
So become a career woman
and work on your career.

201
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,700
It's not that easy to be a career woman.

202
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,490
They're very lonely.

203
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,529
It sounds like your love life and career

204
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,940
aren't doing well.

205
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,259
How do you know?

206
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,420
I just want to say

207
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,739
you don't have to be
so hard on yourself.

208
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,850
You know that?

209
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,289
Your bullies

210
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,769
are enjoying themselves.

211
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,139
Why are you so hard

212
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,780
on yourself?

213
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,460
You'll have to make a choice, right?

214
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,979
You can't just

215
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,580
go with the flow.

216
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,619
Let me tell you a solution.

217
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,700
You can use it later
when you have to make a choice.

218
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,660
Do you want it? Here.

219
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,339
What?

220
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,370
Look.

221
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,210
You see that guy down there?

222
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,610
Once he finishes his call,

223
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,529
you'll choose option A

224
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,010
if he goes to the left.

225
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,739
If he goes to the right, it's option B.

226
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,970
What do you think?

227
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,809
Is that just going with the flow?

228
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,979
Don't get discouraged. Try it.

229
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,370
Figure out the option you want

230
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,099
and close your eyes.

231
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,420
Close them.

232
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,130
When you open your eyes

233
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,529
and find the option

234
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,890
to be what you want,

235
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,010
you'll be happy.

236
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,289
But if the result

237
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,890
is different from what you want,

238
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,180
you may be disappointed
and even frustrated.

239
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,099
But that frustration
will also remind you

240
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,460
what you really want.

241
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,490
And you'll also know what to do.

242
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,780
(Each of us makes a choice)

243
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,700
(about A or B every day.)

244
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,660
(Just like what Allen said,)

245
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,460
(no matter what you choose,)

246
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,370
(it's probably not too bad.)

247
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,580
(But it's not that great either.)

248
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,250
- (Everything's possible.)
- Three.

249
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,409
- (Will life allow us)
- Two.

250
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,010
- (to play games once in a while?)
- One.

251
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
(Resignation Application)

252
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,370
What's going on?

253
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,340
Why are you resigning all of a sudden?

254
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,890
Mr. Wu.

255
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,809
I think the only way

256
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,210
to give myself a good rest is to resign.

257
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,580
I believe

258
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,809
you can find

259
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,940
someone more qualified
to be the director.

260
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,210
Xia Guo, do you
have some misunderstanding?

261
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,739
What I said to you earlier

262
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,649
was out of concern for you.

263
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,420
I don't intend for you to leave.

264
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,169
I understand.

265
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,180
But I think you have a point.

266
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,339
I really need to make some adjustments

267
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,460
in my life and work

268
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,420
and think about my future.

269
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,420
You're so determined.

270
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,940
It seems there's no way
I can change your mind.

271
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,010
Thank you for helping me
make this decision.

272
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,890
Okay, I respect your decision.

273
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,060
All the best.

274
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,039
(Xue Yuming)

275
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,880
(I don't want to go on like this.
Let's break up.)

276
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,890
(When we figure out what to do next,)

277
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,060
(we can say goodbye to the past.)

278
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,540
(I've decided for now.)

279
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,419
(Where's my next choice?)

280
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,769
(I don't want to go on like this.)

281
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,260
(Thinking about it this way,)

282
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,499
(life is full of)

283
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,890
(new opportunities and challenges.)

284
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,690
(I don't want to go on like this.)

285
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,300
(Let's break up.)

286
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,440
(Block)

287
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,760
(Crossroads Bar)

288
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,529
Try this glass of Midsummer Fruit.

289
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,890
I modified it a little.

290
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,580
It's not to your taste again?

291
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,089
I'm just thinking

292
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,340
it's a shame this drink

293
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,289
isn't the bar's signature.

294
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,450
Forget about it.

295
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,219
This

296
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,129
may be the last drink

297
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,650
I make you in this bar.

298
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,130
The owner

299
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,060
is selling the bar.

300
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,610
I heard about it. What about you?

301
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,569
What is your next step?

302
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,090
My next step...

303
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,569
My next step...

304
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,220
is to freeload meals
off you for a while.

305
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,410
Are you scared?

306
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,329
Sure, you can freeload meals off me.

307
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,980
And I'll pay you a salary.

308
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,410
Are you drunk after taking a few sips?

309
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm thinking of taking over this place.

310
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,540
The man downstairs walked in

311
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,580
exactly the direction I wanted.

312
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,020
So I quit my job
and broke up with my boyfriend.

313
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,170
I want to say goodbye

314
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,690
and take on new opportunities.

315
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,020
Let's partner up.

316
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,699
I'll invest, while you do the work.

317
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,600
You're not trying to make me
your sugar baby, are you?

318
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,419
I don't do such things.

319
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,410
Get lost.

320
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,090
No, didn't I just give you
a few free drinks?

321
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,769
You're not really
interested in me, are you?

322
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,340
I'm serious.

323
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,529
Forget it if you don't want it.

324
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,650
You won't have another chance like this.

325
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,179
I want it.

326
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,699
I can work for you.

327
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,820
But

328
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,019
I want to officially become
a shareholder when we make money.

329
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,260
You're farsighted.

330
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,170
Okay, you can do whatever you want.

331
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,820
Okay.

332
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,529
Let's celebrate.

333
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,260
Resignation and breakup.
Two happy occasions.

334
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,650
Happy?

335
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,820
Fight fire with fire.
Two wrongs make one right.

336
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,170
Okay. Happy.

337
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
(Crossroads)

338
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,370
Let's start
by welcoming our new employees.

339
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,699
I'm really glad

340
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,650
to have you join our team.

341
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,899
I hope you can learn more

342
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,659
from our old staff in the next few days.

343
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,049
Whether it's the delivery speed

344
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,289
or the service quality,

345
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,500
I hope you'll all learn something.

346
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,259
But we're not the only ones
learning from you.

347
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,480
You're also learning from us.

348
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,899
We're gonna learn from you too, right?

349
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,780
So I hope we can progress together

350
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,850
and make our bar better.

351
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,090
An extra portion would be good enough.

352
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,219
You've been coughing for days.

353
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,740
You should check it out at the hospital.

354
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,129
It's okay. It just keeps recurring.

355
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,020
No need to go to the hospital.

356
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,580
Take a break. Take a sip of water.

357
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,130
Thank you.

358
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,540
You're burning.

359
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,450
It's your hand that's cold.

360
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,640
Have you sent the invitations?

361
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,780
What invitations? I'll send them
after you go to the hospital.

362
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,529
No, we're about to open up for business.

363
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,170
- I still have...
- Go to the hospital.

364
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,220
What are you doing? Put me down.

365
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,450
What are you doing?

366
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,060
It's still not finished.

367
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,739
What time is it?

368
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,450
Stop asking. Continue sleeping.

369
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,650
I feel much better already.

370
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,849
Your fever is almost 40 degrees.

371
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,740
Can you heal so fast?

372
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,020
Look at you.

373
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,130
You'll make money
but you won't be able to enjoy it.

374
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,450
You don't have to challenge me.

375
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,930
Since I decide to do something,

376
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,090
I must do it well.

377
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,019
I support you in doing it well.

378
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,930
I support you to do it tomorrow.

379
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,410
But tonight...

380
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,300
Just tonight.

381
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,890
I beg you to get some rest, okay?

382
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,020
Fine.

383
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,820
Go to sleep.

384
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,740
How about you and I be together?

385
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,820
We can eat together,

386
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,930
drink together, club together,

387
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,049
and do all the things we've never done.

388
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay?

389
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,930
Xia Guo.

390
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,540
I'm talking to you.

391
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,410
Xia Guo.

392
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,930
Don't pretend to sleep.

393
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,170
You're pretending to sleep.

394
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,699
Xia Guo's exclusive red packet
has arrived.

395
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,739
I wish you all the best.

396
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,580
Good luck.

397
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,740
You didn't show up
for the opening the other day.

398
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,529
Since you gave me

399
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,060
a red packet,

400
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,170
I'll forgive you.

401
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,569
I really couldn't come back.

402
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,049
I wanted to come.

403
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,499
What's wrong? You can't act freely
after marrying into a rich family?

404
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,820
Don't talk about it. It's a long story.

405
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,130
Here. Please enjoy.

406
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,370
- Thank you.
- Here. Try it.

407
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,930
What do you think?

408
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,260
The drink's good.

409
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,340
The bartender's better.

410
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,820
- Allen.
- Coming.

411
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,450
I'll head over first.

412
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,980
Have fun.

413
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,939
Watch your words. You scared him.

414
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,259
He's a kid.

415
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,699
Kid?

416
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,089
He's already an adult, okay?

417
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,269
And can't you tell he likes you?

418
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,329
Don't you want to give it a try?

419
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,179
Try?

420
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,419
He's my business partner.

421
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,499
So what if he's your business partner?

422
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,369
Guo, look how good

423
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,980
you are now.

424
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,890
What happened to you and Mr. Xue?

425
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,739
He went to Singapore.

426
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,410
Are you sure you're not going with him?

427
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,340
I wanted to go,

428
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,500
but he...

429
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,610
He won't let you go?

430
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,450
He was hesitant.

431
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,410
He just can't give me

432
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,130
a clear answer.

433
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,529
All I really wanted was a word from him,

434
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,170
but he won't give it to me.

435
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,699
Guo, why don't you start
by dating long distance?

436
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,129
No.

437
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,780
I can't stand the uncertainty anymore.

438
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,019
When I came to Shanghai,

439
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,300
I didn't think
I'll split up with Yu Jian.

440
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,090
But it still happened.

441
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,020
I don't want to repeat the same mistake.

442
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,170
It doesn't matter, Guo.

443
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,930
I figured it out anyway.

444
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,569
The most important thing
is to depend on yourself.

445
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,899
And you must find

446
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,650
someone who really likes you.

447
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,020
Look how many wrinkles I've got

448
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,809
since I got married.

449
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,289
I even have eyebags now.

450
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,569
Thank you for your support.

451
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,289
I'll drink first.
You can do whatever you want, okay?

452
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,019
Okay, okay.

453
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,130
Come on.

454
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,370
Thank you.

455
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,849
Guo, he's a good guy.

456
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,740
He's motivated, hardworking,
funny and handsome.

457
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,219
Most importantly,
he only has eyes for you.

458
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,529
His eyes light up whenever he sees you.

459
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,699
I'm so jealous.

460
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,289
How can you get excited about anything?

461
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,500
Of course.

462
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
You just have to remember

463
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,609
the most important thing for a woman

464
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,410
is to find someone
who only love her and make her happy.

465
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,769
Guo, I really hope

466
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,809
you can be happy.

467
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,890
So whatever choice you make,

468
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,849
I'll support you.

469
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,090
You have to be brave.

470
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,890
Okay, be brave.

471
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,500
Here. Cheers.

472
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,690
Cheers.

473
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,259
Are you being a free driver again?

474
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,820
It's called additional service.

475
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,220

Settling accounts again?

489
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,129
I had a look.

490
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,219
Our revenue this month

491
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,610
is about what I expected.

492
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,769
Isn't it New Year's and Christmas soon?

493
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,370
We need to increase our budget.

494
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,129
Everything is about

495
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,019
vibes and sense of occasion these days.

496
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,300
We can't lose.

497
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,130
And we can make more money.

498
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,690
I'm not that interested in making money.

499
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,020
What are you interested in then?

500
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,980
You.

501
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,340
Didn't you hear everything
I said in the hospital?

502
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,240
I...

503
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,799
You're pretending you can't remember,
aren't you?

504
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,739
Let me say it again.

505
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,060
No, no, no.

506
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,220
Don't scare me.

507
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,049
Don't joke like that with me.

508
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,740
Joke?

509
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,289
You're a woman, and I'm a man.

510
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,049
We're over 18 and single.

511
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,450
Why can't we be together?

512
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,170
Yes, you're over 18, but...

513
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,769
You're too young.

514
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,129
I'm young, but you've never given it a try.

515
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,820
How do you know it won't work?

516
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,410
I...

517
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,019
Let me put it this way.

518
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,340
I don't think

519
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,219
I'm at my best right now.

520
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,329
I'm still working on a lot of things.

521
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,930
I can't take action
without thinking about the consequences.

522
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,419
I can't make decisions
as easily as you do.

523
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,690
Do you understand?

524
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,930
Decision-making again.

525
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,580
Is it that hard?

526
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,340
I don't know how to explain it.

527
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,370
It's just that...

528
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,780
Look at them.

529
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,610
Look. Look at the couple over there.

530
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,569
No matter what happened to them

531
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,979
yesterday or tomorrow,

532
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,690
they're happy today.

533
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,890
Right?

534
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,850
Let's make another bet.
Are you addicted?

535
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,899
Another bet?

536
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,289
You're the one
who's afraid to make a decision.

537
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,609
That's why we're leaving it to fate.
Look over there. Look.

538
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,690
If the guy raises his glass first,

539
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,610
you'll become my girlfriend today.

540
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,849
If the girl raises her glass first,

541
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,740
you're still my boss tomorrow, okay?

542
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,739
Allen, this is...

543
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,220
Don't interrupt. Look, look.

544
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,300
Look.

545
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,820
Waiter, get me the bill.

546
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,739
Here's your bill.

547
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,780
It's destined.

548
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,569
Enough. Is making money a bad thing?

549
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,930
Don't overthink it.

550
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,450
Happy New Year!

551
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,500
Aren't you taking
today's high-speed train home?

552
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,899
It was canceled.

553
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,179
I can't go home now.

554
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,850
I'm here to freeload
a New Year's dinner from my boss.

555
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,540
I brought things.

556
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,340
I brought some food.

557
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,450
Come in.

558
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,169
You're making dumplings.

559
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,050
We have to eat dumplings
during the New Year.

560
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,370
Look at your dumplings.

561
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,740
Stop. Let me make the dumplings.

562
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,649
Have you washed your hands?
Wash them and disinfect them.

563
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,339
Hurry.

564
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,459
Disinfect and wash my hands.

565
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,740
Wait for me. Stop making dumplings.

566
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,260
Alright, no more drinks after this.

567
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,820
No, I...

568
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,700
Here's to you.

569
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,729
I hope you won't

570
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,299
stress yourself out so much
this year, okay?

571
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,340
Alright, no more drinks.

572
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,660
Let me send you home. Come on.

573
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,140
Guo, I like you.

574
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,779
You're drunk.

575
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,180
Do you like me?

576
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,220
Allen, we're not right for each other.

577
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,340
How about this?

578
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,220
I was very clear with you.

579
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,660
We can only be friends.

580
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,890
Nothing else.

581
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,370
I'll just assume you're drunk today.

582
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,780
Make way.

583
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,100
I can't accept it.

584
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,249
If you do that again, go home.

585
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,740
Don't ever find me again.

586
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,930
I'm sorry.

587
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,660
Allen.

588
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,700
I'm being serious with you.

589
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,100
I really, really want you to be happy.

590
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,970
But I'm not the one
who can make you happy.

591
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,370
Got it?

592
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,100
I hope

593
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,780
this new year goes well for you.

594
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,129
I also hope I can make you happier

595
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,050
in this new year.

596
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,930
(Allen, thank you for appearing)

597
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,890
(in these troubled times)

598
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,700
(and stagnant life.)

599
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,970
(Your appearance)

600
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,050
(brings me to peace)

601
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,820
(and let me)

602
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,890
(know myself better.)

603
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,820
(I hope my presence)

604
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,700
(gives you strength too.)

605
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,010
(I hope we can)

606
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,300
(get better in this new year.)

607
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,600
(Crossroads)

608
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,129
(Notice of Opening Delay)

609
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,820
I'm so sorry.

610
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,729
I know you didn't go home
for Chinese New Year

611
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,970
just so the bar could open for business.

612
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,820
But with the way things are going,

613
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,100
I don't know when we're gonna reopen.

614
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,689
So I'm gonna pay everyone

615
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,780
another month's salary and...

616
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,100
You don't have to
come to work anymore tomorrow.

617
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,530
Boss.

618
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,180
Look. We didn't even go home
for Chinese New Year,

619
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,379
waiting to open for business.

620
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,740
We've been eating and using
everything here.

621
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,780
We even took a month's pay for nothing.

622
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,140
If we take this severance now,

623
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,529
we'll feel bad about it.

624
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,169
- Yes.
- Yeah.

625
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,379
Besides,

626
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,609
everything outside is closed now.

627
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,979
Where can we find new jobs?

628
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,569
Yes.

629
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,819
We might as well stay here, right?

630
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,209
Yeah, Boss. Don't make us leave.

631
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,169
Let us stay.

632
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,339
Don't make us leave.

633
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,609
But I can't afford
to pay your salaries anymore.

634
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,419
I can't let everyone work for free.

635
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,569
It's fine, Boss.

636
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,089
I saved up some money. Don't worry.

637
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,339
I'm willing to wait without a salary.

638
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,609
Yes, we don't want you to pay us.

639
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,609
We're all willing to wait.

640
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,939
We're willing to wait.

641
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,260
- Don't worry, Boss.
- The pandemic will pass, Boss.

642
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,439
(Fisher: Boss, do you make
simple meals for food delivery?)

643
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,160
(I'll send you the address if you do.)

644
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,930
Thank you.

645
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,899
I think we're saved.

646
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,010
We're saved.

647
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,169
Calm down first.

648
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,379
Go back to your posts and get ready.

649
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,499
- Okay.
- Okay.

650
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,490
- Let's go.
- Let's go. We're saved. Hurry.

651
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,299
(Xia Guo: We can make and deliver them.
What would you like to order?)

652
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,700
I'm a hit.

653
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,019
I'm telling you.

654
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,379
Why didn't I find

655
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,089
live streaming so fun before?

656
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,570
You're having fun.

657
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,609
But can your fans

658
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,049
patronize our shop?

659
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,249
Can they give us business?

660
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,370
They can't, right?

661
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,700
This is a message from a customer.

662
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,609
Why didn't I think of

663
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,209
doing food delivery before?

664
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,529
Yeah, people can only order takeout now.

665
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,089
Wouldn't we make money
by making simple meals?

666
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,570
Yeah.

667
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,859
(Fisher: Fried chicken,
salad, and fries.)

668
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,180
Someone ordered.

669
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,620
There is always a way out.

670
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,339
As long as a customer needs us,

671
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,820
we can keep this place open.

672
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,939
Here. I'll contact
the food delivery platform

673
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,089
to start a takeout business.

674
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,089
Any business counts.

675
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,260
I'll handle the recipe.

676
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,970
Leave the menu to me.

677
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,410
Here. 53 and 54 are ready.

678
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,729
This is a cocktail

679
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,689
that I'm going to recommend you.

680
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,529
I'm recommending this one

681
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,089
because the liquor it uses

682
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,100
is common in the market.

683
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,499
Tequila, rum, vodka and whiskey

684
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,649
are easy to find.

685
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,490
You can easily make them at home.

686
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,300
I'm going to talk a little more
about the amount of each liquor.

687
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,320
(Mr. Fisher:
7th order. Shenghua Apartment.)

688
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,800
(Allen)

689
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,300
(Watch my live stream.)

690
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,459
Do you remember

691
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,459
the name of this cocktail?

692
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,819
Yes. It's called Xia Guo.

693
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,779
I saw someone ask
why it's called Xia Guo.

694
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,000
(The color's pretty.)
Good question.

695
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,410
(It looks good.)
Because Xia Guo is my only goddess.

696
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,979
Today is my goddess' birthday.

697
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,729
I hope my friends, fans, and buddies

698
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,089
watching the live stream

699
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,049
will comment

700
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,089
"Happy birthday, Xia Guo." Okay?

701
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,819
Here. Three, two, one.

702
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,850
(That's a nice name.)
Xia Guo, happy birthday!

703
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,899
(Looks good.)
I hope you're happy today, tomorrow

704
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,609
and the day after tomorrow.

705
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,010
(I'd like to have a glass.)
I hope you're happy every day.

706
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,649
I hope every day is like your birthday.

707
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,529
I hope I could always be there for you

708
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,890
and be your bartender.

709
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,089
No more worries on making money,

710
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,089
or on anything else.

711
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,049
I hope we can live happily together.

712
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:13,819
Okay?

713
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,129
(It must be good.)
Xia Guo, happy birthday!

714
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,320
(Xia Guo, happy birthday.)

715
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,850
Happy birthday.

716
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,260
Thank you.

717
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,019
You have such a flair
for food and drinks.

718
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,820
Have you ever thought
about opening a restaurant?

719
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:36,859
Not everyone can enjoy

720
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,890
my cooking.

721
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,530
You have to learn to serve the people.

722
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,169
Look.

723
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,890
The restaurants are reopening.

724
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,010
But bars are off-limits yet.

725
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,649
Making simple meals alone
is too monotonous.

726
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,700
It's not a long-term solution.

727
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,689
Do you think we should

728
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,979
get a bigger place?

729
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,299
One that's suitable for a restaurant.

730
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,820
Let's open a restaurant.

731
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,859
Look at all these
office buildings around us.

732
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,299
Lunch is in high demand

733
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,140
among white-collar staff
returning to work.

734
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,609
Besides, rents and tax points are low

735
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,450
during the pandemic.

736
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,220
We can make it work.

737
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,129
But no one goes to restaurants now.

738
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,169
Who's going?

739
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:15,859
If no one comes,

740
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,410
we can do food deliveries.

741
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,780
How did our bar survive?

742
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,740
Isn't it by doing food deliveries?

743
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,379
We can do some good advertising.

744
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,820
It will work.

745
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,490
Haven't you ever heard of a saying?

746
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,819
Live fish swim upstream.

747
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,970
Are you swimming upstream or impulsive?

748
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,529
There's no way to cover
the cost of food deliveries.

749
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,740
You know that.

750
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,819
Allen.

751
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,010
There is no shortage of clever people.

752
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,970
What's missing are people
who work hard and take risks.

753
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,529
All success doesn't fall from the sky.

754
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,970
I won't listen to those principles.

755
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,819
Seriously, I think you should check out

756
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,499
the stores without

757
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,530
regular opening hours.

758
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,979
They open

759
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,979
whenever they want.

760
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,850
Aren't they doing well?

761
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,129
I think that's the life

762
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,260
we should be pursuing.

763
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,450
Let me ask you.

764
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,339
Do you have a plan for the future?

765
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,689
Why should I think of the future?

766
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,169
I think the most important thing

767
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,410
is not to trap yourself in this place.

768
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,569
We should do something awesome

769
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,180
and meaningful.

770
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,570
Why don't we drive to Xizang?

771
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,530
And then what?

772
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,780
And then?

773
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,339
Why think so far ahead?

774
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,700
Can't you think about it
when the time comes?

775
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,010
Allen.

776
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,570
Since we chose to start a business,

777
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,049
we need to have a sense of crisis.

778
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,939
We have to think big and look far.

779
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,609
We can't miss any chances.

780
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,729
But it's not a good time

781
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,979
to start a business.

782
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,930
Why are you so hard on yourself?

783
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,459
Guo, did you say these

784
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,930
because you don't want to be with me?

785
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,649
Why are you mixing relationships

786
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,820
with work?

787
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,600
Don't come to work tomorrow
if you keep talking like that.

788
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,780
Fine.

789
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,820
You're right.

790
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,299
There's a big difference

791
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,220
on our values.

792
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,930
Ms. Xia, this is your pub.

793
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,689
You can do whatever you want.

794
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,450
It has nothing to do with me.

795
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,050
I'm officially requesting for leave.

796
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,820
(One day,)

797
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,450
(when you can calmly face
life's sudden changes,)

798
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:28,779
(it means)

799
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,490
(you know what you really want.)

800
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,220
(Does that count as growth?)

801
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,530
(My heart is as calm as water.)

802
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,660
(as if it can no longer feel excited.)

803
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,890
(I even miss the excitement.)

804
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,660
(Dear other me,)

805
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,970
(how's your life?)

806
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,820
(Is it still exciting?)

807
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,180
(Is it still passionate?)
