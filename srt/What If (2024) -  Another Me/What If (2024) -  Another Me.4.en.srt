(When Reality Becomes A Dream)

4
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,720
Why are you back?

5
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,920
I... I came down to pick up my parcel.

6
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,200
Don't lie.

7
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,550
I know you are lying.

8
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
What has happened?

9
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,630
My mom

10
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,070
has already rented out this place.

11
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:33,510
I wanted to discuss it
with you just now.

12
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,590
But you seemed so tired

13
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,620
running between your workplace
and the hospital.

14
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,150
So I didn't tell you.

15
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,320
Since when have you become

16
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,880
so hesitant with me?

17
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,950
Hop on.

18
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,150
Let's go to my place.

19
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,950
Yu Jian.

20
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,200
Yu Jian.

21
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Are you back...

22
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,200
Put this on and go to bed early.

23
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,630
What's wrong?

24
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,200
It's not your first time here.

25
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,470
You were brave to jump onto my bed
early in the morning

26
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,800
and wake me up that day.

27
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,470
But I'm going to sleep here.

28
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,080
I haven't done this

29
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,470
since growing up.

30
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,200
Why all the worries?

31
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,680
You were terrified just now

32
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,510
as if I had sneaked into my home
like a thief.

33
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,430
It was scary.

34
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,680
Well,

35
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,240
get rest early.

36
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,360
Tomorrow, I will clean up
Yu Yan's room for you.

37
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,150
Would your parents agree?

38
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,470
Of course.

39
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,460
Later, I will collect your things

40
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,880
from your mom's place.

41
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,340
You are so kind to me, Yam Head.

42
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,920
If you ever encounter trouble
in the future, don't bear it yourself.

43
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,430
You must tell me immediately.

44
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,950
I'm your Yam Head.

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,070
Get rest early.

46
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,360
Ride safe.

47
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,510
Text me when you arrive.

48
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,400
All right.

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,320
Go ahead.

50
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,430
Guo?

51
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Mrs. Yu,

52
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,360
why are you back?

53
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm so forgetful.

54
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,180
I realized I didn't bring my phone
when I was halfway there.

55
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,590
I forgot it.

56
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,400
Were you here

57
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
last night?

58
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,720
Yes.

59
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,030
I... I forgot my keys.

60
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,680
Then,

61
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,150
Yu Jian brought me back.

62
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:40,070
Yu Jian came home last night?

63
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,950
He did.

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,171
But he headed back
to the hospital afterward.

65
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,890
I'm going to the bathroom, Mrs. Yu.

66
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,840
Sure.

67
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,430
There is a new toothbrush
under the sink.

68
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
All right, thank you.

69
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,260
Maybe you can wait for me.

70
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll make it quick and
go to the hospital with you.

71
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,110
Okay.

72
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,030
It won't take long.

73
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,880
Gotcha.

74
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,000
What did you just say?

75
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,790
Wang Yan rented the place
to someone else,

76
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,920
so Guo has to stay in ours?

77
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,590
Mom,

78
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,900
Guo has been with us since little.

79
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,280
Why all the fuss?

80
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,510
Besides, Yu Yan's room is left unused.

81
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,550
Right.

82
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Guo,

83
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,760
you can stay in Yan's room. Don't worry.

84
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,110
Yu Jian,

85
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,800
you are inconsiderate.

86
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,990
How could you not consider Guo at all?

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,910
She moves into your place
before getting married,

88
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,240
people might gossip.

89
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,360
What gossip?

90
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,110
Both of them will
get married sooner or later.

91
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,200
Don't meddle.

92
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,280
Mrs. Yu, don't worry.

93
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Maybe Yu Jian didn't explain it clearly.

94
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,320
Actually, I want to rent Yan's room.

95
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,600
I want to rent the room.

96
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,280
How could you say that?

97
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,550
If you pay to stay in Yan's room,

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,360
it would make us
look like money grabbers.

99
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,840
Drink your chicken soup.

100
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
If you mean a rental,

101
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,230
that's all right.

102
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,560
Mom, are you serious?

103
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,485
Do you really want to charge her?

104
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,600
If Guo moves in as a tenant,

105
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,110
gossip could be avoided.

106
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
Are you saying

107
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,070
that I pay you the rental

108
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,520
for Guo, right?

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,370
Why are you giving

110
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
your mom the money?

111
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,600
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,880
Yeah, you silly.

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,360
We are a family.

114
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190
We won't take Guo's money.

115
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,110
Just drink the soup.

116
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
What I mean is,

117
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,240
ask Wang Yan to pay the rent.

118
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,230
Guo, ask for the money from your mom.

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,920
She is the one who rented
your place to someone else.

120
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,060
Mom, if Ms. Wang doesn't pay for Guo,

121
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,480
Guo still has to pay.

122
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,560
Shut up.

123
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,440
Mrs. Yu,

124
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,390
since I'm renting the place,

125
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,030
I should pay the rent.

126
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,100
That's settled.

127
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,350
I have to go back to my office.

128
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Mr. Yu, remember to finish
the chicken soup.

129
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,150
I should go.

130
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,020
I know you understand me.

131
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,230
Don't worry, Mrs. Yu.

132
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,950
I'll see you off.

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,430
It's fine.
I will contact you later.

134
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,190
Bye, Mr. Yu.

135
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,920
Bye, Mrs. Yu.

136
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,760
Be careful.

137
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,760
Mom,

138
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,350
are you aware of what you just said?

139
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:22,460
Ms. Wang could even

140
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,120
charge her own daughter for the rent.

141
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,720
How would she possibly pay for Guo?

142
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,390
That's right.

143
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,600
Didn't I make it clear enough?

144
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm not asking Guo for the money.

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
It's Wang Yan.

146
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,740
If she doesn't pay,
she is taking advantage of us.

147
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,760
Understood?

148
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,310
Keep it down.

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,390
I get what she is saying.

150
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,190
Your mom wants to

151
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,350
get Guo's money back

152
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,840
from Wang Yan.

153
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,110
Did I get it right?

154
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,742
You are smart for the first time.

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,760
Are you dull?

156
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,600
Guo, regarding the rent,

157
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:02,230
please don't take it to heart.

158
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:03,390
My mom was just saying.

159
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
She won't charge you for that.

160
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,310
I brought up paying rent myself,

161
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,760
so I will pay.

162
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,950
How about this?

163
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,314
I give you the money,

164
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,400
and you give it to her.

165
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,114
Well, I give them
an allowance every month.

166
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,440
It's the same.

167
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:20,640
Listen, if you want to say
or do anything,

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,857
discuss it with me first.

169
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:22,870
Don't decide on your own.

170
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,560
Do you hear me?

171
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:25,371
Please don't get the wrong idea.

172
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,310
I really think

173
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,800
I found a good place to stay.

174
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,150
But you make things complicated.

175
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
You have done so much

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
for my family.

177
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,800
If I were to charge you for the rent,
I wouldn't call myself human.

178
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,350
Since I chose to stay in Leshan,

179
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,560
I chose a life with you.

180
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,150
We will go through
ups and downs together.

181
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,314
All the more reason
that I won't take your money.

182
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,110
Guo, don't worry.

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,520
I will provide you with a better life.

184
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,680
You will be much happier

185
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,628
than those who go
to Beijing or Shanghai.

186
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,150
Sure.

187
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,680
You can do it now.

188
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,560
How?

189
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,390
Buy me another Ciba cake,

190
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,760
and I will be happier.

191
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,110
Sure. You can eat it

192
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,520
right now.

193
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,390
Ms. Liu.

194
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,600
Mr. Yu, we are here.

195
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,230
- Dad.
- Guo is here. Jian.

196
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:24,720
We brought you flowers.

197
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
- So beautiful.
- Do you like them?

198
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,990
(Even an ordinary life
can brim with lights.)

199
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,110
(People here live
comfortably and happily.)

200
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,150
- Mr. Yu, drink some water.
- All right.

201
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,720
Dad, Mom.

202
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,640
Jian is here.

203
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,590
- How is it?
- Coming.

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,560
Are you tired?

205
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,270
I'm not. Are you?

206
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,440
I'm not.

207
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,250
Have you eaten yet?

208
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,230
Not yet.

209
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,480
Grab a bite.

210
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,800
All right.

211
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,720
You should go back now.

212
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,030
It has been a tiring day for you.

213
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,270
- It's fine.
- Guo.

214
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,190
Here. Bring the fruit with you.

215
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,350
No, Mrs. Yu.

216
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,100
No thanks.

217
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
- Keep them.
- Remember to eat while you work.

218
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,630
- Thank you, Mrs. Yu.
- Travel safe.

219
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,270
All right. Come on and eat.

220
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,680
Eat up.

221
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,560
Here.

222
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,150
Be careful.

223
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,600
Yu.

224
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,990
(Isn't this the life)

225
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,640
(many people dream of?)

226
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,390
(Inpatient Department)

227
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,390
(I'm happy)

228
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,950
(living in a small town.)

229
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
(How about you in Shanghai?)

230
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,480
(Have you seen the life you dream of?)

231
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,220
(Haowei Annual Celebration)

232
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,485
Is this a custom
of Haowei's annual celebration?

233
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,390
Of course.

234
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,190
We have a different theme each year.

235
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,480
This year, we go for
organic vegetables and fruits.

236
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,020
So, the theme of tonight's banquet

237
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,440
fits very well.

238
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,760
It's interesting.

239
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

240
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,760
welcome to Haowei's annual celebration.

241
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,820
First of all,

242
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,680
let's give a big hand to welcome

243
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
the general manager of Haowei Group,

244
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,580
Mr. Xue Yuming, to give his speech.

245
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
Please.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,900
Bravo!

247
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,640
In the past year,

248
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
Haowei Group

249
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,990
has been developing steadily.

250
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,190
We seized the opportunities
in various areas

251
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,310
and have achieved remarkable results.

252
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,640
On behalf of the company,

253
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,857
I would like to express my gratitude
to all the staff.

254
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,800
Thank you so much.

255
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:40,800
I won't say much.
There are surprises later.

256
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,560
I wish you a Happy New Year.

257
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,485
Thank you for your wonderful speech,
Mr. Xue.

258
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
Please have a seat.

259
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,440
Next, we will present

260
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
the Best Employee of the Year award.

261
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,030
Let's congratulate Zhang Chao.

262
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,990
Well done!

263
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,030

Xia Guo.

268
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,440
Let's invite the award presenter,

269
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,880
the chairman of Haowei Group,

270
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,350
Mr. Lu Wan.

271
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,350
Welcome, Mr. Lu.

272
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,110
Thank you.

273
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,640
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

274
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,114
You have the loudest applause.

275
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,880
Congratulations.

(Best Employee Award,

277
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,680
In the past year,

278
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,680
thank you
to these six excellent employees

279
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,950
and colleagues down there
for your hard work.

280
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,270
I really appreciate it.

281
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,390
It's New Year.

282
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,390
I wish you all a Happy New Year.

283
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,880
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

284
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,190
Happy New Year.

285
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,110
Cheers.

286
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,950
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

287
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,880
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

288
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,342
Let's drink to the Marketing Department.

289
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,030
Happy New Year.

290
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,720
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

291
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,520
Happy New Year.

292
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,840
Chen Nan,

293
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,310
I heard that you brought
Xia Guo here from Leshan.

294
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,950
Yeah, Mr. Lu.

295
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,885
Xia Guo is doing pretty well.

296
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,840
She is new here,

297
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,228
but she came up with
the brilliant idea of the lucky bags,

298
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:55,200
which solved the urgent shortage problem
in offline stores

299
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,920
and made a marvelous start
for this year's latest product.

300
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,350
Good job.

301
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,950
You know what?

302
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,971
You made the right choice
to come to Shanghai.

303
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,760
Here, you'll have
a bigger space to perform.

304
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:08,828
Thank you for your encouragement,
Mr. Lu.

305
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,940
It's all thanks to Ms. Chen's
and Mr. Xue's guidance.

306
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,880
Don't be humble.

307
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,600
You have a sharp mind.

308
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,070
Mr. Lu, it's not that I brag about
my subordinate.

309
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,480
Xia Guo did improve a lot.

310
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,110
When she first arrived,

311
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,771
she also made some small mistakes.

312
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,070
I heard about it.

313
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,880
It has been tough
for the Marketing Department.

314
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,670
You have to try new strategies
to boost sales

315
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
and ensure inventory at the same time.

316
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,840
It's difficult for you all.

317
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:33,480
Thank you for your understanding.

318
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,760
Mr. Lu.

319
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,480
Mr. Zhang.

320
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,670
I'd like to give you a toast.

321
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,440
Happy New Year.

322
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
By the way, I recommended
a doctor to you last time.

323
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,940
Have you visited him yet?

324
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,100
I haven't had the time yet.

325
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,030
It's fine.

326
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,680
I just want to inform you

327
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,420
that he has just returned from overseas.

328
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,550
If you need to contact him,

329
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,350
call me at any time.

330
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,600
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

331
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,560
Congrats.

332
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,110
Thank you.

333
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:01,028
It's perfect that Mr. Zhang is here.

334
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,390
I would like to announce

335
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:04,480
that our priority for the coming year is

336
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,800
to expand the production line.

337
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,720
Chen Nan,

338
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,760
get ready for it

339
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,150
and do something big.

340
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
Don't worry.

341
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,220
Everyone in the Marketing Department

342
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,560
is waiting for it.

343
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:17,990
She's lucky to have a competent
assistant like Xia Guo, unlike me.

344
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,070
Don't be modest.

345
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,950
You have lots of hidden talents

346
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,350
working under you.

347
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,840
Not really.

348
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,990
I don't have a capable assistant
like Xia Guo.

349
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,190
Maybe you can seek one for me.

350
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,180
You have keen eyes.

351
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,950
How could it be my place to do that?

352
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,680
Why?

353
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,560
Mr. Xue, are you interested in Xia Guo?

354
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,057
It's rare that someone
can catch your attention.

355
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,950
It's not that.

356
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,640
It's true Xia Guo is capable.

357
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,990
If I could have an assistant like her,

358
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,920
it couldn't be better.

359
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

360
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,520
Interesting.

361
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,830
There's finally something
you can't handle, Mr. Xue.

362
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,720
There is.

363
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,760
- Mr. Lu.
- Ms. Zhou.

364
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,560
Mr. Xue.

365
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,980
Happy New Year, everyone.

366
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,400
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

367
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

368
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,720
Mr. Lu, let's go over there.

369
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,840
Okay.

370
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,680
Ms. Zhou, nice dress.

371
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,440
Xia Guo,

372
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,840
come with me.

373
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,950
Happy New Year.

374
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,840
Do you really want

375
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,171
to be Xue Yuming's assistant?

376
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,680
No, I don't.

377
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,400
There's a misunderstanding.

378
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,270
I thought Mr. Xue was joking just now.

379
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,760
Joking?

380
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,720
It seems you both are close enough

381
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,640
to joke with each other.

382
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,680
No, I didn't mean that.

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,680
Xia Guo,

384
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,940
I remember

385
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,350
on your first day here,

386
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,390
I clearly told you that Xue Yuming
and I didn't see eye to eye.

387
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,142
Look at what you have done.

388
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,230
He can instruct you however he wants.

389
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,920
And you intervene
with the offline sales.

390
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,640
I didn't misjudge you.

391
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,560
You are such an asset.

392
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,990
Are you talking about the lucky bags?

393
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,600
I thought the Marketing Department
would also be responsible for that.

394
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,190
- So...
- Mark my words.

395
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,350
I brought you here from Leshan.

396
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,110
Likewise,

397
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,560
I can send you back.

398
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Understood?

399
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
All right, Ms. Nan.

400
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,990
I will be more careful.

401
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Are you sick?

402
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,520
Why do you need a doctor?

403
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,880
Not me,

404
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,440
it's my boyfriend's mother.

405
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,110
If you need a doctor,

406
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,190
I can do you this favor.

407
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,760
But please stop all that funny business.

408
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,350
I'm not blind.

409
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,720
Got scolded?

410
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,350
Mr. Xue.

411
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,640
Interpersonal relationships
at work are complicated.

412
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,840
The lucky draw is going to start.

413
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,440
Go and try your luck.

414
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,350
Go on.

415
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
Yes.

416
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,520
Xia Guo, you are smart.

417
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,880
Don't waste your efforts on things
you are not good at.

418
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,310
Just do what you think is right.

419
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,150
Don't make yourself regret it.

420
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,920
I should go.

421
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,310
Good luck.

422
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,800
Next, we will draw

423
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,640
for the second prize of the night.

424
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,150
The second prize is

425
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,880
a laptop.

426
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,230
Let's congratulate No. 26.

427
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,720
Congrats.

428
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,800
- Please come to the stage.
- No. 26? Not me again.

429
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,230
Maybe I will get the first prize.

430
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,800
You will.

431
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,030
Okay. Congratulations.
Please take a seat.

432
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,950
All right. Now we are going to draw

433
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,720
for the first prize of the night.

434
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,480
The first prize prepared is

435
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,950
the latest model of a smartphone.

436
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,920
The latest smartphone.

437
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,190
(Stub)
No. 78.

438
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,190
(Lucky Draw Ticket)
Where is No. 78?

439
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,270
Yuming, No. 78 is you.

440
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,640
Mr. Xue.

441
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,640
You are lucky.

442
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,990
- Mr. Xue.
- Lucky you.

443
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,350
Please come to the stage.

444
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,560
Hold on.

445
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,640
I won't...

446
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,940
I have a suggestion.

447
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,740
Mr. Xue will donate this phone.

448
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,640
Let's do the lucky draw again,
all right?

449
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,720
Yeah!

450
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,440
Donate the prize!

451
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
Donate the prize!

452
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,760
I also think Ms. Chen's idea is good.

453
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:18,914
I won't take the prize.

454
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,150
Let's draw again.

455
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,270
Okay?

456
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,520
Yes!

457
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,520
Wait.

458
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,190
Since Mr. Xue is so generous,

459
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,640
why don't you donate
another ten phones?

460
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,260
Let's have another round
of special lucky draw, all right?

461
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,230
Right!

462
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,030
Twenty. Double it.

463
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,800
Okay.

464
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,270
Mr. Xue agrees
with Ms. Chen's suggestion.

465
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,880
We will add another 20 phones.

466
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,680
- Awesome, Mr. Xue!
- Awesome, Mr. Xue!

467
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,150
- Awesome, Mr. Xue!
- Awesome, Mr. Xue!

468
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:13,070
- Awesome, Mr. Xue!
- Awesome, Mr. Xue!

469
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,520
You are back.

470
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,070
Why did you come here?

471
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,310
You should've told me sooner.

472
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,971
You haven't been talking
to me these days.

473
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,350
I don't want to be a fool.

474
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,070
When did you arrive?

475
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
Have you been waiting for long?

476
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,960
Why?

477
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,920
Aren't you happy

478
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,720
to see me?

479
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,000
Yu Jian, I have worked all night
and haven't eaten anything

480
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,260
before coming to the hospital,
yet you are saying that.

481
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,390
If you don't want to do this or can't,

482
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,600
just tell me directly.

483
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,470
Do you know you were silly?

484
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,714
I shouldn't yell at you on the phone.

485
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,230
I was very silly.

486
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,560
I didn't mean that.

487
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,960
Guo,

488
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,150
I'm to blame for everything.

489
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,310
Will you forgive me?

490
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,920
Yam Head.

491
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
Come

492
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,310
and try the scallion oil noodles.

493
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,640
I can eat two packets
of this when I'm hungry.

494
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,800
Here you go.

495
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,685
You don't like scallions, do you?

496
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,560
The scallion oil of
our company adopts an

497
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,270
electromagnetic temperature
control technique.

498
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,840
It can control the temperature precisely

499
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,350
and accurately plans in terms of
the amount of ingredients,

500
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,880
temperature, cooking time,
and the addition of ingredients.

501
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,030
I think the scallion scent
is less intense

502
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,880
and the aroma is richer.

503
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,350
Besides, the flour we used

504
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,800
extracts 30 percent of the essence
of the dough core.

505
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,560
It employs vacuum kneading technology

506
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,880
and undergoes seven steps of rolling

507
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,310
to make the noodles chewier.

508
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,310
It also uses
low-temperature drying technology.

509
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,520
Under the temperature
from 50 to 60 degrees...

510
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,230
Why?

511
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,960
Nothing.

512
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,600
I just feel that you have
become more professional.

513
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,180
You look like someone
who works in the headquarters.

514
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,190
Not really.

515
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,640
Because I deal with these every day.

516
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,742
I can't just look up the information
in front of my clients when they ask me.

517
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,560
Hurry and eat.

518
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,800
After going to the hospital tomorrow,

519
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,800
let's go sightseeing.

520
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,270
You rarely came to Shanghai.

521
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,260
There are also some places here
I haven't been to.

522
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,310
Let's go and explore.

523
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,030
Sure, you are the boss.

524
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,190
Yu Yan came back for
Chinese New Year this year.

525
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,714
With her taking care of my parents,

526
00:26:40,714 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm more at ease.

527
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,230
Eat slowly.

528
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,720
I have taken leave from work.

529
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,150
After New Year, my dad

530
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,020
can be transferred
to a rehabilitation hospital.

531
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,700
When he recovers

532
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
and returns home,

533
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:53,942
I can come to Shanghai

534
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,720
and stay with you without worries.

535
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,560
You are so lovely.

536
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,880
In that case, here's your gift.

537
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,390
A handphone?

538
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:10,400
You bought it,
so you should use it yourself.

539
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,600
I didn't buy this.

540
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
I got it from the lucky draw
at the annual dinner.

541
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,070
It's really an eye-opener.

542
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,100
Supposedly,

543
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,920
my general manager won this handphone.

544
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,000
But Ms. Nan,

545
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,580
the lady who brought me here,

546
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,571
suggested in front of everyone

547
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,190
that Mr. Xue give up on this prize

548
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,914
and donate another twenty handphones.

549
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,680
I got it from the final round
of the lucky draw.

550
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,470
However, Ms. Nan

551
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,840
has made it too obvious.

552
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,310
They must be very close,

553
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,270
that's why she did this.

554
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,030
I think both of them have a beef.

555
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,714
But that's not my business.

556
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,720
Anyway,

557
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,920
I give this lucky draw prize

558
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,960
to my boyfriend.

559
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,110
Well, in return,

560
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,640
I have a gift

561
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,960
for my girlfriend too.

562
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,110
What is this?

563
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,030
A moment.

564
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,070
So mysterious.

565
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,920
Let me see.

566
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,840
My gift isn't as expensive as yours.

567
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,430
Promise me

568
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
you won't despise it.

569
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,030
I won't.

570
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I plan to change to a bigger one

571
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
when I come to Shanghai.

572
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,390
So, please wait here for me.

573
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,310
Is this a comforting gift?

574
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,470
You can take it

575
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,840
as my promise to you.

576
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,430
If so, I will receive it.

577
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,070
I will wait for you.

578
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,680
Later,

579
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,960
we will be together forever

580
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,230
and never leave each other.

581
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:02,742
We will never leave each other.

582
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,160
So nice.

583
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,150
Do you like it?

584
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,880
I like your gift.

585
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:09,470
I took a long time to pick it.

586
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,920
Dear Mr. Yu,

587
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,880
you are now
in the vegetables and fruits area.

588
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
Pick anything you want.

589
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

590
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,700
(Envy apple, 50 yuan each)

591
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,110
An apple costs 50 yuan?

592
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,030
I better put it back

593
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,000
and not damage it.

594
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,310
Look at this.

595
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,390
A giant crab over there.

596
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,840
It's called the red king crab.

597
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,470
How come things are
so expensive in Shanghai?

598
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,030
You said it yourself, this is Shanghai.

599
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,520
That's the price here.

600
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,880
You will get used to it.

601
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,760
Look at the pink fish there.

602
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
So interesting.

603
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,920
Think about those three dogs
at the riverside.

604
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,760
I found it Shanghai is bizarre.

605
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,230
Even dogs have their own carts.

606
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,640
They don't have to walk.

607
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,714
People here have nothing better
to spend their money.

608
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,140
Not really.

609
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,680
Ordinary white collars here are like me.

610
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,470
We'll take the cramped subway
at peak hours

611
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,980
and can't sleep more than six hours.

612
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,390
Still, we manage.

613
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,600
But you won't have much happiness.

614
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,390
There are times
when I feel extremely happy.

615
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,110
When?

616
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,270
The payday every month.

617
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,720
I get even happier

618
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,470
when I get both salary and bonus.

619
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,310
In the end, it's all about money,

620
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,000
you money-obsessed.

621
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,350
Are you curious about

622
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,800
how to make your boyfriend

623
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
feel extremely happy?

624
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,190
Tell me.

625
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,030
When my girlfriend prepares
delicious food

626
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,520
and feeds it to me,

627
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,800
I'll be over the moon.

628
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
In your dream.

629
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,800
Guo, don't run.

630
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,150
Okay, just pull over here.

631
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,390
A bit forward.

632
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Forward.

633
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,270
Mr. Liu, Mr. Li.

634
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,960
I brought you the New Year's goods
for Ms. Nan.

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,350
You've worked hard in the past year.
Happy Chinese New Year.

636
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,840
Happy New Year.
Thank you so much.

637
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,960
Over here.

638
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,260
Call everyone over.

639
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,030
Okay.

640
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,270
Guys, come and unload the goods.

641
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,030
- Over here.
- Hurry and unload.

642
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,760
These are Haowei's gift boxes.

643
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,150
They are all delicious food.
Hope this brings you good luck.

644
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,720
Thanks.

645
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,600
Everyone has one set.

646
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
- Thank you so much.
- Here you go.

647
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,960
Thank you, Ms. Nan.

648
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,190
Thank you, Marketing Department.

649
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,000
You are welcome.

650
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,640
I have to say

651
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,800
the superiors of Haowei

652
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,760
are so kind.

653
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,190
Look, Mr. Xue
gave us red packets earlier,

654
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,380
and now Ms. Nan has given us
the gift boxes.

655
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,350
- See you, Mr. Xue.
- See you, Mr. Xue.

656
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,030
Happy New Year.

657
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,520
We must work harder.

658
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,390
That's right.

659
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,714
- Hello, Mr. Xue.
- Hello, Mr. Xue.

660
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:40,142
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

661
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,150
Mr. Xue?

662
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,885
You came here to distribute
the red packets yourself?

663
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,180
What about you? Why are you here?

664
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,800
I...

665
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
I represent Ms. Chen

666
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,828
in delivering the New Year's good
to everyone.

667
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,800
It seems Ms. Chen and I thought alike.

668
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,920
But I'm not as lucky as her

669
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,771
to have a capable assistant like you.

670
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,457
That's why I have to come myself.

671
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,150
You must be joking.

672
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,720
Here's your share.

673
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,920
No thanks, Mr. Xue.

674
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,390
Happy New Year.

675
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,920
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

676
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:19,390
I have only seen you smile

677
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,470
under two circumstances.

678
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,230
One is when you get money.

679
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,880
Seems like it.

680
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,780
(Tensai, Hengshan Road branch)

682
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,350
And another one is like now.

683
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,030
Your boyfriend?

684
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:41,310
I remember that you won a smartphone

685
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,390
during the annual dinner.

686
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,350
Why aren't you using it?

687
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,230
The old one still works.

688
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,840
Go on.

689
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Okay. Right away.

690
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,885
Do you have plans later?

691
00:33:59,057 --> 00:34:01,114
Come with me to distribute red packets.

692
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,920
But Ms. Nan asked me to deliver
the New Year's goods to other stores.

693
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,920
It's fine.

694
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:07,714
Do you drive? I can give you a lift.

695
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,230
I came here in this truck.

696
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,600
If so, you may go.

697
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,760
See you, Mr. Xue.

698
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,110
Drive safe.

699
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,150
All right. Thank you.

700
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,800
Come.

701
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,840
I can do it myself.

702
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,800
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

703
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,560
Careful.

704
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,230
I'm good.

705
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,150
Let's go, sir.

706
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,030
Bye-bye.

707
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,270
Bye-bye.

708
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,030
(BFC)

709
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,560
- Hi, sir. How many of you?
- Hello.

710
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,150
Two, please.

711
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,840
All right. Here is your queue number.

712
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
All right, thank you.

713
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,680
You are welcome.

714
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,840
(Tensai)

715
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,640
Hello, Guo.

716
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,700
Where are you?

717
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,480
I have arrived.

718
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,542
(Tensai)
At the entrance.

719
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,560
Entrance?

720
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,070
I can't see you.

721
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,680
Where are you? Wave your hands.

722
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,190
No. 50.

723
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,880
Do you see me now?

724
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,960
No.

725
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,760
Hengshan Road's Tensai
is inside the mall,

726
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,470
right?

727
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,960
Where?

728
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,070
I... I'm at BFC.

729
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,840
But the one you sent me
is on Hengshan Road.

730
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,500
Why did you go to BFC?

731
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,470
Well, I will come to you.

732
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,270
Wait.

733
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,428
Forget it. Stay there.

734
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,430
I will come to you.

735
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,470
Bye-bye.

736
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,760
So what if you are a member?

737
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,880
It means I don't have to queue,

738
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,150
do you understand?

739
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,480
You have to wait in line even so.

740
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,740
It's all the same in every city.

741
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,470
What's wrong? Let's go inside.

742
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,350
This fellow is making a fuss.

743
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,240
Said I cut the line

744
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,560
and wouldn't let me in.

745
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,470
We don't have to queue.

746
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,430
Everyone is queuing,

747
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,760
why don't you need to queue?

748
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,790
You can ask the staff.

749
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,470
Just ignore him. Let's go.

750
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,270
Stand right there.

751
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,680
Why?

752
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,110
Are you done yet?

753
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,840
I just want things to be fair.

754
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,230
Everyone is queuing.

755
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,430
Why don't you have to?

756
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,800
How could you cut the line?

757
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,880
Mr. Xue?

758
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,600
Xia Guo.

759
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:20,000
What has happened?

760
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,920
He...

761
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,310
This is Mr. Xue of my company.

762
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,560
This is Yu Jian, my boyfriend.

763
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,800
Your boyfriend?

764
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,600
I'm so sorry.

765
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,230
Mr. Xue.

766
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,914
Mister, there is a misunderstanding.

767
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,030
In our restaurant, the east section is
for customers,

768
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,030
while the west section
is only for members.

769
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,600
Mr. Xue is one of our members.

770
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,390
He just needs to
make a call before coming.

771
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,742
No need to wait for a table.

772
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,110
If so,

773
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,840
how can I get your membership?

774
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,110
Well, I'm sorry.

775
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,680
You have to spend a certain amount here,

776
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,228
and also a recommendation
from an existing member to join.

777
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,680
So troublesome.

778
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,470
I'm sorry, Mr. Xue.

779
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,150
It's fine.

780
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,390
You may go.

781
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,180
We know each other.

782
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,040
We'll chat for a bit.

783
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,640
Sure.

784
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
It's all right.

785
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,470
So, this is your boyfriend.

786
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,960
Yes, he just came to Shanghai,

787
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,260
and he is not familiar with here.

788
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm sorry.

789
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,960
It's all right.

790
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,880
Your colleague?

791
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,520
Right.

792
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,590
No wonder I find her face familiar.

793
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,350
We met at the company before.

794
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,420
I'm Xia Guo.

795
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,190
Hello. Just call me Emma.

796
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,960
Hello.

797
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,228
Since it's a misunderstanding,

798
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,760
it's understandable

799
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:25,285
that it's his first time here.
Don't mind it.

800
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,680
We will go inside first.

801
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,960
Sure.

802
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,470
Let's go.

803
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,070
Yam Head,

804
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,800
it suddenly hits me
that another restaurant

805
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,150
is even better than this one.

806
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,430
Let's go there, all right?

807
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,640
Let's go. It's nippy out here.

808
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
Come on. Let's go there.

809
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,060
(Tensai)

810
00:38:00,942 --> 00:38:02,140
Excuse me, here's your chilies.

811
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,800
Thank you.

812
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,030
The beef will be served later.

813
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,640
Please enjoy.

814
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,430
Sure.

815
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,880
Eat up.

816
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,310
I have no appetite.

817
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,110
We are in another restaurant now.

818
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,270
Are you still mad?

819
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,760
Guo.

820
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,430
Did I embarrass you earlier?

821
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,840
No.

822
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,060
Don't overthink.

823
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,514
You were waiting in the cold air.
You must be hungry now.

824
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,600
Hurry and eat.

825
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,800
The food here is delicious.

826
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Try it.

827
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,520
Your general manager

828
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,640
is so arrogant.

829
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,430
That woman

830
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,230
must be the same as him.

831
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,470
You didn't see their attitude

832
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,880
before you arrived.

833
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,390
It was a misunderstanding.

834
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,800
They didn't argue much with you, right?

835
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,030
Mr. Xue may seem a bit stoic,

836
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,190
but he treats the staff quite well.

837
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,430
Why are you taking his side?

838
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,190
I didn't take his side.

839
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,860
I'm just telling the truth.

840
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,820
You can't judge them
over a trivial matter.

841
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,800
You know,

842
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,030
Dr. Jiang from Hospital Ruihua

843
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,350
is a friend of Mr. Xue's.

844
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,000
He introduced the doctor to me

845
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,270
because he knew we needed help.

846
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,800
So, let's be more generous,

847
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,230
all right?

848
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,230
Well, let's eat up.

849
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,430
Try this.

850
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:23,870
How does it taste?

851
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,840
Nice?

852
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,800
Yes, but we waited
for another 40 minutes.

853
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,840
Everyone has to queue
for good restaurants in Shanghai.

854
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,840
Besides, the Chinese New Year
is approaching,

855
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,190
many people choose to dine out.

856
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,920
It's lucky for us to
only wait for half an hour.

857
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,760
They are lots of restaurants like this
in Zhanggong Bridge.

858
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,470
There are all along the entire street,
and no need to queue.

859
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,020
Can it be the same?

860
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,480
The labor and rent here

861
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,070
are much higher than in our hometown.

862
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,880
Besides, the service industry
here is exceptional.

863
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,760
It's not just about eating a meal,

864
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,800
they provide you
with good emotional value.

865
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,150
Guo, you have changed.

866
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,430
How?

867
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,550
Before, you would always drool
when I talked about good food in Leshan.

868
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,680
But now, you think great
of everything in Shanghai.

869
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,430
Waiting in line for a meal,

870
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,760
easy to get lost, and you need to

871
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,270
take a cab
for only five kilometers.

872
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,190
All this hassle

873
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,880
makes you sleep two hours less.

874
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,150
Do you really like all these?

875
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,190
Well, I...

876
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,800
All right,

877
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,800
I know you are angry.

878
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,960
Let me tell you.

879
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,960
When I first came to Shanghai,

880
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,840
I was frustrated.

881
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,310
When I took a cab,

882
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,110
the driver spoke in Shanghainese

883
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,510
and I couldn't understand a word.

884
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,110
In the end,

885
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,560
he took me to a place I didn't know.

886
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:44,230
Besides, the clients embarrassed me,

887
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,942
and my colleagues walked over me.

888
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,350
I'm a foreigner here,
and not familiar with this place.

889
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,680
There used to be lots of trouble.

890
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,390
But what could I do?

891
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,800
Everyone is the same.

892
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,000
We strive to survive every day

893
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,110
and we manage to get through.

894
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,840
Guo,

895
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,640
is this really good for you?

896
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,600
Big cities are complicated.

897
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,520
Aren't you tired of living like this?

898
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,600
I'm living the life myself,

899
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,470
so I have my own judgments and feelings.

900
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,470
Besides, I just received
the Best Employee award.

901
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,190
Don't underestimate me, okay?

902
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,150
I know you are ambitious

903
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,840
and can endure hardships.

904
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,470
But we only live once.

905
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,960
Why stress yourself out?

906
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,230
Do you think

907
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,350
I didn't notice

908
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,960
that you always avoid bad news

909
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,350
when we video-called?

910
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,430
I'm truly worried about you.

911
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,070
Really?

912
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,000
Hurry up and come to Shanghai for me.

913
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,960
With you by my side,

914
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,070
it will be easier for me.

915
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,640
You wanted me to wait for you here.

916
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,457
Are you thinking
of going back on your promise?

917
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,110
Even if I do,

918
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,230
you won't allow that.

919
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,742
Do you really want to back out?

920
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,190
No.

921
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
It hurts.

922
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,190
You are handsome when you smile.

923
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,800
Well.

924
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,110
Shanghai isn't as scary as you imagine.

925
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,230
Besides,

926
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,390
you are smarter and
more capable than me.

927
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,190
You can manage even if anything happens.

928
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,310
Right?

929
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,390
Most importantly,

930
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm here.

931
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
I will always stay with you.

932
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,310
Still mad?

933
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,885
Still pulling the long face?

934
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,350
Let's eat.

935
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,350
Hurry and serve me some duck blood tofu.

936
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,230
Here you go.

937
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,680
Mom, are you at the hospital?

938
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,470
Yu Yan is with you?

939
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,560
Good, I'm relieved then.

940
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,350
Guo is doing quite well.

941
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,560
I'll go back a few days later.

942
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,030
(The anxiety and unease
of our separation)

943
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,680
(makes me be more certain)

944
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,680
(that we love each other.)

945
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,390
(I wish we could strive harder)

946
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,880
(and run towards each other.)
