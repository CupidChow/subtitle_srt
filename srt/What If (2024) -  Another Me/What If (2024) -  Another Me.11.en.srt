(The Hare &amp; The Porcupine)

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,120
Guo.

5
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,359
Time to eat.

6
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,730
Coming.

7
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,880
Mom.

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,290
- What are you looking at?
- Come.

9
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,690
Guo didn't throw up
for the past few days, right?

10
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,159
What's wrong with that?

11
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,879
I was wondering
how it stopped so suddenly.

12
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,000
I even threw up in the delivery room
before I gave birth to you.

13
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,039
Could it be that something's wrong?

14
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
What nonsense are you saying?

15
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,720
Don't jinx it.

16
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,849
Why would something be wrong?

17
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,929
You have no idea.

18
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,879
They're facing tremendous
work pressure now.

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,000
The man's not taking it seriously
even though his wife is pregnant.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,250
It just stopped. Why?

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,360
Mom, the doctor already said

22
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,599
that it's common
no matter if she throws up or not.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,130
There's no need to be alarmed.

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,129
Dad, Mom.

25
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,200
Good morning.

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,129
Guo, come.

27
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,239
Sit down. It's getting cold.

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,200
Morning. Eat up.

29
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,130
We have such
a scrumptious breakfast today.

30
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,320
Have some milk.

31
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,809
Guo,

32
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,450
I have something to discuss with you.

33
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,080
Can you stop putting on makeup

34
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,450
from tomorrow onward?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
It's bad for the child.

36
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,439
Mom,

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,559
my cosmetics are made from
pure plant extracts.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,279
It doesn't contain
any harmful substances. I'll be fine.

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,479
You have no idea whether it's harmful
to the child or not.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,089
You can't just believe
in the advertisements.

41
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,920
Mom!

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,530
These green beans are so delicious.
What's the recipe? Teach me.

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,010
Guo and I are having
a serious conversation here.

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,410
There's lead in cosmetic products.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,969
When your skin breathes...

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,969
The porridge's delicious.

47
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,439
It's cooked to perfection.

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,559
Give me another bowl.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,760
Why are you two being so annoying?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,320
What was I going to say again?

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,039
Guo,

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,450
can you change your jeans

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,740
to something else after breakfast?

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,880
It's too tight.

55
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,730
It'll hurt the child.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,039
Mom,

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,129
our child

58
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,850
is the size of a quail egg now.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,279
The jeans

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,369
won't affect him.

61
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,159
It won't.

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,369
What are you thinking?

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,530
How could it affect the child?

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,640
Wait...

65
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,409
Mom, don't worry.

66
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,920
I'll take good care of myself.

67
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,929
Just listen to me.

68
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,400
Here, have a siew mai.

69
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,209
Eat it while it's hot. Here.

70
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,760
Change into something else later, okay?

71
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,849
Yu Jian,

72
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,449
did you see my shoes?

73
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,679
Why can't I find them anywhere?

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,529
Guo.

75
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,530
Guo, I prepared
a new pair of shoes for you.

76
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,209
It's new.

77
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,170
A brand new pair.

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,009
They're soft and safe to wear.

79
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,170
Try them out.

80
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,170
It's filled with pictures of kids.

81
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,800
Give them a try.

82
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,920
Mom, this is...

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
What's wrong?

84
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,600
What are you looking for?

85
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,170
What is this?

86
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,920
Put on your shoes. We can talk outside.

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,970
Mom, we'll be leaving now.

88
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Mom, we'll be leaving now.

89
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,359
Actually, you guys
don't need to defend me.

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,679
Mom did it for my sake.

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,040
I understand that.

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,240
You guys are making me nervous here.

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,599
What good deeds have I done

94
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,560
in my past life
to get a virtuous wife like you?

95
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,120
Where are you going?
Your bike is over here.

96
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,440
Dear,

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,650
in order to help you
and our baby to avoid bumps,

98
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,290
please sit here.

99
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,040
Where did you get this car?

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,119
The company loaned it to me.

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,569
I needed a car for my projects anyway.

102
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,719
And, you're pregnant too.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,280
It's much more convenient
with a car around.

104
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,730
Your company is so nice to you.

105
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,330
Please.

106
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,850
Alright.

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,039
Your proposal is pretty good.

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,560
Xia Guo, you've adapted
to your new environment pretty quickly.

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Thank you, Ms. Tao.

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,920
It's all thanks to the trust from
superiors and the help of colleagues.

111
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,599
Is your body doing okay?

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,599
Yeah.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,560
Look. I'm doing fine now.

114
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,680
By the way, Ms. Tao,

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,089
I heard that the company

116
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,730
is busy with the proposal for
Xinli Cosmetics' new product launching.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,649
I think it was an urgent task too.

118
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,040
May I give it a try?

119
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
We'll hold a two-day intensive meeting
for this proposal alone.

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
We have to complete
the proposal in three days.

121
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,090
But you're still pregnant.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,530
To be honest with you,

123
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,480
I'm doing it because of the commission.
Being a bit tired is no problem for me.

124
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,329
My employees have always been laid-back.

125
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,529
I never expected to encounter

126
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,650
a hardworking wife like you.

127
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
My family has been experiencing
some financial difficulties.

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,480
I wish to share their burden.

129
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
I understand.

130
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,000
As the saying goes: "While women
are vulnerable, the mother is strong."

131
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,969
However,

132
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,719
the proposal has to be completed
before the deadline.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,530
No problem. I can do it.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,280
If so, you can attend the meeting
with your colleagues.

135
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,090
Thank you, Ms. Tao.

136
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,360
Go now.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,720
(Shuangli Trading Co., Ltd.)
I think the main theme this time

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,769
can highlight the strength

139
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,039
and spirit of women.

140
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,119
Through exploring the narratives

141
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,239
on independence,
perseverance, and confidence,

142
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,170
we can illustrate
the diverse beauty of women.

143
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,210
As for the spokesperson,
I think we should...

144
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,850
Excuse me. Sorry for the interruption.
Someone outside is looking for you.

145
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,530
- Alright. You may leave.
- Please excuse me.

146
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,000
Mom?

147
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,600
Guo.

148
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,210
Mom, what are you doing here?

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,449
You haven't eaten, right?

150
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,000
I brought something nice for you.

151
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,119
Mom, we have a canteen here.

152
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,119
How could the canteen's food
compare to my cooking?

153
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,080
From tomorrow onward,
tell me what you want to eat.

154
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,170
I'll cook for you every day.

155
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,969
Mom, no need for that.

156
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,969
It's inconvenient for you
to travel back and forth.

157
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,479
I'm free at home anyway.

158
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,120
I'll treat this as an exercise.

159
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,359
Let's go and have lunch.

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Where are we having lunch?

161
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,089
Mom, I'll finish what you cooked.

162
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,969
Thank you.

163
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,359
You should head back.

164
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,599
Dad is at home, right?

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,039
I'll leave once you finish your meal.
I'll hold this for you.

166
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,479
Mom, I'm in the middle of a meeting.

167
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,889
I'll have it once the meeting is over.

168
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,800
Look at the time.
Why are you still in a meeting?

169
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,529
Don't they know you're pregnant?

170
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,720
Don't tell me your superiors
don't know that you're pregnant?

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,179
Mom, that's not it. I have to work.

172
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,479
It's working hours.

173
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,879
What work?
You have to eat when it's time to eat.

174
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,449
People get hungry when it's time.
We have to eat when we're hungry.

175
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,449
It's fine if they starve.
They can stand the hunger.

176
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,169
But my grandchild
can't stand the hunger, am I right?

177
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:44,879
Lower your volume.

178
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,199
Guo, why don't you go
and have lunch first?

179
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,809
We'll grab a bite too.

180
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,209
We can resume the meeting later.

181
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:50,969
Hello, ma'am.

182
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,239
I wonder if you're her superior.
Hello, sirs and madams.

183
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,929
It's like this.

184
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,719
Guo is pregnant.

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,849
Please respect

186
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,809
the precious break time

187
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,359
of the pregnant over here.

188
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,639
We should eat during lunch hours

189
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,049
and take breaks during break time.

190
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,999
You mustn't give her too much work.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,689
Okay?

192
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,759
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Mom, stop it. Please stop.

193
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,600
I'll be fine.

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,639
I'm fine. You guys can proceed
with the meeting first.

195
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,089
I'll join you guys soon. Everything's fine.

196
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,929
Alright. You can
go and have lunch first.

197
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,049
- Let's go. Time to eat.
- Mom!

198
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,560
- She already said yes.
- I'll have lunch.

199
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,250
- I'll have it later. Later.
- Enough.

200
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,719
Wait,

201
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,170
did I send the wrong text?

202
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,849
Send it to me again. I'll redo it.

203
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,560
I'll send it to the group right
after I'm done. It'll be quick.

204
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,370
What?

205
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,130
Is the power out?

206
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,329
Xiaoqin,

207
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,689
is the power out?

208
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,289
Or did you not pay the electricity bill?

209
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,449
Mom, what's going on?

210
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,399
Return to your rooms.

211
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,040
The power is out, the whole neighborhood.

212
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,329
One of you is pregnant
while the other is handicapped.

213
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,999
Hurry. Go inside and sleep.

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,289
This won't do.
I haven't finished my work yet.

215
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,239
Guo,

216
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,049
work can never be done.

217
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,569
Look at the time.

218
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,479
Just listen to me.

219
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,089
No. My colleagues
are still waiting for me.

220
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,329
Why not?

221
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,759
The most important thing right now
is the child in your tummy,

222
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,849
you know?

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,969
Hurry and go to sleep.

224
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,250
Just heed my advice.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,890
Stop scrolling your phone, okay?

226
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,720
Come here immediately.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
What's wrong?

228
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,289
Go and ask your mother.

229
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,290
What's wrong with Mom?

230
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,969
She switched off the circuit breaker

231
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,650
because she didn't want me to work.

232
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,519
Dear,

233
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,209
doesn't the laptop

234
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,720
come with a battery?

235
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,840
You can still work
without electricity, right?

236
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,519
It's not like you don't know

237
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,890
how old my laptop is.

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,359
The battery has aged long ago.

239
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,840
It's unusable without electricity.

240
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,040
Now that the power is out,

241
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,720
all of my previous work
have gone down the drain.

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,770
I think

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,560
Mom is just worried about you.

244
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,840
What about this?

245
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,969
Can you resume your work tomorrow?

246
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,130
Yu Jian,

247
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,049
I am firstly an individual
with social attributes and independence.

248
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,639
After that, I'm a pregnant woman.

249
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,490
I have to submit
my PowerPoint slides by tonight.

250
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,560
I'm in a hurry here,
yet your mother is doing this.

251
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,169
Are you coming back or not?

252
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,170
If you're not,
I'm going to expose her myself.

253
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,999
Mom, what are you doing?

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,040
You're back.

255
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,519
Why did you turn it on?

256
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,040
Isn't it better for the power to be out?

257
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,320
You won't be able
to see anything, you know?

258
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,480
Mom, what's the point
in doing this sneakily?

259
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Aren't you afraid
that you might get a electric shock?

260
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,410
I'm doing this to let Guo sleep.

261
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
She's pregnant with your son, you know?

262
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,640
She's working overtime, tiring herself out,
but her child can't take it.

263
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,049
Now that she's asleep,
my mission has been accomplished.

264
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,719
Can't you just talk it over with her

265
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,460
if you don't want her to work at night?

266
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,119
Who said I didn't do so?
But she has to heed my advice.

267
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,599
Don't you know your wife's character?

268
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,089
I'm nice to her usually.

269
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,239
But she is quite strong-minded.

270
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,519
I visited her in the office today.

271
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,200
She didn't wear the shoes
I prepared for her.

272
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,200
Wait.

273
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,130
Mom, you even went to Guo's office?

274
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,689
Mom, what are you doing?

275
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,569
How could you

276
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,370
put your daughter-in-law
under surveillance?

277
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,640
You want her to put on
the shoes you prepared for her?

278
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,560
How can she work in the company
like a regular person, then?

279
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,530
How am I putting her under surveillance?

280
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,320
I did it out of kind intention.
I was worried that she might not eat well.

281
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,119
That's why I made her

282
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,080
something nice and nourishing.

283
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,720
But now, you're blaming me for it?

284
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,519
Mom,

285
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,329
I know you're doing it for our own good.

286
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,219
But youngsters like us
have our own way of life.

287
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,569
It's different from yours.

288
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,849
Guo is an independent individual.

289
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,479
She's not here

290
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,999
to give birth to my offspring.

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,560
Cut the crap.

292
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,719
In my eyes,

293
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,969
Guo is still a child.

294
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,759
Does she know anything
about giving birth and raising a child?

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,239
I'm helping you out of kind intention,

296
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,880
but you only know
how to side with your wife.

297
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,929
Am I your enemy?

298
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,999
I'm your comrade right now.

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
Do you understand?

300
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,250
Alright, my dear comrade,

301
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,599
I'm not trying to side with anyone here.

302
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,840
But can you
please respect science for once?

303
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,209
The doctor already said

304
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,999
the act of childbirth
is a physiological phenomenon,

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,410
not a pathological phenomenon.

306
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,969
Let's not worry too much, okay?

307
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,080
Physiological? Pathological?
What are you talking about?

308
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,290
Better safe than sorry, you know?

309
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,289
Can you please relax?

310
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,530
I can't.

311
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,130
I can't reason with you.

312
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
You should stop.

313
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,960
Here.

314
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,399
Have some cola.

315
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,530
Enjoy it.

316
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,530
It's nice, right?

317
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,440
You didn't argue with Mom, did you?

318
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,800
No, I didn't.

319
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,320
Mom was the one
who had the circuit breaker switched.

320
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,639
I bumped into her.

321
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,920
I criticized her.

322
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,720
I was fierce to you on the phone.

323
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,169
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,440
This wasn't your fault
in the first place.

325
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,410
I already appreciate the fact
that you didn't argue with Mom.

326
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,879
Actually, I know Mom

327
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,490
is doing this for our sake.

328
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,399
I know that.

329
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,849
But I'm just in a hurry here.

330
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,720
It's not like
I'll pull an all-nighter every night.

331
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,969
Besides,

332
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,720
my laptop is indispensable.

333
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,819
Without my laptop,

334
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,500
I can't work.

335
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,040
Indeed.

336
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,479
What about this?

337
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,809
I'll bring Mom here right now.

338
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,849
I'll make her promise you

339
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,329
that she won't affect your work

340
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,000
or put you under
any restraints in the future.

341
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,960
Don't go.

342
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,399
If you go now,

343
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,480
Mom will definitely think
that I'm pulling you to my side.

344
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,920
By then, it'll turn out worse.

345
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,010
You have a point.

346
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,639
I'll take my time to persuade her.

347
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,169
Alright now, I'll stop here.
I have to rush out my PowerPoint slides.

348
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,479
Enough. Go and rest.

349
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,720
I'll do it.

350
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,479
How would you know
how to do my PowerPoint slides?

351
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,400
It's been a long day for you.
You should go to sleep.

352
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,459
I'm energetic

353
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,780
when I see my wife.

354
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,290
Are you done with the script?

355
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,130
It's in this folder.

356
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,290
Here?

357
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,560
Okay.

358
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,809
Leave it to me.

359
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,320
I promise I'll finish it soon.

360
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,600
I want to stay next to you.

361
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,440
Do I put this over here?

362
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,719
Lower.

363
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,010
Lower.

364
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,240
That hurts.
You're abusing your power here.

365
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,359
You won't recover

366
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
unless I put my back into it.

367
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,289
Your meridian is damaged.

368
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,560
There's a knot here.

369
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,040
What about this?

370
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,479
Just leave it.

371
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,089
Okay.

372
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,440
I thought you'd finish it quickly?

373
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,650
I'm doing the next page now.

374
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,089
Guo, come.

375
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,400
This is sea cucumber soup.

376
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,800
Hurry.

377
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,519
Guo,

378
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,929
why don't we have braised meat tonight?

379
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,179
Mom, the doctor already said

380
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,479
that pregnant women
shouldn't take oily food.

381
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,920
We should prepare something
that's high in protein and low in fat.

382
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,519
Yu Jian, sorry for the trouble.

383
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,530
Thank you.

384
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,200
It'll be all done after I update the data.

385
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,689
I wanted to add something
at the last minute,

386
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,720
and you had to come all the way here
this late at night.

387
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm truly sorry for all the trouble.

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,920
You already gave me
the design fee in advance.

389
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,000
It's my duty to complete your requests.

390
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,240
What I did was nothing noteworthy.

391
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,560
Right now, you're experiencing
your most difficult moment.

392
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,280
You have to take care
of your wife, child, and mother.

393
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,570
Those are all your duties.

394
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,810
What's wrong?

395
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
It's nothing.

396
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,890
It's just that
life has been a mess lately

397
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,130
since I open my eyes in the morning.

398
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,050
Early morning,

399
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
my mother would cause a commotion

400
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,249
because of

401
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,650
what Guo

402
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,890
wore to work.

403
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,050
After I send Guo to work,

404
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,330
I have to worry about
whether she feels tired

405
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,280
or unwell.

406
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,959
When I go back home,

407
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,439
my mother would prepare
all kinds of tonics for Guo.

408
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,289
But Guo couldn't finish them.

409
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,410
Just now,

410
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,919
my father and I joined hands

411
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,810
to fend off my mother.

412
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,049
Why does it sound to me

413
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,960
like you're showing off
your loving relationship to me?

414
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,680
A single woman like me

415
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,180
has no chance
to take on such a sweet burden.

416
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,520
Yu Jian,

417
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,890
why don't you take a picture for me?

418
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,919
Right now?

419
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,809
Yeah.

420
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,769
I need to record

421
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,480
the moments we're working together

422
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,370
so that I can post them on my Moments.

423
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,130
- Okay.
- Here.

424
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
One, two, three.

425
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,600
(Ultrasound diagnostic report)
(Name: Xia Guo)

426
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,840
(Yam Head)

427
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,360
(Xia Guo)

428
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,280
Guo,

429
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,599
you're finally on a break.

430
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,280
You should stop working.

431
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,570
Finish the sesame paste while it's hot.

432
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,810
Thank you, Mom.

433
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,170
Mom, look.

434
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,170
Who is that?

435
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,610
Who's there?

436
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,809
Hello.

437
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,410
Is this Yu Jian's home?

438
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,960
Yes.

439
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,159
You are?

440
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,919
I'm Wen Ya, Yu Jian's junior.

441
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,400
He helped me to alter my design last night.
But he forgot to take his tools.

442
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,000
Please come inside.

443
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,399
Guo,

444
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,720
long time no see.

445
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,520
Wen Ya?

446
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,769
Here, have some tea.

447
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,130
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

448
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,119
It's good enough for you to visit us.

449
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,809
You didn't have
to bring all these presents with you.

450
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,809
Yu Jian requires

451
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,329
your support in work too, you know?

452
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,850
Mrs. Yu, you mustn't say that.

453
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,359
Yu Jian is very talented.

454
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,599
It's my pleasure
that he's doing my designs for me.

455
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,620
I spent a lot of effort
to persuade him to help me out.

456
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,639
If so, you can chat with Guo.

457
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,879
I'll go and cut some fruits.

458
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay.

459
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,090
Guo,

460
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,089
I was only able to have this opportunity

461
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,720
all thanks to you
not heading to Shanghai.

462
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,240
You just got pregnant not long ago.
How's your body doing?

463
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,729
I requested my friend

464
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,850
to buy some tonics overseas.

465
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,280
You should have them.

466
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,280
Thank you.

467
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,329
I was busy discussing the design plan
with Yu Jian last night.

468
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,679
He left in a hurry. He forgot to bring
his design plan with him.

469
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,000
I thought that I should visit him.

470
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,119
That's why I came here.

471
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,959
Yeah.

472
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,089
That's how he is sometimes.

473
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,570
He's quite forgetful.

474
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,249
Yu Jian rarely has time
to tend to the house lately

475
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,520
all because of my project.

476
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,840
I have to apologize for that.

477
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
How's the financial condition
of the family?

478
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,330
What do you mean by that?

479
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,720
Guo, please don't misunderstand me.

480
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,440
I know Yu Jian has been slaving away
to support this family.

481
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,089
Please tell me
if you guys are experiencing

482
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,159
any difficulties.

483
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,440
Don't treat me as an outsider.

484
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,680
I'll continue to help you guys out.

485
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,170
Yeah.

486
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,280
Yu Jian does mention you quite often.

487
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,769
He said you helped him out
on numerous occasions.

488
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,920
He was thankful to you.

489
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,049
It's nothing.

490
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,760
I just made an advance payment.

491
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,280
I have to pay Yu Jian eventually anyway.

492
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,769
I'm very happy to help you guys out

493
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,050
in such difficult times.

494
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,959
Advance payment?

495
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,330
What advance payment?

496
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,050
Weren't you thanking me

497
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,289
for the advance payment

498
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,960
I made to Yu Jian?

499
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,920
Sorry about that.
I only found out just now.

500
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
Is that so?

501
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,679
It's fine.

502
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,159
Mainly, I'm very satisfied

503
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,330
with Yu Jian's design.

504
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,159
He's very serious

505
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,240
when it comes to work.

506
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,159
I trust him. If not, I wouldn't have
made an advance payment to him,

507
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,130
don't you think?

508
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,570
Here, have some fruits.

509
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,520
Yu Jian is truly fortunate

510
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,330
to get a client like you.

511
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,809
Sometimes, he's too busy.

512
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,920
That's why there are certain things
he doesn't get to tell us.

513
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,089
Guo and Yu Jian

514
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,249
have been through

515
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,439
many setbacks together.

516
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,050
And now, they have a great relationship.
I'm so envious of them.

517
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,130
Why don't you have dinner with us?

518
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,089
I'll prepare some dishes.

519
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,240
Just ordinary home cooking.

520
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,359
Mrs. Yu, please don't.

521
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,119
I have a dinner appointment.
I won't bother you guys.

522
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,009
That won't do.

523
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,009
You're already here.

524
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,480
Mrs. Yu, maybe next time.

525
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,050
Guo, please take care.

526
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,050
Wen Ya, let's add each other on WeChat.

527
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,009
((Wen Ya's Moments)

528
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,489
(The great designer is great)

529
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,720
(at taking pictures too.)

530
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,440
(A wonderful day.)

531
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,760
Let's go to sleep.

532
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,090
What's the matter?

533
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,650
Are you close to Wen Ya?

534
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,570
Not really.

535
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,330
But she's closer to Yiming.

536
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,720
You should keep the presents
she bought for you.

537
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,890
I'll buy her some gifts in return.

538
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,610
Is she wealthy?

539
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,920
On the day we acquired
our marriage certificates,

540
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,000
everyone sent us red packets.

541
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,679
And, she also made
an advance payment to me

542
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,569
for the project.

543
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,200
Why is she so nice to you?

544
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,959
I'm her designer.

545
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm helping her to design her shop.

546
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,399
And, she's nice to everyone.

547
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,920
She's nice to Yiming too.

548
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,480
Is she so nice to Yiming that she can make
an advance payment to him,

549
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,410
visit his entire family,

550
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,529
and take pictures of her during work?

551
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,160
(Wen Ya: The great designer
is great at taking pictures too.)

552
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,170
Dear, you misunderstood me.

553
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,599
She told me to take that picture

554
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,569
because she wanted to
post something on her Moments.

555
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,960
That's all.

556
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,650
Yes,

557
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,480
we didn't manage to move to Shanghai.

558
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,399
Dad, Mom, me and Yu Yan,

559
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,890
all of us became your burden.

560
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,240
It's tough on you,

561
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,330
yet I couldn't do anything
to help you out.

562
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,850
Luckily, you have Wen Ya.

563
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,280
She can provide you with a job, pay you,

564
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,089
even

565
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,330
be gentle and understanding to you.

566
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,809
I'm so envious that you have

567
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,009
such a great "friend."

568
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,399
Dear,

569
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,650
what are you talking about?

570
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,729
What's with the misunderstanding?

571
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,650
There's nothing between us.

572
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,370
Can't you tell that she fancies you?

573
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,610
Dear,

574
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,050
I know you're emotional
because of the pregnancy.

575
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,769
I'm not emotional.

576
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,170
My emotions are in control.

577
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,399
What do you want me to do

578
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,729
for you to trust me, then?

579
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,399
I don't want

580
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,249
your good friend and client

581
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,679
visit me at home again.

582
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,050
I can't accept it.

583
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,610
Guo.

584
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,809
I have big news.

585
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,000
What is it?

586
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,919
The board of directors will
appoint a returnee

587
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,199
to be head of our department.

588
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,919
I heard that she's been
living in Europe for years.

589
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,280
She's an amazing and independent woman.

590
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,809
So?

591
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,009
Doesn't that mean you won't
get a promotion in the next few years?

592
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,610
I'm worried for your sake.

593
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,440
You're worried for nothing.

594
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,089
It hasn't been one year since
I came Shanghai.

595
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm aware of my abilities.

596
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,050
But you were the hot pick
for promotion before this.

597
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,329
She'll definitely treat you

598
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,050
as her number-one rival.

599
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,130
Girl,

600
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,769
why would a returnee who worked overseas

601
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,050
compete with
a small fry from Leshan like me?

602
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
You're underestimating her.

603
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,200
Why don't you understand
what I'm getting at?

604
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,650
You have no sense of crisis at all.

605
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,569
Lucy,

606
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,170
have you completed
the form I told you to?

607
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,679
Yeah.

608
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,199
I'll send them to you later.

609
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,520
Okay. Hurry.

610
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,760
Morning, Guo.

611
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,520
(To Xue Yuming: A new head
of department is coming.)

612
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,359
(I'll be cooking tonight.)

613
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,199
(What would you like?)

614
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,199
Guo,

615
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
what are you troubled by?

616
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,280
Have you heard?

617
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,529
Someone's joining Mr. Xue's team.

618
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,300
You have to work harder.

619
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,729
I know.

620
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,399
What about this?

621
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
I have plenty of projects.

622
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,680
You can work for me in the future.
What do you think?

623
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,639
No need for that.

624
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,570
Listen to me.

625
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,249
Hey!

626
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,119
My pants!

627
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,130
Sorry about that!

628
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,850
I'll find the janitor.

629
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,329
Hey!

630
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,959
It's my first time wearing this!

631
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,610
It's brand new, you know?

632
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,959
There are all kinds of brands here.

633
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,440
Which one should I pick?

634
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,610
You can try this.

635
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,280
I thought expensive ones were better.

636
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,650
Is this your first time cooking steak?

637
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,130
Yes.

638
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,330
You should use the simplest
condiments for fresh ingredients.

639
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,890
You may give this a try.

640
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,920
Actually, my boyfriend is the one
cooking the steaks before this.

641
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,849
It was delicious.

642
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,359
But I just forgot the kinds of condiments he used.

643
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,330
After hearing that from you,
I think everyone has different preferences.

644
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,679
I don't know if your boyfriend

645
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,130
used this brand before this,

646
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,329
but the taste of a steak

647
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,520
depends on the way you cook it.

648
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,809
Thank you.

649
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,050
Give it a try.

650
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,769
You're back.

651
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,000
You're awake.

652
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,919
You slept like a log.

653
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,439
To think that you said
you were going to cook for me.

654
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,570
You liar.

655
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,890
All done.

656
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,050
The quality of the steak is excellent.

657
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,960
You just need the simplest condiments

658
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,199
for fresh ingredients.

659
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
The condiment you chose
is excellent too.

660
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,410
Where did you go this afternoon?

661
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,049
I didn't see you in the office
this afternoon.

662
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,810
You didn't reply to my text either.

663
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,569
The board of directors
already found someone to replace Chen Nan.

664
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,890
She just came back from France.
I went and picked her up.

665
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,399
Yeah.

666
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,439
Here.

667
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,810
We're finally having
a new leader after so long.

668
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,130
She's just an acting head of department.

669
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,410
Acting head of department?

670
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,769
Isn't she a returnee? Why is she just
an acting head of department?

671
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,040
No matter where she comes from,

672
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,680
she has to pass the test
of our superiors first.

673
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,090
What do you think?

674
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,520
Do you have confidence

675
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,520
in getting along with the new
head of department?

676
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,650
Of course.

677
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,089
I just need

678
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,280
to do my part.

679
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,570
Next time, I must
prepare a steak for you.

680
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
Let me do something innovative.

681
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,720
I'll make steak
with Sichuan peppercorns.

682
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,240
Or steak with
fermented chili bean paste.

683
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,090
Or boiled steak with chili.
What do you think?

684
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,520
I can't take fermented chili bean paste.

685
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,610
I'm allergic to soybeans.

686
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,599
If I take soybeans,

687
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,960
rashes will appear all over my body.

688
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,050
It's that terrifying?

689
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,330
I feel itchy

690
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,050
just thinking about it.

691
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,570
I can't take it.

692
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,680
Doesn't that mean
you'll miss out on various delicacies?

693
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,280
What a shame.

694
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,440
But do you want me
to enjoy them together with you?

695
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,849
If you do,

696
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,130
I can put my allergy medication
on the table

697
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,050
and enjoy the food with you.

698
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,759
For real.

699
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,160
(Unknown number)

700
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,050
I need to answer a call.

701
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,000
This is it.

702
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,280
I was viewing this last night...

703
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,329
Let me introduce her.

704
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,000
This is Ms. Li Qiuman.

705
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,040
She's the acting director
of the Marketing Department.

706
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,809
I hope you guys

707
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,639
can retain
the Marketing Department's efficiency

708
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,199
and professionalism

709
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,330
under Ms. Li's leadership.

710
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,370
Ms. Li, please say something to them.

711
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,089
Hello, everyone. I'm Li Qiuman.

712
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,359
You may call me Yvonne.

713
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,960
I studied in France before this.

714
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,809
I worked in Paris for several years.

715
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,249
I returned to the country

716
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,720
because I think

717
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,599
our country has more space
for development.

718
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,489
I will get along

719
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,240
with you all as soon as possible

720
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
so that I won't let
Mr. Xue or the company down.

721
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,769
(Haowei New Product
Fruit Gummy Marketing Proposal)

722
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,959
The four new types of gummy
launched by the company

723
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,000
will be the Marketing Department's
main focus for the fourth quarter.

724
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,890
Now, let's discuss the marketing proposal.

725
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,439
The board of directors already told me

726
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,729
about the marketing proposal
before I came here.

727
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,890
I made my own version as well.

728
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,009
However, as I didn't have much time,

729
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,959
there might be something lacking.

730
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,440
Please give me your opinions.

731
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,849
Give me a synchronizer.

732
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,920
Thank you.

733
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,849
(Spring In Europe)

734
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,440
Spring In Europe?

735
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,399
That sounds like a Western concept.

736
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,159
The color scheme for the theme
looks classy too.

737
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,769
That's right.

738
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,159
I don't know if you guys
have any ideas about

739
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,569
the spring in Europe.

740
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,610
I think

741
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,289
I can describe it as a chilly spring
with a hint of bitterness.

742
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,130
It's freezingly beautiful.

743
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,049
In order for our customers
to experience that kind of coldness

744
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,410
from our packaging,

745
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,760
I've utilized

746
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,050
nimbus grey,

747
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,170
gilding,

748
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,330
amethyst,

749
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,959
and dark green,

750
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,200
a total of four colors.

751
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,119
These are also the trending colors
for France's fashion industry next year,

752
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,599
Excuse me, I have to interrupt you.

753
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,329
Regarding this proposal,
Xia Guo has already

754
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,679
finished it in advance
together with the Marketing Department.

755
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,130
And, it's already in progress.

756
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,610
Is that so?

757
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,119
That's fine.

758
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,199
We can compare

759
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,890
the two proposals.

760
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,280
Ms. Li, you do live up
to your reputation as a returnee.

761
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,240
Your perspective is fresh,
your positioning is high-end,

762
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,480
and your color scheme is romantic too.

763
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
I love your proposal.

764
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,040
Sorry about this.
I forgot to introduce her.

765
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,000
This is Xia Guo, one of the backbones
of the Marketing Department.

766
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,130
Nice to meet you.

767
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,440
She submitted a proposal before this.

768
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,520
The name of the proposal

769
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,760
was called Spring Morning.

770
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,680
In my opinion, I think both proposals

771
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,000
are unique in their own ways.

772
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,200
Spring In Europe

773
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
targets at a higher-end segment,

774
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,720
while Spring Morning

775
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,009
fits the Chinese traditional culture
thematically.

776
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,720
You may check it out
when you have the chance.

777
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,650
Mr. Xue, since you regard
Xia Guo's proposal highly,

778
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,170
I suggest

779
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,329
we proceed with the refinement

780
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,009
of both proposals.

781
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,879
Once the process is done,

782
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,000
we can hold another meeting.

783
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,439
By then, Mr. Xue
and the company will decide on

784
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,240
which we would choose to adopt

785
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,879
for the new product launch.

786
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,970
Is that okay?

787
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
That's fine.

788
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,329
And, I need some help.

789
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,440
You're head of the department.

790
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,439
You have the right to demand
the help of everyone here.

791
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,130
It's better if it's voluntary.

792
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,840
Please raise your hands
if you're willing to help Ms. Li.

793
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,689
Thank you, everyone.

794
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,090
Thank you for your cooperation.

795
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,809
But when it comes to working together,

796
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,519
I think I'll make a choice

797
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,129
once I'm more familiar

798
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,200
with all of you.

799
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,490
Meeting dismissed.

800
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,930
Jing.

801
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,360
Xia Guo,

802
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,399
I'm not familiar with the company yet.

803
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Can you show me around?

804
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,959
Of course.

805
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,079
Please follow me, Ms. Li.

806
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,320
You can call me Yvonne.

807
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,010
Okay.

808
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,970
This is the office area.

809
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,360
By the way,

810
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,519
did your boyfriend

811
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,130
like the steak you made?

812
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,090
In the end, he cooked it himself.

813
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,570
But he was using the black pepper
you recommended.

814
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,329
He said an excellent steak

815
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,800
doesn't need too much seasoning.

816
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,610
I'm glad to hear that.

817
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,079
Everyone has a different preference.

818
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,399
Even if it's the same person,

819
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,650
their preference might change too,
don't you agree?

820
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,610
But I'm glad that you guys liked it.

821
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,530
By the way, how many years has it been
since you joined the company?

822
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,399
I was working in the Leshan branch
for three years before this.

823
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,650
After that, I was transferred to Shanghai.
It hasn't been a year yet.

824
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,080
If so, you must be quite capable.

825
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,240
I can tell that Mr. Xue
regards you highly.

826
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,130
Mr. Xue loves to encourage
and motivate newcomers.

827
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,720
Just like he always does.

828
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,930
Do you guys know each other before this?

829
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,169
Hello, Migao. What's the matter?

830
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,439
Mom, where are you?

831
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,039
I'm working right now.

832
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,999
Mom,

833
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,649
I don't want to have lunch alone.

834
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,399
Come back quickly.

835
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,490
Didn't we say that the caretaker
would have lunch with you?

836
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,200
I don't want that!
I want you to come back now!

837
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,399
Okay.

838
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,450
Give me a second.

839
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,039
My daughter just returned to the country.

840
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,130
She's not used to the environment here yet.

841
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,400
If so, do you want to head back
and keep her company?

842
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,079
Can I invite you

843
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,650
to come to my house with me?

844
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,090
I'm not familiar with the company

845
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,570
or the Marketing Department yet.

846
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,800
I hope you can talk me through them
as soon as possible.

847
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,970
Sure.

848
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,240
It's right ahead.

849
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,280
Come on in.

850
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,530
Migao, look who's here.

851
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,240
Mom!

852
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,800
Sweetie, what's the matter?

853
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,320
How could you go back on your promise?

854
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,439
You're a bad girl.

855
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,840
Ms. Li, actually,
Migao is quite obedient.

856
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,439
Maybe the dishes I prepared

857
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,010
didn't suit her taste.

858
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,039
Now that we're back in China,

859
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,879
you need to have food prepared the Chinese way.

860
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,729
Understood?

861
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,090
Mommy, I just missed you.

862
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,720
Come.

863
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,479
Hurry and greet her.

864
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,040
Hello, madam.

865
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,399
You should call her miss.

866
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,289
She's Ms. Xia.

867
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,050
Hello, Ms. Xia.

868
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,879
Nice to meet you, Migao.

869
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,010
You're so beautiful.

870
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,729
She's lucky enough

871
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,800
to take after the strengths
of both her parents.

872
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,999
She's a witty girl.

873
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,450
Come. Let's eat.

874
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,930
Come.

875
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,079
Ms. Li,

876
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,130
the dishes are ready.

877
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,640
This is just a regular home-cooked meal.
Please don't stand on ceremony.

878
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,610
By the way, you're from Sichuan, right?
I assume you can take spicy food.

879
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,479
Of course.

880
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,650
I love spicy food.

881
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,840
Do you love spicy food too?

882
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,129
Although I'm not from Sichuan,

883
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,680
I do love spicy food.

884
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,289
If so, I'll give you some

885
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,360
of the fermented chili bean paste
and chili sauce

886
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,130
- when my family sends to me next time.
- No, thanks.

887
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,200
Migao is allergic to soybeans.

888
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,200
She inherited that from her father.

889
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:13,879
Because of them,

890
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,050
we can't use such seasonings
in this household.

891
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,079
Mom,

892
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,689
when will Dad come

893
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,769
and eat with us?

894
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,400
You have to wait until Dad is free.

895
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,439
I don't want that!

896
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,039
Make Dad come back today.

897
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,880
You shouldn't push your luck.

898
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,930
I'm already here
to have lunch with you, you know?

899
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,930
Dad has to finish his work.

900
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,169
No, Mom.

901
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,720
I want Dad.

902
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,200
Mom!

903
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,919
Migao, if you stop trying to be annoying,

904
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,760
I'll discuss it with Dad.

905
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,879
If you want to keep trying that way,
you may go to the side.

906
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm having lunch with Ms. Xia here.

907
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,800
Good girl.

908
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,930
This way, Dad will like you.

909
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,840
Eat up.

910
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,400
You should eat more.

911
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,610
Do you like spicy food that much?

912
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,039
Don't waste food.

913
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,159
Eat up.

914

(Li Qiuman, East China University
of Business and Economics)

916
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,840
Lucy,

917
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,200
Yvonne graduated from East China
University of Business and Economics?

918
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,209
Yeah.

919
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,849
After that, she attended

920
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,360
ENSAD in Paris.

921
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,160
I think Mr. Xue also graduated from

922
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,120
East China University of
Business and Economics as well.

923
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,970
Guo,

924
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,359
since when you became this nosy?

925
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,800
Do you like to ship people too?

926
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,999
That's not it.

927
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,359
There's nothing wrong with that.

928
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,209
I also think that Yvonne and Mr. Xue
suit each other perfectly.

929
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,079
Say, do you think they know each other

930
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,530
before this?

931
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,930
Maybe.

932
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,879
Although we can't tell

933
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,130
from the surface,

934
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,289
that's exactly

935
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,720
where the problem lies.

936
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,720
They just don't want us
to gossip about them.

937
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,360
My eyes are sharp, you know?

938
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,570
Let me observe them for a little longer.

939
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,849
(Li Qiuman, East China University
of Business and Economics)

940
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,050
Firstly, I've already told Amy what to do.

941
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,720
Sorry about that.

942
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,450
Xia Guo, do you need to
use the meeting room?

943
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,920
It's fine. You guys can go ahead.

944
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,040
If so, you guys can come later.

945
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,249
Mr. Xue and I will be done soon.

946
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,129
Give us ten minutes.

947
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,129
No need for that.

948
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,240
You can proceed with this.

949
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,170
You guys can go ahead. We're done here.

950
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,530
Mr. Xue.

951
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,840
You can go ahead, then.

952
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,720

(Sofitel Shanghai Sheshan Oriental)

954
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,329
(A hare once believed that
the quills on a porcupine)

955
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,650
(represented bountiful harvest
and wonderful moments.)

956
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,720
(Thus, she traveled together
with the porcupine,)

957
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,400
(looking forward
to a wonderful future with it.)

958
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,320
(However, a hare is frail.)

959
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,959
(Migao is allergic to soybeans.)

960
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,880
She inherited that from her father.

961
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,919
Because of them,

962
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,809
we can't use such seasonings
in this household.

963
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,809
If I take soybeans,

964
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,610
rashes will appear all over my body.

(No matter how cautious she is,)

966

(she can't defend herself against)

967
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,560
(the quills that the porcupine
hid from her on purpose.)
