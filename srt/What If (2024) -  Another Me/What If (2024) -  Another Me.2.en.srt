(Remain Or Leave)

4
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,000
I never expected
the fall to be that severe.

5
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,710
Old people can't afford to fall.

6
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,900
Once they fall,
all kinds of complications will arise.

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,771
What do you two plan to do?

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,550
Will you be heading to Shanghai first?

9
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,742
I don't think we'll be able to make it.

10
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:16,600
I don't dare to ask them about it too.

11
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
Isn't your flight this Saturday?

12
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,600
Why are you still delaying it?

13
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,400
But how can I tell them
at such a moment?

14
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,520
Tell his sister to
help you guys out for now.

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,710
That won't do.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,080
His sister is in the U.S.

17
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,000
She just got married.

18
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
There's no way she can come back.

19
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,240
Guo,

20
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,280
you must think it through.

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
You must prepare for the worst.

22
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,190
Will you go

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
if Yu Jian isn't going?

24
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,942
(I like how straightforward you are.)

25
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,140
If this choice of yours will make you
lose everything you possess currently,

26
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,428
(will you be able to accept it?)

27
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,240
(I hope to see you in our Shanghai HQ
on the 1st of next month.)

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
I have to tell you this.

29
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,560
You shouldn't jeopardize your career
because of someone else.

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,960
Look at me.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm a great example.

32
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,310
I got married very early.

33
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,310
After that, I was shackled by my family.

34
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,360
My bright future

35
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,190
just passed by right in front of me.

36
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,910
Do you know what's the worst about it?

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,910
No matter how great of a job
you're doing as a daughter-in-law,

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,790
your other half will
always complain about you.

39
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,485
He said I didn't serve his parents well

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,870
or teach our child well.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,520
I wondered if I was
actually that incompetent

42
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,742
and that I couldn't do anything right.

43
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,771
That's why you should listen to me.

44
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,590
When you encounter a situation,
don't think of making compromises first.

45
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,120
No one can fulfill your goals.

46
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,600
You're the only one
who can fulfill your goals.

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,030
You're here.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
How's Mr. Yu doing?

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,942
I'm sure it still hurts, huh?

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,114
He just received a shot.

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,690
He's not complaining about the pain now.

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,480
It's just that he can't move or eat.

53
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,480
He may feel terrible,

54
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,190
but I feel worse looking at him.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,920
Have you eaten?

56
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:31,342
You should have something.

57
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,342
I have no appetite.

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,390
Have you eaten?

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,560
Yeah.

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,750
I had dinner with Ms. Ping.

61
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Good.

62
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,950
Guo, it's been a long day.

63
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,950
Let me send you back.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,270
I'm fine.

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
I won't be working tomorrow.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,190
I've already done my job handover.

67
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,120
Okay.

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,620
(Dear Mr. Yu Jian:)

69
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
(Dear Ms. Xia Guo:)

70
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,057
(Welcome onboard to Flight Shuangliu,
Chengdu, - Hongqiao, Shanghai)

71
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,240
Ms. Ping asked me this today.

72
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,428
She asked me whether
I was still heading to Shanghai or not.

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,390
I said I hadn't
discussed it with you yet.

74
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,870
Look at the state he's in.

75
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,950
I hear that.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,950
It's...

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,830
Guo, you're here, right?

78
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,140
Mr. Yu, are you awake?

79
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,480
It's me.

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Come.

81
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,360
Are you okay?

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,830
How do you feel?

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,070
Today, I feel much better.

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,160
I feel more energetic.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,750
Guo,

86
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,630
I wish to talk to you.

87
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,190
Mr. Yu, what do you wish to say?

88
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,680
Please go ahead. I'm listening.

89
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,750
I'm very happy

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,870
that you're here to visit me.

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,680
It's my duty.

92
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,430
I heard from Jian

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,480
that you were heading to Shanghai.

94
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,310
I don't know

95
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,510
when I'll be able to see you again.

96
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,600
Guo.

97
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,480
Mr. Yu, it won't be long.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,510
I can come back and visit you often.

99
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,240
If you rest and recuperate,

100
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm sure you'll recover soon.

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,750
By then, we can visit
great restaurants together, okay?

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,480
I hope that comes true.

103
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,830
This may sound hilarious,

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,310
but I've never left Sichuan

105
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,600
ever since I was transferred to Leshan

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,600
from Northern China.

107
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,360
Look at the state I'm in.

108
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,480
Forget about leaving Sichuan,

109
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,430
I don't even know if I could

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
stand up and walk again.

111
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,390
Mr. Yu, that won't be.

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,680
I've been thinking about this
for the past few days.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,430
When people grow old,

114
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,560
they have nothing to look forward to.

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,028
I would've taken my own life

116
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,720
had Jian not accompanied me

117
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,160
all this while.

118
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm afraid I can't leave Jian's side.

119
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,820
(Outpatient)

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,070
- You...
- You...

121
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,310
You can go first.

122
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:01,257
Have you contacted our landlord?

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Not yet.

124
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,114
We can talk about it tomorrow.

125
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,630
What's on your mind?

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,830
I want to say

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,720
that if you no longer miss me...

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
What do you mean by that?

129
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,480
You see,

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
if you no longer miss me,

131
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,920
you mustn't pretend to miss me.

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,670
What nonsense are you talking about?

133
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,828
You're letting your imagination run wild
even before you leave the place.

134
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,390
Fine, then.

135
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,550
If so, you must remember that I'm
missing you too when you're missing me.

136
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,270
I'll wonder if you're starving,

137
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,750
if you're exhausted,

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,120
if you slept without taking a bath,

139
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,857
or if you stayed up all night
just to play video games again.

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,870
But who will keep me in check

141
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,600
when you're away?

142
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Guo,

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,670
can you please don't...

144
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,840
What?

145
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,600
Don't...

146
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,790
Why did you stop halfway?

147
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,870
I meant,

148
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,630
can you call me more often

149
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,857
and send me clips
of your daily life over there?

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,150
I know that.

151
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,630
Don't worry.

152
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll call you every day,

153
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,200
okay?

154
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,200
Be a good boy.

155
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,790
Take good care of yourself
on my behalf, you hear me?

156
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,240
Both of us should eat well, work well,

157
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:57,440
and take good care of ourselves.

158
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
Guo, I'm sorry.

159
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,390
I broke my promise.

160
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,000
I can't go to Shanghai with you.

161
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,480
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,630
I understand.

163
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,030
It's fine.

164
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,390
Take good care of your parents.

165
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,080
Right now, they need you more than me.

166
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,790
I'm fine.

167
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,270
I'm truly fine.

(Guo, the entire grade will head to
Shanghai for our summer camp)

186
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,480
during summer break.
Do you wish to join me?

187
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,840
I do wish to join you,

188
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,510
but we aren't in the same grade.

189
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
How can I join you?

190
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,790
I'll discuss it with our teachers.

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,790
I'll tell them...

192
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,428
Your parents went on a business trip.
You're all alone at home.

193
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,960
Will that work?

194
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,600
Don't worry.

195
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,440

200
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,750
Guo, you should go back.

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,440
Spend your days with your mother.

246

324
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Shanghai is very different from Leshan.

325
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,960
You have plenty of things to learn.

326
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,960
You can maintain your curiosity,

327
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,750
but you must learn how
to conceal your flaws.

328
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,480
Understood, Ms. Nan.

329
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,350
I selected you from Leshan personally.

330
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,780
- Hello, Ms. Chen.
- I have great expectations of you.

331
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
However, with your ability, I believe

332
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,057
that you'll adapt
to your surroundings very soon.

333
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,510
Thank you, Ms. Nan. I will do my best.

345
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,070
Okay.

346
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,640
Are you wearing

347
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,200
the factory's uniform?

348
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,110
Aren't we supposed
to wear uniforms to work?

349
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Only those who work in the factory
have to wear uniforms.

350
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
We don't need to
wear any uniform in the HQ.

351
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,400
Is that so?

352
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,160
I'll remove it, then.

353
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,000
Dear, let me ask you something.

354
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,750
Did you know Ms. Chen before this?

355
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,750
Nope. I met her
for the first time in Leshan.

356
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,114
What's the matter?

357
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,600
It's nothing.

358
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,030
In the future,

359
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
I'll be your meal buddy.

360
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,920
You can chat with me often.

361
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,350
I love Sichuan cuisine too.

362
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,110
Really?

363
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:54,350
Sure. I'll recommend
delicious Sichuan cuisine to you.

364
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960

Are you the newcomer?

366
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,110
That's right.

367
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,870

368
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Leshan, Sichuan.

369
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,750
My name is Xia Guo.

370
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,720
You're from Sichuan?

371
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,160
No wonder you look so cute.

372
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:09,142
Are you from Sichuan as well?

373
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,790
Nope.

374
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,640
However, I do like Sichuan girls.

375
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Larry, that's enough.

376
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,520
The morning meeting
will start soon. Let's hurry.

377
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,740
Larry, it's meeting time.

378
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,320
Let's attend the meeting first.

379
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,310
- Larry.
- Let's go.

380
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,790
- Hello, Mr. Xue.
- Hello, Mr. Xue.

381
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,270
I won't beat around the bush.

382
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,590
Let's compare this year's graph
to last year's graph.

383
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,400
Last year, at least we had

384
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,550
a beautiful revenue curve.

385
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,030
Look at this year's graph.

386
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:26,310
Mr. Xue, the Marketing Department
already did everything we could.

387
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,070
- But compared to last year,
- Revenue.

388
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,830
there's only a 2% growth for now.

389
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,400
This is the fourth quarter

390
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,190
with both major
and minor sections combined.

391
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,750
Judging from our speed of growth,

392
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,750
I'm afraid we'll lose the title
of the number one business in Shanghai.

393
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,400
And, I assume you know
the consequences better than me.

394
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,070
Mr. Xue.

395
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,990
(I never expected to see
the legendary Mr. Xue)

396
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,680
(Xia Guo)
(on my first day of work.)

397
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:51,580
(To Ms. Ping)
(He's lecturing us right now.)

398
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,310
(The atmosphere is quite tense.)

399
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,870
If we can't exceed last month's growth,

400
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,510
we will...

401
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:59,030
You should give everyone your salary
and yearly bonuses for Chinese New Year.

402
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,920
If not, we won't have any bonuses.

403
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:02,740
We can't afford
the flight tickets back home.

404
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,350
Yeah, we can't afford them.

405
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,600
The Sales Department
is in charge of generating revenue.

406
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:19,257
The Marketing Department
is in charge of supporting them.

407
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,114
I read the data for the past two months.

408
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,720
Ms. Chen, it seemed like you were
acting conservatively.

409
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,310
You focused on live-stream e-commerce
that featured influencers.

410
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,720
Mr. Xue,

411
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,160
our rival, Shike Corporation,

412
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:34,371
launched a new product
at the end of last quarter.

413
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,350
It did impact our
market share in the market.

414
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
However, the Marketing Department
stood firm,

415
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,160
withstood the pressure,

416
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:44,160
and didn't let our rival
gain any advantage.

417
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,920
As for the live-stream e-commerce
you mentioned,

418
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,750
I assume there's no need
to discuss the issue here.

419
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,590
After all, both you
and the board of directors

420
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,885
already knew about that long ago.

421
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,270
To be concise,

422
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,270
the Marketing Department

423
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,550
hasn't done anything as of yet.

424
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,960
You understand my principles.

425
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,771
If you stay in the same spot,
that means you're deteriorating.

426
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,450
We'll have new marketing approaches
in the second half of the year.

427
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,920
We will go all out
when it's time for us to act.

428
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,000
As long as the Sales Department and
the Marketing Department can cooperate,

429
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:18,800
I believe that everyone
will get a piece of the pie.

430
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:29,342
Is that a newcomer
of the Marketing Department?

431
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:31,942
This new colleague of ours
is called Xia Guo.

432
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,920
I recruited her from Leshan.

433
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,640
Hello, Mr. Xue.

434
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,400
Hello, everyone. I'm Xia Guo.

435
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:41,400
Please take good care of me
in the future.

436
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,160
Ms. Chen, seems like
you're up to something massive

437
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,685
now that you're recruiting fresh blood.

438
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,860
I recruited Xia Guo

439
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,550
because she's very familiar

440
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,800
with the southwest region,

441
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,550
especially when it comes to logistics.

442
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,628
Our main focus for this year
is live-stream e-commerce.

443
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,440
For online sales,

444
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
logistics are paramount
in the later stages.

445
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,680
Ms. Chen, I'm looking forward
to your results.

446
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,550
Guys, let's get to work.

447
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,590
Do a good job with your tasks.

448
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,830
Lucy, head to the warehouse
with your team

449
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,400
- and do an inventory count.
- Okay.

450
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,510
Coco, go and reconfirm
the live-stream procedures

451
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,000
- with Xiao Jie and the rest.
- Okay.

452
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,200
Larry, your team must
develop several more

453
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,428
channels for the live stream.

454
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,350
Get to work.

455
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

456
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,640
Xia Guo.

457
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,310
Wait here.

458
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,510
I believe that you could tell

459
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:44,200
Mr. Xue wasn't really convinced

460
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,110
with my online sales strategy

461
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,680
after that meeting earlier.

462
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,270
However, I believe that
this will be a major trend.

463
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,590
We have to dominate the market.

464
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,720
Okay, Ms. Nan.

465
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,371
I'll definitely do my best.

466
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,270
I need you to summarize the details

467
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,920
of all
the e-commerce influencers for me.

468
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:01,628
I'll send you the name list later.

469
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,350
Okay.

470
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,310
And, you should join me

471
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,240
for the luncheon with Xiao Jie.

472
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,550
Besides that,

473
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,070
head to the warehouse
after the luncheon.

474
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,200
Learn the distributing processes here
as soon as possible, understood?

475
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,880
Understood.

476
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:14,828
You can do it.

477
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,480
Okay.

Hello, miss.

489
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,110
Do you require any services?

490
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,070
I sprained my ankle.

491
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,314
I wish to get a massage.

Nope.

If so, this must be
your first time here.

495
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,880
That's right.

496
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:38,820
Coincidentally,
we're doing a promotion today.

498
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,680
Really?

499
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah.

500
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,640
You came at a great timing.
Please come inside.

501
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,960
Thank you.

502
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:50,960
Thank you.

503
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,750
Don't mention it.

504
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,920
4,800 yuan!

505
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,590
I spent 4,800 yuan

506
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,880
on a stupid membership card!

507
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,880
Have I lost my mind?

508
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,640
I could've received it for free.

509
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,920
But I just had to
spend 4,800 yuan on it.

510
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,110
I don't know what to say about myself.

511
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,400
Guo, you've been talking about this
for the past 20 minutes.

512
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,640
I feel sorry for the money I've wasted.

513
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,630
It's because that madam was
too good at promoting their services.

514
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,310
She told me about
all kinds of discounts.

515
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:20,350
When I calculated them,

516
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,260
it was nearly
the same price as the one-time service

517
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,070
we pay for in our hometown.
It was worth it.

518
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,485
But the more I thought about it,
the stranger it got.

519
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,920
80 massage sessions!

520
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,790
How could I use up
all 80 massage sessions?

521
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,028
I truly don't know
what to say about myself.

522
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,630
Guo, you always compare the prices
before you do anything in Leshan.

523
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,480
Why were you deceived and taken
advantage of when you're in Shanghai?

524
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,480
You can't just say that I was deceived.

525
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,440
Did you know something?

526
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,560
That madam even
gave me this essential oil.

527
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,900
She said she only gifted it to me alone.

528
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,590
At most, I'm just consuming in advance.

529
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,314
Isn't that the same as being deceived?

530
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:55,085
Your effort and request aren't
directly proportional to each other.

531
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,400
At most, I'll use up
all 80 massage sessions.

532
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,550
I'll use up all of it.

533
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,420
Are you angry?

534
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,571
You keep criticizing me

535
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,790
Since when did I criticize you?

536
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:06,780
I'm just analyzing
the situation on your behalf

537
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,920
so that you won't commit
the same mistake again.

538
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:11,000
Fine. You're ignoring me

539
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,857
I'll ignore you too.

540
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,200
Who's there?

541
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,771
Your food delivery is here.

542
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:19,920
I didn't order anything though.

543
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,480
Did you order this?

544
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,960
Are you appeased now?

545
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,030
How dare you pull such tricks?

546
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,400
This shop is hard to order from.

547
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,914
I couldn't order from them before this.

548
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:35,830
How did you do it?

549
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,780
I hired a delivery rider and paid him
extra to deliver the food to you.

550
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,790
You must pay him a lot.

551
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,510
There's no need to save up
this kind of money.

552
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:45,000
After all, your craving is
more important than anything else.

553
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,857
Tell me if you crave anything
in the future. I'll mail them to you.

554
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,590
I'm craving you.

555
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,340
Isn't our video call enough?

556
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:54,210
If so, I have no choice but to fly
to your side as soon as possible.

557
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:55,257
I'll wait for you, then.

558
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,750
You're the best.

559
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,400
Were you on the phone
with Xia Guo again?

560
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,580
It's been a long day.
How can your body stand this?

561
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,960
Mom, you scared me.

562
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm not exhausted. It's fine.

563
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:09,771
What do you mean by you're fine?

564
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,760
Is she still pestering you now?

565
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Listen, you shouldn't
keep in touch with her.

566
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:20,571
She's my girlfriend.
Why shouldn't I keep in touch with her?

567
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,030
Girlfriend?

568
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,400
Don't be angry at me for saying this.

569
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,670
But you spoiled her.

570
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,714
She's not taking you seriously at all.

571
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,060
When your father was hospitalized,

572
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,140
I thought she could delay
her transfer to Shanghai.

573
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:34,285
But she abandoned you
and left the place.

574
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,230
Wait.

575
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,030
What do you mean by that?

576
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,440
I'll take care of my own father.

577
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,914
She doesn't have
the obligation to stay.

578
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,550
Yu Jian,

579
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,190
I'm sure you know

580
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,320
how your father and I
treated Xia Guo all these years.

581
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,200
We treated her like our daughter.

582
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,150
But she left us without saying a word.

583
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,100
How can you marry her when
she's not sharing your woes with you?

584
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,660
Just like her mom!

585
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,670
That's enough.

586
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,920
Alright, I got it.

587
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,800
You should go home.

588
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:57,371
I'm here to replace your shift.

589
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,000
You pulled an all-nighter last night
and you worked today.

590
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,285
You should head back and sleep.

591
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,885
Alright, I'll keep my phone switched on.
Call me if you need anything.

592
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,320
By the way, I think Ms. Liu

593
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,428
looks like a nice girl.

594
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,630
She's not married yet.

595
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,914
Why don't you add her on WeChat?

596
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,840
Mom, since when did you
get a hobby like this?

597
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800
You're so annoying.

598
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,270
You'll regret it if you don't
listen to elderly people.

599
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,150
Stop nagging me.

600
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,060
Just listen to me. Buy some fruits
and deliver them to her tomorrow.

601
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,840
You're so annoying.

602
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,510
That hurts!

603
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,440
Xia Guo,

604
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,320
did you bring this chili sauce here?

605
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,240
It's so delicious.

606
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Let me take a picture.

607
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,880
I'll see if I can buy it later.

608
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:41,100
You don't need to buy it.

609
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,428
I have plenty of them.
You can have as much as you like.

610
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:45,800
I don't think that's appropriate,
you know?

611
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,950
I'll search for it first.

612
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,057
If I can't find it,
I'll come and sponge off you.

613
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,270
Don't stand on ceremony.
You can have it all you like.

614
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,960
Xia Guo, you're so nice.

615
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,630
What is this?

616
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,760
Chili sauce?

617
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,914
Whose chili sauce is this?

618
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,000
It's Guo's.

619
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,400
I'm taking its picture.
Can you return it to me?

620
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,670
You want it back?

621
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,920
Be nice to me, then.

622
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Larry.

623
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,800
I can't hear you.

624
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,000
Larry,

625
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,880
can you return my chili sauce to me?

626
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,440
Here you go.

627
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,030
I'll stop teasing you.

628
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,630
Your hand is so hot.

629
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:29,685
Don't you think my hands are cold?

630
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,230
Aren't they cold?

631
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,670
Guo, the company's heater
is working as intended,

632
00:36:40,371 --> 00:36:41,800
yet you're wearing a sweater.

633
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,320
It's a turtleneck sweater as well.

634
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,190
Aren't you hot?

635
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,480
Nope, not at all.

636
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,590
I'm afraid of the cold.

637
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:48,285
You're afraid of the cold?

638
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,480
Look at our company.

639
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:52,828
There are plenty of ladies here.

640
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,920
Everyone is trying
to outdress one another.

641
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,360
Look at you.

642
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,000
If you're wearing this, it's obvious

643
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,060
that you're missing out
on all of the opportunities.

644
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,070
The thing is,

645
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,710
you have a hot figure as well.

646
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,800
Guo, are you done with lunch?

647
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,285
Don't you remember
that we have something important to do?

648
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,280
Let's hurry.

649
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:13,920
- That's right.
- Larry, I'm sorry.

650
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,110
We'll make a move first. Bye.

651
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,030
What's so important?

652
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,570
What did you guys have for lunch?

653
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,420
(Haowei Food Group)

654
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,320
How do you feel
after joining our company?

655
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,880
It's great.

656
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,960
I feel like everyone here

657
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,857
is in high spirits,
energetic, and peaceful.

658
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,230
Oh my goodness.

659
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,880
I never expected someone

660
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,440
outside of the HR Department

661
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,760
to say something like that.

662
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,360
Is that so?

663
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,230
This is unbelievable.

664
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,342
You know that our company adopts
a last-place elimination system, right?

665
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,110
Yeah.

666
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,070
We have a group-wide
performance assessment.

667
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't think our branch
in Shanghai will face the axe.

668
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,510
No matter how good our performances are,

669
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,000
Mr. Xue will hold
a one-to-one conversation

670
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,710
with the worst-performing employee.

671
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,510
One-to-one, you know?

672
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,800
All those who were involved

673
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,960
all resigned from their posts
without any exception.

674
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,840
And, he has a crazy request too.

675
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,542
You have to clean up your desk and leave
before working hours too.

676
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm sorry. This is yours, right?

677
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Throw it away for me.

678
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,742
(Marketing Department, Rebecca)
Why do you have Rebecca's employee ID?

679
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,000
I bumped into her this morning.

680
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,960
She's the sacrificial lamb of the
last-place elimination system.

681
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:41,360
But do employees like me
who were just transferred here

682
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,920
have to participate
in the annual assessment too?

683
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,800
Mr. Xue doesn't care

684
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,400
whether you're a newcomer or not.

685
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,190
And, laying off newcomers

686
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,320
costs the company the least.

687
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,440
Let's take Angela and Orlando

688
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,200
from the Sales Department
as our examples.

689
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,710
The company spent a lot of money

690
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,550
for them to attend
the Haijiang Elite Course.

691
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,800
Laying them off will be
a huge loss for the company.

692
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,960
Lucy, what kind of individuals

693
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
are eligible for such courses?

694
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,070
You can attend it too

695
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,500
if you fork out the money yourself.

696
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,710
However, it's too expensive.

697
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,230
Ordinary people can't afford it.

698
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,880
I suggest you try your best
to hit your KPI.

699
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,800
If not, not only will you not get

700
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,150
to attend the course in Haijiang,

701
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,510
but you'll also get the sack.

702
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,670
Is Mr. Xue that terrifying?

703
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,440
Seems like you failed to read the air

704
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,480
in the company

705
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,070
during your first day of work.

706
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,190
Moreover,
you came together with Ms. Chen.

707
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,630
That's not an advantage.

708
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,742
It might cause you
to have a high goal to achieve.

709
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,760
Doesn't that mean
our department is quite dangerous?

710
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,714
You finally
understood the situation, huh?

711
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,800
Excuse me. Is Mr. Xue around?

712
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
Emma, I found last year's quotation.

713
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,920
And...

714
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,150
I...

715
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:00,800
Do you need anything?

716
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,485
Mr. Xue, I'm Xia Guo
from the Marketing Department.

717
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,628
- Ms. Chen wants me to...
- I know. Speak.

718
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,314
Ms. Chen wants me to deliver this to you
so that you can sign it.

719
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,000
Put it on my desk.

720
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:13,285
I compared this year's quotation
with last year's.

721
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,380
After that, you...

722
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,800
Do you need anything else?

723
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,670
As I need to hurry to the studio,

724
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,342
I have to bring back the signed document
as soon as possible.

725
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,490
You have to bring it back
as soon as possible.

726
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,960
However, I need to review it seriously.

727
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,190
What should we do, then?

728
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,230
You're right.

729
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,000
I'll head out first, then.

730
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,630
I think it's a little different...

731
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,230
Sorry.

732
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,220
- Mr. Xue.
- Last year...

733
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,230
May I know when's the best time for me

734
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,771
to come and retrieve the document?

735
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,760
I'll review it as soon as possible
and hand it

736
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,400
to Ms. Chen myself, okay?

737
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,400
You can proceed with your work now.

738
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,190
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

739
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,285
No, I have to thank you.

740
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,840
- Sorry.
- You don't need to review this.

741
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,480
No.

742
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,840
Did you consider
the previous project I mentioned?

743
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,590
May we have a chat?

744
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,960
Guys,

745
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,800
please follow our page.

746
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,340
It's Link No. 35.

747
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,280
Link No. 35.

748
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,510
Place your order immediately.

749
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
Buy your kitchen utensils
and get three items for free!

750
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,910
(This is delicious!)
That's right. Three items for free.

751
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,371
Place your order if you like them.

752
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,280
It's sold out.

753
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:19,280
It's already sold out.

754
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,320
Three, two, one, the link is closed.

755
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,760
It's selling like hotcakes, huh?

756
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,400
The next item.

757
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,480
Only 2,000 of them, but we

758
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,940
have to stay the entire afternoon.

759
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,480
Xiao Jie placed
our products at the back.

760
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,000
That means our products are popular.

761
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
Even so, it doesn't amount to much.

762
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,190
Yesterday, during my live stream,

763
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,630
I had a slice of cake unintentionally.

764
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,020
- Our turn.
- Everyone was asking me

765
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,550
where I bought the cake from.

766
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,440
Today, I'll give you guys
the answer you want.

767
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,400
(Is this cake delicious?)
This is the keto cake,

768
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,360
(Super delicious!)
a product launched by Haowei Food Group.

769
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,710
This cake is made
with plant-based sweeteners.

770
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,900
It's perfect for girls
who are cutting back on sugar.

771
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,630
Right now,
we have 2,000 of them in stock.

772
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,960
Only 2,000 of them.

773
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
Post the link.

774
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,150
It's gone.

775
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,400
(I'm ready! Press the link!)

776
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,110
It's gone.

777
00:41:58,228 --> 00:41:59,320
It sold out in a second.

778
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,880
You see? Waiting here was worth it.

779
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,920
I never expected

780
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,480
this cake to be this popular
on our page.

781
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,440
What? You want more?

782
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400
I'll see if I can request
additional stocks for you guys.

783
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:12,457
Can we get more of your products?

784
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:17,060
Xia Guo, add another 8,000 of them.

785
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,400
Don't panic if you fail to buy it.

786
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Let me ask Ms. Chen.

787
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,910
No need.
We're running out of time.

788
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,620
We have to strike while the iron is hot.

789
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,670
Even so, I can't make
the call here. I'll be quick.

790
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,110
Look at the order quantity of this cake.

791
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,230
Guys, don't be impatient.

792
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,760
Dear, you guys
must be quicker next time, okay?

793
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,670
(Hello. The number you have dialed
is unavailable.)

794
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,171
We'll add another 8,000 cakes.

795
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay.

796
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,320
Great news!

797
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,710
Haowei Food Group has decided

798
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,550
to sell an additional 8,000 cakes.

799
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,480
My dear...

800
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,880
How could you add to the order?

801
00:42:47,428 --> 00:42:48,860
How could you touch my computer?

802
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,320
It will improve our sales performance.

803
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,109
We must seize it!

804
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,880
The opportunity will be gone
if we consult them.

805
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,510
Even so,
we have to follow the procedures.

806
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,840
And, how would you know
if our warehouse has any ready stocks?

807
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,400
This is the item promotional season.

808
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,690
What if we have no ready stocks?

809
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,760
I just know that we have to be flexible.

810
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,000
Whether we have any stocks or not
is none of our business.

811
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,310
I'm from the Sales Department.
Making sales is our priority.

812
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,190
Besides, we'll benefit

813
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,070
from the improved sales performance too.

814
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:11,510
Just wait and claim credit.

815
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,630
This is such a huge mess.

816
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,800
How can I resolve this?

817
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,510
Do you know the consequences

818
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,680
of making such a fatal mistake
during the live stream?

819
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,580
The warehouse is unable
to distribute the goods.

820
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,371
And, our offline sales
were affected too.

821
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,000
As the leader
of the Marketing Department,

822
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,714
don't you even have a contingency plan?

823
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:34,320
Mr. Xue, I think I remember
that our group has never designated

824
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:38,142
the maximum quantity limits
for different sales channels, right?

825
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,670
Our live-stream e-commerce
is making money for the company too.

826
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,590
Is it wrong with that?

827
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:43,670
Do you think you're in the right here?

828
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:46,171
You think you don't
take any responsibility at all?

829
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,920
Do you know what's the function
of the Marketing Department?

830
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,630
Rules are meant to be broken.

831
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The era has always
been progressing and evolving.

832
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,280
Why must we cling
to those rigid rules?

833
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,800
Are you lecturing me right now?

834
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,840
I dare not do so.

835
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,670
Mr. Xue, in my opinion,

836
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,440
as the GM of Haowei Food Group,

837
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,710
shouldn't you support and promote

838
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,828
more cooperation with
our live stream e-commerce?

839
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,550
If we don't dominate
the live stream e-commerce market,

840
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,440
our competitors will
dominate them eventually.

841
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:15,457
Moreover, the company only looks at
the total sales volume in the end.

842
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,360
Chen Nan, listen up.

843
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,230
Any decision made in the company
must be followed by standard procedures.

844
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,920
As the GM of this company,

845
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,960
I won't allow anyone to break this rule.

846
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,150
Do you hear me?

847
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,257
Regarding
the live stream incident yesterday,

848
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,800
I've already discussed it with Ms. Chen.

849
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,480
Take disciplinary actions
against you alone.

850
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,657
We'll deduct 3,000 yuan
from your monthly wage.
