(B2 Parking Lot)

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
Yu Jian?

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,680
Why are you here?

7
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,850
Haven't I told you before?

8
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,250
To Shanghai for an exhibition.

9
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,330
Today?

10
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,250
That's right.

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,040
Are you taking Flight CA4591 as well?

12
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,250
Yeah.

13
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,040
What a coincidence. The same flight.

14
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,970
Let's go.

15
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,520
Hello?

16
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,560
Hello.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
Are you Mr. Yu Jian?

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,250
I am.

19
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm from Xiaojiang police station.

20
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,560
We're investigating a fraud case.

21
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,970
Your mother, Zhang Xiaoqin,

22
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,970
fainted all of a sudden when she

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,970
was cooperating.

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,080
She fainted?

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Is my mother okay?

26
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,640
She's fine.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,250
We hope that you can come here

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
because we need to ask you something.

29
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,040
But I'm in Chengdu now.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,730
It might take some time.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,560
Okay.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,770
Okay.

33
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,450
I can't go.

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,600
Leshan's police told me to head back.

35
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,290
They said my mother was scammed.

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,680
How could that happen?

37
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,370
What about your girlfriend's birthday?

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,080
I can only explain to her
on my way back.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
What about your cake then?

40
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,680
Birthday comes once a year.

41
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,640
It'd be a pity if you don't
give it to her.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,930
What about this?

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,330
I can take it to her for you.

44
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:11,770
But...

45
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,730
It's nothing.
I'm just lifting a finger here.

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,330
Since she can't see you,

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
at least

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
she'll feel better

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,890
when she sees the cake you bought.

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,200
Don't worry. Just give it to me.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,680
Alright, then.

52
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,680
I'll send the address to you later.

53
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,730
Thank you.

54
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,520
Go now.

55
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,600
Okay.

56
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,640
Take care.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,330
Okay.

58
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,480
Call me if you need anything.

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,120
Guo,

60
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,410
something cropped up at home.

61
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,370
I need to rush home now.

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,520
I can't go to Shanghai now.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,640
Did you know your mother

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,330
participated in a P2P lending scheme?

65
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,120
(Police)
The victims of such schemes

66
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
are usually elderly people.

67
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,970
This suspect

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
had worked

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,640
for a proper investment platform before.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,080
After he left the company,
he established

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,040
a fake branch.

72
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,730
He even rented an office building

73
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,770
to be his office.

74
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,970
Your mother visited the place before.

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,600
That's why she fell into his scheme.

76
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,200
She also told her friends to invest in it.

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,770
Sir,

78
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,250
how much money

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,520
was my mother scammed of?

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,370
It's 400,000 yuan.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,520
Her friends' loss included.

82
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,080
That much?

83
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,640
Because your mother

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
was brought here to report by someone.

85
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,520
We even suspected

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,410
that she may had inadvertently

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,850
facilitated the fundraising
for the scammers.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,890
But...

89
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,480
She fainted after hearing that.

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,730
But after our inquiry

91
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,290
and comparison
of her friends' statements,

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,970
the suspicion against her
has been largely ruled out.

93
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,560
She's just a normal victim.

94
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,480
Sir,

95
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,250
if so, is it still possible

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,290
to get back the money?

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,370
This suspect

98
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,850
roams around Jiangsu-Zhejiang region.

99
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,480
We're still trying to arrest him.

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,810
The economic investigation team

101
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,600
is trying to freeze
all the accounts found.

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,370
However,

103
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,370
we cannot guarantee
how much of the money

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,330
we can get back.

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,160
Are you saying

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,450
that we might not get it back?

107
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,850
There's such a possibility.

108
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,410
Don't be too dejected.

109
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,560
We'll do our best to get back the money.

110
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,680
Yu Jian already told you, right?

111
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,450
He went back to Leshan
due to an emergency.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,370
And I was coming to Shanghai.

113
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,560
So I came here for him.

114
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,850
Happy birthday.

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,890
Thank you.

116
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,290
Do you need anything else?

117
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,810
Seems like you're not very interested
in the cake

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
your boyfriend bought for you.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
That's none of your business.

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,460
The Xia Guo I heard from him

121
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,780
was a friendly

122
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,410
and sensible girl.

123
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,600
It depends on who I'm dealing with,

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,560
don't you think so?

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,850
Do you know

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,730
that Yu Jian is helping me
design my florist?

127
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,370
He's truly a talented,

128
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,250
interesting, and thoughtful guy.

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
Yu Jian told me

130
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,250
that he could come here

131
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,330
to be with you after this.

132
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
What do you want to say?

133
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,080
Yu Jian told me that he'd come

134
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,040
to celebrate your birthday last week.

135
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,370
But unfortunately,

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,200
something unexpected cropped up.

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
I can understand
why you're in a bad mood.

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,890
But I brought this cake to you

139
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,600
on his behalf out of kind intention.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,250
And you're showing me disdain.

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
I cannot understand that.

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
Can you stop calling him Yu Jian

143
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
in front of me?

144
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,560
So, you were angry because of that?

145
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Sorry about that.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,250
I've been calling him that
since I knew him.

147
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,200
I'm used to it.

148
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,520
His family is in trouble.

149
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,680
You're in Shanghai.

150
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
You can't share his burden first.

151
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
I assume you feel helpless.

152
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,290
Ms. Wen,

153
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,520
your speculation is uncalled for.

154
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,520
He truly misses you.

155
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,120
But you?

156
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,120
You have no interest
in the cake he bought.

157
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
And, you're being mean
to the cake deliverer too.

158
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,040
Are you going too far?

159
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,940
You can leave if you think so.

160
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
You didn't need to come in.

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm not done yet.

162
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,480
Affinity is something

163
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,970
that we can only encounter by chance.

164
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,810
If I were you,

165
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,040
I would never give up on Yu Jian.

166
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,890
Then I have to give up on Shanghai.

167
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,810
What do you think?

168
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
It's a shame that you're not me.

169
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,970
I won't give up on either Shanghai

170
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,290
or Yu Jian.

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,450
I know him very well.

172
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,520
We are of the same kind.

173
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,770
We have the same belief.

174
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,560
And,

175
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,450
our relationship has lasted
for over 20 years.

176
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,890
Not just any Tom, Dick, or Harry

177
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,410
can meddle with our relationship.

178
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Where did you get your confidence from?

179
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,160
Of course, you don't understand.

180
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:06,890
Of course,

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,160
love is something we have to strive for.

182
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,850
If you think you're good enough,

183
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,520
you can give it a try.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,450
I don't need you to teach me that.

185
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,770
Anyway, I can approach

186
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,850
or leave him with ease.

187
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,490
But it's different for you.

188
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,490
You don't have any freedom.

189
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,120
Thank you. Goodbye.

190
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
There's one more thing.

191
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,440
Like it or not,

192
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,160
Xia Guo,

193
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,490
has it never occurred to you
that a breakup might happen

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,930
when you chose to leave Leshan?

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,280
Happy birthday.

196
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,530
(His family is in trouble.)

197
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,770
(You're in Shanghai.)

198
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,160
(You can't share his burden first.)

199
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,930
(I assume you feel helpless.)

200
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,970
His mother

201
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,930
was involved in a fraud.

202
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,930
He was panicking.

203
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,120
Even so, he was thinking

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,080
about how to deliver the cake to you.

205
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,570
He misses you all the time.

206
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,080
But what about you?

207
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,940
(Xue Yuming)

208
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,100
(Xue Yuming ￥666.00 Happy birthday)

209
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,380
(Yam Head)

210
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,770
Mom,

211
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
you haven't eaten the whole day.

212
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,770
You should eat something.

213
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
Don't starve yourself.

214
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,160
Enough. Stop crying.

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,200
It's

216
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,650
just 300,000 yuan.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,280
Just let it go.

218
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,650
Besides,

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
you won't get it back
just by crying alone.

220
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,570
You should be happy instead.

221
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,770
You were lucky
that you weren't arrested for it.

222
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,360
Mom,

223
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,080
how much savings do we have left?

224
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,400
Less than 10,000 yuan.

225
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,120
Mom, what about this?

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,530
I still have some savings.

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,810
Let's pay back Ms. Li

228
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,850
and the others with them.

229
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,650
I'll try to pay back the rest.

230
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,690
With what?

231
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,530
It's hundreds of thousands, you know?

232
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,530
Back then, they said

233
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,360
that they knew the risk themselves!

234
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,280
Mom,

235
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,650
they handed their money to you.

236
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,970
Now they're scammed,

237
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,320
they can only find us to fill the gap.

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,730
Now, we can only hope

239
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,610
that the police can arrest
the culprit soon.

240
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,890
Then we can get back some money.

241
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,850
This won't do.

242
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,040
Jian,

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,040
I'll tell you this first.

244
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,200
You shouldn't use your money.

245
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,120
That's for your wedding.

246
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,400
Dad,

247
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,000
Guo is in Shanghai.

248
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,280
We won't get married that soon.

249
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,490
Let's solve the matters at hand first.

250
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
Guo is in Shanghai.

251
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,930
I think she's made some money.

252
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,200
Why don't we

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,810
- try and ask Guo...
- Enough!

254
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,280
Don't you think it's disgraceful?

255
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,690
Yu Guohua!

256
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,530
Why do you always go against me?

257
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,690
We raised her, you know?

258
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
And, Yu Jian

259
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,200
spent a lot of money on her too.

260
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,730
Why can't she help us
during crucial moments?

261
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,970
What crucial moments?

262
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,770
Jian, don't listen to her.

263
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,400
She lost her mind.

264
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,120
Oh yeah.

265
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,280
Why don't I talk to Wang Yan?

266
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,040
Her husband

267
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,440
can cover the loss without problem,

268
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,360
am I right?

269
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,200
Yeah, yeah.

270
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,280
You were the one

271
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,810
who had issues with her.

272
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
And now,

273
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,280
don't you feel embarrassed
to ask for help?

274
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,850
We'll be in-laws

275
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,810
and a family eventually.

276
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,200
Mom, that's enough!

277
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,060
(Xue Yuming)

278
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,540
(Thank you.)

279
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,460
(Yam Head)

280
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,000
Guo,

281
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,530
have you eaten the cake?

282
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
I have.

283
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,770
Thank you.

284
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,770
My mother used all of our savings

285
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,810
to do P2P lending

286
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,040
without telling us.

287
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
In the end,

288
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,570
the scammer ran away with the money.

289
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,120
So I couldn't

290
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,610
celebrate your birthday with you.

291
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,650
I know that.

293
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,650
I don't blame you.

294
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,120
If so, why does it look like

295
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,240
you're still angry at me?

296
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,440
I just want to know one thing.

297
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,890
Who's that Wen Ya

298
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,890
who brought the cake to me?

299
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,690
Didn't you see her

300
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,610
before you went to Shanghai?

301
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,970
The florist project I'm working on

302
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,160
is her project.

303
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:12,970
You said

304
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,200
that was Tang Yiming's project?

305
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,440
It was Yiming's project.

306
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,960
She came to Yiming,

307
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,280
and Yiming came to me.

308
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,120
Yu Jian, can you please get my point?

309
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,200
You never told me

310
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,570
that you were working for her.

311
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,650
We called and video called

312
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,690
so many times.

313
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Even so, you didn't dare

314
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
to tell me that your "site"

315
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
was actually her shop.

316
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,850
But me? I told you everything

317
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,360
happening at my side and in the company

318
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,650
at the first time.

319
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,850
Mr. Xue, Ms. Nan, and so on.

320
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,120
But you?

321
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,770
You didn't even tell me about it.

322
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,850
Why?

323
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,850
Is that important?

324
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,850
It is.

325
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,650
You told me on WeChat

326
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,650
that she was your friend.

327
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,970
But she called you Yu Jian

328
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,940
as if she's close to you.

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
She said I shouldn't stay in Shanghai

330
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,530
and she could approach

331
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,360
or leave you with ease!

332
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,610
What did she mean?

333
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,200
Was she saying you belong to her?

334
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,690
Guo,

335
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm really exhausted today.

336
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,730
I don't want to argue.

337
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,440
I'm exhausted too.

338
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,850
I received the cake.

339
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,530
Thank you.

340
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,040
Dad.

341
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,650
Were you on the phone with Guo?

342
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,650
Were you two arguing?

343
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,440
No.

344
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,240
How's Mom?

345
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,730
Her?

346
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,890
She's lying on the bed.

347
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,570
Dad,

348
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,530
I'll do something about the money.

349
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm doing a project part time.

350
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,040
I can get my wage in advance.

351
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,000
There's no rush.

352
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,120
In my opinion,

353
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,200
I think your current priority

354
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,320
is to head to Shanghai

355
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,810
and visit Guo.

356
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,650
Her birthday is already over.

357
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,400
We can talk about it when I'm free.

358
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,890
When you're free?

359
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,650
What do you mean?

360
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,690
When will you be free then?

361
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,970
Which of the two is more important?

362
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,200
You see,

363
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,000
you two are so far apart
from each other.

364
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,280
You have to visit her often.

365
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,610
Jian.

366
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,610
I have a piece of advice for you.

367
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,770
If you stop seeing each other,

368
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,690
you'll grow distant from one another.

369
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,730
That's not it.

370
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,730
We do have video calls often.

371
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,930
We call each other.

372
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,610
We did both.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,890
It's different.

374
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,970
It's different.

375
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,280
What about this?

376
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,120
I'll make a promise to you today.

377
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,400
In the future,

378
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll look after my wife

379
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,690
while you'll look after yours.

380
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,690
Got it.

381
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,770
Got it.

382
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,260
(Crossroad BAR)

383
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,360
What drink do you want?

384
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,490
Anything.

385
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,400
We don't serve that.

386
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
This must be your first time.

387
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,730
Are you this rude

388
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,000
to all first-timers?

389
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,970
It's not that I'm rude.

390
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,980
It's that we don't serve
"Anything".

391
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,610
If you want a drink, pick from the menu.

392
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,610
Don't put me on the spot.

393
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,400
The menu.

394
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,690
What about this?

395
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,500
You said you wanted "Anything", right?

396
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,120
Give me a random number.

397
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,240
I'll make the drink

398
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,890
according to the number on the menu.

399
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,000
What do you think?

400
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,240
Nine.

401
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,570
Please wait a moment.

402
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,280
What? Are you in the mood now?

403
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,360
When I was not in the mood?

404
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,200
When you came in.

405
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,690
When you sat down.

406
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,440
When you spoke. When you ordered.

407
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,610
You can read minds?

408
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,200
I can tell from your expression.

409
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,810
Are you this mean

410
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,000
to all of your customers?

411
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,890
Not necessarily.

412
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,120
It depends on my mood.

413
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,850
How old are you?

414
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,930
86.

415
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,610
Not bad.

416
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,890
Can you tell me

417
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,200
the name of this drink now?

418
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,360
Hometown.

419
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,690
Give me another glass.

420
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,080
Four.

421
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,380
(Yam Head)

422
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,580

(Video Call)

426
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,730
Hello, Mr. Xue?

427
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,040
Where are you?

428
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,810
I'm replying to you on WeChat.

429
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,200
Thank you.

430
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,400
Thank you for wishing me
a happy birthday.

431
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,490
I'll hang up now. Goodbye.

432
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,000
Hello?

433
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,360
Hello. This is Crossroad Bar.

434
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
I think this lady is drunk.

435
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,970
Hang up.

436
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,970
Okay.

437
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,040
Give me another one.

438
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,730
Sixty.

439
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,570
You should stop drinking.
Time to go home.

440
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,570
Sixty-six.

441
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,320
You live where? I'll call a cab.

442
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,200
Where I live?

443
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,640
I live in Sichuan.

444
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,440
Leshan.

445
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,770
At Binhe Road.

446
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,810
(I have a piece of advice for you.)

447
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,320
(If you stop seeing each other,)

448
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,320
(you'll grow distant from one another.)

449
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,570
In Leshan, there's a Leshan Buddha.

450
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,810
You know?

451
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,200
Did you answered the call?

452
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,400
That's right.

453
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,970
Thank you.

454
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
Thank you.

455
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,200
Mr. Xue?

456
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
You can still recognize me?

457
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,490
Are you here to drink too?

458
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,320
Oh yeah, that...

459
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,440
You shouldn't drink that much

460
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,570
if you can't drink.

461
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,490
My boyfriend stood me up.

462
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,040
Today's my birthday.

463
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,120
I can drink as much as I like.

464
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,530
Happy birthday.

465
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,570
Ai,

466
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,280
get Mr. Xue a glass of Hometown.

467
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,880
Give him a taste

468
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,690
of Hometown.

469
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,320
Yeah. Hometown is a nice drink.

470
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,400
You know?

471
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,770
Hometown...

472
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,200
I'd like the bill. Thank you.

473
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,490
Mr. Xue?

474
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,890
What are you doing in my house?

475
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,240
You're finally sober.

476
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,280
Did you send me home

477
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,000
last night?

478
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,400
You mean just now.

479
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,850
How could I not remember anything?

480
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,970
Wait.

481
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,690
How did you know I was at a bar?

482
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,000
You're awake, I can leave.

483
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,810
Wait.

484
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,890
So,

485
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,850
you footed the bill for me, right?

486
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,490
How much? I'll give you.

487
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,690
It's not important.

488
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,820
(Yam Head)

489
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,490
Who's calling me?

490
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,440
Who is it?

491
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,300
I don't think

492
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,280
you want to answer it.

493
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
If he truly cares for you,

494
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
he should be the one
standing here right now.

495
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,820
(Yam Head)

496
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,000
Hey. How could you say that about him?

497
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,810
You don't know

498
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,080
what happened between us.

499
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,770
And, how would you know

500
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,490
if he cares for me?

501
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,730
Is he here today?

502
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,080
He's not here, then something's wrong.

503
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,570
You went out to drink by yourself.

504
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,160
How could that be good?

505
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,040
None of your business.

506
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,890
I just lost my mind.

507
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,690
I shouldn't have been cared for you.

508
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,730
You're a girl.

509
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,770
You drank late at night.

510
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,080
What if something happens to you?

511
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,850
Have you ever considered that?

512
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,240
I'm sorry.

513
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,240
I got three pieces of advice for you.

514
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,610
First,

515
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,650
think about

516
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
what else you can possess

517
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,000
besides a relationship.

518
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,160
This is very important.

519
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
What do you mean?

520
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,530
Digest it in your own time.

521
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
What about the second one?

522
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,810
What's your second advice?

523
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,690
I'll tell you about the rest

524
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,280
after you understand the first one.

525
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,810
Rest well. Tomorrow's the weekend.

(Xue Yuming, Yam Head)

529
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
(Think about)

530
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,040
(what else you can possess)

531
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,890
(besides a relationship.)

532
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,400

Do you have fun?

537
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,440
I couldn't reach you on the phone.

538
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,240
I have something to tell you.

539
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,810
You said you were exhausted?

540
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,970
I was giving you a break.

541
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,610
You do hold a grudge, huh?

542
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,810
I'm frying the fish.

Guo, don't be angry.

544
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,280
Go and sit over there.

545
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,200
You'll get oil on your shirt.

546
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,810
Go and sit down.

547
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,650
Hello, Mr. Xue?

548
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm home.

549
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay. I'll amend it

550
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,890
and send it to you.

551
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,810
I've already eaten.

552
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,530
Thank you.

553
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,970
Are you not done yet?

554
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm working. Don't rush me.

555
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,570
Isn't today the weekend?

556
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,690
Why are you busy?

557
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,120
Do you think we're still in Leshan?

558
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,930
There's no rest for the workforce.

559
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,000
Eat if you're hungry.

560
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,280
Hello, Dad?

561
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,850
We'll eat soon.

562
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,890
How's Mom doing?

563
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,040
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

564
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,770
Don't worry.

565
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,890
You guys should rest after eating.

566
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,040

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,610
fell yesterday.

569
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
The screen cracked.

570
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,320
I'll use it once it's repaired.

571
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,730
Guo,

572
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,810
why don't we eat first?

573
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,490
I have something to tell you.

574
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,200
No, Mr. Xue wants it urgently.

575
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,810
You can tell me right now.

576
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,530
I'm listening.

577
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,320
Didn't you wanna know about Wen Ya?

578
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,570
I'll tell you.

579
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,650
I don't want to know that now.

580
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,890
But I have to tell you.

581
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,730
I came all the way here
to explain myself to you.

582
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,690
We bumped into each other
at the airport.

583
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,240
She was going to attend
an exhibition in Shanghai.

584
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,690
Back then, the police called me

585
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,690
and urged me to head back.

586
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,930
She saw me in a hurry,

587
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,490
saying she'd take the cake to you.

588
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,160
I said yes without
thinking too much of it.

589
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,300
(Email delivered successfully)

590
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,610
So, do you feel like

591
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,810
you've been wronged?

592
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,320
(Xia Guo.)

593
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
(I already read it.)

594
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,810
(There are something I wish to discuss.)

595
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,280
(How about meet
at the bar near your house?)

596
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,730
Guo,

597
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,360
I've already explained it
to you many times.

598
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,690
We just have a working relationship.

599
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,040
It's not as complicated as you think.

600
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,240
Working relationship?

601
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,850
Working relationship? Why were you two

602
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,530
that close at the courier station then?

603
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,890
How did you know about that?

604
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,970
You don't want me to find out?

605
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,140
A guilty conscience.

606
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,490
You didn't even dare to mention

607
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,320
the word to me.

608
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,490
Wen Ya is just my client.

609
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,490
That's all.

610
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,360
I didn't mention her

611
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,200
because it doesn't matter
who my clients are.

612
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,040
There's no need
to introduce them to you.

613
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,770
Do you want me to introduce

614
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,810
all of my clients to you?

615
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,320
That day,

616
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,970
I was planning to visit the site,

617
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,930
which was her florist.

618
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,160
And I was going to mail to you.

619
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,770
That's why I went
to the courier station.

620
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,140
She knew you were in Shanghai.

621
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,980
She was showing me

622
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,490
photos she took in Shanghai before.

623
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,320
What's so indecent about that?

624
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,120
Why do you not trust me at all?

625
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,850
How can I trust you?

626
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,160
I was expecting you to celebrate

627
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
my birthday together.

628
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,360
What happened in the end?

629
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,730
And,

630
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,770
speaking of trust,

631
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,320
it's your fault that I can't trust you.

632
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,970
You stay in Leshan for your family.

633
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,120
You sacrificed me

634
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
and our happiness.

635
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,040
Did you know that?

636
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,200
I don't understand this at all.

637
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,970
Why are you bringing up past issues now?

638
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,970
Wanna bring up the past?

639
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,080
Fine.

640
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,980
Something huge happened in the family.

641
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,970
But even now, you showed

642
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,080
no concern for my mother.

643
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,480
You didn't ask how she was doing

644
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,970
or how we should resolve the issue.

645
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,770
Xia Guo,

646
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,690
has my family become

647
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,160
that insignificant to you now?

648
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,650
I showed no concern for your family?

649
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,610
Who found the hospital
in Shanghai for you?

650
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,240
In your eyes,

651
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm a heartless person, huh?

652
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
You're right.

653
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,890
What happened between us

654
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,730
were all caused by

655
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,770
a long-distance relationship.

656
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,040
But you're slaving away here

657
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,160
seven days a week.

658
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,650
I don't see the significance at all.

659
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,080
What other benefits do you have

660
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,120
besides having the money

661
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,440
to buy an extra pair of shoes?

662
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,850
I have nothing to say to you.

663
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,000
This is what you think

664
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,530
about my work in Shanghai, huh?

665
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,440
Fine.

666
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,400
Guo.

667
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,240
Come back.

668
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,440
Return to Leshan.

669
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,200
Let's find back

670
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,650
the happy moments
we used to have in the past.

671
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,650
I can't stand it anymore.

672
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,490
I really need you by my side.

673
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,120
Do you even need me?

674
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,040
You don't need me at all.

675
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
You just need someone

676
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
to stay by your side.

677
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,000
What do you mean by that?

678
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,490
How could that person not be you?

679
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,240
More like you're the one
who no longer needs me.

680
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,650
Just be direct with me.

681
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,530
What?

682
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,080
You wanna break up with me or what?

683
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
Just be direct with me.

684
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,890
Yu Jian, have you lost your mind?

685
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,850
Do you know what you're saying?

686
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,810
I don't know!

687
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:29,440
I only know

688
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,970
that I shouldn't have come today!

689
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,570
Leave, then!

690
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
Yu Jian!

691
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,530
Mr. Xue.

692
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,970
You'll regret it if you go.

693
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,690
No, I have to go after him!

694
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,360
No!

695
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,400
Don't do this! I'm out of time!

696
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,160
You already saw him just now.

697
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,970
Were you happy?

698
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,320
Ask yourself this. Were you happy?

699
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,930
I couldn't be happy at all.

700
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,650
I couldn't.

701
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,650
Now, I'll tell you the second one.

702
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,770
Initiate the breakup.

703
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,490
The one who initiates

704
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,810
the breakup will suffer less.

705
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,080
But I'm in pain right now.

706
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,730
My heart is in pain
when I think about him.

707
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,850
I...

708
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,280
Alright now. Calm down.

709
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,040
Why?

710
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,610
Why?

711
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,770
Why are you...

712
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,060
Why?

713
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,570
You shouldn't be here!

714
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Yu Jian, you're awake.

715
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,440
What are you doing here?

716
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,000
Mrs. Yu told me to come.

717
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,240
You never spoke a single word

718
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,810
after returning from Shanghai.

719
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
Your parents were terrified.

720
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,000
Luckily, your fever has subsided.

721
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,400
Where are my parents?

722
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,040
Mrs. Yu brought Mr. Yu
to the park to play chess.

723
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,490
Don't worry.

724
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,970
Mrs. Yu told the guard
to carry Mr. Yu on his back.

725
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,080
I can't cook well.

726
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,610
Don't be picky, okay?

727
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,850
Here.

728
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Try it while it's hot.

729
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,320
Why did you come back in a hurry?

730
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,610
Was your girlfriend still angry at you?

731
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,770
That's not it.

732
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,570
She was just busy.

733
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,200
Don't lie to me.

734
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,650
She has a misunderstanding toward me.

735
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
Did she make it hard
by talking about me?

736
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,770
No.

737
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,570
I'm glad to hear that.

738
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,770
Actually, I came here

739
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,810
to give you something.

740
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,730
I think you need it right now.

741
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,080
Alright now. I won't bother you.

742
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,810
You should sleep longer. See you later.

743
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,570
Wen Ya, wait.

744
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,490
I can't accept your money.

745
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,320
You deserve this.

746
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,220
An advance payment for your design.

747
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,580
But this is too much.

748
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,120
This is just half of it.

749
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
I'll transfer the rest

750
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,320
one month after
the initiation of the project.

751
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,850
Yu Jian,

752
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,810
you aren't just

753
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,280
any ordinary designer in my heart.

754
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,400
Your worth

755
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,970
cannot be measured with money.

756
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,040
If you lose money, you can earn it back.

757
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,610
If you lose your love,

758
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,240
you can find another one.

759
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,690
Everything will definitely get better.

760
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,040
But you mustn't give up on yourself.

761
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,690
You're doing me a huge favor here.

762
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,610
I'm truly thankful to you.

763
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,200
Don't worry.

764
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,000
I'll definitely do a good job.

765
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,360
Thank you so much.

766
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,280
I'm not just being nice

767
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,320
to you because of the project.

768
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,610
Actually,

769
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,240
I do like you quite a lot.

770
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,040
I don't believe
that you didn't feel it at all.

771
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,690
You blocked off everything

772
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,770
as you were together with
Xia Guo before this.

773
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,040
But now, it's different.

774
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,160
I hope you can reconsider your decision.

775
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,970
I hope you can consider me.

776
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,970
Wen Ya, actually, I...

777
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,000
Yu Jian,

778
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,770
I know. You can't get over her.

779
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,400
But it's fine.

780
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,570
From tomorrow onward,

781
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,040
I can keep you company every day.

782
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,040
I believe

783
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,610
that you'll accept me one day.

784
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
Thank you

785
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,360
for giving me this opportunity.

786
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
We can work hard together.

787
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,000
Yu Jian,

788
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,810
I'll head back first.

789
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,240
You guys can have a chat.

790
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,650
See you tomorrow.

791
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,200
You must remember what I said.

792
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,160
I trust you.

793
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:56,970
What else do you want to say?

794
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
You already saw it.

795
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,280
What's with the question?

796
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,890
Is this your so-called
"working relationship"?

797
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,080
Is this "there's nothing indecent

798
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,040
about it"?

799
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,970
You asked me

800
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,690
to come back for...

801
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,970
Let's break up.

802
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,490
I'm sure you've been wanting to say that.

803
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,530
I'm just expressing what's on your mind.

804
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,300
You should've expected this

805
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,320
when you left Leshan back then.

806
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,240
Fine.

807
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,080
You're even saying
the same thing as her.

808
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,200
Is she very gentle,

809
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,650
thoughtful, and understanding?

810
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,690
The person

811
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,200
you need the most is her, right?

812
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,810
She can share your burden
at the first time.

813
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,610
If so, why did you

814
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,400
go to Shanghai
and stage an act yesterday?

815
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,810
Are you taking me for a fool here?

816
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,080
I'm so silly.

817
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,080
I almost fell for it,

818
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,930
for your sincerity

819
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,000
and your endeavor.

820
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,490
You can think whatever you like.

821
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,850
That's right.

822
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,200
Not only did she help me out,

823
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,080
but she also helped my family out.

824
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,690
Where were you when I needed you

825
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,530
the most?

826
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,320
Why is she the one helping me out

827
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,440
instead of you?

828
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,400
What about you?

829
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,530
What were you doing?

830
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,730
Let's drop the act now.

831
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,200
Let's part ways in peace.

(you must wait for me in Shanghai.)

868
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,730

to initiate the breakup?

881
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,610
Why didn't I listen to you

882
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,610
and initiate the breakup?

883
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,080
Do you think

884
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,610
I can go back in time

The best way to cure you after a breakup
