(Encounter or Reminiscence)

4
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,140
Guo, aren't they home?

5
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,460
Where are my parents?

6
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,500
Dad and Mom are taking a walk with Chen.

7
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,130
Guo, what's wrong?

8
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,970
Impossible!

9
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,180
Jian would never cheat on you.

10
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,060
I won't be mistaken. It was him.

11
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,979
No way. Jian isn't that kind of person.

12
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,410
Ever since he started
contacting Wen Ya again,

13
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,250
I kept persuading myself

14
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,580
not to think about that either.

15
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,609
But today, I saw both of them

16
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,930
driving to a hotel.

17
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,060
I had no way to deceive myself again.

18
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,250
When we were having breakfast,
he told us

19
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,460
that he went out for a business meeting.

20
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,460
As if.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,809
What kind of business meeting
would he have with a woman

22
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,500
in that kind of place?

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,019
Did I have to charge inside

24
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,899
and catch them red-handed?

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,019
Stop, Guo.

26
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,410
Can you stop letting
your imagination run wild?

27
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,650
Why don't you...

28
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,529
Why don't you go to sleep?

29
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,650
Everything will be fine
when you wake up tomorrow. I'm serious.

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,370
Yan, you don't need to persuade me.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,970
He's your brother.

32
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,250
Of course you'll side with him.

33
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,649
If you think that he's right, fine.

34
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,460
Forget it.
I shouldn't have told you about it.

35
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,060
Guo, that's not what I mean.

36
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,900
It's fine.

37
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,410
Just forget that
we ever had this conversation.

38
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,090
What's wrong?

39
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,970
You never tidy up
after yourself usually.

40
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,850
But you're being so proactive today.
Is something off?

41
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
Look at you.

42
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,220
I'll be criticized no matter
if I help you out or not.

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,650
Help me out, huh?

44
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,019
Yeah, you're "helping me out"
by doing this.

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,580
But it's my duty to do all of these.

46
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,340
It's my duty to tend
to all family affairs.

47
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,020
Guo,

48
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,050
I know. I've been busy with work lately.

49
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,730
I neglected you and Chen.

50
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,730
You hate me. I feel terrible about it.

51
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,460
Therefore, in my opinion,

52
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,700
there are some issues

53
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,090
we need to resolve, don't you think?

54
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,380
Fine.

55
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,490
Are you free tomorrow?

56
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,580
Let's go and have a chat outside.

57
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,650
Okay.

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,610
I found a place.
I'll take you there tomorrow.

59
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,140
We can resolve

60
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,900
our issues there tomorrow.

61
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,460
Okay.

62
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,410
If so, I...

63
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,170
What's on your mind?
You never spoke a word.

64
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,970
I'll speak when we get there.
Just focus on driving.

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,720
(Lechuan Hotel)

66
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,460
Why do you bring me here?

67
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,610
You'll know after we get in.

68
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,939
Alright, you guys can go ahead.

69
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,579
I'll get you guys
some desserts for free later.

70
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,379
- Okay. Thank you.
- May your business boom.

71
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,460
Thank you.

72
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,619
Hello, we're doing a 20% discount today.
You may try out the things you like.

73
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,820
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

74
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,090
Ye, has our liquor arrived?

75
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,169
Let me urge them.

76
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:08,699
Okay.

77
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,209
Boss, your flowers are here.

78
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,290
Coming.

79
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,849
Are you here to deliver the flowers?

80
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,719
Boss, these are your flowers?
Where should I put them?

81
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
(Wealth)

82
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,700
Well, you guys may
put one on each side. Thank you.

83
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,580
Slightly forward. Okay. Thank you.

84
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,940
Xia Guo, congratulations
on your grand opening!

85
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,900
When you receive
the two bunches of "wealth" flowers,

86
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,850
you should congratulate me!

87
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,170
It's because I've hiked
Mount Everest successfully!

88
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,490
May all of our wishes come true!

89
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,780
I hope...

90
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,089
I hope Xia Guo can become

91
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,120
the happiest person in the world!

92
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,290
Xia Guo, you must stay happy!

93
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,800
(Wealth)

94
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,579
Boss, the liquor deliverer is here.

95
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,970
He's looking for parking.

96
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,019
Tell him to park
at the back door. I'll be there.

97
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,850
Okay.

98
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,970
Congratulations.

99
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,610
I knew today was
the opening of your new shop.

100
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,420
I came back to support you.

101
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,820
When did you come back?

102
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,420
My quarantine ended yesterday.

103
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,820
Coincidentally,
I could make it to this occassion.

104
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,220
I see.

105
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,060
I finally met you after so long.

106
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,180
Are you planning to speak to me
while standing?

107
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,890
You're my customer. I'm waiting
for you to make an order.

108
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,180
So, you guys are selling
these liquors as well.

109
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,890
I know the supplier.

110
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,340
Do you need me to open a bottle for you?

111
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,120
No need for that. I'm not here to drink.

112
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,769
If so, what would you like?
I'll give you some recommendations...

113
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,250
I'm here to see you.

114
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,569
I guess you saw me, then. I need to go.

115
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,580
Wait.

116
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,770
Now that I'm back,
I'm not going anywhere else.

117
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,580
I'll stay.

118
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,970
I won't go anywhere else again.

119
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,899
That's good. You should
bring your friends here, then.

120
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,370
I just want to tell you

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
that when I didn't agree with you
leaving Shanghai

122
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,540
together with me back then,

123
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,770
saying that you had to
be responsible for your position,

124
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,859
actually, I was the one escaping
from my responsibility...

125
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,220
Excuse me, I've got to go.

126
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,339
Hello. Today's our grand opening.

127
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,569
You can get a 20% discount
if you post about us on your Moments.

128
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,739
Sure.

129
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,090
Thank you.

130
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,940
(Now that I'm back,)

131
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,660
(I'm not going anywhere else.)

132
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,180
I'll stay.

133
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,040
(Blacklist: Xue Yuming)

134
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,770
(Xue Yuming: I was happy
to see you today.)

135
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,060
(I hope that you're happy too.)

136
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,599
(Fisher: Hello, miss. I heard that
today's your grand opening.)

137
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,799
(I wish to borrow your place)

138
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,499
(to propose to my girlfriend
on 22nd of September.)

139
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,120
(May I know if it's convenient?)

140
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,529
(Xia Guo: My establishment caters to
various business and private banquets.)

141
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,420
(We're very happy to witness
your happy moments together.)

142
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,919
(Fisher: Thank you. I also hope that
you offer personalized decorations.)

143
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,439
(Can I add you on WeChat?)

144
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:54,400
(Fisher requeststo add you as a friend.
NO. 1)

145
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,090
(Xia Guo: Hello.
It's our honor to serve you.)

146
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,090
(May I know about the details?)

147
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,850
Are you busy?

148
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,180
Why are you here again?

149
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,220
- The afternoon session hasn't started.
- I know.

150
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,850
It's fine. I can wait here.

151
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,340
I can work here. No problem.

152
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,370
The environment is great.

153
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,420
You can resume your work.

154
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,700
You won't affect me.

155
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,620
(Make it near to the window.
She loves sunlight.)

156
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,180
You look happy today.

157
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,929
Of course. Everyone's happy
making money, you know?

158
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,929
(If so, which of the proposals
do you like?)

159
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,380
What kind of business
are you dealing with?

160
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,180
May I know?

161
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,439
It's a customer who's special to me.

162
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,139
(The forest-based theme.)

163
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,319
He wishes to propose to his girlfriend
at my shop here.

164
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,739
(Do you have any other
special requests?)

165
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,890
What kind of customer?

166
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,820
Can you tell me about
how special he is? I'm curious.

167
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,929
Our shop was almost closed down

168
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,529
during the pandemic.

169
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,440
(It must contain a special symbolism.)
I was already laying off my employees.

170
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,300
After that, I was inspired

171
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,340
when he asked me
if I provided food delivery service.

172
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,770
That's how my shop managed to survive.

173
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,250
He's considered my benefactor.

174
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,669
(Roger that. I'll definitely do my best.)

175
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:40,770
So, you're grateful to him,
and you wish to repay his favor?

176
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,580
I must do a good job with this.

177
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,660
If news of this gets out,

178
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,289
my shop might become

179
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,610
a popular spot for couples.

180
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,940
That'll definitely happen.

181
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,130
That's great. Let me help you out.

182
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,460
No thanks.

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm not that expensive to hire.

184
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,250
Just treat me

185
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,449
to a simple lunch.

186
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,300
There's no free lunch in the world.

187
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,940
You want to have lunch? Sure.

188
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,940
Make an order and pay with WeChat Pay.

189
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,400
(Divorce Certificate)

190
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,139
What's going on?
Did you two really get a divorce?

191
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,250
Yeah. This is what
I've been busy with all this while.

192
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,490
What was on your mind?

193
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,420
We don't suit each other.

194
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,139
Actually, it only takes an instance

195
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,660
for us to figure something out.

196
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,340
One day, when I woke up,
I suddenly realized

197
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,180
that I was no longer interested

198
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,730
in everything that was related to him.

199
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,660
I made myself breakfast.

200
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,010
It was filled with
all of my favorite food.

201
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,730
We've been married for so long,

202
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,420
and I forgot
how my favorite food tasted like.

203
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,130
I cried while eating.

204
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,130
Congratulations.

205
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,250
This is what you should've done.
You have to be yourself.

206
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,610
You're right.

207
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,809
In the past, I thought I knew

208
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,099
what I desired.

209
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,580
I was always straightforward
and efficient.

210
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,700
Now, I think
that kind of life is boring.

211
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,890
I've lost myself for too long.

212
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,940
Indeed,

213
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,090
sometimes,

214
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,940
we only realize such thoughts
after experiencing something.

215
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,180
It's the same for all of us.

216
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,490
Forget about me.
What about you and Mr. Xue?

217
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,540
Did you ask him about it or not?

218
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,340
Nope.

219
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,300
I couldn't stand what he did.

220
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,739
What gives him the right to leave

221
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,180
and come back whenever he likes?

222
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,809
Who does he take me for?

223
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,220
Does he think
the world revolves around him?

224
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,490
Look at you.
You're still angry at him even now.

225
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,090
If so, do you still feel something
for him when you see him?

226
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,890
Actually, I don't know.

227
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,490
But I still get nervous when I see him.

228
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,770
If so, that means you still like him.

229
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,449
You should just yield to him.

230
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,770
Why are you putting yourself
on the spot here?

231
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,490
But a smart person
does not dwell on past actions.

232
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,660
I think it feels great to be alone now.

233
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,660
A prodigal who returns is
more precious than gold, you know?

234
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,300
We're talking about Mr. Xue here.

235
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,809
He has never done this for anyone else.

236
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,180
Enough. Stop trying to persuade me.

237
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,300
I'm at peace now.

238
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,060
In fact, I'm at so much peace now

239
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,289
that I don't even know

240
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,730
why I should be together with him again.

241
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,000
(Xue Yuming: Have you decided
on the red wine brand?)

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,409
(I found a perfect brand for the occasion.)

243
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,449
(You should come to my house tomorrow.)

244
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,160
(Xia Guo: It's better
if you deliver it to the shop.)

245
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,300
(Xue Yuming: Forget it, then.
Forget about this conversation.)

246
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,050
Hi.

247
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,050
Didn't you have the passcode?

248
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,940
I already forgot about it.

249
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,140
Come inside.

250
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,539
All of these are the belongings
you left at my place.

251
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,810
I brought them here for you.

252
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,250
Where's the red wine? Show it to me.

253
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,180
Over here.

254
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,819
This is specially
made for Valentine's Day.

255
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,929
There are only 2,000 bottles
in the world.

256
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,250
They were sold online.

257
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,100
I managed to buy one.

258
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,969
It's special because

259
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,250
there's a love quote
on each of the bottles.

260
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,579
You can only see it

261
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,420
after finishing the wine.

262
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,330
So, you only have its picture?

263
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,940
It's on its way here. It'll arrive soon.

264
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,339
Alright, then.

265
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,200
(Unknown Caller)

266
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,250
It's here.

267
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,530
Hello? Where are you?

268
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,900
What? Please excuse me.

269
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,420
How fast can you reach here?

270
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,620
Go ahead. Tell me.

271
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,010
Everything's unchanged.

272
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,810
Where's your necklace?

273
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,729
I couldn't find it.

274
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,100
If so, I'll buy you a new one.

275
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,220
It's fine. I can buy it myself.

276
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,900
How's the red wine?

277
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,770
Something cropped up.

278
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,970
It's fine. I'll deliver it
to your shop personally.

279
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,619
Sorry for the trouble.

280
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,860
Not at all.

281
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,250
Since we already found
such a special red wine,

282
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,859
shouldn't we come up with a dessert

283
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,010
that goes with it?

284
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,779
That's a great idea.
I'll think about it later.

285
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,660
I'll help you out.

286
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,570
- No need for that.
- Give me a chance.

287
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,140
What about this?

288
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,660
Fine. I'll change.

289
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,900
This?

290
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,660
Nope.

291
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,940
Nope.

292
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,180
Nope?

293
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,440
You aren't your customer's girlfriend.

294
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
How would you know
that she wouldn't like it?

295
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,619
I only know that these cliches

296
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,940
can't be considered unique.

297
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,339
Why are you suddenly so interested
in other people's proposals?

298
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,169
No. I just think

299
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,140
that since we're doing this,

300
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,860
we should give it our all.

301
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,409
If you're this girl,

302
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,620
I'm saying if,

303
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,100
what kind of cake would you choose
if you were in her shoes?

304
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,729
I like fruit cakes.

305
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,050
It's not like you don't know that.

306
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,010
But we're talking about her now.
Don't drag me into this.

307
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,249
Fruit cakes are nice.

308
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,660
I love them.
They're sweet, but not too sweet.

309
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,420
Many youngsters love them.

310
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,200
But what kinds of fruit
do we have to use

311
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,860
to make it extraordinary and special?

312
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,530
What fruit would you choose
if you had to make a choice?

313
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,169
Let me check.

314
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,119
(Fruits and their symbolism)

315
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,160
(Encyclopedia of fruits
and their symbolism)

316
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,100
Fig?

317
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,099
The fig flowers are small

318
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,810
and hidden within the receptacle.

319
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,140
It's subtle and reserved,
symbolizing guardianship.

320
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,180
It represents selflessness
and quiet dedication.

321
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,250
I think that's a great choice too.

322
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,339
You can put the round cups here.

323
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,460
Okay.

324
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,140
We can place two over here.

325
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,330
I'll place this here.

326
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,729
I think we need some macaroons too.

327
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,379
Alright.

328
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,770

I'm trying to bribe you here.

This won't work.
It's impossible between us now.

That's not what I mean.

348
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,330
I'm here to formally
apply for the position of chef.

349
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,940
I'm serious.

350

Thank you.

What do you think about the taste?

354
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,770
I don't feel anything in particular.

355
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,420
Maybe I didn't do a good job.

356
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,899
It'll taste just like before.

357
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,970
I believe.

358
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,530
You should go.

359
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,859
I have some special flowers in my car.

360
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,449
I need to use them
as decoration for the door.

361
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,700
Thank you.

362
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,570
I'm truly grateful to you

363
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,770
for your time and effort.

364
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,290
However,

365
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,140
it's unnecessary.

366
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,140
I didn't think that far ahead.

367
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,779
I just want to be with you every day.

368
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,729
Xue Yuming, you already left me.

369
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,620
You don't owe me anything,
and I don't owe you anything either.

370
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,330
Just leave. I'm serious.

371
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,700
These are the special flowers
I mentioned.

372
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,970
In England, there's a saying that goes:

373
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,570
"There's no happiness
without mistletoe."

374
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,530
If a couple kiss
in front of these flowers,

375
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,860
they'll get married.

376
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,729
Even estranged spouses will reconcile

377
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,810
in front of them.

378
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,220
And the message behind
this flower is very beautiful.

379
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,220
It represents hope.

380
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,330
Hope.

381
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,620
Does it look good? Isn't it special?

382
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,380
It's special.

383
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,449
I guess his fiancee
won't have any regrets

384
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,770
on that day.

385
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,050
What about you?

386
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,180
Have you ever thought about that day?

387
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,420
Me?

388
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,050
To me, being together with someone

389
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,050
means having dinner together after work,

390
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,620
enjoying some drinks,

391
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,059
and getting a ring on my finger

392
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,620
unknowingly.

393
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,420
That's happiness to me.

394
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,409
It's that typical?

395
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,250
Maybe it's typical to you.

396
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,139
But to some,
it's already wishful thinking.

397
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,330
But I still think that
she deserves something extraordinary.

398
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,660
So,

399
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,530
you can't

400
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,730
forgive me yet,

401
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,099
right?

402
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,460
It's all in the past now.

403
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,770
When you first left me,

404
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,140
I was very dejected.

405
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,010
But after that, I gradually realized

406
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,940
that your effort might not
get you the result you want.

407
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,970
And, not getting the result I wanted

408
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,140
wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

409
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm very satisfied
with my current state.

410
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,099
I'm content.

411
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,899
That sounds like

412
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,010
my appearance is unnecessary.

413
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,290
No matter
if you appear in my life or not,

414
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,140
it won't affect my current life.

415
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,339
Does that mean
all of my efforts are useless?

416
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,530
You should focus on your work.

417
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,970
That's the real you after all.

418
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,209
I'll place them on the door.

419
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,530
After that, I'll go.

420
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,600
(Xia Guo: Everything is ready.)

421
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,970
(Now that I'm back,)

422
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,530
(I won't go anywhere else again.)

423
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,620
(I won't find any excuses
to leave your side again.)

424
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,180
(I'll stay by your side,)

425
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,810
(watch over you, and protect you.)

426
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,330
Will you marry me?

427
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,319
(Zoe: Boss, we have
an important event today.)

428
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,619
(What time will you reach the shop?)

429
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,419
(Yun'er: Boss,
what time will you arrive?)

430
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,319
(Ysy: Boss, are you there?
Please wake up!)

431
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,440
(Zeng Lihai: Boss, wake up!)

432
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,169
(Pandemic Inspection,
Closed for One Day)

433
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,530
(Fig)

434
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,539
The fig flowers are small

435
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,970
and hidden within the receptacle.

436
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,050
It's subtle and reserved,
symbolizing guardianship.

437
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,530
(It represents selflessness
and quiet dedication.)

438
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,009
It's special because

439
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,700
there's a love quote
on each of the bottles.

440
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,059
You can only see it

441
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,140
after finishing the wine.

442
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,330
Excuse me. I've got to go.

443
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,970
Didn't you have the passcode?

444
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,530
I already forgot about it.

445
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,929
You still can't forgive me yet, right?

446
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,330
It's all in the past now.

447
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,440
(Marry Me)

448
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,050
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

449
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,700
Hello.

450
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,700
So, you found out.

451
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,380
I wish to propose to you.

452
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,290
Am I wrong?

453
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,489
Although you think
it should be a typical day,

454
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,249
I still think that
it should be extraordinary.

455
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,290
So, do you wish to keep up the act?

456
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,970
Actually, I thought of the possibility
that you might reject me.

457
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,250
After hearing what you said last night,

458
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,220
I already had a bad feeling about it.

459
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,649
Going to Singapore

460
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,050
was the thing I regretted the most.

461
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,010
That was the low point of my career.

462
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,700
I wasn't the best version
of myself back then.

463
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,250
That's why I hesitated and backed off.

464
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,730
For that, I received my just desserts.

465
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,410
I finally understood that I could never

466
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,409
become the best version of myself
without you by my side.

467
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,859
If so, is now the best time?

468
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,200
Are you the best version
of yourself now?

469
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,299
Do you think I should accept your
proposal because you figured it out?

470
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,730
Xue Yuming, you're too full of yourself.

471
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,659
You're making it as if
your proposal alone

472
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,500
can resolve
all of the issues between us.

473
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,850
Do you know that?

474
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,259
When I was together with you,

475
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,489
I was always cautious.

476
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,200
You were always the center of my world.

477
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,859
I waited for you when you didn't want
to disclose our relationship or get married.

478
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,180
I still had to wait for you
when you went to Singapore.

479
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,489
I finally overcame

480
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,640
my trauma,
which consisted of my inferiority,

481
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,320
disappointment,
and endless waiting for you.

482
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,379
Now, I wish to start anew.

483
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,890
After that, you came back
out of the blue.

484
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,060
You directed and acted in this play,

485
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,850
which you think was romantic.

486
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,659
So now, do I have to shed tears of joy

487
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,540
and join you in your game?

488
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,089
I'm sorry. I never expected my existence

489
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,930
to give you that much pressure.

490
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,730
I never expected you to be traumatized.

491
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,089
I came back and did all of this

492
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,770
in order to win back your trust.

493
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,850
I did it to salvage our relationship.

494
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,140
I can even start from zero

495
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,370
and court you again.

496
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,500
You're right. I'm too selfish.

497
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,699
If you think

498
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,699
everything here is just
a part of my play,

499
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,620
they'll be meaningless, then.

500
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,220
Don't let them go to waste.
Share them with your friends.

or you think it's not good enough,

506
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,700
you may toss it.

507
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,450

has never changed.

508
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,370

(to appear at the right time.)

540
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,410
(But we often miss out on them too.)

541
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,890
(Maybe time will provide us
with the best answer)

542
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,850
(and the best arrangements.)

543
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,660
Dear, please get out of the car.

544
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,290
What are you up to?

545
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,730
Come.

546
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,160
Are you surprised?

547
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,700
Isn't it surprising?

548
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,890
Guo, this is what I promised you.

549
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,700
I'm fulfilling my promise now.

550
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,700
The groom is handsome

Dear, I'm sorry.

562
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,020
I've made you wait for too long.

563
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,220
You kept telling me
to believe in miracles.

564
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,100
Sometimes, I would wonder

565
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,140
what would happen to us

566
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,450
had not you chosen

567
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,220
to remain in Leshan.

568
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,980
Maybe we would still be a happy couple.

569
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,220
But it might not be the same situation.

570
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,500
Now, we have our parents, friends,

571
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,580
and our dear son, Chen, with us.

572
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,810
In my opinion,

573
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,450
there are no miracles
in the world initially.

574
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,980
Your choices and sacrifices

575
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,540
created these miracles.

576
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,770
In the past three years,

577
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,140
we kept each other company

578
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,660
and helped each other to go through

579
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,500
our most helpless moments.

580
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,020
But I'm very lucky

581
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,890
to have you by my side.

582
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,580
Our life in the future

583
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,660
is still filled with
uncertainties and challenges.

584
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,500
But I believe that we can
overcome any obstacles,

585
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,850
hand-in-hand.

586
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,500
Xia Guo,

587
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,730
thank you for choosing
to spend your life with me.

588
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,620
In the future, we will definitely

589
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,100
stay happy together.

590
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,810

- Here.

602
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,969
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

603
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

604
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,450
Thank you, Ms. Ping, mister.

605
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,250
Thank you, Dad. Let's go.

606
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,020
Congratulations.

607
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,580
Are you two really...

608
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,100
Are you trying to say that
I'm not good enough for Wen Ya?

609
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,980
I had the same reaction as you

610
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,450
when I first saw them.

611
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,259
Guo, congratulations.

612
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,259
You look so gorgeous today.

613
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,580
Thank you guys for today.
I appreciate your effort.

614
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,049
I'm just an errand girl.

615
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,730
They're the major contributors here.

616
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,089
I'm just the errand girl's underling.

617
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,370
Let's give them our blessings.

618
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,449
Congratulations!

619
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,770
- Thank you.
- Congratulations too.

620
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,810
Alright now.
Stop paying attention to us.

621
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,620
Go and entertain other guests.

622
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,580
Today's your day. Enjoy it.

623
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,569
Alright. We'll be going now.

624
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,089
Go ahead.

625
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,020
Let's go.

626
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,179
- Put it back. Don't touch it.
- It looks like a bun.

627
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,969
- I'm just checking the filling.
- Put it back.

628
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,330
Dad, Mom.

629
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:51,929
Jian, Guo.

630
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,449
You guys should rest today.
Let me offer you two a toast.

631
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,609
Here. This is great.

632
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,379
Thank you, Dad, Mom.

633
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,770
Here, Guo.

634
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,930
This is delicious.

635
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,969
If I must say,

636
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,179
you should've discussed
the wedding banquet with me.

637
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,540
Wouldn't it be great for us
to have it indoor?

638
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,529
It's so windy out here.

639
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,339
Look at you. Today's a festive occasion.

640
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,489
Why do you have to say that?

641
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,449
- Guo, you're so beautiful.
- Thank you, Mom.

642
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,409
Is Mommy pretty?
Mommy's pretty, isn't she?

643
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,360
Chen.

644
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,589
- It must be cold.
- Is Mommy pretty?

645
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:22,489
You two should finish the toast soon.
After that, get some extra clothing.

646
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,180
- Got it, Mom.
- Don't catch a cold.

647
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,980
Where did you go? Go and help them out.

648
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:28,969
He peed.

649
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,529
- Let's go and change the diaper.
- He peed again?

650
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,089
- Mom, let me help you out.
- I'll go and change the diaper. Hurry.

651
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,009
It's fine. I'll go.

652
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,730
- You shouldn't. I'll go.
- Can you do it yourself?

653
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,540
Guo, you must be happy today.

654
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,250
You lass.

655
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,620
I'm sure you knew it all along.

656
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,980
You said my brother
was cheating on you yesterday.

657
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,810
May you two be happy forever.

658
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,330
Thank you.

659
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,500
Yan.

660
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,609
Go and get me another glass of wine.

661
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,220
Do it while your mother isn't around.
Hurry.

662
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,730
You look so pretty in your wedding gown.

663
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,020
Thank you.

664
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,930
I truly feel happy too.

665
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,890
What about you?
Have you found your own happiness?

666
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,540
It's pretty good.

667
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,450
I'm holding everything in my own hand.

668
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,500
Although my life is still busy,

669
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,370
it seems like I have more confidence

670
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,330
after what I've done.

671
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,700
That's great.

672
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,700
I plan to bring my child
to Shanghai in a few more days.

673
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,290
I always wanted
to go there all this while.

674
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,140
I also wish to open
another restaurant in Leshan.

675
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,580
This is my home after all.

676
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,370
Will you still think about

677
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,330
the "what ifs"
if we could go back in time?

678
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,410
You're right.

679
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,890
No path is better than the other,

680
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,620
or it's worse than the other.

681
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,700
Most importantly,
you must stay true to your heart.

682
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,330
Thank you

683
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,850
for making my life in Shanghai
a carefree one.

684
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,730
Thank you

685
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,730
for making my life in Leshan
a blissful one.

686
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,410
May we find
the best version of ourselves

687
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,580
in our own lives.
