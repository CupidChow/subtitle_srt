'I Joy' is one of the most high-end

5
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,420
(I Joy Wedding)
wedding planning companies in China.

6
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,899
They have been featured

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,940
in CosmoBride five years in a row.

8
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,099
They handle hundreds
of high-end weddings a year.

9
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,659
The brand is interested
in working with us.

10
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,479
They hope to jointly launch customized

11
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,370
(I Joy &amp; Haowei: Cake &amp; Door Gifts)
wedding candy and door gifts.

12
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,609
Young people nowadays

13
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,130
are very willing
to splurge on their weddings.

14
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,630
'I Joy' is a high-end brand.

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,869
So we

16
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,120
must come up
with products to match them.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,190
Any ideas?

18
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,320
We can use Spring Morning.

19
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,510
Spring Morning has broken sales records.

20
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,189
I think 'I Joy' came to us

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,589
because our Spring Morning series sold well.

22
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,039
There's no better way
to make Spring Morning

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
into wedding candy.

24
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,430
That's a good idea.

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,960
Let me share my thoughts.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,560
I think 'I Joy' is worth working with.

27
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,669
However,

28
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,519
Spring Morning's already a collaboration
with Thousand Miles of Spring River.

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,919
If we push it to 'I Joy',

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,709
not only 'I Joy' will think
that we're brushing them off,

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,639
but we might also have legal disputes

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,030
with Thousand Miles of Spring River.

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,120
So I suggest

34
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,109
using the concept of Spring In Europe

35
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,640
to launch new chocolate products.

36
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,750
It will be easier
to get I Joy's approval.

37
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,560
Sure.

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,549
You can report this idea

39
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,190
to Mr. Xue.

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
Yvonne.

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,190
Spring In Europe is your concept.

42
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,549
And you're the marketing director.

43
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,640
Why don't you talk to Mr. Xue yourself?

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
It's precisely because it's mine

45
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,869
that if I reintroduce
Spring In Europe to him,

46
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,960
he'll think

47
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,120
I have a personal agenda.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,750
Since you suggested it,

49
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,710
it would be better if you go convince him.

50
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,870
You're overthinking.

51
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,039
I think you should trust

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,710
Mr. Xue's professional judgment.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,640
Besides, business is business.

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,470
He won't mix business
with personal affairs.

55
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,439
I wonder what you were thinking

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,790
as you stood there earlier.

57
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,470
The company
had a meeting this afternoon

58
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,030
to talk about
cooperation with a wedding company.

59
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,519
I don't think

60
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,710
Spring Morning is a good fit for this

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,030
because Spring Morning has already...

62
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,840
We already got off work.

63
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,150
Don't you think
you should change your identity?

64
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,550
What identity?

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,910
You know the answer.

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,640
Mr. Xue has never been
without a woman by his side.

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,400
Who am I?

68
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,400
What do you mean?

69
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,710
Are you angry?

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,670
Are you really angry?

71
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,550
Do you think

72
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm that narrow-minded?

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,230
A little sometimes.

74
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,559
Someone's calling you.

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
I didn't hear.

76
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,080
Hurry and answer the call.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,280
Answer it first.

78
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,480
(Li Qiuman)

79
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,400
Hello?

80
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,910
Would it be convenient for you
to accompany Migao now?

81
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,589
Now?

82
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,590
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,079
The meeting scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon in Beijing

84
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
has been changed to tomorrow morning
in the last minute.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So I have to catch the plane now.

86
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,759
But Migao

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,710
cried and screamed on the phone

88
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,789
when she heard I was leaving.

89
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,400
The nanny can't calm her down.

90
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,269
I'll have to trouble you

91
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,590
- Okay, got it.
- to calm her down.

92
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,150
Go on.

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,280
Go accompany Migao.

94
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,349
I have some unfinished work,
so I'm going upstairs to work overtime.

95
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,119
Don't work so hard.
I'll send you home first.

96
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,229
It's okay. I'm just going to be
alone at home anyways.

97
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,910
I might as well do some work.

98
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,590
Go on. Don't keep Migao waiting.

99
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,520
Text me.

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,320
Ms. Xia?

102
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,030
Is Ms. Xia here?

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,229
Over here.

104
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,109
Hello, Ms. Xia.

105
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,110
Here's your dinner. Please take it.

106
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,110
I didn't order food delivery.

107
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,670
I'm not sure either.

108
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,840
(Everything Is Lovely)

109
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,800
It's for me.

110
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,720
Okay.

111
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,280
- Thank you.
- Okay.

(Haowei Food Group)

113
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,080
(Xue Yuming: I ordered you dinner. Enjoy.)

114
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,870
(Xia Guo: Thank you.)

115
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,600
I don't mind you talking to Migao.

116
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,399
I don't think you'd mind

117
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,390
if Migao joined you on your date either.

118
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,720
You knew we were going on a date,

119
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,630
so you did it on purpose.

120
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,790
The meeting in Beijing
was canceled at the last minute.

121
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,840
It was such a coincidence.

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,270
I can't help it.

123
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,030
You don't mind, but I do.

124
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,200
What's the matter?

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,789
Will a six-year-old bother you?

126
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,469
What bothers me

127
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,829
is that you never asked Migao
if she minded.

128
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,960
You only think about yourself,

129
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,630
but have you
ever considered her feelings?

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,360
It's my job to give them space.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,789
I'll let Migao

132
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,669
find out about me naturally

133
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,320
and then accept me.

134
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,630
Isn't that better?

135
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,279
I'm beginning to understand

136
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,510
what Xue Yuming likes about you.

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,030
You have a lot of foresight.

138
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,720
But there's one thing, Xia Guo.

139
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,429
You've thought so far ahead.

140
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,270
Have you ever asked Xue Yuming

141
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,320
if he included you

142
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,720
in his future plans?

143
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,110
(Hello.)

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
(Yes!)

145
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,110
(My inclusion.)

146
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,829
(It's indeed the most taboo subject)

147
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,790
(between me and Xue Yuming.)

148
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,390
(My feelings for him
are getting deeper.)

149
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,680
(And I'm also getting
more dependent on him.)

150
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,549
(He's included in all my plans.)

151
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,030
(What about him?)

152
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,990
(I know)

153
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,240
(that when I start to care about this,)

154
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,150
(my love starts becoming inferior.)

155
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,270
(The deeper I get,
the more I can't get out.)

156
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,840
(I'm like a sensitive rabbit.)

157
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,390
(I become insecure)

158
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,240
(by his every move.)

159
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,360
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

160
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,030
These are all your favorite.

161
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,990
Why aren't you eating? What's wrong?

162
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,200
You have good eyesight. You can see.

163
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,309
It's so dark here.

164
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,390
I don't even know what I'm eating.

165
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,469
Sometimes, dining is

166
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,200
about the atmosphere and vibe.

167
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,309
You need to

168
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,440
book this restaurant
half a month in advance.

169
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,480
I don't even know
if you booked it for me.

170
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,789
How did you know I was free today?

171
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,910
What if I'm not available?

172
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,840
I booked it for you, of course.

173
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
You...

174
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,669
You're still mad at me

175
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,990
about what happened last night,
aren't you?

176
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,750
I just don't like eating in the dark.

177
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,270
I like somewhere brightly lit.

178
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,919
Fine, I promise you

179
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,759
I'll bring you
to somewhere bright next time.

180
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,510
Endure this today, okay?

181
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,789
You already said that.

182
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,360
I'll look narrow-minded
if I don't say yes.

183
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,790
Thank you.

184
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,680
Hurry and eat.

185
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,960
By the way, did Li Qiuman tell you

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,789
we can use

187
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,080
Spring In Europe's concept
for the collaboration with 'I Joy'?

188
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,390
Didn't we agree

189
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,669
not to talk about work after work?

190
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,589
Yes.

191
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,399
We already
don't have much time for each other.

192
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,860
Why should we be occupied by work?

193
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,780
I know I haven't
spent much time with you

194
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,990
these days.

195
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,110
Shouldn't you have said,

197
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,309
"I can never

198
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,720
spend too much time with you."?

199
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,480
- I'm inarticulate.
- You are.

200
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,480
It's that table, right?
Right there, right?

201
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,600
This is yummy.

202
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,750
Yuming, what a coincidence.

203
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,510
Mr. Shao.

204
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,220
Hello. Long time no see.

205
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,819
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

206
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,309
Here. Let me introduce you.

207
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,150
This is my girlfriend, Cindy.

208
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,359
This is Haowei's general manager,

209
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,709
Mr. Xue.

210
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,189
- No.
- Hello, Mr. Xue.

211
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,560
Nice to meet you.

212
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,589
By the way, are you attending
the club meeting next week?

213
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,359
Yes.

214
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,560
I have a speech to make.

215
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,949
That's great.
We'll meet and talk later then.

216
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,680
- Okay, see you next week.
- See you next week.

217
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,359
We'll meet and talk later then.

218
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,999
Okay.

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,919
We'll go over first.

220
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,709
Okay.

221
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,560
Enjoy your meal.

222
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,159
Goodbye.

223
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,080
Goodbye.

224
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,600
Goodbye.

225
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
Your plan failed, didn't it?

226
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,990
No matter how dark it is,
people can still recognize you.

227
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,829
What's wrong?

228
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,480
Why do you keep picking on me today?

229
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,239
There's an office policy against dating,

230
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,960
so we have to
avoid suspicion in the office.

231
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,879
But we still have to avoid suspicion

232
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,510
when we're out to dinner
during weekends.

233
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,639
Why can't we

234
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,309
just date like normal people?

235
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,560
Is it so hard to date in the open?

236
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,440
Xia Guo.

237
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,320
Here.

238
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,879
I'm so sorry

239
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
I can't give you
a satisfactory answer right now.

240
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,600
But as long as

241
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,279
our relationship is taboo at the office,

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,680
I won't challenge it.

243
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,589
Our relationship didn't come easily,

244
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,030
so I need to protect it.

245
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,840
Can you understand me?

246
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,990
Yes, I understand.

247
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,750
Thank you.

248
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,480
Dig in.

249
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,990
(Wang Yan: Guo, I'm in Shanghai.)

250
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,360
(Let's have dinner together tonight.)

251
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,960
(Xia Guo: What are you doing here?)

252
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,030
(Okay.)

253
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,790
Something happened to Lucy.

254
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,080
What happened?

255
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,879
Guo, where did you go?

256
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,469
What's the matter?

257
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,150
Lucy was dismissed by Human Resources.

258
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,910
Why?

259
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,029
Mr. Wang found out about

260
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,350
her underground relationship with Tim.

261
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,270
Don't worry. I'm fine.

262
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,550
Go home and talk it out with your dad.

263
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,480
Don't argue anymore.

264
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,240
It's okay. I have some paperwork to do.

265
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,960
Goodbye.

266
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,240
Are you okay?

267
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,640
You scared me.

268
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,920
I thought you would
cry and make a scene.

269
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,480
Good, you're pretty calm
when things get tough.

270
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,399
Calm?

271
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,599
I was just faking it for Tim.

272
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,160
Why... Why are you crying?

273
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,960
It's alright if I lose my job.

274
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,749
But what should I do

275
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,660
if his dad won't let him marry me?

276
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,259
It's all my fault.

277
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,189
I forced him to marry me,

278
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,029
so he could only
go back and talk to his dad.

279
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,839
Alright.

280
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,029
Why is his dad so cruel?

281
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,120
Here. Wipe it.

282
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,160
Your mood changed so quickly.

283
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,029
I'm sure Tim will figure something out.

284
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,200
Besides, think about it.

285
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,229
Now that he has told Mr. Wang,

286
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,269
what does that mean?

287
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,240
That means he loves you, silly girl.

288
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,270
Okay, stop crying.

289
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,229
You don't know

290
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,159
how cowardly Tim is.

291
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,030
He does whatever his dad says.

292
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,509
What should I do if his dad tells him

293
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,709
to break up with me?

294
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,539
Why am I so unlucky?

295
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,879
Okay, stop crying. You're the best.

296
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,240
Stop crying.

297
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
Okay, stop crying.

298
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,429
Cheer up. What's the big deal?

299
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,590
Just find a new job.

300
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,750
And if Tim really loves you,

301
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,839
it's not your problem to worry about.

302
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,880
Right?

303
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,960
Right?

304
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,480
Stop crying.

305
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,350
Guo, I'm not like you.

306
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
Actually, I envy you.

307
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,880
You can devote yourself to your work.

308
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,440
But I'm not as good as you.

309
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,310
I just want to marry a good man.

310
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,990
But why is it so hard?

311
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,029
Okay, I know.

312
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,559
You just want to be
in a good relationship

313
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,750
and marry a good man, don't you?

314
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,119
You're not wrong.

315
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,540
You're right.

316
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,510
I don't have your courage yet.

317
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,429
Why would you say that?

318
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,060
Are you also seeing someone?

319
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,160
No way. You are?

320
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,990
Who is it?

321
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,310
No, I'm not.

322
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,750
Did you hear about
what happened to Lucy?

323
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,750
I think I heard it first.

324
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,350
How dare you pick me up here then?

325
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,310
There's no need to freak out.

326
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
What do you want for dinner?

327
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,750
My mom is in Shanghai.

328
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,240
Send me the location.

329
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,880
I'll send you there
to have dinner with her.

330
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,160
What about you?

331
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
Don't worry about me.

332
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,510
Have a nice meal with your mom.

333
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,990
Do you want me
to pick you up after dinner?

334
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,990
No thanks.

335
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,640
You have something on your mind.

336
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,640
It's just been too long
since I've seen her.

337
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,270
I don't know what to say when we meet.

338
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,550
This is the first time
I've heard of your mother visiting

339
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,400
since I've known you.

340
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,750
She must have missed you.

341
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,030
Are you sure
you don't want me to pick you up?

342
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,270
No, I can go back on my own.

343
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,550
Text me when you reach home.

344
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,640
Okay.

345
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,830
Cheer up, okay?

346
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,790
Alright.

347
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,200
Remember to have dinner.

348
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,070
Guo, over here.

349
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,750
Have you been waiting long?

350
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,960
Not long. I just ordered.

351
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,220
Have you been busy lately?

352
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,660
You have time to come to Shanghai
but don't have time to dye your hair.

353
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,960
At my age,

354
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,160
it doesn't matter whether I dye my hair.

355
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,989
Let me know in advance
next time you come

356
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,240
so I can pick you up.

357
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,079
I'm only here for two days.
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

358
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,440
I don't want to bother you
when you're so busy.

359
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,200
The transportation in Shanghai
is convenient.

360
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,720
What would you like to drink?

361
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,790
No drinks. Water's fine.

362
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,160
I'm glad to see

363
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,310
you're doing well.

364
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,790
You're dressed

365
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,640
like a Shanghai girl now.

366
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,720
No.

367
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,920
Thank you.

368
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

369
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,070
The food here is good.

370
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,790
And the environment is quiet.

371
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,200
There are many
good restaurants in Shanghai.

372
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,680
I'll take you to try them next time.

373
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,590
Sure, take me next time I come.

374
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,030
Dig in.

375
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,400
You should eat more.

376
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,960
Are you seeing anyone?

377
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,160
Why do you ask?

378
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,440
As your mom, can't I just ask?

379
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,750
No.

380
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,400
Who was the man
who just dropped you off then?

381
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,790
How long have you known each other?

382
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,830
Does he know
you're having dinner with me?

383
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,640
Yes.

384
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,550
Why didn't he come with you?

385
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,550
He doesn't know you.

386
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,949
Is he avoiding me on purpose?

387
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,550
No, you're overthinking.

388
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,640
What does he do?

389
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,240
He's my boss.

390
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,440
That's good.

391
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
A man's career is important.

392
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,550
Is he a lot older than you?

393
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,160
Was he ever married?

394
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,680
No.

395
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,790
That's even better.

396
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,920
Hurry and get married.

397
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,270
But I have one request.

398
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,399
If you have a wedding,

399
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,709
you must have one in Leshan
after having one in Shanghai.

400
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,359
It's too early to talk about these.

401
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,990
Early?

402
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,070
You're not getting younger.

403
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,750
Why wait if you think
you're right for each other?

404
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,550
I want to work on my career first.

405
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,440
It's not too late to talk about these

406
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,990
when I've achieved something.

407
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,879
He has a career,

408
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,350
so you'll have nothing to worry about.

409
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,310
You don't need to work so hard.

410
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,319
I'm working hard to have a better life.

411
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,469
It has nothing to do with others.

412
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,400
A better life?

413
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,550
A woman's job

414
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,160
is to find a man
who loves you and dotes on you.

415
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,790
After you get married,

416
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,830
you won't have to worry about
daily necessities anymore.

417
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,799
You'll have a warm and happy family.

418
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,840
Didn't you always ask me
to be independent?

419
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,590
Why are you asking me
to rely on someone else now?

420
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,200
Can't I live by myself?

421
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,240
Yeah.

422
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,720
I put too much in your head.

423
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,120
Do you hate me?

424
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,720
Not really.

425
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,550
Do you still hate me?

426
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,399
Mom, you asked me out to dinner,

427
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,830
so let's eat.

428
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,680
Why are you bringing this up?

429
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,160
Hurry up and eat.
The food is getting cold.

430
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,720
Guo.

431
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,830
If someone meets the right person

432
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,990
and doesn't get a happy ending,

433
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
won't they be wasting their time?

434
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,920
Can you afford it?

435
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,310
Don't say these.

436
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,030
Where's Zheng? He didn't come with you?

437
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,510
He's waiting for me outside.

438
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,669
I wanted to talk to you alone

439
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,270
and didn't want him here.

440
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,640
Madam Liu.

441
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,160
Help me put Migao to bed in my room.

442
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,750
- Okay.
- Be careful.

443
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,799
Don't wake her up.

444
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,070
Okay.

445
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,590
You're home early.

446
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,070
Migao's mom

447
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,510
has another sudden meeting tonight.

448
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,680
She said
she couldn't sleep at home alone

449
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,240
and insisted on seeing me,

450
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,350
so I picked her up.

451
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,400
She fell asleep before we got home.

452
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,160
I didn't even get changed.

453
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,160
I didn't tell you in time

454
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,960
because
I didn't want to disturb your dinner.

455
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,550
If...

456
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,469
If Li Qiuman has activities every day,

457
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,400
are you going to do this every day?

458
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,830
What do you mean?

459
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,990
I'm totally fine with you
talking to Migao.

460
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,359
Li Qiuman keeps trying
all kinds of things to pick on me.

461
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,269
I accept that.

462
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,079
I can't even get in your car
without going to B3.

463
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,750
I accept that too.

464
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,960
But my mom came all the way to Shanghai,

465
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,790
and you didn't even see her. I...

466
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,720
Got it.

467
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,790
Your mom came to Shanghai today
to see you.

468
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,799
If I just showed up

469
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,480
without preparing anything,

470
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,270
what will she think of me?

471
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,799
The Mr. Shao we met at dinner last time

472
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,749
is just an acquaintance

473
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,680
in the business world.

474
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,509
Why would I tell him

475
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,159
everything about my personal life?

476
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,750
It's not necessary.

477
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,350
Speaking of Li Qiuman,

478
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,639
I don't know what she's thinking.

479
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,960
I don't want to know.

480
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,429
All I know is that

481
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,319
I only have one girlfriend,

482
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,509
and that's you.

483
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,680
There's no doubt about it,
and nothing can change it.

484
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,640
But she's Migao's mom.

485
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,749
I can't confront her head-on

486
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,640
without considering Migao's feelings.

487
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,790
Speaking of the office,

488
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,990
You saw what happened to Tim and Lucy.

489
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,709
We are just sacrificing

490
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,029
that little public freedom

491
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,310
to keep

492
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,270
our jobs and the quality of life

493
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,920
we have.

494
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,189
In other words,

495
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,030
We work happily under the same roof
during the day

496
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,429
and live sweetly at night

497
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,990
under another roof.

498
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,440
Isn't that good?

499
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,990
If you put it that way,

500
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,510
I'm not smart and sensible enough.

501
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,590
That's not what I meant.

502
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,350
Everything I just said

503
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,680
is unfair to you.

504
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,750
So I want you to know that

505
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,750
this is all temporary.

506
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,240
I'll do everything I can

507
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,790
to keep you
from feeling aggrieved again, okay?

508
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,160
Let me send you home, okay?

509
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
Okay.

510
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,440
Okay, hurry home.

511
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,120
You're getting rid of me so soon?

512
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,350
No.

513
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,310
Promise me.

514
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,310
If anything upsets you in the future,

515
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,229
tell me as soon as possible, okay?

516
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,399
But I don't want you
to keep figuring things out for me.

517
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,550
It'll be exhausting.

518
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,440
I'll do my best to protect you,

519
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,830
but you also have to
learn to adjust and protect yourself.

520
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,790
Okay, got it.

521
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,550
Bye.

522
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,599
Bye.

523
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,990
See you.

524
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,750
You're here.

525
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,400
You're finally back.

526
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,270
Do you care about Migao?

527
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,160
Where did you go?

528
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,240
She came here to find you,
but you're not around.

529
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,559
You're back so late.

530
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,879
Are you serious?

531
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,160
It's my fault.

532
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,030
I'll apologize to Migao tomorrow.

533
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,720
Children are the most sensitive.

534
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,709
She knows who's been mean to her

535
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,550
and who's been brushing her off.

536
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,359
If you admit she's your child,

537
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,019
please do your duty as a father.

538
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,120
Okay?

539
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I'm tired.

540
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,350
Are you tired?

541
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,550
You can sleep with Migao.

542
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,750
I'll sleep in the guest room.

543
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,070
Have an early rest.

544
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,399
Guo, my boyfriend came to pick me up.

545
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,960
Where are you going?
Let me take you there.

546
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,669
It's okay. I already got a ride.

547
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,750
Sure, I'll go first then. Goodbye.

548
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,510
Xu Li.

549
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,949
And everyone.

550
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,550
Let's have a quick meeting
in the conference room.

551
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,400
I just saw Xia Guo leaving.

552
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,200
Ask her to come back.

553
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,550
I'll call her.

554
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,559
Hello.

555
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,879
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

556
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,030
I can't get through to her.

557
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,799
Why are you still here? Go after her.

558
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,070
She probably went down to B3.

559
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,080
Okay.

560
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,679
Why am I so careless?

561
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
It's okay.

562
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,120
I didn't think
they had this kind of relationship.

563
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,359
I was too shocked to stop her.

564
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,350
Ms. Li, don't blame me.

565
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,400
(Xia Guo)

566
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,160
Hello? Xu Li, did you call me?

567
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,919
Yvonne called a short meeting.

568
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,080
Where did you go?

569
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,199
But I... I'm already on my way home.

570
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,790
Is it important?

571
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,949
Just go home.

572
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,469
I'll tell Yvonne.

573
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,199
Okay.

574
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,310
Go ahead with the meeting first.

575
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,919
Let me know
if there's anything important

576
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,200
after the meeting.

577
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,240
Goodbye.

578
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,040
Xia Guo is so good at pretending.

579
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,080
Alright, stop discussing.
Let's start the meeting.

580
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,430
Good job.

581
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,950
Nothing special, I suppose?

582
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,600
Don't go even if there is.

583
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,950
Take a look at the slides.

584
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,790
We're mainly discussing
these three projects.

585
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,000
We looked into the social environment...

586
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,870
(I learned to live in the moment.)

587
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,830
(But am I also
treading on a dangerous edge?)

588
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,430
(Life)

589
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,750
(keeps throwing
one problem after another at us.)

590
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,080
(Lucy)

591
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,629
Lucy.

592
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,640
Xia Guo.

593
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,989
I called you so many times.

594
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,520
Why are you
only answering your calls now?

595
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,759
What's wrong?

596
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,839
How can you still fall asleep

597
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,199
after what happened?

598
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,640
Check your WeChat.

599
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,279
(Da Bao)
Gosh.

600
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,759
When did they get together?

601
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,149
(Xu Li)
She's taking projects like a rocket.

602
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,429
I'm sure they've been together
for quite some time.

603
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,989
(Wang Zilin)
Ms. Li has a daughter with Mr. Xue.

604
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,509
Doesn't this prove that
Xia Guo is a home wrecker?

605
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,679
(Junbo)
They weren't married.

606
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,429
(Xu Li)
But it's equally bad as preventing Yvonne

607
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,910
from getting back together with him.

608
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,839
Hello.

609
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,199
The number you dialed is currently busy.

610
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,790
Please try again later.

611
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,870
Xia Guo.

612
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,200
Do you know why we found you?

613
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,430
Yes.

614
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,160
I accept any punishment.

615
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,840
I feel sorry for you two.

616
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,080
You're a talent
whom the company values very much.

617
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,589
Yuming's the head of the company.

618
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,199
But you took the lead
in violating the company's

619
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,270
rules and regulations,

620
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,120
which caused a bad influence.

621
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,640
Mr. Lu.

622
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm sorry

623
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,759
to have disappointed you with this.

624
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,949
(Resignation Letter)

625
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,390
I quit.

626
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,759
What are you doing?

627
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,039
Mr. Lu didn't ask you here

628
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,680
to quit.

629
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,430
Yuming just left my office

630
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,199
an hour ago.

631
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,029
(Resignation Letter)

632
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,750
He has handed in his resignation.

633
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,720
What?

634
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,509
He knew you would resign,

635
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,430
so he asked me to come talk to you.

636
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,350
He hoped you'd stay.

637
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,160
No.

638
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,199
He's the general manager.

639
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,469
The core of the company.

640
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,430
I...

641
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,270
I should bear the consequences.

642
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,270
He went to great lengths

643
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,000
