An order of tofu curd. Take away.

You are here, Guo.

14

Do you want it with
an egg or crisp pork?

15

Crisp pork.

16

All right.

I can tell this is for Yu Jian.

18

I can't.

Don't be so courteous.

shuangda noodles. Take away.

until four this morning.

Let me sleep a bit longer.

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,210
On the count of three.

two...

45
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,160
Fine.

46
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,570
Guo,

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,600
you are an angel.

48
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,930
Please let me sleep a bit longer.

49
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,210
Go ahead and sleep.

50
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,960
I will find another hot guy

51
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,280
to take me to work.

52
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,840
Which hot guy are you meeting?

53
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,400
Guess.

54
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,040
Guess?

55
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,770
Well, let me guess.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
Tickles.

57
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,250
Nice.

58
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,570
How do you feel?

59
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm amazing, right?

60
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,960
You are.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,010
Did you learn this before?

62
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,130
I'm good at anything my Guo likes.

63
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,770
Delicious.

64
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,890
Mrs. Yu, stop moping.

65
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,160
I will do it later.

66
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,150
Eat it while it's hot.

67
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,160
You guys eat first.

68
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,130

73

Feet up.

74
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,770
Come on.

75
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,130
Zhang Quan's shumai.

76
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:56,330
You can't eat this.

77
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:57,931
It's not good for your health.

78
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,890
Guo, eat the shumai.

79
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,010
Don't just eat the noodles.

80
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,450
Fine, I eat the noodles.

81
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,600
You always crave good food.

82
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,010
Guo, here you go.

83
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,600
The 783rd portrait.

84
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,890
You are improving.

85
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,810
Show me.

86
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Let me see.

87
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,330
Guo is prettier than this drawing.

88
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,130
Nice.

89
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
- Mom.
- Not nice.

90
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,210
What are you stewing
early in the morning?

91
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
Laba congee.

92
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,480
You have been drinking this
all your life. Don't you know?

93
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,502
Let me do it, Mrs. Yu.

94
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,890
Yu Jian. Are you wearing
the long underwear?

95
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,890
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

96
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,560
It's getting colder.
You have to wear it.

97
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
It's not winter, though.

98

It's too early.

99
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,770
Guo, I bought you a set too.
I'll give it to you later.

100

101
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,810
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

102
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,480
Yu Jian, wash your hands first.

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
So annoying.

104

107

Be patient.

108
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
You don't have to clock in.

109
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,720
I have many things
to handle this morning.

110
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,510
If they are delayed, the plan for
this afternoon will be all messed up.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,720
But my hands and legs are feeling weak.

112

Beg me, then. I'll gain strength
if you do that.

00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,330
to check the inventory list carefully
before delivery.

190
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,170
How could you make
such a trivial mistake?

191
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,480
Ms. Chen. Please have some tea.

192
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,170
It wasn't me.

193
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,690
Then, was it me?

194
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,931
Wasn't it you who
forwarded me the inventory list?

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,530
I did.

196
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,817
- But...
- That's right.

197
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,840
You young people are so careless.

198
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,000
Ms. Chen, well,

199
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
since it's already spilled milk,

200
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,930
let's give her a chance.

201
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,210
The goods have reached Chengdu,

202
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,840
just ask the local staff to settle it.

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,290
I have learned the situation.

204
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,050
Get out.

205
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,600
Drink some tea.

206
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,000
Put it there.

207
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,100
(Zhanggong Bridge Food Street
Welcomes You)

208
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,960
What's wrong with you?

209
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,600
You look gloomy after work.

210
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,120
Wang Chang'an messed me over.

211
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,930
I'm so mad.

212
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,720
Again?

213
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,360
This snide.

214
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,120
But he failed.

215
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,210
There is a bigwig
who noticed his trick this morning.

216
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,390
Director of
the Marketing Department from Shanghai.

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,210
Goodness.

218
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,120
You should meet her.

219
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,290
- So fashionable and capable.
- Do you envy her?

220
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,050
We are both women.

221
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,240
But she is so outstanding.

222
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,050
Of course, I envy her.

223
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:52,600
By the way, Ms. Ping told me that
Shanghai headquarters is recruiting.

224
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,274
But there will be an evaluation.

225
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,017
She lent me the internal materials.

226
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,720
Are you interested?

227
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,217
Ms. Ping is
the most potential candidate.

228
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,880
But she has a family to take care of.

229
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,245
So she has to give it up.

230
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,988
She encourages me to give it a try.

231
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,290
If I pass the evaluation,

232
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,290
it's a promotion to go to Shanghai.

233
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,000
My salary will surely double or triple.

234
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,330
Are you going to abandon me
for more money?

235
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm serious.

236
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,330
Didn't we agree to get married

237
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,240
when you turn 30?

238
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,240
Before that,

239
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,450
we should work harder

240
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,530
and earn more money.

241
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,570
What if I want to marry you

242
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,450
before turning 30?

243
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
You can't wait?

244
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,530
Besides,

245
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,600
what if you get lost
when you are in Shanghai?

246
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,000
I can take a cab.

247
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,217
You aren't familiar with the place.

248
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,720
You might get abducted.

249
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,080
Am I dumb?

250
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,700
(Mr. Zhang)

251
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,720
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

252
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,330
What?

253
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:57,245
Stop eating, let's go.
Take me to the factory.

254
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,810
It's all wasted.

255
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,880
Come on. Let's go.

256
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,360
Something has happened. Hurry.

257
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,460
Stop.

258
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,690
Stop.

259
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,570
Stop fighting.

260
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,930
Calm down.

261
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,360
Please calm down.

262
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,290
Please calm down.

263
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,360
Listen to me.

264
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,330
She falls down.

265
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,120
Stop fighting.

266
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,690
Xia,

267
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,080
are you all right?

268
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm fine.

269
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,450
Get up.

270
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm so sorry.

271
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,000
I tried my best to persuade them.

272
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,570
They insist that it's your company's
responsibility for the returned goods.

273
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,330
They are worried about the wages

274
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,788
if they unload the goods again.

275
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,560
They also said they won't do it
unless you give them an explanation.

276
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,690
- We won't do it!
- No!

277
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,720
Pay more.

278
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
- We won't do it!
- We won't do it!

279
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,050
We mean it.

280
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,210
I have called Mr. Wang
regarding this matter,

281
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,530
but he said it's not his responsibility
and hung up on me.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,930
How about this?

283
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,080
Everyone, simmer down.

284
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,600
Calm down.

285
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
I will figure something out.

286
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,040
I promise you

287
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,540
I will resolve this.

288
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,170
Okay?

289
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,810
- Can you resolve this?
- Uh...

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
Give me a moment.

291
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,360
Ms. Chen, what brings you here?

292
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,810
What are you guys doing?

293
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,840
Shanghai is waiting for the new goods.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,050
Where have you sent them?

295
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,240
Listen, you are
in charge of the logistics.

296
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,000
I won't increase the budget anymore.

297
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,410
Ms. Chen,

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,120
how about this?

299
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,720
Instead of temporarily storing
goods that are close to expiring,

300
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,410
which would take up space
in the warehouse

301
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,531
and waste effort on
repeated loading and unloading,

302
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,860
why don't we have the drivers

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,100
deliver them to the supermarkets
we work with?

304
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,120
That way, we can save
both labor and expenses.

305
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,660
How can we put these
nearly expired goods back on sale?

306
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,210
Ms. Chen,

307
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,060
there are sales channels

308
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,570
for such goods

309
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,810
in a small city like Leshan.

310
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,330
I have tested

311
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,600
that these goods would sell

312
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,930
if offered at a discount.

313
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:11,330
Besides, the supermarkets
will handle the unloading.

314
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,080
This is better than keeping them
in the warehouse

315
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,850
and discarding them upon expiration,
which would result in a huge loss.

316
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,170
Ms. Chen, this is
the sales activity report

317
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,050
of all the supermarkets we work with
in Leshan.

318
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,930
I pick a few that are closest to here.

319
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:37,960
Please have a look.

320
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,930
If you agree, I will discuss
a promotion plan with the managers.

321
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:43,840
(Supermarkets in Leshan)
There are

322
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,502
more than ten supermarkets on the list.

323
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,330
How do you decide which to choose?

324
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,720
It's simple.

325
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,720
I will go for those
with high daily sales

326
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,930
and are closest to here.

327
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,080
Don't worry. I know what to do.

328
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,210
All right, you handle it.

329
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,050
Okay.

330
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,131
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

331
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,840
I will inform them now.

332
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Misters, here's the thing.

333
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:09,530
You don't have to unload the goods
from the two trucks.

334
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,410
I will send you a few addresses later.

335
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,810
You can deliver the goods

336
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,650
to those addresses.

337
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,760
That will be all, okay?

338
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
- All right.
- All right.

339
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,600
Yam Head,

340
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,480
go to Shanghai with me.

341
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,650
Are you really going there?

342
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,640
I haven't been there before.

343
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,210
That's why I want to explore.

344
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:34,600
You know it very well.

345
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,560
When I went to the university
in Chengdu,

346
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,600
Dad and Mom wanted me home once a week.

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
If I go to Shanghai,

348
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,930
they might go crazy.

349
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,210
It's not like
we won't come back anymore.

350
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,000
We will go there and
work for a few years

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,930
to make some money.

352
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:50,360
When we come back, we'll be able to
afford a car and a house.

353
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,131
They will be happy to see that,
won't they?

354
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,170
What?

355
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,720
Do you want to leave me?

356
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,410
Give me some time to think about it.

357
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,210
My Xia Guo is an outstanding

358
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,410
and competent career woman.

359
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,720
As for me,

360
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,610
I prefer stability.

361
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,210
I consider much
before making decisions.

362
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,960
That's why we complement each other.

363
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,370
We are a perfect couple, aren't we?

364
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,170
Don't change the subject.

365
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,370
Let me tell you first,

366
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,130
I could change my heart
in a long-distance relationship.

367
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
Are you threatening me?

368
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,410
I'm not going then.

369
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,520
- Let's go together.
- No.

370
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,274
Let's go together.

371
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,880
No.

372
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,040
Please go with me.

373
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,320
Why aren't you begging?

374
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,850
Just beg a little more,

375
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,800
I might change my mind.

376
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,130
I'm not begging you.

377
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,130
I want you to go with me

378
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,690
when you are willing to.

379
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,320
All right. Let's see if you
can pass the evaluation.

380
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,130
All right?

381
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,370
Let's go.

382
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,610

(Don't slack off.)

388
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,560
(I will check
when I get back from Chengdu.)

389
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,850
Is it your winning entry
for the Best New Designer Award

390
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,450
in the international design competition?

391
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,760
It's my graduation project.

392
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,690
My design was inspired by...

393
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,180
(Interviewer)

394
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,180

(May I ask,)

396
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,680
you are quite talented,

397
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,080
but why would you stay in Leshan?

398
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,320
Leshan is my hometown.

399
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,850
This place has given me
a lot of creative ideas.

400
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,410
Also,

401
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,850
my most important family
and friends are here.

402
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,502
(Interviewer)
Then, why are you leaving?

403
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,690
Because my girlfriend

404
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,610
wants to go to Shanghai.

(that the ultimate significance
of a woman working is)

(to enter marriage
without being confined.)

(the career is an armor)

I came here.

436

Look at this house.

437
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,040

if it wasn't my house.

446
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,000
Just throw it away.

are my own business.

452
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,850
It has nothing to do with you.
Don't touch them.

453
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,040
Is that how you talk to your mom?

454
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,280
You were looking for a place, anyway.

455
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,520
I rented mine to you.

456
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,240
That's a sweet deal.

457
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,280
What has happened to your hand?

458
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,210
None of your business. Just leave.

459
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,040
So ungrateful.

460

Turn off your phone

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,000
and put it away.

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,910
Hello? The assessment
is starting soon, so speak.

468
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,650
I have been hired
by a company in Shanghai.

469
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,560
What?

470
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,960
It's in your hand now.

471
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,302
When did you go for an interview?

472
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,090
Liar.

473
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,410
I didn't want to give you false hope

474
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,930
if I fell short.

475
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:50,930
Well,

476
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,090
I will hang up.

477
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,960
Good luck.

478
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,320
Hello?

479
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,930
The assessment begins now.

480
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,210
You are crazy.

481
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:17,170
Why did you leave your civil servant job

482
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,760
and go so far to work for someone else?

483
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,550
You also have to rent
an expensive apartment.

484
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,702
Stop eating spicy food.
Your stomach is weak.

485
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,930
What's wrong with that?

486
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
I'm still working for someone else.

487
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,760
Look at the child of Li downstairs.

488
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,210
So what that he studied abroad?

489
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,674
He tries to do a civil servant job.

490
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,170
Of course, you are stable now.

491
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,650
But you can't take any chances

492
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,430
thinking that you will achieve
something big.

493
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,560
You might be framed by others.

494
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,850
People over there are snobbish.

495
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,970
They look down on people
from small cities like ours.

496
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,217
Have you heard
how big companies exploit their staff

497
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,680
and enslave them?

498
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,850
You will be worn out.

499
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,520
Listen to me, don't go.

500
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,130
You will regret it.

501
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,960
All right?

502
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,480
Mom,

503
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,170
Guo and I have talked about it.

504
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,650
When we earn enough money,

505
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:07,760
we'll come back
and establish our own business.

506
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,410
By then, you and Dad

507
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,090
can enjoy a comfortable life.

508
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,800
It sounds so familiar to me.

509
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,160
Before your sister left,
she said the same thing.

510
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,617
Look what kind of day she is having.

511
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,610
She didn't study much and is jobless.

512
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,410
She works like a slave in the house.

513
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,280
Why are you talking about her now?

514
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,217
What I'm trying to say is,
don't deflect me,

515
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,450
I have already sent your sister away.

516
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,130
If I don't keep you with us,

517
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,450
who will be here for us

518
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,560
when something happens?

519
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
Who will cook for you both?

520
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,170
Jeez, you are saying

521
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,170
as if we are very old.

522
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,650
I just don't want to
live a mundane life with you alone.

523
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,410
I'm so furious.

524
00:25:45,902 --> 00:25:47,000
What's wrong with Guo too?

525
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,090
Her dad died when she was little.
We pitied her.

526
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,250
When we were neighbors,
her mom never cared about her.

527
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,890
It was we who fed her
and took her to the hospital

528
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,520
when she was sick.

529
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,440
Why are you raking out

530
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,610
this ancient history?

531
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,890
What does it matter?

532
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,000
Of course, it does.

533
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,410
They both left us
when they grew up.

534
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,240
Your mom is worried

535
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,130
that you might suffer out there.

536
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,760
Don't blame her.

537
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,210
Speaking of which,

538
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,320
you are not right either.

539
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:25,610
You should've told us sooner.

540
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,760
Reflect on this.

541
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,930
Here you go, Three Bams.

542
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,850
No, I don't need that.

543
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,130
Me too.

544
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,040
Five Craks.

545
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,850
Self-drawn is great.

546
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,130
Eight Dots.

547
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,090
You are here.

548
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,000
Four Craks.

549
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,690
Got it. Four Craks.

550
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,040
Double win.

551
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,890
I'm done.

552
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,090
Give me the money.

553
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,560
I'm off.

554
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,850
What's wrong with her?

555
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,280
Sore loser.

556
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,090
Finally, I got you.

557
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,240
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

558
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,170
I'm in the middle of the game.
Can't you see?

559
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Just tell me here.

560
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,280
Do you know they are going to Shanghai?

561
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,280
I don't.

562
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Eight Craks.

563
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,450
Can you please at least pretend

564
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,090
that you care about your child?

565
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:30,531
I don't need a lecture from you.

566
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,410
Guo is independent.
She has a mind of her own.

567
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:34,690
She will decide for herself.

568
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,480
Yes, I know.

569
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,610
Still, we can analyze

570
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,760
the situation for her.

571
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,000
That's something we can do.

572
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,240
Guo is ambitious.

573
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:43,610
It's good for her to go to Shanghai.

574
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,130
Girls nowadays are different.

575
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,690
They stand on their own feet.

576
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,410
It's better than relying on men.

577
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,930
Still, girls will eventually
build a stable family

578
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,760
and live happily together.

579
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,280
That's the best for them.

580
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,450
To build a stable family,

581
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,040
they have to make money first.

582
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,960
Money again. All you know is money.

583
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,320
You are saying this
as if you don't like money.

584
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,690
Nine Craks.

585
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,074
Claiming a tile for a quadruplet.

586
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,130
Wang Yan,

587
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,670
I'm discussing our children's future
with great patience here.

588
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,000
What's with that attitude?

589
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,410
Good tile for the quad.

590
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,280
Are you listening to me?

591
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,410
Can you two talk this out? Okay?

592
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,760
You are affecting the game, right?

593
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,690
Anyway, I have told you
what I mean to say.

594
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,850
As for my daughter,

595
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,410
I support her to go to Shanghai.

596
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,240
As for your Yu Jian,

597
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:30,445
you guys discuss it among yourselves.

598
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,040
Don't bother me
with small matters like this.

599
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,650
Come, let's continue.

600
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,960
It's hard to talk to you.

601
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,960
Enough.

602
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,380
(Whole-House Rental| Xujiahui Wantiguan
European Loft Apartments)

603
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,870
Maybe we should look for
an apartment outside of downtown?

604
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,000
This place is too expensive.

605
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,720
There is an art gallery nearby.

606
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,240
In the second half of the year,

607
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,560
three international masters

608
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,788
will hold an exhibition there.

609
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:10,960
Does it mean we'll go to exhibitions
like taking a stroll downstairs?

610
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,660
Yeah.

611
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,140
(Unknown)

612
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,090
Will it be the headquarters?

613
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,560
Answer it.

614
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,040
Answer it for me.

615
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,170
You are scared.

616
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,720
Hello?

617
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,450
No need.

618
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,170
Credit card.

619
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,130
It was scary.

620
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,160
Don't worry. You will make it.

621
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
We will meet in Shanghai very soon.

622
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,400
Shanghai has many delicious foods.

623
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,130
We can go and explore, all right?

624
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:52,890
Let's go to Disneyland too.

625
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,280
We can get an annual pass

626
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,690
and go as many times as we want.

627
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,960
How much will that be?

628
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,090
Our salaries will be over ten thousand.

629
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,210
We can afford two annual passes.

630
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,060
(Unknown)

631
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:07,890
It's ringing again.

632
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,170
Answer it.

633
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,610
Hello?

634
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,650
Yes, I am.

635
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,520
We are not going.

636
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,480
It's pointless to go to exhibitions.

637
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,690
Those popular stores

638
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,520
are expensive, and the food is awful.

639
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,845
What's the point of going there?

640
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,210
Disneyland is boring and childish.

641
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,280
Things in Shanghai

642
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,290
are expensive.

643
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,280
The place is too big
and it's easy to get lost.

644
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,000
Right?

645
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,520
It's good that we stay in Leshan.

646
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,610
We eat well,

647
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,170
dress well, and sleep well here.

648
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,690
Right? The temperature is comfortable.

649
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,890
Besides, we have friends here.

650
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,720
It's wonderful.

651
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,170
Right.

652
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:00,760
If I stay here,
I will end up being like Wang Chang'an.

653
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,090
Handing over the work to subordinates

654
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,090
and having fun every day.

655
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,240
And the connections can't be expanded.

656
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,370
If I stay here,

657
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,000
I can expect what my future will be.

658
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,520
Only Shanghai can bring me
unknown challenges.

659
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,090
What I'm saying is,

660
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,320
Leshan is good too.

661
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,370
Am I right? You see,

662
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,800
we can respond to the national call
and have two children.

663
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,330
When we grow old,

664
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,210
we will have grandchildren.

665
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,690
With all those kids waiting on us,

666
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,280
it will be wonderful.

667
00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:30,650
We haven't even gotten married yet,

668
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,960
you want me to bear your child.

669
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,090
We will get married soon.

670
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,090
Honestly, I just want to make my life
a bit extraordinary.

671
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,000
Just a little bit is enough.

672
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,960
My career can be a bit successful.

673
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,320
My life can be a bit exciting

674
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,040
and a bit enviable to others.

675
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:50,520
I just want to be an ordinary man

676
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,960
and live a stable life with you.

677
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,480
You say this now,

678
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,210
but when you go to Shanghai,

679
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,010
you have a higher income,
see a bigger world,

680
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,090
meet more people,
you will think I don't deserve you.

681
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,720
Why would I go to Shanghai?

682
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,890
But you were admitted.

683
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:08,480
Why should I go when you stay here?

684
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,720
Don't be ridiculous.

685
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Are you serious?

686
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,090
That's G. Archi.

687
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,040
I don't care what it is.

688
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,000
Big bosses are difficult to deal with.

689
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,890
I prefer to be with you.

690
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,720
Don't be facetious.

691
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,650
Well,

692
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,280
speaking of the work,

693
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,890
I heard that one must have a strong
stomach to work in the company.

694
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,170
I cherish my life.

695
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:31,370
But that's an opportunity

696
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,450
many people can't even get.

697
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,650
Eating with you is also an opportunity
many people can't get.

698
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,960
You...

699
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,800
Stay still.

700
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,480
You look ugly.

701
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,617
Let me take a photo of you.

702
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,890
Cut it out.

703
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,280
You are so annoying.

704
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,210
I didn't know I had
become so honey-tongued.

705
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,610
Argh.

706
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,090
Don't be sad.

707
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,890
I believe we will
live a great life in Leshan.

708
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,610
I also believe

709
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,890
we will be very happy together

710
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,130
and our living standards will surge.

711
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,930
Yam Head.

712
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,960
There, there.

713
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,560
You better not regret it.

714
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,370
What would I regret?

715
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,930
Don't cry.

716
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,560
Guys,

717
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,240
here you go.

718
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,370
I brought you some snacks from Shanghai.

719
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,650
Distribute to everyone this noon.

720
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,450
Each of you has one.

721
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,760
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

722
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,650
(Go to Shanghai)
Distribute to everyone.

723
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,000
From now on,

724
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,280
if we need to bring anything
from Shanghai,

725
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,280
we can ask Guo for help, right?

726
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh, I have a bad memory.

727
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,850
I forgot. You didn't
pass the assessment, right?

728
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,370
I thought you were quite capable.

729
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,610
How come you failed?

730
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,410
Hey, I'm talking to you.

731
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,520
Are you upset

732
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,650
because you can't go to Shanghai?

733
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,400
No.

734
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,010
I think Leshan is good.

735
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm happy I can stay here.

736
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:17,700
Really?

737
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,050
I have never heard anyone say

738
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,880
Leshan is better than Shanghai.

739
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,800
I think Leshan is better.

740
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,120
Sweet-skinned duck and barbecue skewers
can be found in Leshan.

741
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,670
It takes ten minutes to go to work.

742
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,760
The cost of living is low,
and life is happier here.

743
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,760
Most importantly,

744
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,170
my boyfriend is here with me.

745
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,690
I couldn't be happier.

746
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,360
You just don't want to admit it.

747
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,570
It's good to stay here.

748
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,400
Sometimes, people need
to accept the truth

749
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,800
that they are mediocre.

750
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,130
Having a pipe dream isn't practical.

751
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,010
You will still be working under me.

752
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,570
We have plenty of days ahead.

753
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,360
By the way, Guo.

754
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,610
Go downstairs

755
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,690
and buy me some beer.

756
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,400
Mr. Wang.

757
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,280
You are drinking goji berry and beer.

758
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,570
What's wrong with your body?

759
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,440
Stop laughing.

760
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,500
Why do you need that?

761
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,045
Don't interrupt. Get back to your work.

762
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,690
I'm talking to you,

763
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,690
Xia Guo.

764
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,800
Mr. Wang, I'm busy.

765
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,570
Are you giving me attitude?

766
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,530
Listen up, everyone.

767
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,920
I'm your boss.

768
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,050
Do you hear me?

769
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,050
You better learn your place.

770
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,610
Put your work aside

771
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,490
and buy me some beer.

772
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,050
Don't you get fresh with me?

773
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,920
Hello?

774
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,970
Guo, bring me two packs of cigarettes.

775
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,920
The money isn't enough.

776
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,880
You cover it first.
It's no big deal. Gosh.

777
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,920
Hurry back.

778
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,970
Hello?

779
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,450
(Honestly, I just want)

780
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,920
(to make my life a bit extraordinary.)

781
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,130
(My career can be a bit successful.)

782
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,970
(My life can be a bit exciting)

783
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,050
(and a bit enviable to others.)

784
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,800
Ms. Chen,

785
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,050
I look forward
to more collaborations between us.

786
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,800
Sure. Mr. Zhang,

787
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,010
please support Haowei.

788
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,360
- Well, we'll leave.
- See you.

789
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,690
- See you.
- Get in, please.

790
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:46,588
See you.

791
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,240
Ms. Chen.

792
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,280
Why have you been following me?

793
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:02,617
I heard you are going back
to Shanghai tomorrow.

794
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,200
I would like to talk to you.

795
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,840
I only have ten minutes.

796
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Make it quick.

797
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,410
I want to go to Shanghai with you.

798
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,680
You want to go to Shanghai?

799
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,970
You can't find barbecue skewers
everywhere in Shanghai.

800
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,320
Commute time is at least an hour,

801
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,130
the cost of living is high,

802
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,360
and life is less happy.

803
00:37:21,902 --> 00:37:23,388
Do you really want to go there?

804
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,200
You heard that?

805
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,280
You are Xia Guo, right?

806
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,410
Yes, I am.

807
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,130
I saw your result in the written test.

808
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,840
It's a shame. You didn't
meet the standard.

809
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
But I can do more than that.

810
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,360
That's why I want to try again.

811
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,200
You know

812
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,640
I don't determine

813
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,090
the recruiting standards.

814
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,217
If you want me
to make an exception for you,

815
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,570
you should give me a reason.

816
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,130
To be honest,

817
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,570
my boyfriend and I have been

818
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,931
making plans to go to Shanghai.

819
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,130
He has been accepted by a company there,

820
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,930
but I failed.

821
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,890
Ms. Chen,

822
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,320
Haowei is the top national food company.

823
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,090
Shanghai is a big city

824
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,450
that needs practical talent.

825
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,410
It's no use for one to
be good at learning by rote.

826
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:21,474
I have been to top performers
in sales at the Leshan branch.

827
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,680
If I could go to Shanghai,

828
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,930
I could prove myself better.

829
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,570
Also,

830
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,360
I like your heels.

831
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,570
I want to have them.

832
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,450
I don't really get your two reasons.

833
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,640
Xia Guo, are you so persistent?

834
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,160
Isn't Leshan a good place?

835
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,840
It's comfortable here.

836
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,680
Leshan is good.

837
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,200
This place is comfortable

838
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,320
and stable.

839
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,930
How should I put it?

840
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,360
The life here is predictable.

841
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,410
This is where three rivers converge.

842
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,360
Countless streams merge into rivers,

843
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,674
combine into a larger river,

844
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,450
and flow to a vast place.

845
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,090
I want to go to a vast place
to explore.

846
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,720
If Leshan is a small circle,

847
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,570
Shanghai is a bigger circle.

848
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,410
Beyond Shanghai,

849
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,090
there is an even bigger circle.

850
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,200
Every one of us

851
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,010
lives in our own circle.

852
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,130
If you want to go out,

853
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,090
you need to put in more effort.

854
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,720
I know.

855
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,280
But I can make more money in Shanghai.

856
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:35,702
I want to make big money.

857
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,530
I like that you are frank.

858
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,360
But if this choice

859
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,840
comes at the cost of losing something,

860
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,970
will you accept it?

861
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,090
I will.

862
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,360
Finish the handover of your work
as soon as possible.

863
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,160
I'd like to see you at Shanghai
on the first day of next month.

864
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,130
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

865
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,890
I made it!

866
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,010
We are going to Shanghai!

867
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,530
When we return five years later,

868
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,010
you should be Director Yu by then.

869
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,930
No, you are Boss Yu.

870
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,160
If so, you will be Madam Yu.

871
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,530
I don't want that. I'm Xia Guo.

872
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,680
I want to be Boss Xia.

873
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,610
Boss Yu will marry Boss Xia.

874
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,280
Boss Xia loves Boss Yu.

875
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,840
Once I get to Shanghai,

876
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,110
I want to visit the Oriental Pearl

877
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,800
and eat xiaolongbao in City God Temple.

878
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,490
Sure.

879
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,970
I want braised pork then.

880
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,410
I'm going to Shanghai.

881
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,840
We are going to Shanghai!

882
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,320
Cheers!

883
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,760
Dinner is on me tonight.

884
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,150
It's a farewell party for you both.

885
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,010
Let's dig up.

886
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,280
If so, we won't hold back.

887
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,570
You don't have to.

888
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,410
Why don't you both join me

889
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,800
to establish a company?

890
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,280
We can be our own bosses

891
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,530
and work for ourselves.

892
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,630
Wouldn't that be better?

893
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,130
Guo,

894
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
let's give Mr. Tang a toast.

895
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,320
Let's wish his new studio the best.

896
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,760
Here, Yiming.

897
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,550
- Here.
- To you.

898
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,840
Come.

899
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,010
Let's drink.

900
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,530
Yiming.

901
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,090
Wen Ya,

902
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,890
you are here.

903
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,490
I'm always here these days.

904
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,530
Scoot over.

905
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,530
Please sit.

906
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,970
- Take a seat.
- Please sit.

907
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,760
Mr. Fan went traveling,

908
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,970
so I have to mind the store.

909
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,090
No wonder.

910
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,160
Oh, right.

911
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,160
Do you remember Yu Jian?

912
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,530
She's our junior, Wen Ya.

913
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,620
Yu Jian.

914
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,760
Hello.

915
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,530
Hello.

916
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,240
Please sit.

917
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,680
I'm your junior
from the Management Department.

918
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,360
Yiming always talks about you.

919
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Finally, I meet you.

920
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,450
You are handsome.

921
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,160
Nice to meet you.

922
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,200
This is my girlfriend, Guo.

923
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

924
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,890
Hi.

925
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,050
What a beautiful couple.

926
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,840
Yu Jian,

927
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,010
this restaurant is newly designed.

928
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,800
Can you take a look for me?

929
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,610
The combination
of red bricks and log wood is good.

930
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,760
The hardness of red bricks
and the softness of log wood

931
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,530
make the entire space harmonious.

932
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,410
It's just that...

933
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,640
Well, just stop here.

934
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,550
Didn't you say you were hungry?
Come on and eat.

935
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,570
No.

936
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,570
Wait, Guo.

937
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,130
Let him finish. I want to hear.

938
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,760
Yeah, we want to hear.

939
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,930
Go on.

940
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,890
Let me see.

941
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,010
The horizontal facade division
is quite good.

942
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:38,531
Good design for functional zoning.

943
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,490
The problem is in
the vertical facade division.

944
00:42:42,817 --> 00:42:44,800
It appears that the available area
is maximized,

945
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,800
but in fact,

946
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,530
it disrupts the overall styles
and harmony.

947
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,160
How could we solve this?

948
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,410
You did this?

949
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,640
No, it doesn't matter who did it.

950
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,970
Just tell us how to solve this.

951
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,017
Either you demolish it

952
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,720
or replace it with wood

953
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,010
and wrought iron to
increase its transparency.

954
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,840
- It makes sense.
- This is unexpected.

955
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,760
You are quite right.

956
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,610
Well said.

957
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,450
Yu Jian, I'm planning
to open a flower shop.

958
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,050
Currently, I'm doing market research.

959
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,531
Could you help me with the design?

960
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,280
I'm sorry, Wen Ya.

961
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,410
We won't be in Leshan for long.

962
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,530
What he means is

963
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,320
that both of them
are leaving Leshan for Shanghai.

964
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,800
What a shame.

965
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
That's bad timing.

966
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,090
They are the most
clingy couple in Leshan.

967
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,720
Are you envious?

968
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,930
Of course.

969
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,640
Dinner is on me.

970
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,800
As a farewell party.

971
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,450
Order anything you want.

972
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,450
- Sure.
- Thank you.

973
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:48,750
Ms. Wen,
Yu Jian is leaving for Shanghai.

974
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,800
But we have time.

975
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,640
We are here.

976
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,970
You always are welcome here.

977
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:52,740
(Mom)
It's my mom.

978
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,490
Answer it for me.

979
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,800
She is going to nag again.

980
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,720
Answer it.

981
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,410
All right.

982
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,930
Tang, cheers.

983
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,980
Mrs. Yu, I'm Guo.

984
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,680
Yu Jian is with me. He...

985
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:07,840
What?

986
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,680
This way.

987
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,930
Mom.

988
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:20,280
- Son, you are here finally.
- What happened?

989
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,320
Sit down.

990
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:25,320
- What's wrong?
- I wonder what happened to your dad.

991
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,480
He has been inside for a while.

992
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,450
Where is Dad?

993
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,160
Inside there.

994
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,720
(CT Scan Room)
Mom, calm down.

995
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,640
Dad will be all right.

996
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:35,360
There is a compression fracture
in his first lumbar vertebra.

997
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,280
It's already compressed by half.

998
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,845
It's a dislocation associated
with a fracture.

999
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,160
It's severe.

1000
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,817
He needs surgery as soon as possible.

1001
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,160
(The untoward accident)

1002
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,760
(has shoved us)

1003
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,450
(to a crossroads in life.)

1004
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,200
(On one side, departure is arriving.)

1005
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,970
(On the other side,)

1006
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,570
(it's a deep familial bond.)

1007
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,450
(Where should I go?)

1008
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,640
(Where)

1009
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,090
