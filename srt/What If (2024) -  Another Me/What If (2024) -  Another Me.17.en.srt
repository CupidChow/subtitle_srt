(First Come, First Loved)

4
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,930
You're awake.

5
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,500
Why were you so late?

6
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,500
Did you drink?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,100
I had a little drink
with the client tonight.

8
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,580
Quite a day for you.

9
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,259
Go take a shower.
I'll prepare your things.

10
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,220
Wait.

11
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,540
I have a gift for you.

12
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,060
Here.

13
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,660
It's so pretty.

14
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,500
There's a little bear in here.

15
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,500
Honey,

16
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,220
what happened during the day
was my fault.

17
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,219
I've thought about it.

18
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,330
Just let the nanny share your burden.

19
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,620
And take your time finding a job.

20
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
I won't have any more opinions.

21
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,020
Really?

22
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,580
I used to think

23
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,730
that working outside was hard

24
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,339
worried about you suffering,

25
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,770
so I thought

26
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,810
I might as well just make money.

27
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,250
But I neglected

28
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,930
that you're brilliant too.

29
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,850
And you also have many goals to achieve.

30
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,810
So

31
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,700
you can go to work.

32
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,770
Leave everything at home to the nanny

33
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,730
and leave the money-making to me.

34
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,020
Thank you for understanding me.

35
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,449
Of course I have to.

36
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,810
If I don't understand you,

37
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,810
am I supposed to let others do it?

38
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,290
What are you talking about?

39
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,410
This is a preserved flower.

40
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,609
You can't get this
from an average florist.

41
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,660
Where did you get it?

42
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,060
This flower shop is new.

43
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,700
Your husband designed it.

44
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,100
Really?

45
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,020
We were celebrating it tonight.

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,339
If you like it,

47
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,730
we'll exclusively

48
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,660
get flowers from them.

50
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,100
Madam Qian, is that you in there?

51
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,770
Wait. A second. Just a second.

52
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,609
Ms. Wang, you scared me.

53
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,179
You're really good at drawing.

54
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,449
Why are you sneaking around?

55
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,140
I'm mopping the floor.
Go about your business.

56
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,700
Your feet, please.

57
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,489
Madam.

58
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,890
What took you so long? Look at the time.

59
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,219
I'm sorry, Mrs. Yu.

60
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,449
I have an important interview today.

61
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,179
I have to go first.

62
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,819
Let her know what you want.

63
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,980
I gotta go.

64
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,620
Hello, Mr. Yu.

65
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,930
Yu Jian,
what's going on with you lately?

66
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,580
What's wrong?

67
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,540
There are few pages on this drawing
where you've got the unit of measure wrong.

68
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,409
The costing came out

69
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,929
15% over budget.

70
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,770
Audit rejected all of them.

71
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,620
How could he make such a stupid mistake?

72
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,409
You've been in such a muddled state

73
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,770
at work lately.

74
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,410
I know you have a baby at home,

75
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,859
but you can't slack

76
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,440
(Budget 13.8 million. Exceeded 15%)
and make such a big mistake.

77
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,580
Sorry, sir. I...

78
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,450
Alright, you don't have to explain.

79
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,930
Hurry and have the drawings corrected.

80
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,299
You can't afford

81
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,660
to delay the construction.

82
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,850
Okay, I'll fix it immediately.

83
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Madam Li, leaving work so early?

84
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Yu.

85
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,219
I probably didn't do a good job,

86
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,810
so Mrs. Yu wasn't pleased.

87
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,370
I'm gonna go.

88
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,850
Thank you.

89
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,290
Okay.

90
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,290
Honey.

91
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,730
Ho...

92
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,290
The baby just fell asleep.

93
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,620
It's only been a few days,

94
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,620
yet we've switched many nannies.

95
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,220
Don't even mention it.

96
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,379
She fed Chen porridge

97
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,980
while cutting her nails.

98
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,060
She didn't admit it when I found out.

99
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,140
Good nannies are hard to find.

100
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,020
Come out for dinner.

101
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,850
I'm so busy
that I didn't have time to cook.

102
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,569
What would you like to eat?
I'll make it for you.

103
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,580
No.

104
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,250
It's ready made. Come on.

105
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,020
Did you get these from Mom?

106
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,140
Mom said you've worked hard
to take care of the baby.

107
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,930
She said
she'll take care of our future meals.

108
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,730
Here. Dig in.

109
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,690
In my opinion, we can't find

110
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,220
a satisfactory nanny.

111
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,490
Why don't we just let my mom do it?

112
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,490
Honey, I told you before.

113
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,929
Our parents aren't obligated
to take care of our children.

114
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,980
Yes.

115
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,739
But no matter what,

116
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,410
my mom is free labor.

117
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,610
We can just use her.

118
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,899
You're such a good son.

119
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,140
You take the free meals for granted too,
don't you?

120
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,100
It's tasty.

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,250
Stop asking Mom to cook.

122
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,740
She's worked hard enough
taking care of Dad

123
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,530
and still has to help us.

124
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,140
I feel bad.

125
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,020
So why don't we...

126
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,690
just move in with them?

127
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,860
Wouldn't that be easier?

128
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,370
Honey, let me tell you.

129
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,089
The elderly's living habits

130
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,220
are a little different from ours.

131
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,690
I don't want us to live together.

132
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,779
You can just say

133
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,940
that you can't get along with my mom.

134
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,169
So you've already worked it out.

135
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,060
And you're just informing me?

136
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,169
No. What are you talking about?

137
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,129
My mom knows you're looking for a job

138
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,140
and can't find a suitable nanny,

139
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,220
so she was kind enough to offer it.

140
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,940
But you didn't appreciate it.

141
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,490
I think
you're just biased against my mom.

142
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,459
How could I be biased?

143
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,250
It's not just your mom. My mom too.

144
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,659
Any parents who live with their children
for too long

145
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,969
will sooner or later have problems.

146
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,650
Why can other families do it?

147
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,329
Other families are united.

148
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,129
Other families

149
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,539
can live in harmony.

150
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,579
Why can't we do the same?

151
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,250
So you're saying it's my problem.

152
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,610
What I meant is

153
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,249
the so-called family conflicts

154
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,369
are just misunderstandings.

155
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,060
It's no big deal.

156
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,419
You don't have to
make it that complicated

157
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,940
and serious.

158
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,250
No, Yu Jian.

159
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,499
Sometimes I don't know

160
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,619
whether you're naive, simple,

161
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,900
or forgetful.

162
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,289
My mom won't even let you enter the ward
when I was in confinement.

163
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,200
Have you forgotten about it?

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,120
She kept giving you a hard time.
Are you okay with that?

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,060
I'm okay with it.

166
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,740
Why can't I be okay with it?

167
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,739
You just want to say

168
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,009
that my dad, my mom and Yu Yan the day
you went into labor.

169
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,089
Do you think otherwise?
Am I not wronged?

170
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,289
Yes, you were wronged.

171
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,450
It's my fault.

172
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,459
I didn't fulfill

173
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,049
my duties and obligations

174
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,290
as a father and a husband.

175
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,929
But what does it have to do with my mom?

176
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,009
She's simply fulfilling

177
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,739
her duties and obligations as a mother.

178
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,969
I'm not arguing with you

179
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,570
about who's right and who's wrong.

180
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,900
I just want to learn from my mistakes.

181
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,980
I don't want to bother anyone anymore.

182
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,329
Everyone has their own things to do

183
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,129
and their own obligations to fulfill.

184
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,329
But I can't gamble with Chen, okay?

185
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,820
In conclusion,

186
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,900
you're just annoyed
that everyone ignored you.

187
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,220
Guo, would you spare yourself?

188
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,499
You don't like what I do.

189
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,720
And you don't let my mom help us.

190
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,049
Yeah, sure.
We'll do what you say and find a nanny.

191
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,089
You're not pleased
with the nannies we hired.

192
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,499
So we kept changing nannies

193
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,779
and now our lives are messed up.

194
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,450
Are you happy now?

195
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,020
Chen!

196
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,040
(Emergency)

197
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,530
Okay. Thank you.

198
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,100
Is Chen alright?

199
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,940
He fell so hard just now.

200
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,820
Don't worry.
The doctor checked everything.

201
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,940
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have argued with you.

202
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,060
I was careless.

203
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,860
I'm not a good mother.

204
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,140
Guo.

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,250
It was an accident. It's not your fault.

206
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,100
You work very hard.

207
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,699
You hope everyone in our family

208
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,570
lives comfortably.

209
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,020
You try to reduce
unnecessary family conflicts

210
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,100
and my work stress.

211
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,610
Not only was I inconsiderate,

212
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,530
but I also criticized you.

213
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,100
It's my fault.

214
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,220
(Rixin Commerce and Trade HR)

215
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,779
(Xia Guo passed the interview)
Do you want to go home?

216
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,680
(The second interview is tomorrow)
We'll be home soon.

217
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,969
- Guo.
- We'll be home soon.

218
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,180
Look.

219
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,929
Maybe... Maybe I shouldn't go.

220
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,530
No. Go to the interview.

221
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,290
I'll take half a day off tomorrow
to stay home with Chen.

222
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,410
Baby.

223
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,969
Okay, got it.

224
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,179
Okay.

225
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,180
- I'll get up.
- Hello, Mom?

226
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,699
What's wrong?
Why are you calling me at this hour?

227
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,499
I miss my grandson.

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,060
Yu Chen's family.

229
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,020
- Here.
- You left a medical record here.

230
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,610
Medical record? What's wrong with Chen?

231
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,369
Nothing.

232
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,650
Are you in the hospital? Which hospital?

233
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,699
No wonder my eyelid
has been twitching all night.

234
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,929
It's been twitching nonstop.

235
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,140
No, Mom.

236
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,169
Well... Don't... Don't bother with it.

237
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,739
We can handle it.

238
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,779
Are you sure?

239
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,209
What were you doing
at the hospital then?

240
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,739
I'm telling you.

241
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,530
I'll come over and check tomorrow morning.

242
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,929
Jeez.

243
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,539
You two can't take good care of a baby.

244
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,020
And you won't even
let me take care of him.

245
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,659
You have to be more careful.

246
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,330
How did the baby end up in the hospital?

247
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,369
Okay.

248
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,659
I... I'll stop talking.

249
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,779
We're going home soon.

250
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,610
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

251
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,780
You're back.

252
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,060
Mom, what are you doing here?

253
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,860
He's asleep.

254
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,450
Where's Yu Jian?

255
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,780
I came to check on Chen.

256
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,220
Yu Jian was called away by his senior.

257
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,740
Hurry inside.

258
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,250
You look pale.

259
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,780
Go to bed and get some rest.

260
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,570
I'm fine, Mom.

261
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,899
Mom, stop mopping the floor.
Just leave it.

262
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
I'll mop it later.

263
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,410
Yu Jian told me everything.

264
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,610
You stayed up a few nights

265
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,859
for an interview.

266
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,410
Your body can't take it.

267
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,699
Be good. Go to bed and get some sleep.

268
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,900
I'll make dinner later.

269
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,100
Mom.

270
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,249
It's hard enough taking care of Dad.

271
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,819
Don't cook for us anymore.

272
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,819
We can handle it.

273
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,020
Sit down.

274
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,250
Sit down.

275
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,900
Guo, let me tell you.

276
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,290
I'm happy to take care of him and you.

277
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,100
Yu Jian said
you haven't found a suitable nanny.

278
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,459
You can't be too picky.

279
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,900
They're no match for family, right?

280
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,180
In my opinion,

281
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,539
you can't work

282
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,370
if you can't find
a suitable nanny, right?

283
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,980
How did the interview go?

284
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,900
They said they'll send me
a job offer next week.

285
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,250
Guo.

286
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,900
Guo's the best.

287
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,610
You have a fever.

288
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,860
Did you not realize it?

289
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,140
It's okay, Mom. I'll just sleep it off.

290
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,899
Lie down. Lie down immediately.

291
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,180
Why are you

292
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,530
so stubborn?

293
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,089
Just give me a call.

294
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,610
I won't ignore you. Here.

295
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,490
Jeez.

296
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,900
I'll make you some ginger water.

297
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,859
Get some rest.

298
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Thank you, Mom.

299
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,180
Give me a second.

300
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,740
(We stumble along parenthood)

301
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,859
(like babies.)

302
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,490
(Growing up,)

303
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,539
(we understand more)

304
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,610
(about how precious
our parents' love for us is.)

305
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,370
(Is the other you)

306
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,450

307
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,559
♪A wonderful life is a simple song♪

308
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,160

314
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,200
(Did your wish come true?)

315
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,739
(Do you have someone or something)

316
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,579
(you believe in?)

317
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,249
I can see there's been some effort done.

318
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,290
Yes.

319
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,410
Please come in.

320
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,410
Mr. Lu, you wanted to see me?

321
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,780
Xia Guo, let me introduce you.

322
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,129
This is the newly appointed
general manager

323
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,980
for Shanghai branch, Mr. Wu Yonghui.

324
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,330
Hello, Mr. Wu.

325
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,129
I've seen your proposals. They're good.

326
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,180
Thank you.

327
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,410
Have a seat.

328
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,860
Xia Guo.

329
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,250
There's one more thing I'd like to do
before my term

330
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,980
as acting general manager expires.

331
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,940
I need to hear your opinion.

332
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,169
Mr. Lu, you must be joking.

333
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,049
If you have any orders, just order me

334
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,450
to carry them out.

335
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,530
You answered so readily.

336
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,530
Is marketing director such an easy job?

337
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,220
Are you saying

338
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,180
you want to promote me
to marketing director?

339
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,490
Are you confident?

340
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,940
Of course.

341
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,250
But am I qualified?

342
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,499
Haowei never prioritizes seniority.

343
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,740
We appoint people on their abilities.

344
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,289
After months of close inspection,

345
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,739
With your professional skills,

346
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,060
your character,

347
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,250
coupled with your hard work and focus,

348
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,940
you can handle

349
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,060
the marketing department.

350
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
Okay, since Mr. Lu trusts me,

351
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,250
I'll do the job well.

352
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,250
I like how decisive you are.

353
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,100
Great. I look forward
to working together with you.

354
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,610
Yes.

355
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,490
HR told me in an email

356
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,459
that their chairman really liked you

357
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,530
after his interview with you.

358
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,329
They hope you can go soon.

359
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,740
You can book your flight now.

360
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,250
Why the rush?

361
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,060
I'd like to stay in Shanghai
for a few more days.

362
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,100
I have some unfinished business.

363
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,060
I'm not in a rush. They are.

364
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:58,899
Besides,

365
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,290
what business do you have here?

366
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,530
I haven't decided yet.

367
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,929
No. How could you not have decided?

368
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,690
As a professional manager,

369
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,360
you've worked
three years after three years.

370
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,860
You've done the best you can.

371
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,899
Quitting is the best move.

372
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,980
Yes.

373
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,490
It's not the wrong path. I just...

374
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,610
You just want to
spend more time with your girlfriend.

375
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,459
If you're so reluctant to part with her,

376
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,220
you can ask her to send you there.

377
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,610
Think of it as a trip.

378
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,820
Brandon.

379
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,779
It's hard

380
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,289
to find such a good offer again.

381
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,899
You'll regret it if you miss it.

382
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,370
I don't want to regret it either.

383
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,450
Yes, that's good.

384
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,060
Go there and settle down first.

385
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,220
You can bring
your girlfriend over later.

386
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,690
(Xia Guo: I'll buy you dinner tonight.)

387
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,410
(I have good news to tell you.)

388
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,900
(Xue Yuming: My treat.
I have something to say too.)

389
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,690
(Sanchuan. See you at six.)

390
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,650
Please enjoy the meal.

391
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,370
Thank you.

392
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,690
I love this bean sprout.

393
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,740
You're in a good mood.

394
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,530
Looks like
it's not the average good news.

395
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,819
You got a promotion,

396
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,020
what extraordinary good news it is.

397
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,530
You got a promotion.

398
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,940
Jeez.
You can really figure everything out.

399
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,820
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Let's start over.

400
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,290
You got a promotion?

401
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,129
Congratulations, Director Xia.

402
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,779
You finally got what you wished for
in only two years.

403
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,499
Good job.

404
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,780
You're so good at acting.

405
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,129
Bottoms up.

406
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,330
Sure.

407
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,049
Do you think my ambition

408
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,330
is just to become a director?

409
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,490
Your ambitions are quite big.

410
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,900
But

411
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,140
I probably advise against
climbing the corporate ladder.

412
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,820
Why?

413
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,860
You can start your own business.

414
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,459
Who told me at the beginning of the year

415
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,009
that I wasn't qualified enough?

416
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,089
You're indeed under-qualified

417
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,009
for a senior position in Haowei.

418
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,100
But if you start your own business,

419
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,100
you only need one suitable opportunity.

420
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,820
Really.

421
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,780
It's nice to be my own boss.

422
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,290
But if I start my own business,

423
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,289
you'll have trouble finding me 24/7.

424
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,049
Who will accompany you to meals

425
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,690
and dates?

426
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,650
Yes.

427
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,450
You're right.

428
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,570
Director Xia is better.

429
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm content

430
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,570
with my life right now.

431
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,290
I want it to stay this way.

432
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,140
By the way, what did you want to say?

433
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,899
Didn't you say on WeChat

434
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,330
you had something to tell me?

435
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,289
I forgot.

436
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,369
What about your job?

437
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,610
Did you get any results?

438
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,940
We're still communicating. Soon.

439
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,100
It must be good news.

440
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,779
We'll celebrate

441
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,739
when the results come back.

442
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,579
Sure.

443
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,740
You're going to cook then.

444
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,250
You've emailed it, right?

445
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,690
Okay, I'll check it now.

446
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,980
Where's my laptop?

447
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,249
Help me check.

448
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,699
Okay.

449
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,860
Okay. Thank you.

450
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,020
I'll check it now.

451
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,060
I'll do it as soon as possible.

452
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,650
Yes, I know.

453
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,330
Okay, I...

454
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,100
I gotta go.

455
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,760
(Singapore Appointment Notice)

456
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,969
The offer from Singapore came through.

457
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,980
Yes.

458
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,650
They just sent it.

459
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,100
I didn't get a chance to tell you yet.

460
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,100
So is that

461
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,330
what you wanted to tell me today?

462
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,530
Yes.

463
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,699
But I didn't say anything

464
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,410
because I didn't want to ruin your mood.

465
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,490
You just got a promotion.

466
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,220
Ruin my mood?

467
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,900
It's a big deal.

468
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,100
Besides, I'm the one who wronged you.

469
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,969
I kept making you accompany me

470
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,289
that I ignored something so important.

471
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,180
No, no, no.

472
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,209
I have a lot of options to choose from.

473
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,610
It's just that its salary and position

474
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,490
are in line with my expectations.

475
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,290
It's that simple.

476
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,220
No need to apologize.

477
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,969
I told you

478
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,129
it was me who should have left Haowei.

479
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,539
No.

480
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,899
Otherwise,

481
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,419
and even go to Singapore.

482
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,370
Xia Guo, Xia Guo.

483
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,140
My leaving is the best option.

484
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,129
Like I said,

485
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,289
You can continue working in Haowei.

486
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,819
Then, wait for an opportunity to leave.

487
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,860
I'll invest

488
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,410
and not be at anyone's beck and call,

489
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,180
That's our plan.

490
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,690
Okay?

491
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,490
I'll go to Singapore with you.

492
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,410
You want to go to Singapore...

493
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,020
Yes.

494
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
With me?

495
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,490
What's wrong?

496
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,140
I...

497
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,650
I'll think about it.

498
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,659
I don't care.

499
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,450
I don't want to part with you.

500
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,929
I'm going there for work.

501
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,610
I'm not leaving you.

502
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,249
It's not that.

503
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,009
Long distance relationships won't work.

504
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,859
Transportation is very convenient now.

505
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,779
I can always come back.

506
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,289
I can even come back once a week.

507
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,089
You can come and see me.

508
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,089
But there will be

509
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,900
another possibility.

510
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,329
I don't want that possibility.

511
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,250
You're all I want.

512
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,290
I have confidence in me.

513
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,570
I'm more confident in our relationship.

514
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,089
But I just want to be by your side.

515
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,020
I just want to be by your side.

516
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,100
You just got promoted to be marketing director

517
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,900
then you go to Singapore with me.

518
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,899
It might feel new to you at first.

519
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,450
But over time,

520
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,659
since Singapore is not a big place,

521
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,220
you'll soon get bored.

522
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,410
When that happens,
you'll have to look for a job

523
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,100
from scratch and keep getting rejected.

524
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,009
Do you like how that feels?

525
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,009
You don't have to worry about that. I...

526
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,089
I didn't tell you

527
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,980
because I was scared.

528
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,900
What do you mean?

529
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,169
You don't want me to work in Singapore

530
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,539
or you don't want me to follow you?

531
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,579
I don't want you

532
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,969
to lose yourself for me.

533
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,450
Lose myself?

534
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,980
How is this about losing myself?

535
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,459
I could get a job too.

536
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,140
I'm not afraid of hard work.

537
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,180
Xue Yuming, I want to ask you.

538
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,089
Am I included in your future?

539
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,220
Have you ever thought about marrying me?

540
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,499
What do you think?

541
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,619
I'm asking you.

542
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,140
That's different.

543
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,290
Are you afraid to answer?

544
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,779
What can I say to you at this point?

545
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,659
I want to know your answer.

546
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,860
I can't answer that.

547
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,820
I thought we were the same.

548
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,140
You came to Shanghai from Leshan

549
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,619
with your heart set on your career.

550
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,819
So you can understand

551
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,940
my situation and my choice.

552
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,780
Not to mention I'm a man.

553
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,650
You don't understand me.

554
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,929
(You don't want me to work in Singapore)

555
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,209
(or you don't want me to follow you?)

556
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,249
(I don't want you)

557
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,100
(to lose yourself for me.)

558
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,820
(Xue Yuming, I want to ask you.)

559
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,899
(Am I included in your future?)

560
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,579
Have you ever thought about marrying me?

561
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,060
I can't answer that.

562
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,419
You have good taste, Sir.

563
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,419
This diamond ring is part of our classic

564
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,499
six-prong ring collection.

565
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,250
And it's 2.88 carats.

566
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,419
(Miss, do you want
to have a diamond ring?)

567
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,289
(We have a new batch of diamonds)

568
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,779
of excellent color and clarity.

569
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,290
The design is also classic.

570
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,290
Perfect for weddings or proposals.

571
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,060
I can show them to you.

572
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,330
Sir.

573
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,180
Thank you.

574
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,290
Goodbye.

575
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,860
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,289
I wasn't thinking

577
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,650
from your point of view.

578
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,370
You're right not to like

579
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,100
long-distance relationships.

580
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,450
It's my fault. I was selfish.

581
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,129
I'm not afraid of

582
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,610
living in a new place.

583
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,330
Let alone starting over.

584
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,780
What I'm afraid of
is we'll go backward

585
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,820
or even losing you.

586
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,860
So can you give me a chance?

587
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,740
Come to Singapore with me.

588
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,860
Even if you can't find the right job,

589
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,060
it doesn't matter.

590
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,940
I'll take care of you.

591
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,370
Because I can't live without you.

592
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,450
Will you?

593
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,650
(But what would have happened)

594
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,020
(if I didn't go to Singapore with him?)

595
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,570
(Life is full of courage and luck.)

596
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,610
(Your leaving made me realize)

597
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,650
(that there are times
when things are not good)

598
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,610
(and times when things aren't right.)

599
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,659
(Fate will send us)

600
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,690
(on different paths again.)

601
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,940
(Separation)

602
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,370

(that the moment of gain

636
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,220
(So we prepared ourselves)

637
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,499
(and practiced separation every day.)

(Zheng Tuqiang)

639
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,180
(However,)

640
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,370
(separation comes unexpectedly)

641
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,940

(Finance Room)

644
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,180
(is being separated)

645
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,020
(without saying goodbye properly.)

646
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,250
Your mom

647
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,140
refused to let me tell you.

648
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,650
She found out about it for about a year ago

649
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,780
but refused to have surgery.

650
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,490
The doctor said

651
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,100
she might not make it.

652
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,740
I thought it might be too late

653
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,690
if I still don't call you.

654
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,860
Talk to your mom

655
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,740
when she wakes up.

656
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,249
Mom, you've worked hard these days.

657
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,779
I can't take care of Chen.

658
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,739
Keep me posted

659
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,139
on your mom's condition.

660
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,490
Okay.

661
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,100
What should we do?

662
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,220
Gosh.

663
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,900
Hello? Go ahead.

664
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,329
Salt?

665
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,129
Isn't that in the cabinet by the sink?

666
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,780
Can't you see the word written on it?

667
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,450
Where does it hurt?

668
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,860
Why do you have so many issues?

669
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,180
Just suck it up.

670
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,650
Jeez.

671
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,049
Guo, do you have enough money on you?

672
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,969
I'll get you some cash tomorrow.

673
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,140
No thanks, Mom.

674
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,650
Mom.

675
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,929
After you finish your meal,

676
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,900
take Chen home with you.

677
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,530
Don't worry about me.

678
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,570
What... What did you say?

679
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,690
I said take Chen home with you.

680
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,610
Yu Jian and I will pack up

681
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,060
and move back in with you.

682
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,129
Are you saying

683
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,650
I can carry our Chen

684
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,900
home?

685
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,819
You've worked hard, Mom.

686
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,290
It's nothing. Go about your business.

687
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,129
Go.

688
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,410
I'll pack up.

689
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,450
Chen.

690
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,020
We're going home.

691
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,980
Are you happy too?

692
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,920
(Outpatient)

693
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,819
Mom, Mom, are you awake?

694
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,419
Mom.

695
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,690
Mom.

696
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,020
I asked Mr. Zheng not to tell you.

697
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,780
But he told you anyway.

698
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,740
Why did you keep it from me?

699
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,490
Everyone has one's own destiny.

700
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,610
I don't want to burden you.

701
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,579
Why do you always do this?

702
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,530
I'm your daughter.

703
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,330
Do you think I'll thank you
for doing that?

704
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,180
Honey, don't say that.

705
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,530
I never wanted you to thank me.

706
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,740
You think

707
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,530
I'm a bad mother.

708
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,610
I've spent my life

709
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,060
doing what I want to do.

710
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,940
I never compromised.

711
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,780
But people

712
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,780
will always have a lot of regrets.

713
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,860
In my last year, I tried to be

714
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,100
a good mother and grandmother.

715
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,330
Right? Guo.

716
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,650
Mom, we get it.

717
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,860
Guo gets it too.

718
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,820
Is Chen okay?

719
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,650
He's fine.

720
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,290
My mom's looking after him. Don't worry.

721
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,740
You two are young.

722
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,020
You still have a long way to go.

723
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,980
Don't put too much pressure

724
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,180
on your life and work.

725
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,570
Yu Jian.

726
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,410
I'll leave Guo to you.

727
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,900
Then I can put my mind at ease.

728
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,370
You two need to

729
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,100
raise Chen well.

730
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:34,969
Mom.

731
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,370
Mom.

732
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,929
Mom.

733
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,060
Mom.

734
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,410
Mom.

735
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,450
(Your mom says it's not easy for you)

736
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,610
(So she refused to tell you about it.)

737
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,539
(As for your monthly rent,
she didn't make it her own.)

738
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,180
(House Ownership Certificate)
(She had them saved in the bank.)

739
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,610
(She changed the house ownership
after she found herself ill.)

740
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,410
(She left it to you.)

741
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,740
(Your name is the only name on it now.)

742
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:09,120
(Buddha Pioneer)

743
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,570
You came back.

744
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,780
Why?

745
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,330
Why did she leave so suddenly?

746
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,100
I stayed by the hospital bed day by day.

747
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,250
She never opened her eyes again.

748
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,250
Don't blame yourself too much.

749
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,370
She wouldn't want to see you this upset.

750
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,140
She never blamed you before she left.

751
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,180
I'd rather have her wake up
and yell at me.

752
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,370
She'll be so happy for you

753
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,819
when she sees what you've achieved.

754
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,940
What I've achieved?

755
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,530
What have I achieved?

756
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,249
Watching everyone around me leave

757
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,860
and not being able to do anything?

758
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,220
And now she's gone too.

759
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,450
She told me before she left

760
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,900
that she was a selfish mother,

761
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,980
but she lived her life
without complaint.

762
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,220
Because she made the choice she wanted.

763
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,860
She had no regret or grievance.

764
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,740
Right.

765
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,690
She lived the life she wanted.

766
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,140
What about us?

767
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,570
Did we make the right choices?

768
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,570
When we stood at the crossroads of fate,

769
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,860
didn't we both make our own choices?

770
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,370
Yeah.

771
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,690
It's all my choice.

772
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,290
She also said

773
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,690
In life, whatever road...

774
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,820
Whatever road you may choose,

775
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,220
you may regret it.

776
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,980
But once you decide,

777
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,140
you have to go on.

778
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,530
It will end well.

779
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,370
She told me not to be afraid or regret.

780
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,140
If you could do it all over again,

781
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,610
would you make the same choices?

782
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,330
We don't get second chances in life.

783
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,610
We can't start over.

784
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,100
We all need to move on.
