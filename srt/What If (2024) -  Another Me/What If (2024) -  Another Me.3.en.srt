(Within Reach And Out of Reach)

4
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:51,380
Regarding
the live stream incident yesterday,

5
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,270
I've already discussed it with Ms. Chen.

6
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,980
Take disciplinary actions
against you alone.

7
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,914
We'll deduct 3,000 yuan
from your monthly wage.

8
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,830
Mr. Xue,

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,190
why am I the only one punished?

10
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,410
I didn't give Xiao Jie the order
to replenish the goods.

11
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,270
It was Tim.

12
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,780
I can accept it
if I was punished with him...

13
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,660
The encrypted key for backend goods
replenishment is only accessible

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,430
on the PCs meant for
the Marketing Department, am I right?

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,590
Mr. Xue, firstly,

16
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,150
I'm not the one mainly
responsible for the mistake.

17
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,100
Secondly,

18
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,500
the company has never designated

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,100
the maximum quantity limits
for different sales channels, right?

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,870
The more products we sell
through e-commerce,

21
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,942
the more money
our company will make as well.

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,070
Did Chen Nan tell you that?

23
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,350
She just thinks

24
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,780
that you should support and promote

25
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,220
more cooperation
with our live-stream e-commerce.

26
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,630
There's a limited amount of space
one can occupy in that field.

27
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,430
If we don't occupy it,

28
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,540
- the others...
- Xia Guo.

29
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,070
The resource allocation

30
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,030
for both online and offline channels

31
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,870
cannot be decided by me or her alone,

32
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,940
not to mention you.

33
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,820
Understood?

34
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,940
Is there anything else?

35
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,500
The door is behind you.

36
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,940
Let's not drag this out any longer.

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,430
Let's hurry and deal with this.

38
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,070
Ms. Nan, are you okay?

39
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,780
Okay.

40
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,540
Alright.

41
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,260
Ms. Nan,

42
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,980
why must I take the blame?

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,260
It was obviously Tim's fault.

44
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,800
Many things in life cannot be discerned
by right or wrong alone.

45
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,220
Don't you know that?

46
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,500
Even so, the company
has to be reasonable.

47
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,680
This isn't fair
to the Marketing Department.

48
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,640
How can we proceed with our work now?

49
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,820
The wrongdoer wasn't punished.

50
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,460
The people beside him
are punished instead.

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,630
There's no way I can do this.

52
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,940
If so, you should leave.

53
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,750
No one will stop you.

54
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,870
Xia Guo,

55
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,400
why did you come to Shanghai
in the first place?

56
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,750
I'm here to make money.

57
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,100
If so, you have to be capable enough.

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,260
Didn't you promise me in Leshan

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,940
that you could withstand pressure?

60
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,700
You can't take it when you're
dealing with such a minor issue?

61
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,910
Seems like I was wrong about you.

62
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,430
How about I tell

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,620
the Finance Department
to book a flight for you this afternoon.

64
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,630
You may leave anytime.

65
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,670
I don't want to go back.

66
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,750
If so, you should do your best here.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,930
The issues you'll encounter later
will be much more troublesome than it.

68
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,000
You're actually dejected
over such a minor issue?

69
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,900
Don't be a snowflake.

70
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,110
And, I need to remind you of this.

71
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,990
Xue Yuming is not just picking on
the Marketing Department,

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,880
but he's also picking on me
most of the time.

73
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,380
And, you're the person I recruited.

74
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,310
You have to be extra careful
in the future. Understood?

75
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,670
Got it, Ms. Nan.

76
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,670
Here.

77
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:51,430
I have plenty of meal appointments
this month. I'm not using my meal card.

78
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,310
We above the mid-tier
have meal allowances.

79
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,028
It'll go to waste if you don't use it.

80
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,550
Just take it. My hands are sore.

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,940
Go and have something meal.

82
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:05,000
After that, come back and work harder.

83
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,140
(Haowei Food Group)

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,870
(That GM of yours)

85
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,900
(is too much.)

86
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,070
He's inhumane.

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,380
He's worse than Wang Chang'an.

88
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,670
I have to live in fear every day.

89
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,110
Luckily, I have Ms. Nan.

90
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,870
She gave me
her meal card this afternoon.

91
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,020
I'm sure she knew my wage was docked.

92
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:44,085
She felt sorry for me.

93
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,285
Luckily, you have Ms. Chen
covering your back.

94
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,900
If so, why are you eating that?

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,460
I'm too shy to use it.

96
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm already grateful
that she's this nice to me.

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,020
Yeah. We don't lack that money either.

98
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:58,020
(Oh, is Mr. Yu going to be transferred
to another hospital tomorrow?)

99
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,340
(If so, you don't need to be
on the night shift every day.)

100
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:01,857
That's not happening.

101
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:03,114
My mother is worried about him.

102
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,714
(She insists on letting him
stay here for a few more days.)

103
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Is that so?

104
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,750
That's good too. At least
his condition is stable.

105
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,750
However, it'll be hard on you.

106
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,940
It's not that bad.

107
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,190
Actually,

108
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm not on night shift duty every day.

109
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,500
By the way, stop
mailing stuff to my parents.

110
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:23,260
(You got yourself a terrible GM.)

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,685
(You should keep the money,)

112
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:25,990
(buy meals for your colleagues,)

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,980
(and try to foster
good relationships with them.)

114
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,580
I don't want to foster relationships
with other people.

115
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,550
Yam Head, you should come here quickly.

116
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,340
I don't wish to be alone anymore.

117
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Don't cry.

118
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,750
If you cry, it feels like
I'm bullying you.

119
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,310
By the way,

120
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,340
I have a gift for you.

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,580
What is it?

122
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,430
An oscillator?

123
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,260
Why did you buy that?

124
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,460
Who told you to make yourself
look so pitiful?

125
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,600
You couldn't bear
to clean your ears outside.

126
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,460
I was just exaggerating it.

127
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,940
I was just unhappy with
the cost of living here.

128
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,020
Now, you know.

129
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,310
Your boyfriend's service
is still valuable.

130
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,820
You can't live without me, right?

131
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,700
Here, listen to this.

132
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,070
I miss you so much!

133
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,000
Why are you crying again?

134
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,670
Should I cry too and join in the fun?

135
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,990
What's wrong?

136
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,640
I'll hang up first.

137
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,630
Something cropped up.

138
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,940
Hello?

139
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:42,550
You're still working overtime?

140
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,940
Why are you having
our competitor's product

141
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,200
instead of
the company's self-heating hot pot?

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,310
This is Bowl Chicken-Flavored.

143
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,971
Our company doesn't have this flavor.

144
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,900
And, I just want to know

145
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,430
the strengths and weaknesses
of our competitor's products.

146
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,028
You're from Sichuan, huh?

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,380
Bowl Chicken.

148
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,457
Are you only having this for dinner?

149
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,820
My wage was just docked.

150
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:16,260
What else can I eat besides this?

151
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,490
Mr. Xue, could it be
that you wish to treat me to a meal?

152
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,700
Sure, I'll treat you to a meal.

153
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,430
What do you want?

154
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,790
Forget it.

155
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,670
I haven't finished my work yet.

156
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:29,571
I don't want my wage to be docked again.

157
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,820
Okay.

158
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,980
Didn't you realize

159
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,100
that I was being concerned
about you just now?

160
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,670
Alright. Don't stay here too late.

161
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,030
Go back early.

162
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,030
Why are you only here now?

163
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,510
Where did you go?

164
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,990
I went to set up our display in IKEA.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,940
I saw the text in our group chat
and I rushed here.

166
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,580
What's going on?

167
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,300
You got yourself
in huge trouble this time.

168
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,460
You better don't make a sound

169
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,310
when Mr. Xue is here.

170
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,940
If not, he might go after you.

171
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,220
Me?

172
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,940
What have I done again?

173
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,390
Stop. He's here.

174
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,340
(Food Promotion Seminar)
Tomorrow's the first day

175
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,190
of our Chinese New Year
promotional season.

176
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,620
According to the feedback
from our partner,

177
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,820
for the keto cake we introduced,
we still

178
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,550
haven't met
the contractual requirement

179
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,820
for five shopping malls' worth
of stock volume.

180
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,750
They're urging us to provide them
with the goods.

181
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,550
But our warehouse in Shanghai
has run out of goods.

182
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,100
Now, it's 4 PM.

183
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,670
We have 18 hours until 10 AM tomorrow,

184
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,000
which is the operating hour
for shopping malls.

185
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:13,740
Guys, how should we resolve this?

186
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,940
Why don't I speak to Xiao Jie first?

187
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,820
I'll tell her to delay
the online shipments

188
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:23,580
and transfer half of the inventory here
to support our offline sales.

189
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:24,510
That's impossible.

190
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,580
But why?

191
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,100
Because you told me personally

192
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,340
that Xiao Jie's live stream
was the first time our brand

193
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,657
is making an appearance online.

194
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,910
We've given the customers our promise.

195
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,485
Do you want the effort
of our online customers to go in vain?

196
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,820
Are you a member?

197
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,670
(Free SPA)
We're doing a promotion today.

198
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,620
You can enjoy our services for free.

199
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,270
What about presale vouchers?

200
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,430
Continue.

201
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,620
Is it possible for us

202
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,430
to turn the lack of goods

203
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,150
into presale vouchers?

204
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,900
Just like those massage parlors.

205
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,270
Reload the card and get a discount.

206
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,690
Then, go for the services.

207
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,580
We can let our customers

208
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,430
buy presale vouchers

209
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,570
so that they can redeem
their products in the future.

210
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,460
Lucky bag.

211
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,820
We can turn it into a lucky bag.

212
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,020
We'll put some free gifts inside.

213
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,700
Not only
can we satisfy our customers,

214
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,510
we'll also make them feel
as if they're getting a discount.

215
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,740
And, we can buy time
for our production line and logistics.

216
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
That won't do.

217
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,740
Presale vouchers are viable

218
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,700
for products like daily necessities.

219
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:24,910
(Ketogenic Cake)
Our product

220
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,270
isn't considered a daily necessity.

221
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,980
If we use such a method,

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,390
our customers will definitely think

223
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,740
that it's a sales gimmick.

224
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,460
It'll definitely affect

225
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,550
their purchase experience

226
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,114
and their acknowledgment of our brand.

227
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,150
Moreover,

228
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,740
I don't think shopping malls
will support our method.

229
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,550
I do think we can give it a try.

230
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,270
We can put different products
into a gift box.

231
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,670
After that, we can turn it
into a lucky bag, right?

232
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:55,620
That's right, Mr. Xue.

233
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,070
Then we'll put the presale voucher

234
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,885
and the samples of the five new products

235
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,110
and launch in the next quarter
into the lucky bag.

236
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,510
That's pretty good.

237
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,460
The lucky bag can attract customers

238
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,460
while we can promote
our new products too.

239
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,580
I think it's a great idea.

240
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,190
Ms. Chen,

241
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,390
head to the Finance Department
and request a temporary budget.

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,500
Transfer it to our suppliers'
bank accounts immediately.

243
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,740
Xia Guo, go and calculate

244
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,700
the number of new product samples
we need.

245
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,820
If we don't have enough,

246
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,930
you can fill them with
the ready goods in the warehouse.

247
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,670
Lucy, find a supplier
to design our lucky bag

248
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:29,860
and the presale vouchers.

249
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,060
Then head to the warehouse
and proceed with the packaging.

250
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,910
(Full of Prosperity)
Then,

251
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,657
send them to the shopping malls
immediately and set up the display.

252
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,030
The rest of you will be

253
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,620
assigned to the warehouse
and shopping malls accordingly

254
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
to assist in the packaging
and display set-up.

255
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,940
All of you have to make sure
the lucky bags are available

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
on the first day
of our promotional season.

257
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:06,660
- Good job.
- Mr. Xue, why are you here?

258
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,600
- Supper.
- Thank you.

259
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,510
For everyone.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,860
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

261
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,970
- Thanks, Mr. Xue.
- Thanks.

262
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,820
Take a break.

263
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,840
You should have something.

264
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,910
Take a break.

265
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,030
No thanks, Mr. Xue.

266
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,460
I should remain in my post.

267
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,285
Or I won't be able to explain myself
if something happens again.

268
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,270
I'm here.

269
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,857
I'll bear all of the responsibilities
if something does happen.

270
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,430
Am I terrifying?

271
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
I'm terrified of you.

272
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:45,714
I'm terrified at the thought
that my wage might vanish.

273
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,030
Sit down.

274
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,980
I'll have a chat with you.

275
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Sit down and chat.

276
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,510
You do like to bear a grudge, huh?

277
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,620
You felt like you were wronged, huh?

278
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,670
Fine. Let me tell you this.

279
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,150
Your PC is your weapon.

280
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,870
You didn't look after your weapon
and let someone

281
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,200
use it without permission.

282
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,670
Would you remember your lesson
if I didn't punish you?

283
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,220
So, you knew

284
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,430
that I was implicated by Tim?

285
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,150
You don't say?

286
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,620
You should've told me earlier.

287
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,800
I was depressed for so long, you know?

288
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,220
Now, I feel much better.

289
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,220
You're happy now?

290
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,940
Yeah.

291
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:48,910
You should have some.

292
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,980
Thanks.

293
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,790
Good job.

294
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,200
Diced Chicken With Chili Peppers?

295
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
How did you know that I craved this?

296
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
You're from Sichuan.

297
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,685
My goodness. I have been craving
spicy food for a long time.

298
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:07,660
Mr. Xue, don't you want some?

299
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,430
I'm not hungry.

300
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,100
I'll eat, then.

301
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,310
Eat up.

302
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,820
It tastes just like my hometown cooking.

303
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,820
Mr. Xue, I have one more question.

304
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,980
Ask away.

305
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,790
Why did you only punish me
without punishing Tim?

306
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,190
You should ask Ms. Chen about that.

307
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,980
(Yam Head)

308
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,860
Guo.

309
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:49,228
What were you busy with?

310
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,220
What took you so long?

311
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,970
I was working overtime
in the supermarket.

312
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,070
I didn't hear your call.

313
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,790
My mother had a sudden headache.

314
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,314
What's wrong with Mrs. Yu?

315
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,430
She's fine.

316
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,742
I brought her to the ER Department
to get an X-ray scan.

317
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,220
However, I'm not confident
in the doctors here.

318
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:04,860
I just want to ask you

319
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,460
if you can head
to a first-tier hospital in Shanghai

320
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,810
and make an appointment with them

321
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,057
so that they can take
an X-ray scan for my mother?

322
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:12,790
Which department should I go to?

323
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,700
The Neurology Department.

324
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm new to the place.

325
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know
which hospital is good enough.

326
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,440
Coming!

327
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,310
Guo,

328
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,610
why don't you inquire about it?

329
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,500
I'll hang up first.
I need to send my mom home.

330
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,220
Alright, be careful, then.

331
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,110
I'll talk to you later.

332
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,860
Okay.

333
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,820
Goodbye.

334
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,100
It's hard to make an appointment
with the hospitals in Shanghai.

335
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,742
Which department are you looking for?

336
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,620
The Neurology Department.

337
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,220
My boyfriend's mother
went for a brain CT scan.

338
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,550
He wants her to come here for a checkup.

339
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:44,430
But I don't know
which hospital to go to.

340
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,430
Hospital Ruihua.

341
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,730
The Neurology Department
of Hospital Ruihua is pretty good.

342
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,510
You have to get a number online first.

343
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,980
If you fail, you have to
line up in the hospital.

344
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,670
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

345
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,740
Eat up.

346
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,460
Finish it while it's hot.

347
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,430
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,190
Hospital Ruihua.

349
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,420
(Hospital Ruihua, Shanghai)

350
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,270
Go now.

351
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,380
Give me your paper.

352
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,580
Done.

353
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,510
Next.

354
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,380
(Counter)

355
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,070
Okay.

356
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,790
Okay. Next.

357
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,270
Hello.

358
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,580
May I make an appointment with

359
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,200
specialists in the Neurology Department?

360
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,142
Their schedules are full
until next month.

361
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:46,000
What about regular outpatient diagnosis?

362
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:47,230
That's available.

363
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:48,590
Do you have a pre-examination form?

364
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,270
A pre-examination form?

365
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,950
Get a pre-examination form.

366
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,542
Come back and queue after that.

367
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,310
Sorry about this.

368
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,650
I've been queuing for a long time.

369
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,020
Can you please make an exception?

370
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,950
That's the rule here.

371
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,710
Next.

372
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,030
Can you hurry up?

373
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,510
You need to get a pre-examination.

374
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,380
Why are you here

375
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,790
if you don't even know about that?

376
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,990
Miss, don't be impatient.

377
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,360
The counter is over there.

378
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,860
Go and take a number.

379
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,620
It'll be quick.

380
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,514
It won't take long.

381
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,100
Go now.

382
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,180
Don't be impatient.

383
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,030
Thank you.

384
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,070
Excuse me. Please make way. Thank you.

385
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,270
What do you need?

386
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,580
A number of Neurology Department.

387
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,742
The Neurology Department?

388
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:26,140
Come back in the afternoon.

389
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,550
- In the afternoon?
- That's right.

390
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
- Next.
- Not now?

391
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,420
No.

392
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:29,990
Next.

393
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,740
- What do you need?

394
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,860
Stomachache, right?

395
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,130
Come back in the afternoon.

396
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,270
- Excuse me.
- Next.

397
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,470
Here.

398
00:18:48,060 --> 00:19:01,060
(Outpatient Department)

399
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,340
Miss,

400
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,810
which specialist are you trying to see?

401
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,660
What do you mean?

402
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,370
Which specialist you're trying to see?

403
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,685
You want to make an appointment?

404
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,857
Make an appointment?

405
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,070
Yeah.

406
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,610
Which one? The Orthopedics Department?
Or the Oncology Department?

407
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,180
What?

408
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,085
So, you're from another state, huh?

409
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,257
You couldn't understand me?

410
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,457
I was asking you
which specialist you're trying to see.

411
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,828
Is it the Orthopedics Department?

412
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:25,400
The Oncology Department?

413
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,170
Internal Medicine or Surgery Department?

414
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
The Neurology Department.

415
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,270
I need a number of it.

416
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,030
No way, alright?

417
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,220
How about the Oncology Department?

418
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,420
Listen, I'm great friends with the head
of the Oncology Department.

419
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,820
I'll give you a discount, okay?

420
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,340
No thanks.

421
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,270
Hello?

422
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,100
Guo, did you manage
to make an appointment?

423
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,428
No.

424
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,980
I have to wait until next month
to make an appointment online.

425
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,080
I'm at the hospital now.

426
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,990
I can't get an appointment here as well.

427
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,030
Guo,

428
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,510
can you be flexible for once?

429
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,990
If this hospital doesn't work out,

430
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,170
we can find another hospital

431
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,200
and get another doctor.

432
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,580
Didn't you say you wanted
to see the best doctor here?

433
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,390
The Neurology Department
in Hospital Ruihua

434
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,990
is the best in Shanghai.

435
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,180
Ms. Liu,

436
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,885
please change my father's dressing.

437
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,790
He was sweating profusely

438
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,950
- the entire night.
- Hello?

439
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,790
He didn't sleep well.

440
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,820
- Okay.
- Hello, Yu Jian?

441
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,900
Did you hear me?

442
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,300
Hello?

443
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,950
Guo, I was talking to
the nurse just now.

444
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,270
As I was saying,

445
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,530
since you're in Shanghai,

446
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,000
can you think of something for me?

447
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,771
I'm thinking of something right now.

448
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,340
It's not like you can get an appointment

449
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,030
with specialists in Shanghai
anytime you want.

450
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,420
I don't own the hospital.

451
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,280
Can you not make it as if you're
dealing with official matters here?

452
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,620
I'm begging you here.

453
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,142
Can't you please do something about it?

454
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,620
You could've told me directly

455
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,660
if you don't wish to do it
or if you can't do it.

456
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,230
Yu Jian, I worked overtime last night
and skipped dinner

457
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,610
just so I could come to the hospital.
But you're saying that?

458
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,270
That's right!

459
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,180
I can't do this!

460
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:50,371
Come here and do it yourself
if you're that capable!

461
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,620
Hello, Miss.

462
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,020
Today's our grand opening.
Our set lunch has a discount.

463
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,180
Do you wish to know more?

464
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,070
Do you have single sets?

465
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,820
Yes.

466
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,990
We provide many promotional set lunches.

467
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,260
(Hongkong Plaza)
Please look.

468
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,900
(138 Yuan Set Lunch)
For example, our steak is popular.

469
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,070
We're giving discounts
because it's our grand opening.

470
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,580
It costs 188 yuan on normal days.

471
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,470
Forget about the steak.

472
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,510
(Classic 78 Yuan)
Does it

473
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,270
cost 78 if I order
the spaghetti ala carte?

474
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,270
This is already

475
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,270
our cheapest meal.

476
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,180
It's just ordinary spaghetti bolognese.

477
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,100
Thank you.

478
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:35,030
It's right over there.

479
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,580
Hello, mister.

480
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,030
(Personal Credit Card)
It's our grand opening.

481
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,110
(Your monthly bill is 1,638.7 yuan)
We have discounts.

482
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,340
You may take a look.

483
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,380
Hello, Miss.

484
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,660
Would you be interested in our event?

485
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,620
Please take a look.

486
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,510
Hello, mister.

487
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,540
(Hongkong Plaza)

488
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,820
(Xue Yuming)

489
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,550
(Dr. Jiang.)

490
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,910
(He's a specialist in neurology.)

491
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,790
(You can seek her help
in Hospital Ruihua.)

492
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,230
(I already spoke to her.)

493
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,710
(Xia Guo)
(Thank you, Mr. Xue.)

494
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:16,860
(Yu Jian)
(Hello. The number you have dialed)

495
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,070
(is currently busy.)

496
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,340
(Please try again later.)

497
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,070
(At this moment,)

498
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,380
(I just wish to return to your side)

499
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,180
(and embrace you.)

500
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,470
(However, such simple moments
of happiness in the past)

501
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,990
(are quite a difficult task now.)

502
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,790
(The distance between us
obstructed our relationship.)

503
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,140
(Our love was within reach,)

504
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,900
(but now, it's out of reach.)

505
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,660
Who's there?

506
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,710
Ms. Wang?

507
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,030
Ms. Wang!

508
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:12,571
Who are you guys looking for?

509
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,580
Ms. Wang told us to come here
to sign the rental agreement.

510
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,900
Wang Yan.

511
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:19,400
Isn't this Wang Yan's house?

512
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,420
It's Unit 502.

513
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,420
Coming.

514
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,660
Ms. Wang, you're here.

515
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,620
What's going on?

516
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,420
Sorry about that.

517
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,270
I was stuck in a jam.

518
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,510
Sorry for being late.

519
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,820
Wait, you didn't go to Shanghai?

520
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,580
Guys, please wait here.

521
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,340
You?

522
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,340
What's going on?

523
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,510
Tell your tenants to leave.

524
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,710
Answer me first.

525
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,850
Why didn't you go to Shanghai?

526
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,900
This is my personal matter.

527
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,420
How could you rent my unit out

528
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,510
without my permission?

529
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,420
I thought you went to Shanghai.

530
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,114
The unit is vacant anyway.

531
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:50,620
If I rent it out, we'll get extra money.

532
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,710
Isn't that pretty good?

533
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,310
Let me ask you something.

534
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,470
Did you not go to Shanghai
because Zhang Xiaoqin

535
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,950
forbade Yu Jian from joining you?

536
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,420
Forget about them.

537
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,228
Let's deal with
the current situation first.

538
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,420
Girl,

539
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,900
why are you so silly?

540
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,230
- What should we do?
- It's fine.

541
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,742
How could you forsake
such an opportunity to move to Shanghai?

542
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,510
How many times have I told you this?

543
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,550
You must always prioritize yourself.

544
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:11,790
You have to consider the life

545
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,990
you wish to lead in the future.

546
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:14,180
Just because he stays here?

547
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,230
Forget about it.

548
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,514
They're still waiting outside.

549
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:17,380
That's why I suggest

550
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,900
you return to Shanghai first.

551
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
What were you guys bickering about?

552
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,290
Ms. Wang, what exactly is going on?

553
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:24,140
I'll be done.

554
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,270
Give me a second.

555
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,230
Baby girl, I'm begging you here.

556
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,340
Listen to me, okay?

557
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,342
I'll buy a flight ticket
for you right now.

558
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,828
I'll take you to the airport now.

559
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,550
Your future is more important.

560
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,550
More like your profit is more important.

561
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,620
You want to chase me out

562
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,300
so that you can
make your rental income.

563
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,100
Of course I'll make my rental income.

564
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,230
However,

565
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,030
your future is my priority.

566
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,860
It's your career.

567
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,550
You do make it sound good, huh?

568
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:49,580
Since when have you considered
my feelings since young?

569
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,510
How could you be so heartless?

570
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,510
Did you grow up on morning dew alone?

571
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,860
Have you not spent
a single cent of my money?

572
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,140
Money, money, money.

573
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,860
It's money again.

574
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,790
Money is the only thing you talk about.

575
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,380
Stop arguing.

576
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,750
My child needs a quiet place.

577
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,310
Your mother

578
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,620
rented out your unit already?

579
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:13,860
What will you guys do?
Where will you guys live?

580
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,750
I'll discuss it with Yu Jian after this.

581
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,750
Don't blame me for criticizing you.

582
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,180
It's too impulsive for you

583
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:26,030
to change your mind and stay here now.

584
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,860
Ms. Ping, I know that.

585
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,030
But Yu Jian needs me the most
during this period.

586
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,100
I'll be too selfish
if I leave right now.

587
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,800
You didn't see it for yourself.

588
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,950
He and his family were elated
when they knew that I wasn't leaving.

589
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,000
This is just like
what your mother had said.

590
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,900
As your friend, I truly don't wish

591
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,600
to see you join this small circle
and follow in my footsteps.

592
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,140
A small circle is not that bad.

593
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,510
There's Yu Jian and you in the circle.

594
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,510
I feel at ease.

595
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:58,660
What were you guys talking about?

596
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,820
Xia Guo.

597
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,380
You're something else now.

598
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,750
You leave and come back

599
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,180
whenever you feel like it.

600
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,750
Do you not know

601
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,030
where you stand now

602
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,270
just because that woman in Shanghai
buttered you up?

603
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,750
Ms. Chen was the one
who permitted the transfer.

604
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,790
And, I decided
to give up on the opportunity

605
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,030
out of the blue.

606
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,340
You came here not long ago.

607
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:22,200
I had no time
to update you about my situation.

608
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,140
Is that so?

609
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,710
So, since you didn't
come to work for several days,

610
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,857
can I consider that
as you being absent from work?

611
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,950
I have my own leave.

612
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:32,170
According to the labor law,

613
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,990
employees who have worked for more than
one year but less than ten years

614
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,310
are entitled to five days
of paid annual leave, Mr. Wang.

615
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,580
Not bad at all.

616
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,880
You're bringing up the labor law?

617
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,400
Have you applied for leave, then?

618
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,550
Mr. Wang, she already
applied for leave from me.

619
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,580
I forgot to report it to you.

620
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,100
I'm so forgetful.

621
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,230
It's my negligence.

622
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,790
Sorry about that.

623
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,140
Fine.

624
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,550
Guo,

625
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,620
are you printing the quotation

626
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:25,950
for Xinghui Supermarket's
pre-New Year promotion?

627
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,030
Yeah.

628
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,310
Let me do it.

629
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:31,171
Mr. Wang told me to deliver these to him
so that he could sign them.

630
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:33,420
I was the one doing this previously.

631
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,900
Precisely.

632
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,750
I don't know what Mr. Wang is thinking.

633
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,710
No one wants to do such a chore.

634
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,140
Hello, Zhao.

635
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,140
When are you free?

636
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,280
Let's have a meal together.

637
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,620
Shouldn't we do a follow-up

638
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,285
on the project we discussed before this?

639
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,380
Mr. Wang already told Liang
to do the follow-up with me.

640
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,620
Liang is right beside me.

641
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,390
Do you guys need
to speak with each other?

642
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,380
No need for that.

643
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,900
You guys can continue.

644
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:09,860
I'll hang up first.
I won't interrupt you two.

645
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,190
Why did you cancel all of my tasks?

646
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:24,470
You were a candidate
selected by our HQ in Shanghai.

647
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,950
You don't need to trouble yourself
over such trivial affairs.

648
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,230
What should I do, then?

649
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,910
Are you trying

650
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,540
to make me leave of my own accord?

651
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:33,100
You said that yourself.

652
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,100
I won't stop you if you want
to find a better job.

653
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,710
After all, your value is different now.

654
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,060
Mr. Wang, I just wish to remind you

655
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,470
that my contract hasn't expired yet.

656
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,190
Unless you wish to sack me.

657
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,340
I may consider that.

658
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,820
That crook.

659
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:00,730
(Yu Jian)
(I'm at the entrance now.)

660
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,257
(I'll wait for you to get off work.)

661
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,500
(I stayed.)

662
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:33,870
(I'm going to run toward him.)

663
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,150
(I'll never regret it.)

664
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,260
(Outpatient Department)

665
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,020
Mrs. Yu.

666
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,430
Guo, you're here.

667
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,340
He's asleep?

668
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,230
Where's Yu Jian?

669
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,430
He went to find his senior.

670
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,540
Have you eaten?

671
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,630
I have.

672
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,670
How was Mr. Yu doing today?

673
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,150
He was pulling a long face all day long.

674
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,670
I didn't know what was on his mind.

675
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,060
He's asleep now,

676
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,910
but he didn't eat much for dinner.

677
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,020
Where's Li?

678
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,340
Don't bring him up.

679
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:25,600
He applied for a half-day leave
because his relatives

680
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
were here to visit him.

681
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,150
Now that he's gone...

682
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,390
Mrs. Yu, what's wrong?

683
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,340
Are you unwell?

684
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,340
Have a seat.

685
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,470
I've been here the entire day.

686
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,910
My blood pressure is rising again.

687
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,020
I didn't bring my medicine here.

688
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,090
What about this?
You can head back first.

689
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,457
I'll keep an eye on Mr. Yu.
I'll do the dishes later.

690
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,260
Are you sure you can do it?

691
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,390
Why not?

692
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,230
I think Li will come back soon.

693
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,500
You should head back.

694
00:31:58,142 --> 00:31:59,670
Your health is more important. Come.

695
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:00,990
Here, let me help you out.

696
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,100
Guo,

697
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,150
I'm grateful that
you didn't go to Shanghai.

698
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,260
If not, there'll be
no one here to assist me.

699
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Mrs. Yu, don't say that.

700
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,500
Come.

701
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:10,150
Let me send you downstairs.

702
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,700
- I'll hire a cab for you.
- No need.

703
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,470
It isn't that far.

704
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,100
I'm not that fragile.

705
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,230
You shouldn't see me off.

706
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:18,100
He'll panic when he wakes up and sees

707
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,885
- that no one is in the room.
- It's fine.

708
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:22,540
Sorry for the trouble, then.

709
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,580
No problem.

710
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,670
I'll call him later.

711
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,230
Okay.

712
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,390
I'll tell Li to return.

713
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,260
Please take care.

714
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,710
Tell me when you get home, okay?

715
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,670
(Xia Guo)

716
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,770
(I'm at the hospital now.)

717
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,257
(You can focus on your work.)

718
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,100
Mr. Yu, you're awake.

719
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,540
Guo, you're here.

720
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,740
Mrs. Yu just left.

721
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,390
Of all the times to leave,

722
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,500
she just had to leave at this moment.

723
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,150
Are you looking for her?

724
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,500
It's nothing.

725
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,710
Where's Li, the caretaker?

726
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,780
He's not around.

727
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,230
Just tell me if you need anything.

728
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,470
It's nothing.

729
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,100
Guo, have you eaten?

730
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,260
You should go
and have something outside.

731
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,100
I've already eaten.

732
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,260
Mr. Yu, are you hungry?

733
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm not.

734
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,500
You see,

735
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,870
the ventilation here is terrible.

736
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,060
You should go out and take a breather.

737
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,870
Do you think it's stuffy?

738
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,060
Let me open the windows.

739
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,340
No... No need for that.

740
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,470
Go and get me some water.

741
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,150
Okay.

742
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,990
But your flask is full.

743
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,430
I'll pour some water for you.

744
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,630
Guo,

745
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,320
just stop.

746
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,910
Aren't you thirsty?

747
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,710
Put it down.

748
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,870
You're back.

749
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,140
Li, you're back.

750
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,910
Great.

751
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,820
Hurry.

752
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:07,870
Get it for me.

753
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,180
Guo,

754
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,870
stay outside for a while.

755
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,990
Hurry, get me the pot.

756
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,430
The pot.

757
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,680
I have to do the dishes.

758
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,180
Sorry for the trouble.

759
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:31,950
(Yu Jian)
(I just saw your text.)

760
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,470
(I don't know what time
I can return.)

761
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,540
(Head back and rest early.)

762
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,270
I have something
to discuss with you later.

763
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,790
It's fine. You can go ahead.
I'll wait for you.

764
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,020
Let me see.

765
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,580
How did you get that?

766
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,470
I'm fine.

767
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,260
I'm just too exhausted
for the past few days.

768
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,100
I was giddy and I
knocked my head on the site.

769
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,660
Does it hurt?

770
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:52,820
I'm sure it hurts, right?

771
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,500
It doesn't.

772
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:54,500
I've already dressed it.

773
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,700
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

774
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,470
That was careless of you.

775
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
I'm fine.

776
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,270
Let me send you back.

777
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,910
Okay.

778
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,470
- Let me put on my coat.
- Okay.

779
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,350
Go now.

780
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,050
So, I said I had something
to discuss with you

781
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,500
this afternoon, right?

782
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,470
Actually,

783
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,390
my mother thought...

784
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,390
Did I fall asleep?

785
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,180
What did you say just now?

786
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,750
It's nothing.

787
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:55,485
Why don't you spend the night here?

788
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,440
No need to send me back.

789
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,660
- No way.
- You can stay.

790
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,170
I can't rest
if you go home alone.

791
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,990
No, you're too tired.

792
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,990
Let's go.

793
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,140
Let's go.

794
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,830
Wang Chang'an again?

795
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,620
He actually bullied you?

796
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,470
I heard from Ms. Ping

797
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,750
that Wang Chang'an wanted
to bring a relative of his

798
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,057
to the company to replace me.

799
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
He hates me

800
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,350
because his plan was foiled.

801
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,750
It's all my fault.

802
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:28,457
You had to suffer because of me.

803
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,790
Don't say that again.

804
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,470
I chose to stay here of my own accord.

805
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,060
By the way, I heard

806
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
that it's costly to hire
a monthly caretaker.

807
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,220
It costs 2,000 yuan, right?

808
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:39,990
Of course.

809
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,420
The wage of a caretaker
who takes care of many individuals.

810
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,260
A one-to-one caretaker
is even more expensive.

811
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,350
How could we afford that?

812
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm sure you guys spent a lot
when Mr. Yu was hospitalized.

813
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:53,228
We never expected
surgery to be that expensive.

814
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,990
He has to go through rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and so on.

815
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,685
And, my mother
stored her money inside a fund.

816
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,060
You can use my bank card for now.

817
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,390
This won't do.

818
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,790
How could I spend your money?

819
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,140
It'll be fine as long as
you don't tell them about it.

820
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,685
I'm already touched by the fact
that you chose to stay with me.

821
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,100
You shouldn't intervene. I'm still here.

822
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:15,430
Both of your parents were nice to me.

823
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,750
How could I not intervene?

824
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:18,540
So, you chose to stay here

825
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,790
because of my parents?

826
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,430
Of course. You don't say?

827
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,950
How dare you, Xia Guo?

828
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:29,485
Why don't you become
their goddaughter instead?

829
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:30,310
In the future...

830
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,020
In the future, we'll be sworn brothers.

831
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,990
Sure.

832
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,430
I'll be your big brother.

833
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,270
Call me Big Brother.

834
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,020
No way!

835
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,620
Be careful!

836
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,870
We're on the road.

837
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,540
There's no way I'll call you that.

838
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,620
(Osmanthus Tower Community
Fitness Center)

839
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,485
You don't need to send me upstairs.

840
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,990
What's wrong?

841
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,350
Mr. Yu is still in the hospital.

842
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,257
You should head back
and keep him company.

843
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,220
Alright, then.

844
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:07,470
Remember to text me

845
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,500
when you reach home.

846
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,660
Got it.

847
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,620
Go now.

848
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,470
Take care, okay?

849
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,790
Okay. Take care.
