00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,119
Last month,

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,630
we had a barbecue.

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,830
How about having Western food tonight?

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,110
Let's have Japanese food.

8
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,589
If we want to have a hot pot,
then we order Sukiyaki.

9
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,400
If we want to have seafood,
then we can order salmon.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,910
We can have skewers too if we want.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,069
Alright, let's have Japanese food then.

12
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,839
Sure.

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,869
Guo. Guo.
We're having a dinner gathering tonight.

14
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,030
We'll have Japanese food.

15
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,359
I'm not going.
I'll have a proposal meeting tomorrow.

16
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,589
I need to get ready for it.

17
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,079
Are you guys joining us
for Japanese food?

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,119
Let's have Japanese food.

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
See, everyone is going.

20
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,320
Xu Li,

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,790
when will the documents for tomorrow's
proposal meeting be delivered?

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,070
At two o'clock.
Mr. Du will personally deliver them.

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,749
Yvonne, I have another document here

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,320
that needs your signature.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,279
Guo, come on.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,679
Join us for the dinner tonight.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,029
We'll have what you like.

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,470
How about Sanchuan?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,070
Are you tempting me with Sanchuan?

30
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,959
Are you feeling tempted?

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,679
Just think about this.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
Since we'll have
a proposal meeting tomorrow,

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,029
let's just have a good meal tonight

34
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,120
to perform better tomorrow.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,149
Come on, join us,
there's delicious food.

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,160
Okay.

37
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,840
I'll join you guys, okay?

38
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,190
Thank you, Yvonne.

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,239
Cheers! Cheers!

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,280
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Cheers!

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,149
Guo, why aren't you eating? Eat it.

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,080
- I'm eating.
- Guo doesn't feel like eating.

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,519
Because no one
is serving the food for her.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Come on.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,920
Let Larry serve you one. Try it.

46
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,959
Thank you, but I don't eat raw ones.

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,310
You can give it to me then. Give me.

48
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,629
Guo, you don't need to feel pressured.

49
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,679
It's common
if you lose to Yvonne tomorrow.

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,309
After all, she's the boss.

51
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,359
Why would we lose?

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,559
Guo is very capable.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,279
Just because you're Yvonne's confidant.

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,909
You appear here to suppress us.

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,469
You've misunderstood me.

56
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,590
I'm asking Guo to let go of
the burden and face it calmly.

57
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,119
Why are you trying
to provoke our relationship openly?

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,869
Stop it. Don't worry about me.

59
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,520
It's just a small case tomorrow, okay?

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,240
Do you guys hear it? Small case.

61
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,760
I misspoke. I'll take a penalty drink.

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,719
- Come on.
- Come on! Come on!

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,679
Guo, you can do it!

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,749
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

65
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,590
- Cheers!
- Keep going!

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,430
Yvonne!

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,239
Ms. Li is here.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,550
You're all here.

69
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,279
Yvonne, we're having a dinner gathering.

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,520
Do you want to join us?

71
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,880
I think this is not convenient.

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm here to celebrate
my daughter's birthday.

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,799
That's fine.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,919
We can join in celebrating
the kid's birthday together.

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,839
- Yeah.
- We're alright.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,440
Hi, brothers and sisters.

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,230
How sweet she is!

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,559
You're happy now, right?

79
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,269
There are so many brothers
and sisters here today

80
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,440
celebrating your birthday with you.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Are you happy?

82
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,429
I'm happy.

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,080
Miss Xia.

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,560
Migao.

85
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,039
Mummy,

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,640
can I sit next to Miss Xia Jiejie?

87
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,389
Sure.

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,799
You can sit next to Miss Xia.

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,710
You have to be good
and eat well by yourself.

90
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,830
Let's move a little bit backwards.

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,869
Waiter.

92
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,479
Come on, Migao, you sit here.

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
Kids sit here.

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,230
Thank you.

95
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,519
You can have the barbecue later. Okay?

96
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,659
- Do I disturb you guys?
- No, you don't.

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,710
Let's wipe your hands first.

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,560
Let's eat.

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,949
There's no cake here.

100
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,760
I'll go buy a cake for the kid.

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,030
- Mr. Xue.
- Mr. Xue.

102
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,200
Daddy! Daddy!

103
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,830
Daddy!

104
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,509
What's going on?

105
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,629
Brandon,

106
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,189
I just found out that they're here

107
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,670
when I came.

108
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,479
What about having it together?

109
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,030
Migao is very excited.

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,159
No. Let's not disturb them.

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,269
Let's go somewhere else.

112
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,869
Don't. It's unnecessary.

113
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,400
Let's just stay with them.

114
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,429
- Everyone's here. Just stay.
- Yeah.

115
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,000
- Mr. Xue, just stay here.
- Just stay together.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,519
Yeah.

117
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,790
- That's right.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,829
It's rare for us to have a gathering.
Let's stay together.

119
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,230
Hand me the cake, Mr. Xue.

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,670
Give it to me.

121
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,949
Mr. Xue.

122
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,189
You can have your seat here.

123
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,919
I just remembered that

124
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
I need to modify the plan for tomorrow.

125
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,509
I need to go back first.

126
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,429
You guys enjoy your meal.

127
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,029
Enjoy.

128
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,389
- Guo, don't leave.
- Guo, don't leave.

129
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,389
If you're leaving,

130
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,269
we'll feel embarrassed to stay here.

131
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,799
Don't say you're embarrassed.

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
I feel embarrassed celebrating
my daughter's birthday here then.

133
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,790
If my opponent is working too hard,
I'll feel very pressured.

134
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,719
Miss Xia, please don't leave.

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,760
Don't you want to have Migao's cake?

136
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,359
Yeah, Xia Guo.

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,159
Stay here

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,189
and eat with us.

139
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,080
You've revised that plan
hundreds of times already.

140
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,559
Let's eat together.

141
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,819
- That's right.
- Yeah, Guo.

142
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,679
- Guo, don't leave.
- We rarely gather.

143
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,829
- Let's eat together.
- Come, sit.

144
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,239
Let's move a little further backwards.

145
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,939
Waiter.

146
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,719
- Migao.
- Come here.

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,080
- Sit.
- You sit here.

148
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,270
Let's celebrate
Migao's birthday together.

149
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,150
Are we disturbing anyone here?

150
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,080
No, no.

151
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,960
Alright.

152
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,790
Brandon and I

153
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,270
didn't intend to hide it from anyone.

154
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,719
Since everyone saw it today,

155
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,710
I'll just make it public now.

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,520
Migao is my and Brandon's daughter.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,429
We met each other at university.

158
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,080
We've known for so long.

159
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,719
We've known each other

160
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,230
for almost ten years, right?

161
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,760
Migao,

162
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,829
were you obedient at kindergarten today?

163
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,919
Of course, I am.

164
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,470
The teacher has rewarded me
with stickers.

165
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,960
That's great.

166
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,230
Yvonne,

167
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,200
you kept this secret well hidden.

168
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,030
If you hadn't said it,
we wouldn't have known.

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,910
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

170
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,960
I think Migao looks a lot like her dad.

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,320
It's a blessing for a girl
to look like her dad.

172
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,880
Yup, you should have children
as early as possible while you're young.

173
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,359
Look at Mr. Xue and Yvonne.

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,559
They are still very young.

175
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,880
They can

176
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,119
easily deceive young men and women.

177
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,230
There's absolutely no problem with that.

178
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,640
Am I right?

179
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,559
Guo,

180
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,790
why are you so serious?

181
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,559
Do you also want to have a child

182
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,080
as adorable as Migao?

183
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,799
Don't worry,
your prince will arrive soon.

184
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,230
Stop talking.

185
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,760
Enjoy the food, guys.
It's my treat today.

186
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,239
- Thank you, Mr. Xue.
- Thank you, Mr. Xue.

187
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,159
Let's have a toast.

188
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,199
Cheers!

189
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,270
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

190
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,520
Migao, let mummy help you
to wipe your hands.

191
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,150
Look, what's coming?

192
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,150
Is this my cake?

193
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,629
Sweetie, shall we blow the candles now?

194
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,760
Yeah.

195
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,480
Come on.

196
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Xia Guo, sorry to bother you.

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,120
Could you please take
a video of the three of us?

198
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,910
No need.

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,270
I'll take it for you two.

200
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,869
Don't bother others.

201
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,749
How can we have it without you?

202
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,880
Let Xia Guo take it for us.

203
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,079
- I'll take it.
- Thank you.

204
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,959
Let's go. Hurry.

205
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,079
I go myself.

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's all sing the birthday song.

207
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,310
Come on.

208
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,509
Happy birthday to you.

209
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,119
Happy birthday to you.

210
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,150
Happy birthday to Migao.

211
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,880
Guo.

212
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,149
Guo.

213
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,150
- Guo.
- Guo, don't leave.

214
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,719
She's having a daughter
as her trump card now.

215
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,030
How can she be reconciled
if she doesn't use it?

216
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,229
But, to be honest,

217
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,760
this is a pretty lame move.

218
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,400
Men hate being threatened,

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,149
especially by women.

220
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,029
You little brat.

221
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,509
How much do you know about men?

222
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,669
This is the nature of men.

223
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,270
It has nothing to do with age.

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,359
You've already broken up
with Xue Yuming now.

225
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,389
Stop dwelling on it.

226
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,310
I don't want to dwell on it too.

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,589
But, when I saw them holding
their daughter

228
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,199
appearing together in front of me,

229
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
I really...

230
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,669
I can't stay in that company anymore.

231
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,240
I really can't stay anymore.

232
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,959
Let's go somewhere else to have a talk.

233
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,070
Okay?

234
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,760
Get me another drink.

235
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,550
You can just have water.

236
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,749
Can you let me explain?

237
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,999
Give me a chance, please.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
What do you want to tell?

239
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,199
Telling me why you hide it from me?

240
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,070
Alright. Come on, you can start now.

241
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
I didn't intend to hide it from you.

242
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,629
I didn't know

243
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,120
the existence of Migao.

244
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,119
But, I can't change the fact

245
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,239
that she is my daughter.

246
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,229
Well, you can't change.

247
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,150
I know you can't change.

248
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,400
I accept that both of you
get back together, okay?

249
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
The relationship between me and her
is not like what you think.

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,070
Xue Yuming,

251
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,150
you should thank her

252
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,589
for giving you

253
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,550
such a perfect image.

254
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,270
Reunion after a long separation,

255
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,840
forgiving past grievances,
and treating each other gently.

256
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,669
What a deep affection it is!

257
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,720
You've drank too much. Let's...

258
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,119
I don't want to hear
you speak right now.

259
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,190
I don't want to.

260
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,550
Hi, Linda. Good morning.

261
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,950
Guo, how was it?

262
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,479
What do you mean?

263
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,149
You were incredible last night.

264
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,239
Yeah, Guo.

265
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,719
You were so courageous last night.

266
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,319
I've been annoyed by him
for a long time.

267
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,360
He's always mooching off here and there.

268
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,240
Courageous?

269
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,030
Hitting him was necessary.

270
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,469
But, I feel sorry

271
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,400
for disrupting the kid's birthday party.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,120
That's fine.

273
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,869
I declare that from today onwards,

274
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,919
you're the best leader of Haowei

275
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,430
in my heart.

276
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,550
Look.

277
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,270
She is not calm anymore.

278
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,149
If I put in so much effort

279
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,550
and still lose to you,

280
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,439
I might

281
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,190
have no face to stay
in this office anymore.

282
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,439
(What is presented to you now)

283
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,760
(is the spring scene
in my hometown, Leshan.)

284
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,310
(Ancient people loved praising spring)

285
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,239
(The green leaves
adorn the tall willow tree)

286
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,790
(The wickers flutter like green ribbons.)

287
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,719
Xu Li,

288
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,760
please invite Ms. Li and Xiao Guo in.

289
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,000
(Spring Morning)

290
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,240
Have your seats, please.

291
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,549
For the proposals of "Spring Morning"
and "Spring In Europe",

292
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,629
we've already reviewed

293
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,120
both of the texts and videos.

294
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,959
There have been significant improvements
compared to the first draft.

295
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,270
Each has its own merits.

296
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,070
Before the vote,

297
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,790
we'll give you a chance

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,270
to campaign for yourselves.

299
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,360
Alright, I'll go first.

300
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,829
If you think

301
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,149
that this draft has made a breakthrough,

302
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,240
it's all because
when I revised the draft,

303
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,119
I managed to invite two

304
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,719
top art designers from Europe,

305
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,190
Leon and Hogar.

306
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,479
They are also willing

307
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,950
to promote our products overseas.

308
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,629
This is because we want to fulfill

309
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,190
the internationalized requirements.

310
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,509
If I don't remember wrongly,

311
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,999
Hogar was the Gold Medal winner

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,600
of the German
Logo Design Award two years ago.

313
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,199
And also, Leon has
an extraordinary background too.

314
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,360
He has been invited as an art consultant

315
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,629
by many luxury brands.

316
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,840
That's great.

317
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Xia Guo,

318
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,789
you mentioned "Thousand Miles
of Spring River" in your proposal.

319
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,789
Are you

320
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,839
preparing to collaborate with this game?

321
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,599
Yes.

322
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,719
My kid plays this game too.

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
It's said to be ranked as the number one

324
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
simulation game on the internet.

325
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,190
The daily turnover rate is very high.

326
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,880
What an impressive idea.

327
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,509
Actually, I was also inspired

328
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,190
by our recent collaboration with TNE.

329
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,079
I aspire to open up wider perspectives

330
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,549
in cross-border collaboration.

331
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,910
In my view,

332
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,789
the consumer group for candies

333
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,790
is more skewed towards
the younger generation.

334
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,719
If we able to collaborate
with the simulation game,

335
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,029
it can quickly

336
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,509
bring us closer
to the younger generation

337
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,760
and open up the market.

338
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,760
Try to imagine

339
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,269
playing games while eating snacks.

340
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,070
What an enjoyable moment, right?

341
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,719
This proposal is great.

342
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,319
Moreover, my idea

343
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,640
aligns closely with the concept
of "Thousand Miles of Spring River".

344
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,239
They also suggested me

345
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,029
to include some

346
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,119
diverse regional cultural elements

347
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,239
to connect with nature.

348
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,709
All of these are reflected

349
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,120
in my proposal.

350
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,480
Pretty good.

351
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,629
One is inclined towards
internationalization

352
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,869
and elitism,

353
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,719
while the other leans
towards localization

354
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,909
and youthfulness.

355
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,270
It's hard to say which is better.

356
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,439
Mr. Xue, what do you think?

357
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,549
Both proposals are of high standard.

358
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,520
Each with different styles.

359
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,030
The sales expectations are similar.

360
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,029
But,

361
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,909
in terms of gross profit

362
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,439
and market share increment

363
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,070
expectations,

364
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,119
"Spring Morning"
might be slightly better.

365
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,839
Of course,

366
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,719
"Spring In Europe"
is positioned more high-end.

367
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,950
It's hard to choose.

368
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,439
All these are just personal opinions.

369
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,950
They don't resemble the actual results.

370
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,239
During the process,

371
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,070
it will have existing variables.

372
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,670
As for which proposal to adopt,

373
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,000
we will

374
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,400
decide by voting.

375
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,520
The two of you

376
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,270
do not need to avoid it.

377
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,719
I announce the voting results.

378
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,400
The winning proposal

379
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,720
is the one that won by a large margin,

380
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,240
"Spring Morning".

381
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,910
Congratulations, Xia Guo.

382
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,269
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

383
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,950
Thank you, everyone.

384
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,919
Xue Yuming,

385
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,320
did you vote for "Spring Morning"
intentionally to embarrass me?

386
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,319
"Spring In Europe"

387
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,349
targets the middle
and upper-class audiences.

388
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,080
It's obvious to view it from the costs.

389
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,069
How can you compare the gross profit
of "Spring Morning" with mine?

390
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,190
I've also mentioned that

391
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,750
the positioning of "Spring In Europe"
is more high-end.

392
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,269
As a CEO,

393
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,479
I bear the company's

394
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,789
KPI.

395
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,549
I need to remind the shareholders
of the pros and cons of the two proposals.

396
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,910
Don't talk to me like a bureaucrat.

397
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,190
I just want to know

398
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,800
who did you vote for?

399
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,150
It's not so important who I voted for.

400
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,109
"Spring Morning" is clearly
leading by a large margin.

401
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,269
The result is obvious.

402
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,199
Answer my question.

403
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
As your superior,

404
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm not obligated
to report my work to you.

405
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,560
And, as Migao's dad,

406
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,510
I hope you don't use Migao anymore.

407
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,789
I responsibly tell you,

408
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,190
me and you,

409
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,710
it is not possible.

410
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,190
It is not possible between us?

411
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,349
Then, is it possible for you
if you are with someone else?

412
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,679
Dare you say who you are with now?

413
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,149
Do you dare?

414
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,840
I like Xia Guo.

415
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,470
You've gone insane.

416
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,510
Do you know
the consequences of your actions?

417
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,479
If the company finds out,

418
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,360
both of you will be done for.

419
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,800
(Well, let me repeat once again)

420
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,320
(I)

421
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
like

422
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,150
Xia Guo.

423
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,190
(Do you like grocery shopping?)

424
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,069
(I really like grocery shopping.)

425
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,080
(Whenever I get to grocery shopping,
I feel extremely relaxed and relieved.)

426
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,639
(Just buy it.)

427
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,749
(I'll treat you.)

428
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,179
(But I have a condition.)

429
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,539
(For every item you buy,)

430
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,230
(you have to tell me a story about it.)

431
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,360
(What did you observe?)

432
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,990
(Family and love.)

433
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,950
All these moments you witnessed

434
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,549
are all the reasons for us

435
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,879
to not neglect life

436
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,800
because of prioritizing
those pretty numbers.

437
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,470
(Oh my!)

438
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,360
(Mint Candy)
(How lucky to find this candy here!)

439
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,069
(Whenever I eat it,)

440
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,589
(I feel refreshed.)

441
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,829
I feel refreshed instantly

442
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,749
and then I got a perfect score
on the test the next day.

443
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,829
(That's super amazing!)

444
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,470
Excuse me, please make me a way.
Excuse me.

445
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,710

The password for my home

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,880
I won't change it anymore.

465
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,670

(I seem to be breaking through)

469
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,910
(the loneliness that pervades)

470
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,120
(without fear of obstacles.)

471
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,710
(But, what lies ahead of that?)

472
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,320
(Will I get to feel
the earthly scene of mine?)

473
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,080
Guo.

474
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,470
Guo,

475
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,120
don't be busy there.

476
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,239
Leave some dishes

477
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,479
for your mum to do.

478
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,439
It's okay, dad.

479
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,789
I learned a few new dishes online

480
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,040
and wanted to try them out.

481
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,309
You're back finally!

482
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,069
Guo

483
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,510
has almost done preparing the dishes.

484
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,069
Mum, you're back.

485
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,360
My dear Guo,

486
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,549
I've told you

487
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,919
to wait until I come back to cook.

488
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,789
Hurry up, take them off.

489
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,190
- Please.
- That's nothing, mum.

490
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,639
I just wanted to move around a bit.

491
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,829
I just can't sit still anymore.

492
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,919
I'll do all the household chores.

493
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,479
You can just lay down properly
in the room.

494
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,349
- Please be good. Take them off.
- I'm fine, mum.

495
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,309
It is almost done.
There's just one soup left.

496
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,040
We can dig in
when Yu Jian comes back later.

497
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,919
Dad, look at this.

498
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,500
Here you go. Drink some water.

499
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,670
Thank you, mum.

500
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,040
It is not hot.

501
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,039
Thank you, mum.

502
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,589
Mum, look at this.

503
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,479
You bought these
baby's clothes so early.

504
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,399
I was thinking

505
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,750
we could go choose together next month.

506
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,399
I came across it online,
and it was too cute.

507
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,439
I couldn't resist.

508
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,910
Look at this little bear.

509
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,400
So small.

510
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,560
And there's a maternity bag here too.
Have a look, mum.

511
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,910
A maternity bag?

512
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,430
Everything is inside the bag.

513
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,750
What's this?

514
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,959
That's so particular nowadays.

515
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,320
You know too little now.

516
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,159
Nowadays is different from the past.

517
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,719
You're right.

518
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,829
You don't mess around.

519
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,679
We're outdated.

520
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,749
I'll keep myself updated then.

521
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,159
I'll send you a big red envelope later.

522
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,040
- You can buy whatever you want.
- Thank you, mum.

523
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,999
What big red envelope?
Is there one for me too?

524
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,510
- You're back.
- Jian, you're back.

525
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,950
We're going to eat soon.
Go wash your hands.

526
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,800
What delicious dishes have you prepared?

527
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,600
I could smell them from downstairs.

528
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,349
They're all prepared by Guo.

529
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,190
Those are not your favourites.
But all are my favourites.

530
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,029
It's okay. I'll give my beloved wife

531
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,029
a big red envelope too.

532
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,199
Here you go.

533
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,600
This is the down payment
for the new project,

534
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,109
rewarding for my two goddesses.

535
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,399
There's one for me too?

536
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,990
- Of course.
- Thank you.

537
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,040
Guo worked the hardest.

538
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,360
This is for you too.

539
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,439
Mum,

540
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
this is Yu Jian's tribute to you.

541
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,430
Just keep it.

542
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,639
We've already paid off the money.

543
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,109
We both have pensions.

544
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,029
That's enough for us.

545
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,230
We won't spend this.

546
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,600
- Stop it, please don't like this.
- Take it and buy something.

547
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,479
I can still earn the money.

548
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,179
Let's eat now.

549
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,360
I'm starving.

550
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,349
You've made lots of money now.

551
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,880
Work hard.

552
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,640
Work hard to earn more.

553
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,840
Ouch, pain.

554
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,710
Who's that?

555
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,040
Why are you back?

556
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,040
Surprise!

557
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,399
Dad,

558
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,359
are you feeling better?

559
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,919
I'm getting better day by day.

560
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,960
That's good then.

561
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,159
You always

562
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,590
give us a shock.

563
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,029
Can't you give us

564
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,639
a heads-up beforehand?

565
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,350
It's not a shock, but a surprise.

566
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,509
But,

567
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,429
you should have let
your brother pick you up.

568
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,669
It's fine, no need to bother.

569
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,910
I can come back myself.

570
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,669
Is this our little one?

571
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,879
Let me touch.

572
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,639
Stop touching. Be careful.

573
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,469
Guo, sit down.

574
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,070
- Have a rest.
- I'm fine, mum.

575
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,830
Why do you come back by yourself again?

576
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,240
Where's An?

577
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,189
He's always

578
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,910
not around.

579
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,319
I was so bored in Los Angeles.

580
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,239
That's why I come back.

581
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,159
I can eat your cooking
and stay a couple of days.

582
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,480
Stop flattering.

583
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,029
You know there's a
free babysitter at home,

584
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,150
right?

585
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,430
Missing home?

586
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,669
Listen to my advice.

587
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,949
Just move back here.

588
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,110
That's right.

589
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,040
Andrew doesn't want to move back.
How can I move back?

590
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,320
You can bring him back with you.

591
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Look at what the news says now.

592
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,799
There is either robbing or killing
in the United States.

593
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,919
How scary it is!

594
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,029
It is safer here.

595
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,269
Don't mention that.

596
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,070
Don't scare my girl.

597
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,879
She has her own plans.

598
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,110
Am I right, girl?

599
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,709
Here you go, wifey.

600
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,830
Have some honeydew.

601
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm eating preserved plums now.

602
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,040
Let Yan eat.

603
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,709
Bro, you're so biased.

604
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,430
You forget about your sister
once you have a wife.

605
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,280
Your sister-in-law is pregnant now.

606
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,749
The doctor said she should eat more.

607
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,799
If you have one too,

608
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,240
this whole plate will be yours.

609
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,350
Sis,

610
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,560
is it really uncomfortable
being pregnant?

611
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,830
I'm fine.

612
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,040
Just

613
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,639
a little uncomfortable

614
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,509
at the beginning,

615
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,000
but now I don't feel anything.

616
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,110
Your sister-in-law is a heroin now.

617
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,029
To take care of the baby in her belly,

618
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,670
she quit her job.

619
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,919
Now she's the most important person

620
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,110
to take good care of in our family.

621
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,590
Guo,

622
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,630
eat more.

623
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,749
Mum, I'm eating.

624
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,319
Don't go into the kitchen again.

625
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,879
How many times have I told you?

626
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,390
The fumes are bad for the child and you.

627
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,520
Alright, mum.

628
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,559
That's right.

629
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,960
Pregnant women are precious.

630
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,110
Bro,

631
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,359
mum told me that she's been
taking care of my sister-in-law.

632
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,670
Where have you been?

633
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,119
Your brother is busy with work now.

634
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,590
He's making big money.

635
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,229
I can take care of Guo.

636
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,509
I can even take care of you too.

637
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,269
That means

638
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,110
my brother is supporting
this big family.

639
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm so envious.

640
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,560
Some people are just born lucky.

641
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,240
Yu Yan, who are you talking about?

642
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,029
Who can I talk about?

643
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,560
Of course, I mean

644
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,800
my cute baby.

645
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,720
Let's eat now.

646
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,390
Wifey,

647
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,430
I'm ready.

648
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
Ready for what?

649
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,670
Stop pretending.

650
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,560
I'm ready

651
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,390
from inside to outside.

652
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,240
Stop it. I'm doing homework.

653
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,070
You can't forget about your husband

654
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,830
after having a child.

655
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,000
Stay calm.

656
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,040
Stay calm.

657
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,960
Stay calm.

658
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,430
What do you want?

659
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,830
Thinking of something naughty again?

660
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,469
I just feel that

661
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,070
my dear Guo

662
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,119
has the most beautiful

663
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,000
baby bump in the world.

664
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
Where did you learn that from?

665
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,159
Keep your volume down.

666
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,590
There are so many people in the house.

667
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,280
But honestly, wifey,

668
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,520
did Yu Jian's return

669
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,960
upset you?

670
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,110
Sometimes she's a bit over when talking.

671
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,800
You don't take it to heart.

672
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,949
It's okay.

673
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,560
You're overthinking it.

674
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,960
But I feel like

675
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,960
Yan doesn't seem very happy this time.

676
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,070
Is there something wrong with her?

677
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,240
What could be wrong with her?

678
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,559
She's always been like that.

679
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,390
She's been spoiled since childhood.

680
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,879
Now that she's back

681
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,319
seeing that you're pregnant,

682
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,590
and everyone's attention is on you.

683
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,280
She feels left out.

684
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,760
Just ignore her.

685
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,509
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

686
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,319
If she bullies you,

687
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,590
just give me a call.

688
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,320
I'll deal with her.

689
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,670
She won't.

690
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,150
I want to bite you.

691
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,280
Hey, how can you really...

692
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,070
Well, just continue.

693
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,830
I can't bear it.

694
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,960
Accompany me with my homework.

695
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,040
Alright.

696
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,709
Look,

697
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,000
I've copied all the key points.

698
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,150
I'm quite professional now.

699
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,760
Keep your eyes open.

700
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
They are open.

701
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,240
Guo,

702
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
you're throwing up again?

703
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,590
Do you need my help?

704
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,630
Guo.

705
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,350
Yan?

706
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,390
Mum, I...

707
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,670
You...

708
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,320
Are you pregnant?

709
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,910
Why didn't you tell me
about such a big matter?

710
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,040
What are you thinking?

711
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,760
I don't want this baby.

712
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,509
The baby is here now.
How can you just not want it?

713
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,079
I can't even take good care of myself.

714
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,870
How can I take care of the baby?

715
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,269
You have me here.

716
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,399
Plus your brother's kid,

717
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,599
I can take care of them together.

718
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,200
It's all about raising kids only.

719
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,070
That's not what I meant.

720
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,200
What happens then?

721
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,560
Ignore that. Anyway, I can't have it.

722
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,390
Yu Yan.

723
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,760
Yu Yan.

724
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,070
Are you hiding something from me?

725
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,560
Talk to me.

726
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,910
Talk to me.

727
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,040
He wants to divorce me.

728
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,080
Why would he want to divorce you
when everything's fine?

729
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,430
There's nothing fine.

730
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,110
It's never been fine.

731
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,280
Remember his behaviour
during Chinese New Year?

732
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,390
I'm fed up, mum.

733
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,639
Every couple has their ups and downs.

734
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,110
But it's normal.

735
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,320
Why would it escalate to this?

736
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,800
You're already pregnant now.

737
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,910
He doesn't even know,

738
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,159
and even if he did,

739
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,760
he wouldn't let me keep it.

740
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,029
This time I came back
to have an abortion.

741
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,040
No, please don't.

742
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,839
That's a little life.

743
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,830
You can't just decide not to have it.

744
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,390
Let me ask you,

745
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,320
do you intend to divorce or not?

746
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,469
I don't.

747
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,070
Then keep the baby.

748
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,229
During pregnancy and breastfeeding,

749
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,399
the husband cannot file for divorce.

750
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,469
But he's treating me like this.

751
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,110
Why should I have his child?

752
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,590
Yan, you have to listen to me.

753
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,000
This is important.

754
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,669
Maybe having a baby
will change his mind.

755
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,709
Mum.

756
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,280
What I say will be right.

757
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,070
Mum is experienced.

758
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,240
And,

759
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,520
don't tell your dad and your brother.

760
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,800
Did you hear that?

761
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,720
Mum, I don't want to eat.

762
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,029
Then what do you want to eat?

763
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,680
You're causing trouble
as soon as you're back.

764
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,919
Mum kindly made porridge for you.

765
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,070
And you're picky.

766
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,520
Don't talk nonsense.

767
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,720
Yan, are you like me?

768
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,670
What?

769
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,830
I also have some good news to announce.

770
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,240
Our Yan is pregnant.

771
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,759
Really?

772
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,149
Congratulations, Yan.

773
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,510
Then, we can accompany each other now.

774
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,000
You should have said that earlier.
Then, I won't treat you like just now.

775
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,760
Here you go, the fried dough sticks.

776
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,629
She can't have that, too oily.

777
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,759
Peel an egg for Yan.

778
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,990
Alright, I'll peel an egg.

779
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,879
Yan, let me tell you,

780
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,799
you can talk about this

781
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,350
with your sister-in-law.

782
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,719
She's taken a step ahead.

783
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,950
She can share her experience with you.

784
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,160
This baby came too suddenly.

785
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,030
I haven't mentally prepared
for his arrival.

786
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,989
What's there to prepare?

787
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,989
Your sister-in-law
was in a panic at first too.

788
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,679
Now look at her.

789
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,839
She can handle it so well, right?

790
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,359
Yeah.

791
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,320
You should talk more
with your sister-in-law.

792
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,800
Yeah, let's talk more later.

793
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,509
Oh yeah, where's Andrew?
When is he coming to accompany you?

794
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,469
He's busy like you, he works too.

795
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,720
He's making money too.

796
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,799
That's right.

797
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,680
Yan, mum is here.

798
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,390
You don't need to worry too much.

799
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,429
Yan, I have to go on
a business trip to Chengdu today.

800
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,950
Do you want me to bring you anything?

801
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,470
No, bro, just take care of yourself.

802
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,419
Alright.

803
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,399
Then, you stay at home well.

804
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,870
Call me if anything happens.

805
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,080
Jian, go and get my good wine for me.

806
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,510
Let me have a small cup of it.

807
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,069
Dad, you can be happy,

808
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,160
but having a drink early in the morning
is bad for your health.

809
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,240
Go and take it.

810
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,679
Mum, you see my dad.

811
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,030
Go and take it. Since he's happy,
let him have a small cup.

812
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,949
He's excited.

813
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,910
Alright.

814
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,390
Just one small cup.

815
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,029
Shut up.

816
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,509
I don't want to hear you
say these things.

817
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,989
Have you ever listened to me?

818
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,470
Have you ever understood me?

819
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,760
Do you want me to go over now?

820
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,600
Well, I'll sign.

821
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,759
Yan.

822
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,990
Where are you going?

823
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,320
Mum.

824
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,679
Talk to me.

825
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,719
I heard everything.

826
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,679
Were you talking to An?

827
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,720
What are you signing?

828
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,510
He even comes all the way
to Leshan for a divorce.

829
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,149
I also care about my reputation.

830
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,279
Why should I cling to him?

831
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,550
Is this the time
to worry about reputation?

832
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,719
Think about the baby in your belly.

833
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,069
Don't mention the baby.

834
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,550
It's nothing to do with having a baby.

835
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,029
Does having a baby mean
we have to stay together?

836
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,830
What I said last night
was just a waste of breath.

837
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,240
You're having a baby now.

838
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,910
The baby can be
the glue between you two, isn't it?

839
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,679
If he knows there's a baby,
he'll come back to you.

840
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,719
Just bear with it until he comes back.
Isn't that good enough?

841
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,879
It's a different era now, mum.

842
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,239
Isn't it all the same?

843
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,759
There's no permanent
resentment between spouses.

844
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,160
You just can't understand me.

845
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,509
I beg you, let me
handle it myself, okay?

846
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,870
No, come back with me.

847
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,760
Where are you going?

848
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,799
- Come back with me.
- Let go of me.

849
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,759
Listen to mum.

850
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,919
No, you can't go.

851
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,989
Let go of me, mum.

852
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,029
Listen to me.

853
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,830
Come home with me, my dear.

854
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,200
You...

855
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,760
Are you okay?

856
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,359
Do you need to go to the hospital?

857
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,320
(General Tower)

858
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,879
Why don't you answer?

859
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,080
You have to tell him
about your pregnancy.

860
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,870
I won't tell him.

861
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,719
Why are you so stubborn?

862
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,510
Can't you just listen to me once?

863
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,800
What can we do now?

864
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,319
You insisted on going to America back then,
and insisted on marrying him.

865
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,279
What did I tell you?

866
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,240
I told you, I didn't like him,
I didn't agree the marriage.

867
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,469
He's so aloof.

868
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,399
Did I tell you?

869
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,280
Have you ever listened to me?

870
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,800
Your brother and your sister-in-law
are not easy too.

871
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,160
They are also tight on money.
But they are loving and caring.

872
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,030
Why do you want
to make your own life difficult?

873
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,800
Can you stop comparing me to my brother?

874
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,719
I'm not the one
who doesn't want to live a happy life.

875
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,239
That's why, Yan.

876
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,870
Open your eyes
and look at the situation now.

877
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,919
It's him who wants a divorce.

878
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,839
You don't want it, right?

879
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,030
Isn't the baby the best reason?

880
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,589
You can't divorce now.
How can you survive after divorce?

881
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,990
You've no money for food and drinks,

882
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,549
no job and house.

883
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,320
How can you support yourself?

884
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,510
You'll regret it.

885
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,950
Mum.

886
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
You considered
all the house, baby and money.

887
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,470
Have you ever considered my feelings?

888
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,149
Which sentence am I saying now

889
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,719
haven't considered your feelings?

890
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,029
You haven't considered

891
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,720
any of my feelings at all.

892
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,759
You only think about yourself.

893
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,240
You care about your reputation.
You're so selfish.

894
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,120
Let me tell you the truth,

895
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,720
I went to America to get away from you.

896
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,430
I wanted to be far away from you.

897
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,390
You make me mad and upset.

898
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,240
Talk to him.

899
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,280
Talk now.

900
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,199
Stop calling me.

901
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,429
- Get out...
- Hello.

902
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,949
Hello, An...

903
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,680
And, it's me, your mum.

904
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,919
I have

905
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,469
some good news to tell you.

906
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,680
Yan is pregnant.

907
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeah.

908
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,549
That's right.

909
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,870
Alright.

910
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,800
Well, don't you worry.

911
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,600
Okay.

912
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,720
See, isn't this great?

913
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,470
An's attitude is not that bad.

914
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,919
He lets me take good care of you.

915
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,680
He'll come here to see you
in a couple of days.

916
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,470
Stop crying.

917
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,550
Your health is more important.

918
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,629
Everything will turn right
after having a baby.

919
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,910
Don't hurt the baby.

920
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,510
Listen to mum.

921
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,080
Stop crying.

922
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,320
Wifey, mum, you're back.

923
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,799
An is here.

924
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,919
When did you come?

925
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,870
I just got here.

926
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,550
Yu Yan, I wish you good health.

927
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,470
Why are you here?

928
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,109
Have your seat.

929
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,919
I'll go make tea.

930
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,600
Okay, I'll go check on her first.

931
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,469
When did he come?

932
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,910
He's been here for a while.

933
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,950
Andrew is so terrible.

934
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,279
How come he didn't go
to the hospital to find you?

935
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,830
It's good enough that he came.

936
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,640
It seems like you haven't told your parents
about our matter yet, right?

937
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,240
What's your plan now?

938
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,800
How do you plan to solve this?

939
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,760
I don't want to talk about this at home.

940
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,359
I want us to divorce, can we?

941
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,509
I don't want this child.

942
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,319
You want to get an abortion
here or in America,

943
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,949
it's up to you.

944
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,350
I respect your choice.

945
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,240
I won't divorce.

946
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,510
I want to keep this child too.

947
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,989
This child is not gonna
to help you, okay?

948
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,799
Forget about it.

949
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,149
I don't love you anymore.

950
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,510
Do you understand?

951
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,910
Well, this way. I make my move.

952
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,319
We'll negotiate about
the property division.

953
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,149
For assets, we split, okay?

954
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,800
I'll try my best
to fulfill your requirements.

955
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,910
How's up?

956
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,870
But don't try to use this child
to keep me.

957
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,390
What a trash!

958
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,549
My patience is limited, okay?

959
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,430
I want a divorce right now.

960
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,120
I've told you the conditions,
you can think about it yourself.

961
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,120
I won't give you an answer.

962
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,839
If you want to wait,

963
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,350
go back to America and wait.

964
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,720
Mum, what are you doing?

965
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,879
An, what do you want for dinner?

966
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,030
I will cook for you.

967
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,989
I don't need it.

968
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,949
I have clients
waiting for me in Chengdu.

969
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,949
Thank you. Maybe next time.

970
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,989
Have something before you leave.

971
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,149
It's okay. I ran out of time.

972
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,320
Goodbye.

973
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,640
You just let him leave like that?

974
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,990
Did you two have a fight?

975
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,030
No.

976
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,320
I'm pregnant, I don't want to be angry.

977
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,470
It's better to think like this.

978
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,350
Andrew is so busy.

979
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,950
He came and went in a hurry.

980
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,640
Dad, mum.

981
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,760
I'm so tired.

982
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,640
I want to rest for a bit.

983
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,470
Yan.

984
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,989
Yan, what are you doing?

985
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,589
Give it to me.

986
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,509
You can't drink alcohol now.

987
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,799
You don't want your baby anymore?

988
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,240
I don't want it.

989
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,629
He's made up his mind.

990
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,390
Why do I need this child then?

991
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,720
Didn't Andrew come today?

992
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,830
Haven't you reconciled?

993
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,800
That was a lie.

994
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,589
He just wanted me to abort this child.

995
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,510
He's been forcing me all along.

996
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,760
I don't know what to do
with this child anymore.

997
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,030
Guo,

998
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,279
I don't want to get divorced.

999
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,200
I really don't want to.

1000
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,949
My mom said,

1001
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,470
wait for this child

1002
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,510
to grow up

1003
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,989
and understand things.

1004
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,279
If he asks me where his dad is,

1005
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,320
how do I answer him?

1006
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,279
Will I regret

1007
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,390
if I don't want this child?

1008
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,719
Well, Yan.

1009
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,080
You calm down first.

1010
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,870
I'm not you.

1011
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,160
I can't make decisions for you.

1012
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
But you need to think carefully.

1013
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,719
If you decide to keep this child,

1014
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,680
can you take responsibility for him?

1015
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,949
I can comfort you,
I can give you positive vibes.

1016
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,830
But these are not what you need.

1017
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,799
This is between you and Andrew.

1018
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,470
You need to figure it out yourselves,
understand?

1019
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,550
Do you think

1020
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,430
I should keep this child?

1021
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,080
If I were you,

1022
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,120
I would keep him.

1023
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,640
When I found out I was pregnant,

1024
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:17,280
I hesitated and denied it too.

1025
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,550
But as long as I thought about

1026
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:23,030
the day

1027
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,839
when I would hear

1028
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,870
his first cry,

1029
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,950
I had the courage

1030
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,990
to want to have him.

1031
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,430
Come.

1032
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,430
Come closer to me.

1033
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,320
Come.

1034
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,510
Why is he making those gurgling sounds?

1035
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,870
Maybe he's whispering to his aunty.

1036
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,239
Every time he moves now,

1037
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,350
I feel a little happier.

1038
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,870
This is a blessing from God
that only mothers can experience.

1039
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,589
I'm not sure

1040
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,470
if I'm able to handle it.

1041
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,280
No matter what decision you make,

1042
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,989
I firmly believe

1043
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,720
having a child isn't a way
to salvage a marriage.

1044
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,870
This child is yours.

1045
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,800
Whether you want to keep him or not,

1046
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,470
it's for yourself.

1047
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,080
Yan,

1048
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,030
this is your right.

1049
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,430
I understand.

1050
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,430
But...

1051
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,990
But as for having and raising a child,

1052
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,719
I don't even know

1053
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,800
whether I can handle it or not.

1054
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,550
If you decide to keep him,

1055
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,399
then don't worry.

1056
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,759
Our whole family will help you

1057
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,160
take care of him together.

1058
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,549
As long as you're keeping him
for yourself,

1059
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,470
and not for anyone else.

1060
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,629
Guo,

1061
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,509
I want to say a few words to the baby,

1062
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,549
can I?

1063
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,680
Come.

1064
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,120
My little nephew,

1065
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,600
or my little niece,

1066
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,600
when you come out,

1067
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,509
let's travel with aunty.

1068
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,720
We'll explore the world together, okay?

1069
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,160
(To pursue love,)

1070
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,240
(we all go through the obstacles.)

1071
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,510
(Some come out unscathed.)

1072
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,510
(And many others)

1073
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,600
(are not protected by the God of Luck.)

1074
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,950
(But that's okay.)

1075
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,949
(The scars from wounds
will become our armor.)

1076
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,550
(The pain will make us stronger.)

1077
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,680
(And we)

1078
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,950
(will eventually grow stronger.)
