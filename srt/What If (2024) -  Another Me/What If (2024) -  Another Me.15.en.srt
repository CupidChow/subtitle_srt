(One's Desire And Possession)

4
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,539
The closure
of the cervix opening is good.

5
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,780
The blood flow of the umbilical cord
is normal as well.

6
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,980
There's no issue.

7
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,329
You're almost in your 37th labor week.

8
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,010
Your child has been engaged as well.

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,299
You may give birth at any time
during this period.

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,930
Come. Be careful.

11
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,329
I read from the book

12
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,609
that 37 weeks is already
considered a full term.

13
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,299
During this period...

14
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,460
Here. Have some water first.

15
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,180
You must be very careful
during this period.

16
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,259
If you feel unwell,

17
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,929
we must rush to the hospital,
you hear me?

18
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,329
Got it. It's not that big of a deal.

19
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,220
That's right.

20
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,060
There's no need to be overly cautious.

21
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,899
It's best if she can

22
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,650
walk at least half an hour per day.

23
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,580
It'll help with natural childbirth.

24
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,329
Alright, doctor. We understand.

25
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,370
Thank you.

26
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,780
Did you hear that?

27
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,900
That'll work too.

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,280
If so, you should wait for me
to get off work.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,739
I'll join you for a walk after work.

30
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,019
Don't take walks by yourself.

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,970
Alright. I'll heed your advice.

32
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,500
Come, Dear.

33
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,500
Be careful.

34
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,329
Enough. You don't
need to send me upstairs.

35
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,259
You should head back.

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,259
- You're late to work.
- It's fine. I'll send you upstairs.

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,649
That won't do.
You'll waste a lot of time

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,769
going back and forth.

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,250
You've always been late lately.
Your senior will tell you off for this.

40
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,089
It doesn't matter. Let's go.

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,699
It's fine.

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,850
Enough already. Let's go.

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,900
Yu Jian!

44
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,780
Yan is missing!

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,780
What do you mean by she's missing?

46
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,060
Mom, be careful.

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,049
Yan!

48
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,859
She was gone when I went to her room!

49
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,370
Her phone is switched off as well!
I couldn't reach her!

50
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,220
I thought
you didn't allow her to go outside.

51
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,299
Yeah.

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,649
We were having a meeting on the streets.

53
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,809
They were surrounding me
and chatting with me.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,300
Yan was gone
when I pushed open her door.

55
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,259
Mom, calm down for now.

56
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,259
You and Guo can go upstairs.

57
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,179
I'll go and find her.

58
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,410
I can't stay at home at this moment.

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,259
Let's split up and search for her.

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,369
Guo, you should go upstairs first.

61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,250
Lunch is ready.

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,259
I'll check the town square park.

63
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,340
Okay.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,090
You should go upstairs first.

65
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,440
Let me join you.

66
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,769
You shouldn't create additional trouble.

67
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,060
That's not it.
I have something to tell you.

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,459
You guys are really bold, huh?

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,060
How dare you guys
keep it from me for so long?

70
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,080
I would've taught him a lesson long ago
had I found out.

71
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,500
Look at your reaction.
Luckily, I didn't tell you about it.

72
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,780
I kept it from you guys
in order to protect Yan.

73
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,299
She was doing fine

74
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,780
when I chatted with her back then.

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,050
Why did she do this all of a sudden?

76
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,460
I'm sure something's wrong.

77
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,970
Could it be that Andrew
is back to find her again?

78
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,780
I'll break his legs
if he dares to come back.

79
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,850
Do you think it's useful
for you to speak out of spite?

80
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm just afraid Yan
might lose control of her emotions

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,730
after seeing Andrew.

82
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,410
If not, she would've come home by now.

83
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,290
This won't do.

84
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,170
Say, could she be at Tanghe Bridge?

85
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,850
Didn't we used to play there
when we were young?

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,460
Alright. Let's check it out.

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,610
Dear, be careful.

88
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,970
Yan!

89
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,610
Yan!

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,730
Yan!

91
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,119
Yan!

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,380
Yan!

93
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,410
Dear,

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,290
is that Yan?

95
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,380
Yan,

96
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,410
my wife already told me about it.

97
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,850
Did Andrew come and find you?

98
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,499
Look at you.

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,139
Are you silly? You could've told me
that you were in trouble.

100
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,340
I would've stood up for you.

101
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,780
That's right, Yan.

102
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,380
Tell us if you're in trouble.

103
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,780
Let's discuss it together.

104
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,140
That jerk is back.

105
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,020
And, he brought a woman with him.

106
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,850
That woman is older than me.

107
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,260
But she's richer than me.

108
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,490
She's willing to buy a house for him
and have a child with him.

109
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,730
Jian, do you know something?

110
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,650
The house that Andrew lived
in the U.S. wasn't his.

111
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,970
He has no assets at all.

112
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,260
I won't get a single cent.

113
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,730
If I don't get a divorce with him,

114
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,020
I have to repay his debt
together with him.

115
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,329
Yan,

116
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,380
don't worry.

117
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,220
I won't let you suffer.

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,610
I'll settle with him later.

119
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,730
That's enough.

120
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,530
Yan,

121
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,409
let's head home first.

122
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,260
We can talk at home, okay?

123
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,410
We shouldn't stay here.

124
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,580
That's right.

125
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,850
Yan, let's go home.

126
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,020
We'll face the music together with you.

127
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,610
Good.

128
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,090
Good job, Zhang Xiaoqin.

129
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,730
Zhang Xiaoqin!

130
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,410
How dare you hide such
a huge deal from me?

131
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,460
You have to explain yourself today.

132
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,090
You even forced her?

133
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,820
You even forced Yan to give birth?

134
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,649
Do you think Yan's life
isn't hard enough?

135
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,849
Why are you shouting at me?

136
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,459
Do you want other people to hear us?

137
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,169
So now,
you care about your dignity, huh?

138
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,460
It's too late!

139
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,140
Dad, Mom.

140
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,170
You're back.

141
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,259
Where have you been?

142
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,530
Your phone was switched off.

143
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,460
I'm talking to you.

144
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,730
Do you feel unwell?

145
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,059
Yan?

146
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,969
Mom,

147
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,340
you should let Yan rest first.

148
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,490
Go and rest.

149
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,170
Why did she go to the riverbank?

150
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,730
What else do you think?

151
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,649
She intended to do something silly.

152
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,769
But now, it's okay.

153
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,140
Everything's fine now.

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,650
Jian,

155
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,140
what do you plan to do, then?

156
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,819
I'll look for Andrew tomorrow.

157
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,220
I'll chase him back to the U.S.

158
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,340
Yu Jian,

159
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,020
from tonight onward,
you should sleep on the sofa.

160
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,059
Keep an eye on her.

161
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,460
I'm too slow.

162
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,250
Don't let her leave the house
in the middle of the night.

163
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,649
Got it.

164
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,139
Don't worry.

165
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,769
You must keep an eye on her.

166
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,060
Alright.

167
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,730
What's wrong? Do you still feel unwell?

168
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,770
Why is the last month excruciating?

169
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,289
My entire body hurts.

170
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,809
Why don't we try our
the breathing method?

171
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,340
See if it can ease your pain.

172
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,300
Come.

173
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
How is it?

174
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,850
It's not working.

175
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,379
What's going on?

176
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,689
Stay here with me.

177
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,449
Maybe I'll be fine later.

178
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,340
Okay.

179
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,409
But I have to
keep watch over Yan at the door.

180
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,339
If not,

181
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,409
she might sneak out

182
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,010
and attempt something silly again.

183
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,540
Yeah.

184
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,130
You should remain in the living room.

185
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,499
I'll have the door half-closed.

186
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,940
Call me if you need anything.

187
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,689
I'll be going now.

188
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,770
Go now.

189
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,540
Why does it hurt so much?

190
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,300
The pain comes in waves.

191
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,049
How about I give you a massage?

192
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,340
No need for that.

193
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,820
I feel a little better like this.

194
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,700
I'll check the time.

195
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,929
If the pain comes
every five to ten minutes,

196
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,219
we have to head to the hospital.

197
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,490
Dear,

198
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,770
could it be that
I'm going to go into labor?

199
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,770
I'm scared.

200
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,890
Don't be scared. I'm here for you.

201
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,010
Why don't we take a walk?

202
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,370
Come.

203
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,060
Be careful.

204
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,820
Here, be careful.

205
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,529
Be careful.

206
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,820
Wait.

207
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,370
What are you guys doing?

208
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,610
Look at the time.
Why aren't you guys asleep?

209
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,890
Mom, Guo might be giving birth soon.

210
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,169
That can't be.

211
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,169
There's one month
before the delivery date.

212
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,649
Guo, do you feel unwell anywhere?

213
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,850
My entire body hurts.

214
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,010
Your child is causing trouble
for you now that he's grown.

215
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,219
Sleep early.

216
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,300
It'll be fine.

217
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,820
Yu Jian,

218
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,890
rest early.

219
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,289
Dear, I don't wish to walk.

220
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,730
I wish to sit down.

221
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,180
Okay. Come, let's sit down.

222
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,970
It hurts!

223
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,929
It hurts.

224
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,929
Mom is a veteran.

225
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,060
She's experienced.

226
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,529
Since she said it's fine,

227
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,180
this should be normal, then.

228
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,730
Yan!

229
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,929
Dear!

230
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,099
Yan!

231
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,370
Yu Guohua!

232
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,130
Yu Jian!

233
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,259
Yan!

234
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,850
Mom, what's wrong?

235
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,340
Yan!

236
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,289
Mom!

237
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,979
What are you doing?

238
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,420
- Mom!
- Yan, get up!

239
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,339
Yan!

240
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,660
Get a towel!

241
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,820
Yu Guohua!

242
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,700
Dial 120!

243
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,770
Yan, wake up!

244
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,970
Yu Jian!

245
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,180
- Yu Jian!
- Yan!

246
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,689
- Yan!
- My goodness!

247
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,689
- Yan!
- Yan!

248
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,739
- Dear!
- Get up!

249
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,890
My girl, get up!

250
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,060
Hang in there!

251
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,890
Yu Jian!

252
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,370
Dad!

253
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,890
Dad!

254
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
(Surgical Theater, Do Not Enter)

255
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,139
Relax.

256
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,379
Take a deep breath.

257
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,490
Relax.

258
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,850
Take a deep breath. Follow my command.

259
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,340
- Follow my command.
- Don't be nervous.

260
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,730
Come, take a deep breath.

261
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,280
Relax.

262
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,420
We'll reach the hospital soon.

263
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,560
(Surgical Theater)

264
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,999
(Emergency)

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,240
(Operating)

266
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,770
How's her condition?

267
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,649
Her blood pressure is normal,
but her water broke.

268
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,979
She has irregular contractions.
The cervix has only dilated to 3cm.

269
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,400
The fetus is at risk
of asphyxia at any time.

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,120
Head to the surgery theater
and prepare for delivery.

271
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,840
(Family members, please stop here)

272
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,460
Where's your family?
We require their signature.

273
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,929
Doctor!

274
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,730
Doctor, what's wrong with my child?

275
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,099
The fetus lacks oxygen.
The fetus is at risk of asphyxia.

276
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,400
We need to perform surgery
on you immediately.

277
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,460
Where's your family?

278
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,899
They're not here.

279
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,490
I came here alone.

280
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,289
Dr. Wu, this patient
came to the hospital alone.

281
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,610
She doesn't have any family members.

282
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,139
Let her sign it, then.

283
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,080
Report it to the
Medical Services Department right now.

284
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,379
(Surgical Theater)

285
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,420
Doctor,

286
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,289
how's my sister?

287
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,540
She's still in a coma.

288
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,160
The doctors are
trying their best to save her.

289
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,220
Okay.

290
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,540
Mom.

291
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,449
Sit down.

292
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,499
Hang in there. Stay sober.

293
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,130
Here, sign this.

294
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,960
(Individual or Representative)

295
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,579
Hello.

296
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,330
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

297
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,819
Hello.

298
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,899
The number you have dialed

299
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,530
cannot be reached.

300
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,440
(Individual or Representative: Xia Guo)

301
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,970
Hello, Dad?

302
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,250
What's wrong?

303
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,249
Jian,

304
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,099
why did you only pick up now?

305
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,810
Guo will go into labor soon.
She went to the hospital alone.

306
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,099
We'll apply anesthesia to you soon.

307
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,299
Relax. Don't get agitated.

308
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,660
If not, you'll be in danger
when your blood pressure rises.

309
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,250
Relax.

310
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,770
Here, take a deep breath.

311
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,330
Breathe out.

312
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,700
Breathe in.

313
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
That's right.

314
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,929
Relax.

315
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,250
You mustn't be nervous.

316
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,560
(Guo)

317
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,059
Xue Yuming, why didn't you
tell me that you resigned?

318
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,099
You came back so early.

319
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I'll be done soon.

320
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,009
You didn't answer my call
or reply to my texts.

321
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,649
What exactly are you up to?

322
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,860
The last dish will be served soon.

323
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,530
Come. Time to eat.

324
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,660
Don't be like this.

325
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,539
You should be happy for me.

326
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,940
Now that I've resigned,

327
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,010
I have plenty of time to spend with you.

328
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,649
I can learn how to cook.

329
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,969
I can go and exercise.

330
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,290
I can go and play sports too.

331
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,490
Isn't it great?

332
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,010
How can I be happy about that?

333
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,539
You're such a jerk.

334
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,180
You want me to feel guilty, don't you?

335
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,339
Actually, I was
mentally prepared long ago.

336
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,570
It wasn't a surprise.

337
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,970
- It wasn't a sudden decision either.
- But why?

338
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,530
To the company, you're very important.

339
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,579
To us,

340
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,770
my resignation will be
less impactful than yours.

341
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,180
Actually, that's not the case.

342
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,859
It's tough to be a General Manager.

343
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,970
It's like you're sitting
at the mouth of a volcano.

344
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,409
You have to deal with the complex and
intricate interpersonal relationships

345
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,899
within the company.

346
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,250
Once you do a bad job,

347
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,140
the higher-ups will fire me.

348
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,099
If so, I would rather use this chance

349
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,249
to resign.

350
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,570
I'll look cool too.

351
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,700
If so, why did Mr. Lu say

352
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
you resigned because of me?

353
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,530
Of course I have to consider your stand.

354
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,380
You're different from me.

355
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,420
It's not easy for you to get a job.

356
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,250
I know very well what you went through
to get to your position.

357
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,779
Therefore, in conclusion,

358
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,729
my departure

359
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,050
is more beneficial to our future.

360
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,100
Alright. Let's end this topic.

361
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,420
Baby, let's eat.

362
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,770
Spicy Shredded Potatoes.

363
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,330
Pan-Seared Green Chili Pepper, and

364
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,100
Sichuan Boiled Beef, the most
difficult dish to make among them.

365
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,409
Don't do this.

366
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,570
What's wrong?

367
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,530
Why?

368
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,299
I just think that it's not easy

369
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,299
for you to get a job too.

370
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,299
Who said so?

371
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,859
The headhunters

372
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,489
will flood my phone with calls
in three days.

373
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,730
Stop showing off.

374
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,700
Alright now.

375
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,530
If you feel sorry for me,

376
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,970
you should work hard,

377
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,579
get promoted,

378
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,180
and make more money

379
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,490
to support me.

380
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,940
I can't afford that.

381
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,620
I guess.

382
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,490
Try this.

383
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,730
Here.

384
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,900
Come on.

385
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,810
What do you think?

386
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,940
Awesome.

387
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,460
Awesome.

388
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,969
- That's not accurate.
- Let me try it again.

389
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,899
It's awesome.

390
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,730
Awesome.

391
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,100
Awesome.

392
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,080
You're allergic to
fermented chili bean paste.

393
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,460
You have no right to try this.

394
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,700
I won't let you have it.

395
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,009
Awesome.

396
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,249
(Loratadine Tablets)

397
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,620
Allergy medication?

398
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,100
We lack one soup.

399
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,900
That was mind blowing.

400
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,720
Yeah, right?

401
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,180
Does she know that
you recorded the video?

402
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,380
So what if she knows?
What can she do to me?

403
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,000
Mr. Xue resigned for her sake,

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,920
yet she's thick-skinned enough
to come and have lunch here.

405
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,579
I think

406
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,900
Mr. Xue was just toying with her.

407
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,009
Did you guys read the group chat?

408
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,299
Mr. Xue is resigning

409
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,689
in order to find an excuse to dump her.

410
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,700
Hello.

411
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,700
- Hello.
- I think so.

412
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,770
It's Mr. Xue.

413
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,570
- Hello, Mr. Xue.
- Sit down.

414
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,689
By the way,

415
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,009
I'm no longer the General Manager.

416
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,220
So, don't call me Mr. Xue in the future.

417
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,169
Please resume your meal.

418
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,730
I'm here to look for my girlfriend.

419
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,339
- Girlfriend?
- Girlfriend?

420
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,249
What did he say?

421
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,180
He said girlfriend.

422
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,169
- My goodness.
- It's official now.

423
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,900
- My goodness.
- Look at them.

424
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,379
What are you doing here?

425
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,899
I have an appointment.

426
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,290
But it's not time yet.

427
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,209
That's why I came here

428
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,330
to deliver dessert to you.

429
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,900
Isn't that obvious enough?

430
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,460
Dad will miss you.

431
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,729
Goodbye, Dad.

432
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,779
You have to visit us on Christmas.

433
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,050
I'll try my best.

434
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,380
You're so cute.

435
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,250
Give me another hug.

436
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,220
Alright now.

437
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,180
Do you feel disappointed

438
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,860
that Migao isn't reluctant
to part with you?

439
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,420
A little bit.

440
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,970
What about you?

441
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,360
Are you sure you're not going
to stay and develop your career here?

442
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,770
Migao missed her friends

443
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,900
when she came back here.

444
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,420
To her,

445
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,940
you're just a father she sees
during the holidays.

446
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,330
It's my fault.
I did miss out on her growth.

447
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,900
I want to thank you for
educating Migao well too.

448
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,730
If I have time,

449
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,700
I'll visit you guys on Christmas.

450
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,100
Seems like I didn't meet you

451
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,050
at the right time.

452
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,420
I believe that you'll meet
the right person eventually.

453
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,449
Goodbye.

454
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,730
(Once, we desired plenty of things.)

455
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,530
(We tried our best to climb upward
and grab onto everything we had.)

456
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,420
(But when we think about it, we realize)

457
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,380
(that life is supposed)

458
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,490
(to be simple.)

459
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,010
(One house, two individuals,)

460
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,940
(three meals, four seasons.)

461
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,570
(That's the life I desire.)

462
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,460
(A life together with you.)

463
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,180
Baby.

464
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,050
He looks just like you
when you were a baby.

465
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,489
I've bought plenty
of new clothes for you.

466
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,779
Let's try them on

467
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,860
when we go home, okay?

468
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,660
Mom,

469
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,730
thank you.

470
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,409
Silly child.

471
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,010
Why didn't you call me back then?

472
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,330
I thought I could do it myself.

473
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,660
But giving birth was tough.

474
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,290
It was too tough for me.

475
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,579
Alright now. Stop crying.

476
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,700
Stop crying.

477
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,330
You already pulled through.
You should be happy about it.

478
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,290
Look, you have an adorable baby.

479
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,050
You should be happy about it.

480
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,660
Be happy.

481
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,209
I've hired the best
maternity nurse for you.

482
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,489
Once you're discharged,

483
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,330
we'll live in our house.

484
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,290
I won't let you suffer again.

485
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,250
You mustn't cry during
the confinement period.

486
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,290
Look at how cute he is.

487
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,100
- In-law.
- Mom.

488
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,689
We've been waiting here for three days.

489
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,249
You should let us take a look
at the baby

490
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,860
and Guo.

491
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,859
You should go back and take care

492
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,380
of your own daughter.

493
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,490
Both my grandson and Guo
don't need your concern.

494
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,380
Mom.

495
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,180
I know you're still angry at me.

496
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,899
Yan slit her wrist back then.

497
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,249
The family was in turmoil.

498
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,579
But I did neglect Guo.

499
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,330
You can scold me or hit me all you like.

500
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,059
I just hope that
you can give me a chance

501
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,810
to apologize to Guo.

502
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,689
You have to give us a chance
to apologize to Guo.

503
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,249
I promise I'll serve her
and take care of her

504
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,579
when she's discharged from the hospital.

505
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,449
I guarantee with my life.

506
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,689
Yan, don't you trust me?

507
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,620
Who wants your life?

508
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,460
Guo almost lost her life, you know?

509
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,420
What's the use of your life?

510
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,570
Did you see that?

511
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,940
That's the private ward
I prepared for Guo.

512
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,409
I hired the
best maternity nurse for her.

513
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,660
You want to serve her
and make it up to her?

514
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,420
How?

515
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,409
Guo already made up her mind.

516
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,730
She'll do her confinement period
in my house after being discharged.

517
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,570
You don't need to worry about her.

518
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,539
Mom.

519
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,579
Wang Yan, you better
don't cross the line!

520
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,779
Do you think you can truly

521
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,929
claim my grandson to your own?

522
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,099
He belongs to our family!
His surname is Yu, you know?

523
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,679
Sorry about that.

524
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,729
How could you point fingers at us?

525
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,860
Mom, just stop it!

526
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,860
She's too much!

527
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,460
In the end, it was our fault.

528
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,490
Guo almost lost her life
delivering my child.

529
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,660
That's our fault.

530
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,660
If Yan was in her shoes,

531
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,420
I'm not sure
what condition you'll be in.

532
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,940
What condition I'll be in?

533
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,810
I'm not capable enough.

534
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,619
If you're that capable,

535
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,940
you should take your wife
and child home!

536
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,779
(Leshan Women and Children's Hospital)

537
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,929
(Yu Jian: Dear, it's my fault.)

538
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,169
(I have no way to explain myself.)

539
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,640
(It's fine that you're not forgiving me.)

540
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,680
(But you have to give me a chance
to apologize for my mistake.)

541
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,009
(Dear, does it still hurt?)

542
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,779
(Mom and I have been
waiting here for three days.)

543
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,449
(Let us come inside and take a look.)

544
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,139
(Dear, if you don't want
to let me see Chen,)

545
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,899
(can you at least
show me a picture of him?)

546
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,009
(Dear, do you feel better today?)

547
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,729
(Please spare us.)

548
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,010
(Even one minute is fine.)

549
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,689
(Dear, are you asleep?)

550
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,059
(Right now, I'm all alone.)

551
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,660
(I miss you guys so much.)

552
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,100
Miss,

553
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,940
the baby's father is still waiting

554
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,530
outside the door.

555
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,010
It's been tough on him too.

556
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,810
He's been waiting for many days.

557
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,009
Let him in.

558
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,729
Okay.

559
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,140
I'll call him now.

560
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,460
Dear.

561
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,139
I didn't interrupt your rest, did I?

562
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,290
How's the recovery going?

563
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,250
I'm fine.

564
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,050
You can take a look at our child.

565
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,970
What a good boy.

566
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,860
Chen,

567
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,100
I'm begging you.

568
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,460
You must be a good boy, okay?

569
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,380
Don't cause any trouble.

570
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,660
Let Mom rest well,

571
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,010
you hear me?

572
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,339
This child is like me.

573
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,900
I never cause trouble.
I slept a lot when I was a baby.

574
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,250
How's Yan doing?

575
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,050
Luckily, her arteries were not damaged.

576
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,099
But she lost her child.

577
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,770
She was unconscious for
the entire night.

578
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,290
She only woke up on the second day.

579
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,660
She just left the hospital yesterday.

580
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,460
Even now,

581
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,940
she's not willing to speak with us.

582
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,140
Guo,

583
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,570
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,339
That night, I...

585
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,100
I'll be discharged by tomorrow.

586
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,290
Okay.

587
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,420
If so, I'll pick you up tomorrow.

588
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,420
I mean, I'll pick you up
and send you back to your home.

589
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,970
Mom already told me about it.

590
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,530
Mom already retrieved the house.

591
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,290
I'm more used to living there.

592
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,810
Alright. I'll heed your will.

593
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,380
If so, I'll bring the things
I bought for Chen

594
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,730
there as well.

595
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,970
Here.

596
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
Dear,

597
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,380
does it still hurt?

598
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,420
You should go.

599
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,810
I need to rest.

600
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,100
Okay.

601
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,140
I'll head back first.

602
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,100
Dear,

603
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,220
can I take some pictures of Chen?

604
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,250
Dad and Mom haven't
gotten to see him yet.

605
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,220
I'll leave, then.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

606
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,460
I'll be leaving now.

607
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,360
(Nurse Station)

608
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,570
This is my son!

609
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,180
It's my son.

610
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,209
Chen!

611
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,810
I'm shedding tears over it.

612
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,489
Chen.

613
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,529
Jian, who do you think he takes after?

614
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,620
He looks just like
Jian when he was a baby.

615
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,609
Am I right, Chen?

616
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,810
I think he looks like your mother.

617
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,609
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

618
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,009
Look. He does resemble Guo too.

619
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,999
He resembles his grandmother.

620
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,899
Wang Yan did do a good job
in raising the child.

621
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,180
It's the same if you let me raise him.

622
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,760
It's not like
they're raising him themselves.

623
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,240
Anyone can hire
a maternity nurse, you know?

624
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,129
I can do it too if I have the money.
Am I right?

625
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,609
- Mom.
- Am I right?

626
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,489
I'll send the picture to you later.

627
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,220
I need to pick up Guo and Chen.

628
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,450
When will you bring the child back?

629
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,819
Guo has to have a limit

630
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,580
to her tantrum, right?

631
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,020
It's all her mother's fault.

632
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,660
She wants to take our first grandson
as her private asset.

633
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,409
Did you hear me?

634
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,339
Yeah.

635
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,370
Hurry up.

636
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,060
Coming.

637
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,930
Is this Ms. Yu Yan's house?

638
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,379
Hello.

639
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,580
I'm an attorney representing Mr. Andrew.

640
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,899
There's a divorce agreement here.

641
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,450
I need her to take a look.

642
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,500
Divorce agreement?

643
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,449
What are you saying?

644
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,660
You better scram!

645
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,379
- Dad!
- How could you hit me?

646
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,179
That's what I'm going to do!

647
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,529
You better scram!

648
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,410
Wait!

649
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,699
This is a legal proceeding!

650
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,409
My foot!

651
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,569
To hell with your legal proceeding!
Bring Andrew here!

652
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,040
I'll tell him
all about the legal proceeding!

653
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,089
- I'm his attorney!
- How dare you bully my daughter?

654
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,179
How dare you bully the Yu family?

655
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,699
How dare you bully my daughter?

656
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,180
Calm down! This is a harmonious society!

657
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,819
You're breaking the law
by hitting people.

658
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,929
How dare you bully
Chinese people like us?

659
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,089
- I won't spare you!
- This is a harmonious society!

660
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,620
It's wrong for you to hit people!

661
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,659
- I'll slay you!
- Dad!

662
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,370
- Stop it!
- Dad!

663
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,290
Show me the agreement.

664
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,120
(Divorce Agreement)

665
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,980
Alright.

666
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,020
Give me your contact number.

667
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,370
Okay.

668
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,660
This is my name card.

669
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,250
Goodbye.

670
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,819
Dad.

671
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,890
Your waist hasn't recovered yet.
Why did you do that?

672
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,890
Give it to me.

673
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,259
You did give it your all, huh?

674
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,850
What if you get hurt again?

675
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,890
Mom, did you cook?

676
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,540
I'm hungry.

677
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,770
Baby, we're home.

678
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,850
Baby, are you hungry?

679
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,730
Granny will bathe you at home.

680
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,370
Bring the things in.

681
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,180
Okay.

682
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,100
Look at your new toys.

683
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,660
We're home.

684
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,850
It's comfortable at home, right?

685
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,540
The bed is ready.

686
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,739
Come.

687
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,060
Come, Chen.

688
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,330
Let's try our new bed.

689
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,980
You're yawning, huh?

690
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,770
What's wrong?

691
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,660
Here, give him this pillow.

692
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,330
Here you go, my baby.

693
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,770
Let me put a pillow under your head.

694
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,700
Mom,

695
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,540
I have something
to discuss with you guys.

696
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,899
Can I bring

697
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,009
Guo and Chen back home
in a few more days?

698
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,290
My parents haven't
gotten to see Chen yet.

699
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,609
Guo is in her confinement period.

700
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,180
Besides, it's cold outside.

701
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,819
You want Guo and Chen to travel around?

702
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,330
What are you thinking?

703
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,980
The bed is complete.

704
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,960
I'll clean it up bit by bit.
You can go to work.

705
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,370
Stay out of this.

706
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,020
Got it.

707
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,580
You have a point.

708
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,060
I was inconsiderate.

709
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,450
We can talk about it
when the weather gets warmer.

710
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,700
Madam,

711
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,060
the bath water is warm now.

712
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,410
Alright.

713
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,660
Baby, let's go and take a bath.

714
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,330
Come, Chen.

715
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,330
Go now.

716
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,250
I'll help my mother out.

717
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,930
If so, I'll head to work first.

718
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,850
This situation can be handled easily.

719
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,020
Don't worry. There will be no issue.
I don't have time to waste on her.

720
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,540
Andrew!

721
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,859
You scum!

722
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,930
What do you want?

723
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,140
Mister!

724
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,980
Mister!

725
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,699
Calm down, mister!

726
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Scram!

727
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,859
It's wrong to hit someone!

728
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,000
Scram!

729
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,220
How dare you bully my sister?

730
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,489
Help! He's hitting someone!

731
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,370
Is this 110?

732
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,500
There's a fight over here!

733
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,219
(Xiaojiang Police Station)

734
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,819
You guys can talk it over in the future.

735
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,700
Do not fight again, got it?

736
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,370
Alright. You guys may go.

737
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,220
Andrew was intimidated by you.

738
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,370
I thought he would extort us for it.

739
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,810
Yan.

740
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,140
Sorry for the trouble.

741
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,450
Jian, you did that on my behalf.

742
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,299
I know you can't take it

743
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,620
without venting your frustrations.

744
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,290
I was blind,

745
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,410
so I married to a guy like him,

746
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,620
and made you guys worry about me.

747
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,770
That's why Guo hasn't
forgiven you until now.

748
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,370
Jian, I owe you for this.

749
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,540
We're a family.
We don't owe each other anything.

750
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,730
Don't worry about Guo and I.

751
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,620
But I heard that you were going to
return to the U.S. with that scum.

752
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,410
Is that true?

753
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,410
I've made up my mind

754
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,770
after you beat him up.

755
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,290
If you return with him,

756
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,770
doesn't that make him more unscrupulous?

757
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,569
I've already experienced death once.

758
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,700
Why would I fear him?

759
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,540
I plan to finish

760
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,700
my postgraduate course
after divorcing him.

761
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,370
After that, I'll come back here.

762
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,250
Come. Let's go home.

763
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,890
Mom, why are you not asleep yet?

764
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,410
You didn't take enough
clothes with you.

765
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,770
Listen,

766
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,609
you shouldn't return
to your house in the U.S.

767
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,259
Just leave everything there, you hear me?

768
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,520
Return to your academy immediately.

769
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,060
If you need anything,
I'll buy them for you.

770
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,810
Got it.

771
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,819
Mom, just leave it there.

772
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,449
I'll do it myself.

773
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,819
- Go somewhere else.
- It's fine.

774
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,529
Just leave it there.

775
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,819
Mom, it's fine. Just leave it there.

776
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,810
Just go.

777
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,379
Don't move.

778
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,379
Sit down.

779
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,660
Sit down!

780
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,730
Look at what you've done.

781
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,100
Mom,

782
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,770
do you care for me?

783
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,290
What's with that question?

784
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,969
All mothers
care for their children, you know?

785
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,220
I cared for you the most
since you were young.

786
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,660
Think about it.

787
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,529
Your father, your brother,

788
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,659
and your sister-in-law,

789
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,890
since when was I worried about them?

790
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,100
You've always cared for me, right?

791
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,450
I'm just angry.

792
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,489
I'm angry that you did this to yourself.

793
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,890
How could you do this to yourself?

794
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,220
I always thought that I was a burden.

795
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,129
I'm good at nothing.

796
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,779
I kept causing trouble for you guys.

797
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,929
You guys had to worry about me.

798
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,290
Enough already. Just stop it.

799
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,540
That's not true.

800
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,100
Mom,

801
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,700
can you praise me?

802
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,140
I...

803
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,859
I've always praised you.

804
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,250
You're good at everything.

805
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,290
You never praised me before.

806
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,930
How could that be?

807
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,730
Have you praised me for my study

808
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,020
or my marriage before?

809
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,620
You always criticized me since young.

810
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,020
You blamed me and
made arrangements for me.

811
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,609
When I was young,

812
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,850
when I first received
the Model Student Award,

813
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,680
you said Jian already
received that award long ago.

814
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,220
When I got third place
in the long-distance running contest,

815
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,659
you said I could come in first place

816
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
if I put in more effort.

817
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,859
Do you remember what you said

818
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,980
when I passed the threshold
for my overseas study?

819
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,609
You said I shouldn't

820
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,540
let the family's money go to waste.

821
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,339
I always wanted you to praise me,

822
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,890
even if you'll only do it once.

823
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,450
You...

824
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,659
If you don't know
what to praise about me,

825
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,850
you can praise my new hairstyle.

826
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,540
Your hair,

827
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,500
it's too short.

828
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,700
Yan.

829
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,620
You're good.

830
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,730
You're great.

831
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,540
You're excellent.

832
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,730
Alright.

833
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,540
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

834
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,370
And, I promise you guys

835
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,250
that

836
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,819
I won't make you guys worry about me

837
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,180
in the future.

838
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,450
Here.

839
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,850
Look.

840
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,259
This is the apartment near the academy.

841
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,700
I've already checked the price.

842
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,140
This is the attorney for the court case.

843
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,220
The divorce
will definitely proceed smoothly.

844
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,450
