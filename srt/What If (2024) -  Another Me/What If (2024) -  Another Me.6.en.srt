(Mundane life or prospective future?)

4
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,970
Have you taken everything?

5
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,410
This is the last box.

6
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,100
I didn't expect

7
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,660
we would lose our job like this.

8
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,300
The merger of the Chengdu
and Leshan branches

9
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,770
is inevitable.

10
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,580
Fortunately, you found a job.

11
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:12,090
Consider this as a cusp in life.

12
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,420
When I go to the Chengdu branch,

13
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:16,628
I have to travel
between my home and the company.

14
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,530
I'm worried I might not manage.

15
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,210
We should go.

16
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,810
Thank you, Ms. Ping.

17
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,740
Enough.

18
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,942
You are saying it
like this is our last farewell.

19
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:37,110
If I come across any good opportunities,
I'll introduce them to you.

20
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,650
Don't worry too much.

21
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,620
Give yourself a break.

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Take a rest.

23
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,620
Take care of yourself
when you are in Chengdu.

24
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,810
Text me at any time.

25
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,610
You may go.

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,930
Bye.

27
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,490
(Life in a small circle)

28
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,810
(isn't smooth either.)

29
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,370
(The unknown future makes me wonder)

30
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,300
(whether I made the right choice.)

31
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,020
Yam Head, I'm back.

32
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,260
(Ice jelly)

33
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,020
Guo,

34
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,620
let's get married.

35
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,580
I don't want to wait anymore.

36
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,730
Xia Guo,

37
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,580
will you marry me?

38
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,060
But...

39
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,900
But your dad is still in the hospital.

40
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,460
I'm jobless. I...

41
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,290
So, you don't want to marry me?

42
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,620
It's not that.

43
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,200
I will take that as a yes.

44
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,980
♪There's no need to make a choice♪

45
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,020

(Outpatient)

53
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,170
Why did you make a hasty decision?

54
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,460
Mom,

55
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,500
Guo and I are not young anymore.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,380
Many of her schoolmates
are planning to have a second child.

57
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,020
Besides, she gave up
her job in Shanghai for us.

58
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,940
Now, she is jobless.

59
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,700
I have to take the responsibility
for her.

60
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,380
Haven't we always
taken responsibility for Guo?

61
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,714
How are you going to get married,
given the current situation at home?

62
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,610
You never considered us.

63
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,140
Here's what I think.

64
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,810
You see, both of them

65
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,250
have dated for a long time.

66
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,490
It's time to take the plunge.

67
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,290
Do you think marriage is easy?

68
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,660
Let me ask you this.

69
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,720
Where are you going to stay
after getting married?

70
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,140
Guo will marry me.

71
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,160
We'll stay at home.

72
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
That's right.

73
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,540
Your dad is going back
from the hospital soon.

74
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,850
Is she okay squeezing together with us?

75
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,100
People might think
we take Guo in to serve the elderly.

76
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,640
Mom, you can't control

77
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
what others think.

78
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,330
Guo isn't snobbish.

79
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,010
If she minded
our family's condition,

80
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,740
she would have broken up
with me long ago.

81
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,000
Although she never mentions it,

82
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,570
do you know the thoughts
deep inside her?

83
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,620
Here, Dad.

84
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,740
How about this?

85
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,010
Guo and I will rent a house nearby.

86
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,780
Is that good?

87
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,742
How are you going to pay the rent?

88
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,220
You say you want to get married,

89
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,370
yet you waste money.

90
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,660
How are you going to
carry on your life and raise kids?

91
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,300
Mom, you are overthinking it.

92
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,300
Anyway, we will
take care of our own business.

93
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,570
Don't worry about us.

94
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,450
Well, you...

95
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,620
Shut up.

96
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,890
I will do it myself.

97
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,620
I know this is your favorite,
so I bought it.

98
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,330
Thanks, Mrs. Yu.

99
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,210
I only bought a few.
I'm not sure how it tastes.

100
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,690
- Let me try.
- It's quite expensive.

101
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,300
So sweet.

102
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,330
Are you out for job hunting later?

103
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,690
I will cook you some noodles.

104
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,250
I will do it.

105
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:22,220
It's fine, Mrs. Yu.

106
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,457
You just got back from the hospital.
I will do it.

107
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,450
How could I bother you
with household chores

108
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,810
when you are in my house?

109
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,780
It's fine.

110
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,420
I heard

111
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,860
that Yu Jian and you

112
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,970
are going to get married.

113
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,180
Let me ask you.

114
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,970
Where do you want to stay
after getting married?

115
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,330
We haven't talked about it yet.

116
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,380
Well, I think getting married
is a good thing, right?

117
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,314
You both should've done that earlier.

118
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,020
But young people don't like to stay
with the older generation.

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,420
It's uncomfortable, right?

120
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,610
Not at all, Mrs. Yu.

121
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,060
I think it's good
for a family to live together.

122
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,000
And Mr. Yu will be discharged
from the hospital.

123
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,180
We can look after him as well.

124
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,420
How could I ask my daughter-in-law

125
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,400
to look after him
when she married into the house?

126
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,140
It's fine.

127
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,500
What I mean is

128
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,930
that your mom has an apartment, right?

129
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,850
It isn't big.

130
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,900
Mrs. Yu, I know you care about us.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,570
But the house is my mom's.

132
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,810
It has nothing to do with me.

133
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,500
How could it be?

134
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,380
Who did your dad leave it for?

135
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,450
You are his daughter.

136
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,914
I have never thought of that before.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,171
And my mom certainly wouldn't
think of that either.

138
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,540
Don't worry, Mrs. Yu.

139
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,810
After we get married,

140
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,540
Yu Jian and I will rent a place outside.

141
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,660
That would be a huge expense.

142
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,930
Mrs. Yu, you know that.

143
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,260
The apartment

144
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,610
is on a long-term lease.

145
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,450
I can't ask my mom
to drive the tenant away, right?

146
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,300
I forgot.

147
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,690
My memory is like a sieve.

148
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,210
Here, eat the orange.

149
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,210
Let's eat.

150
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,730
Hello.

151
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,090
Hello, who are you looking for?

152
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,690
Are you the tenant of No. 502?

153
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,500
What's the matter?

154
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,180
Well, here's the thing.

155
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,900
I'm the landlady's in-law.

156
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,730
I came to visit you.

157
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,260
I brought you a fruit basket.

158
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,040
- No.
- It's fine.

159
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,450
It's fine. Take it.

160
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,260
- Well.
- Let's talk.

161
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,600
You don't have to be so courteous.

162
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,380
Madam.

163
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,180
On what basis should we believe you?

164
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,690
Who are you to ask us to move out?

165
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,380
That's right.

166
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,690
Wang Yan and I are in-laws.

167
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,690
We are a family.

168
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,210
She is too embarrassed to tell you,

169
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,260
so she sends me here.

170
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,371
Madam, we are not going
to discuss this with you.

171
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,180
Let the landlady talk to us.

172
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,880
I would like to ask her.

173
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,960
We signed a three-year lease,

174
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,140
and we pay the rent on time.

175
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,420
What is it now?

176
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,900
We are asked to move out
in less than half of a year.

177
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,450
- Are you pulling our leg?
- That's right.

178
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,900
Please understand us.

179
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,060
Did you pay the deposit

180
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,450
and three months' rent in advance?

181
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,180
I can offer you an extra month's rent.
Is that okay?

182
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,810
Madam,

183
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,140
please understand us.

184
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,900
Look at my wife.

185
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,420
She is pregnant.

186
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,540
The baby is due too.

187
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,420
Do you think

188
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,810
it's appropriate for us

189
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,140
to look for a new place now?

190
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,300
But my children

191
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,450
can't sleep on the street.

192
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,210
They will get married, right?

193
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,420
Look at my pregnant belly.

194
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,020
How could I possibly move out?

195
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,850
That's right.

196
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,420
Are you all right, dear?

197
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,420
The baby kicks me.

198
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,660
Be careful.

199
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,460
Madam, do you want to negotiate?

200
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,380
We won't move out.

201
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,300
Let's go there.

202
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,330
I'll negotiate with you.

203
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,380
All right? Come.

204
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,010
Madam, please leave.

205
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,140
Take your fruit basket

206
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,020
- and don't come again.
- Let's talk this out.

207
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,240
- No.
- If you have any ideas,

208
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,570
- Madam, take it.
- you can tell me.

209
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,730
Don't drop it. Be careful.

210
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,850
Hello?

211
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,420
What's wrong with Zhang Xiaoqin?

212
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:06,180
What has happened?

213
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,380
She went to my house

214
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,300
and asked the tenant to move out.

215
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,060
Is she sick in the head?

216
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,140
I need you to come here now.

217
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,780
Of course, I have to say this.

218
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,330
Yu Jian's dad is bedridden,

219
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,810
and her sister is in the US.

220
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,290
She doesn't care about anything here.

221
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,210
Yu Jian is working under the government.

222
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,420
He can't even afford a house.

223
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,730
What can you get from him?

224
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:29,420
I don't want anything from him.

225
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,140
I like him because he is nice
and his family is also nice.

226
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,780
Mom, how could you take Guo's house?

227
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,330
Do you really want your son
to live off his wife?

228
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,970
How could you say that?

229
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,810
I just want you to have your own house
after you get married.

230
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,660
Are you looking for a job?

231
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,130
(Recruit)

232
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,610
You should've listened to me

233
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,570
to go to Shanghai.

234
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,420
Yeah.

235
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,380
Luckily, I didn't stay in your house.

236
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,900
Or I could've paid for the rent.

237
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,090
I'm so livid when you talk about this.

238
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,540
You are staying in their house now.

239
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,180
But they never
propose marriage properly,

240
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,930
not even the courtesy
of having a meal together.

241
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,380
Do you really need that?

242
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,180
Do you?

243
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,300
Mom, if you really care about me,

244
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,810
you should stop bothering Guo
about the house.

245
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,180
Where can you get a house?

246
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,180
Wait, the house...

247
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,290
Do you know how much a house is?
Can you afford that?

248
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,570
They don't respect me at all.

249
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,450
I'm your mother.

250
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,970
He won't take you seriously
if he doesn't respect me.

251
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:27,057
Shouldn't you reflect on
why they did this to you?

252
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,140
How do you expect others to respect you

253
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,771
when you charge your own daughter rent?

254
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,420
Guo,

255
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,060
you haven't married him yet,

256
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,330
and you are taking his side.

257
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,660
She has a house.
Why doesn't she stay there?

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,257
You wouldn't understand what I say.

259
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,060
Let me ask you.

260
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,780
Are you getting married or not?

261
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:47,940
If you are willing
to marry into this kind of family

262
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,980
and serve this kind of in-laws,

263
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,970
I don't care.

264
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,850
Even so, we can't stay
in her mom's house.

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,540
You know very well the situation
of her family is complicated.

266
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,140
What's so complicated?

267
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,330
Her dad bought the house.

268
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,730
Tell Zhang Xiaoqin

269
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,570
not to come after my house.

270
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,370
No way.

271
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,710
Right? He divorced her mom,
and left the property to them.

272
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,330
Guo has a share in it too.

273
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,930
When your dad left,

274
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:12,330
the debt hadn't been cleared yet.

275
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,690
Mr. Zheng paid for it.

276
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,780
This house belongs to you, me,

277
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,570
and Mr. Zheng.

278
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:21,970
Idiot.

279
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,810
What's wrong?

280
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,260
Stupid.

281
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,690
How are things going today?

282
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,530
It's fine.

283
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,090
Take your time.

284
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,210
- Well.
- Well.

285
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:42,850
- After you.
- After you.

286
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,810
You go first.

287
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,690
Nothing else.

288
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,930
I'm hungry.

289
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:49,228
What do you want to eat?

290
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,090
I want...

291
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,320
I'm fine with anything.
What do you want?

292
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,420
Hotpot, skewers, or stir-fried dishes?

293
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:57,942
But I want to eat all of them.

294
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,210
We will eat all of them.

295
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,660
Come on.

296
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,060
It's daytime now.

297
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,930
You are too slow.

298
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,180
Open your eyes.

299
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,660
Eat the food.

300
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,540
Tortoise.

301
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,810
Guo.

302
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,210
Mrs. Yu.

303
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:42,810
Didn't Yu Jian come back with you?

304
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,260
We had lunch together just now.

305
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,457
He went back to the hospital
to look after Mr. Yu.

306
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,500
I left some food for you guys.

307
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,930
Yu Jian didn't tell you anything,
did he?

308
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,828
Mrs. Yu, since I was little,

309
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,720
you have never treated me
like an outsider.

310
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,460
You have always cared about me.

311
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,850
I really appreciate that.

312
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,810
But you know about the situation
in my family.

313
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,260
I don't want to have conflicts
with my mom.

314
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,980
So you don't have to
argue with her for me, all right?

315
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,540
I was too impulsive.

316
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,850
I have caused you trouble.

317
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,570
But I'm really angry.

318
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,610
Your name should be registered

319
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,850
on the property certificate.
How come it isn't?

320
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,900
Your mom has gone too far.

321
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,020
Who told you this?

322
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,260
My dad put my name on it

323
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,700
when he bought the house.

324
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,700
Your name is on it?

325
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,320
That's great.

326
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,300
Wonderful.

327
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,570
I was just guessing.

328
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,980
Then why did she charge you the rent?

329
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,810
This is unreasonable.

330
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,650
Mrs. Yu,

331
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,485
I don't want to talk about this again.

332
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,850
Don't worry.

333
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,570
Yu Jian and I have discussed it.

334
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,700
After we get married,

335
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,220
we won't ask for money from you.

336
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,610
We will rely on ourselves.

337
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,940
Yes. That's good.

338
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,090
You rely on yourself.

339
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,485
So don't worry.
I'm going back to my room.

340
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,130
You rely on yourselves.

341
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,940
Of course, you do.

342
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,130
Put that off your mind.

343
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,700
I will talk to Mom.

344
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,060
I can understand her.

345
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,610
Your dad is coming back soon.

346
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:23,980
It won't be easy for him
to move around in the house

347
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,020
when we stay there
after getting married.

348
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,330
Actually, I don't mind.

349
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:30,920
When I was sick back then,

350
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,460
your parents took care of me.

351
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,060
I live comfortably with them around.

352
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,020
Guo,

353
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,940
anyway, I will figure something out

354
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
about the house.

355
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,570
Don't worry.

356
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,460
Go to bed early, all right?

357
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,980
All right.

358
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,740
Take a rest while your dad
is sleeping now.

359
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,700
You must be tired.

360
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,380
Get rest early.

361
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,220
All right.

362
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,380
Love you.

363
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,220
I love you too.

364
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,260
I'm hanging up.

365
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,330
Bye.

366
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,220
(Whether I stay or leave this city,)

367
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,740
(troubles are part of life.)

368
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:10,180
(But there is always)

369
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,170
(a solution to the problem.)

370
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,220
(Take every step seriously)

371
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,220
(and live every moment well.)

372
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,980
(That's how
we won't let ourselves down.)

373
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,330
Mr. Xue.

374
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,460
Are you up?

375
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,940
Yes.

376
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,370
Come to my office when you arrive.

377
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,090
All right.

378
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Mr. Xue, Ms. Chen.

379
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,971
It's the first time Mr. Xue asked
to borrow someone.

380
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,170
How could I turn him down?

381
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,490
Xia Guo, you are now seconded

382
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,570
to be Mr. Xue's assistant.

383
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,700
But you still belong to
the Marketing Department.

384
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,720
Your sales performance is
also recorded under us.

385
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,980
Thank you, Ms. Nan.

386
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,570
All right, you will
learn from Mr. Xue now.

387
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,810
Please help me to guide her, Mr. Xue.

388
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,700
I should thank you for helping me

389
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,114
when I'm in urgent need of staff.

390
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,090
Thank you.

391
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,500
You are welcome.

392
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,890
Please go ahead.

393
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,770
Mr. Xue, Ms. Chen...

394
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,890
No worries.

395
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,940
You are my assistant now.

396
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,520
Of course, you also belong
to the Marketing Department.

397
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,850
Nothing has changed.

398
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,260
Work hard to set up the pop-up stores.

399
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,220
At the very least, you can secure
the performance of this quarter.

400
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,410
Yes, Mr. Xue.

401
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,610
Here's for you.

402
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,010
(Haijiang Business School)

403
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,020
Haijiang Business School?

404
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,020
Weekend classes.

405
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,610
It won't affect your work.

406
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,740
Go and recharge yourself.

407
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,170
Mr. Xue,

408
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,650
does the company

409
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,740
expense this?

410
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,500
Are you not going if it doesn't?

411
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,980
No, I didn't mean that.

412
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:11,980
I will cover it for you.

413
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,220
Thank you.

414
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,050
Go ahead.

415
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,940
You are so nice.

416
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,260
Thank you.

417
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,130
I have some money left.
I will transfer it to you.

418
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,810
The expenses at home are high,

419
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,200
you have to support the family.

420
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,300
You don't need to rush to Shanghai
for the time being.

421
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,410
I can't take your money.

422
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:49,170
I have to work during the day
and look after my dad at night.

423
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,810
If I take on the project,

424
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,020
I won't even have time
to video call you.

425
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
Well, that's all I need to hear.

426
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,980
As long as you still care about me.

427
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,370
Besides, I've been busy lately.

428
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,500
Later, I need to prepare a price list

429
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,700
of the company's products.

430
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,780
Why are you doing this?

431
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:09,571
Aren't you in the Marketing Department?

432
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,170
I have become Mr. Xue's assistant.

433
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:12,290
When did that happen?

434
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,220
Why didn't you tell me?

435
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,220
I was transferred.
That's why I'm telling you now.

436
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,540
Wait, why did they choose you
out of all people?

437
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,500
Cherish it if I have a job.

438
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,130
Besides, it's a rare opportunity.

439
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,500
I can learn a lot.

440
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,940
Did Ms. Nan agree with this?

441
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,500
Doesn't she have conflicts with Mr. Xue?

442
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,130
Ms. Nan agreed.

443
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,780
How could she agree?

444
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,500
She brought you there from Leshan.

445
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,130
This is complicated.

446
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,780
I can explain it to you
in a word or two.

447
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,170
Both of them don't see eye to eye.

448
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,800
I don't want to take
either side of them.

449
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,570
Anyway, I just need

450
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,700
to do my work well.

451
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,810
Right?

452
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,220
Does Mr. Xue have
other intentions against you?

453
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,850
No way. How is that even possible?

454
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,300
Anyway, you must be careful.

455
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,300
I... I always feel something is wrong.

456
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,810
Don't overthink.

457
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,300
You need to be more careful

458
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,610
with Yiming's project.

459
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,130
Yu Jian.

460
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,610
It's really you.

461
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
Wen Ya.

462
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,370
What a coincidence.

463
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,890
Are you here for Yiming?

464
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,850
He called me many times.

465
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,300
Finally, I have time today.

466
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,260
Yiming told me about it.

467
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,020
How's your dad's recovery after surgery?

468
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,370
Pretty well.

469
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,610
He's been transferred to
a rehabilitation hospital.

470
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,220
I'm so grateful to you last time,
Mr. Wang.

471
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,090
My dad wants to
invite you over for a drink

472
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,850
if you have time.

473
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,260
Sure.

474
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,130
What do you think?

475
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,220
Designer Yu designed this place.

476
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,220
I can see that.

477
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,460
If it were you,

478
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,980
it would be decorated
in traditional Chinese style.

479
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,170
Don't mock me.

480
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,170
Well, Wen Ya.

481
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,500
Should I tell

482
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,020
Yu Jian about that?

483
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,460
He always listens to you.

484
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,810
Please tell him.

485
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,540
What is it?

486
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,490
So secretive.

487
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,500
Take a seat first.

488
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,700
Last time, Wen Ya requested you
to design her flower shop.

489
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,228
But you wanted to leave for Shanghai.

490
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:27,620
She asked me again a few days ago.

491
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,890
I told her you didn't leave.

492
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,780
So she insisted I seek your help again.

493
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,520
This is what you called me here?

494
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,020
You could've told me over the phone.

495
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,220
I'm afraid you might reject it.

496
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,980
Wen Ya would blame me later.

497
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:40,330
When you said
you were coming over today,

498
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,570
I quickly called her.

499
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,010
Just tell her directly.

500
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,885
I don't want to be the messenger
anymore.

501
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,060
Yiming has tried to approach you
many times for my request.

502
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,770
Now that you are here today.

503
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,500
I think we are halfway through already.

504
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,500
Take a look first.

505
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,460
Please have a look
and see if you are interested.

506
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,810
Don't worry about the money.

507
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,740
You will be satisfied.

508
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,170
Here's the thing, Wen Ya.

509
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,020
I stayed in Leshan

510
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:14,850
because I wanted to look after my dad.

511
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,890
Now, his health is improving.

512
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,330
I have promised my girlfriend

513
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,257
I would go to Shanghai
as soon as possible.

514
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,260
To be honest,

515
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,980
the flower shop is a big project,

516
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,300
and it probably requires a longer time
to finish it.

517
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,540
If I can't finish your project

518
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,850
before I leave,

519
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,571
it will be troublesome for you.

520
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,980
Don't be so stubborn.

521
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,570
Just take a look

522
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,460
and see if you are interested.

523
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,060
Even if you leave eventually,

524
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:43,857
I can monitor the project for you.

525
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,090
That's right.

526
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,650
Please take a look first.

527
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,570
Please.

528
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,540
All right, I will take a look.

529
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,330
That's right.

530
00:25:57,914 --> 00:25:59,370
What do you think about it, Yu Jian?

531
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,260
Who drew this?

532
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,730
I have some ideas,

533
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,890
and I drew them out.

534
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,514
Give me some professional opinion.

535
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,220
Are you sure?

536
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,370
Yes.

537
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm sincerely seeking your opinion.

538
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,890
All right.

539
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,060
I will be frank with you.

540
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,740
You need to redo this.

541
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,460
It can't be used at all?

542
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,700
I think the divisions of the area
do make sense.

543
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,020
Why do I have to redo it?

544
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,700
This is a flower shop.

545
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,300
It sells flowers.

546
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,460
So, the entrance

547
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,780
must have wide and open exposure

548
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,020
to allow the sunlight

549
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,130
to shine on your flowers.

550
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,130
But due to your preference
for the cold wabi-sabi style,

551
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,940
you give up the wide exposure
to sunlight.

552
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,700
This is absurd.

553
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,460
I don't want the common design
like other flower shops

554
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,020
as they only have a spring season.

555
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,260
Besides, I read from the magazine...

556
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,020
Stop.

557
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,057
Just now, you mentioned
the division of areas.

558
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,380
The movement along
your display area, packaging area,

559
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,330
and storage is unreasonable.

560
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,980
The display area looks great at dusk.

561
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,770
I purposely

562
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,700
- designed a wide window for that.
- Nonsense.

563
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,130
This is the load-bearing wall.

564
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,810
If you make a window in that wall,

565
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,570
the entire shop would collapse.

566
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,460
You rebuke every idea I make.

567
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,810
I'm your client and I pay you money.

568
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,628
I seek your help to solve the problem.

569
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,020
The solution I offer
is to redo everything.

570
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,057
That's not what I want
for my flower shop.

571
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,650
Aren't you here

572
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,971
to seek professional opinions?

573
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,260
If you don't believe me,

574
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:35,457
you can consider
seeking a second opinion.

575
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
You are right.

576
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,980
I should consider that.

577
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,370
All right. Take your time.

578
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:51,610
(Yu Jian)
(Have you eaten yet?)

579
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,330
(Xia Guo)
(I'm eating.)

580
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,650
You look at your phone
three times during the meal.

581
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,610
Can you tell me

582
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,500
how many times it was related to work?

583
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,540
Twice.

584
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:05,940
Was it the company's group chat?

585
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,810
Yes.

586
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,890
What I mean is twice is far from enough.

587
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,890
It means your network isn't rich.

588
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,570
What should I do?

589
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,020
I recommend a course to you.

590
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:19,330
How is it coming along?

591
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,140
Don't worry. I work very hard on that.

592
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,570
I will definitely get an A.

593
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,730
Getting an A

594
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,460
isn't my intention to send you there.

595
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,650
What is it then?

596
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,940
Do you know all your classmates?

597
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,300
Yes, but we don't talk much.

598
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,610
The group chat is also quiet.

599
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,610
The lecturer said

600
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,460
we are the quietest batch.

601
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,460
None of the students

602
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,370
aims to get an A there.

603
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,142
Hey, Mr. Xue.

604
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,890
I always invite you,
but you never come.

605
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,650
Hi, Peter.

606
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,650
And now you came.

607
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,300
Let me introduce to you

608
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,940
my assistant, Xia Guo.

609
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,010
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

610
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,130
Please have a seat.

611
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,810
You are busy investing
and opening new stores.

612
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,780
I don't want to get in your way.

613
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,370
Well, it's nothing.

614
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,460
But there are always endless worries.

615
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,980
Why?

616
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,460
My wife wants to buy a property
in Huangpu River.

617
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:12,090
But it sold out in just a few days.

618
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:13,740
She has been fussing with me lately.

619
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,650
I have been asking around

620
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:17,300
to see if there are any reserved units.

621
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,740
Are you talking about
the Rongmao Palace?

622
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,500
Are you interested in that too?

623
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,460
No, I can't afford that.

624
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,610
But I just ate

625
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,540
with one of their person-in-charge

626
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,650
yesterday.

627
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,740
I didn't know your company
got involved in that area.

628
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
No, it's not.

629
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,090
His wife wanted to
start a restaurant chain,

630
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,370
so we're expecting a collaboration.

631
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,370
No wonder.

632
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,850
Please introduce him to me.

633
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,520
(Peter, owner of Sato Restaurant)
I get what you mean.

634
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,600
(Said to be a trust-fund baby)
I will make an arrangement for you.

635
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,020
I must thank you.

636
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,700
Today's meal is on me.

637
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,650
Impossible.

638
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,810
If this pans out well,

639
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,740
a meal isn't enough.

640
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,130
Oh, yeah.

641
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,380
One meal is not enough.

642
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,330
I'm kidding.

643
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,980
Don't worry. Count on me.

644
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,020
All right, don't let me keep you.

645
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,020
Sure.

646
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,114
I'll wait to hear from you.

647
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,300
Bye-bye.

648
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:12,085
Peter Huang. His Chinese name
is Huang Youkun.

649
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,000
His father is one of the shareholders
of the Huitong Department Store

650
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,330
in the US, which is also
the next target of our company.

651
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,540
Mr. Xue,

652
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,130
you brought me here
for a purpose, right?

653
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,650
You are not so dull.

654
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,610
Do you know how we met?

655
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:30,942
Is he your classmate
in the business school?

656
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,610
Not exactly.

657
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,170
I met him through my classmate.

658
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,260
When I was in the class,

659
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,890
getting an A wasn't my goal.

660
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,540
I get it now.

661
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,460
(You meet all kinds of people)

662
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,890
(in social situations.)

663
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,250
- (Their attire, speech, and character)
- Look over here.

664
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,620
(reflect their social status.)

665
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,730
Look at me and smile.

666
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,460
(Those in fancy clothes
may not be the boss.)

667
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,660
(Those who are passionate
may not have a say.)

668
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,220
You should observe them very carefully.

669
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,130
Isn't it handsome?

670
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,610
This is the third horse
my husband gave me.

671
00:31:12,828 --> 00:31:14,180
- Let's take a selfie.
- Come on.

672
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,850
So, you have to give them
what they want.

673
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,650
I have prepared a barbecue for tonight.

674
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,870
The dessert in the riding school
doesn't taste good.

675
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,460
Just make do with it, all right?

676
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,370
The Napoleon pastry
in your dessert house

677
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,710
has been selling like hotcakes.

678
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,220
I just ordered some

679
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,010
and thought we could try it together.

680
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,460
That's great, Guo.

681
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,610
You are so considerate.

682
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,770
We should always
share good food together.

683
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,460
Thank you.

684
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,090
This little cake looks quite nice.

685
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,090
And this too.

686
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,380
This is also good.

687
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,740
Is it mango?

688
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,850
Yes.

689
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,890
Your ring looks beautiful.

690
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,090
Where did you buy it?

691
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,010
It was sold out in Shanghai.

692
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,490
I saw it in the shopping mall when
I was on a business trip to Beijing.

693
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,980
I couldn't wait for the buying agent,
so I bought it.

694
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,490
I read online that
this is a limited edition.

695
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,330
It's hard to buy it.

696
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,410
You know this.

697
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,700
(When you are in the group,)

698
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,650
(humble yourself if necessary)

699
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,530
and draw attention to the individual
you aim for.

700
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,260
My boyfriend is so clingy.

701
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,770
Isn't that good?

702
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,180
My boyfriend is far away from me.

703
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,890
We can only have video calls every day.

704
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,570
I envy you.

705
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,050
It's good to be alone.

706
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,220
We can focus on work.

707
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,140
Don't you think so?

708
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,570
(Subtly show off yourself)

709
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,370
at the right moment.

710
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,810
Mr. Xue is always busy,

711
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,700
and I'm lucky to help him.

712
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,300
You are the assistant of Mr. Xue.

713
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,860
It's rare that Mr. Xue
gives you a day off

714
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
for us to gather.

715
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,900
Not at all.

716
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,940
Yeah.

717
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,980
Recently, outdoor luxury camping

718
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,460
has become quite a trend.

719
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,610
Why don't you consider doing something
like camping sites on your plot?

720
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,620
Right.

721
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,900
- That's brilliant.
- Sure.

722
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,770
My company can publicize it for you.

723
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,500
What do you think?

724
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,770
You can contact me
for the bedding supplies.

725
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,010
We know suppliers.

726
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,490
Let's arrange a meeting and discuss.

727
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,490
I will take care of
the food and beverage.

728
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,770
That's wonderful.

729
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,700
Sure.

730
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,490
You see,

731
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,980
we classmates should interact more.

732
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,090
We can come up with lots of new ideas

733
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,020
and progress together.

734
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,570
That's settled, then.

735
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,170
We should meet regularly.

736
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,340
(Camping Meals Proposal)

737
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,540
Interesting.

738
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,890
(When you observe people around you)

739
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,420
(with a different angle,)

740
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,314
(you will discover
a colorful side of them.)

741
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,810
(And when you interact with people
in a different way,)

742
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,180
(you will realize)

743
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,371
(that life is brimming
with learning opportunities.)

744
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,490
(I begin to look forward to)

745
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,300
(many unknown challenges.)

746
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:55,340
(Xiao Jie)

747
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,500
(Recent 28 live stream activities
The longest hours: 7.5; Audience: 26 million)

748
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,170
Mr. Lu,

749
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,660
you want Xiao Jie

750
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,850
to be the brand ambassador?

751
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,700
I know you are quick.

752
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,690
The result of Xiao Jie's live stream

753
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,210
is remarkably good.

754
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,060
You seized the opportunity.

755
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,650
Good job.

756
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,250
Can you try to invite Xiao Jie?

757
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,540
Ms. Chen,

758
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,860
you have worked with Xiao Jie
for some time.

759
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,170
Will it be a problem
to seal this deal with her?

760
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,010
We are too familiar with each other.

761
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,920
It's inappropriate for me
to negotiate with her.

762
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,730
Why?

763
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,010
The serious shortage

764
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,980
of our inventory
in the first live stream

765
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,285
still gives me the jitters
when I think about it now.

766
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
We had a few collaborations after that.

767
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,210
Though I have been very careful,

768
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,610
there are rumors saying
that we have some dirty deals

769
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,820
behind the scenes.

770
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,570
I would like to spare myself
from the gossip.

771
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,340
Ms. Chen's concern

772
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,780
sounds reasonable.

773
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,650
It's fine, I will find someone else.

774
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,290
It seems

775
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,730
that you have someone in mind.

776
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,900
Yes.

777
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,290
Me?

778
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,340
The budget is 1.5 million.

779
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,980
Do you have any idea how to negotiate?

780
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,420
I can't start with the base price.

781
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,420
I will offer 1.2 million.

782
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,060
That's high.

783
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,730
Cut down by half.

784
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,500
Half by?

785
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,650
800, 000?

786
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,460
That's harsh.

787
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,820
I mean, that's too much.

788
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:25,170
There is no market price reference

789
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,090
for the influence's endorsement.

790
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,690
The principle of negotiation is

791
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,460
whoever quotes first

792
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,250
sets the starting point.

793
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,300
800, 000.

794
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,780
- What do you think?
- This is tricky.

795
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,580
Do you have the confidence
to seal the deal?

796
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,860
I will try my best.

797
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,820
Thank you.

798
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,290
But

799
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,260
I have never

800
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,420
done this before.

801
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,260
I don't want to get ahead of myself,

802
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,820
Mr. Xue.

803
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Your attitude is good.

804
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,420
You know yourself.

805
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,610
It's fine.

806
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,260
Ask away

807
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,460
if you have any doubts now.

808
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,170
Instead of the price,

809
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,820
I'm more concerned

810
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
that if Xiao Jie sees that Haowei

811
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,300
sends an executive to talk to her,

812
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,090
she might think we look down on her.

813
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,730
If I were to go myself,

814
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,650
would Xiao Jie think

815
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,090
that Haowei needs her desperately

816
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,820
and then demand an absurd amount?

817
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,170
If we can get Xiao Jie,

818
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,210
live stream sales would be in the bag.

819
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,460
You think positively about
the future of live stream e-commerce?

820
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,770
Not really.

821
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,090
Even though

822
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,650
the sales volume is high,

823
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,020
the returned goods

824
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,210
are kind of a common occurrence.

825
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,420
I know

826
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,940
Chen Nan influences you a lot,

827
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,500
and you value the results
of the live stream e-commerce.

828
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:45,857
You keep up with the trend.

829
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,130
That's good.

830
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,420
But have we ever considered

831
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,060
the feelings of offline stores?

832
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,570
Under the heavy continual hit
by the internet,

833
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
should they choose to continue
expanding their business

834
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,290
or just give up?

835
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,570
I need to think about this.

836
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,210
Let's

837
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,690
move this conversation elsewhere.

838
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,710
Wen Ya,

839
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,570
why are you here?

840
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,460
I came to visit your dad

841
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,380
and you.

842
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,170
How's your dad doing?

843
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,200
He's recovering quite well.

844
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,460
We will return home soon.

845
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,610
Resting is the only way

846
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,130
for lumbar injuries.

847
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,650
You must be very tired

848
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,420
to work while looking after him.

849
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,900
Well,

850
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,020
that's no big deal.

851
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,060
The thing is, the elderly seem

852
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:53,980
to behave like a child
when they get sick.

853
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,500
It's more tiring to please him
than looking after him.

854
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,210
That's cute.

855
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,940
Please take a seat.

856
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,340
No need.

857
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,540
I came here

858
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,090
to discuss something with you.

859
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,900
All right. Let's talk outside.

860
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,610
Come.

861
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,090
You can refresh your mind

862
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,020
in a new place.

863
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:22,060
Do you like shopping in the supermarket?

864
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,730
I do.

865
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,610
I love shopping in the supermarket.

866
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,820
This place is comfortable

867
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,980
and helps me unwind.

868
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,820
Is there anything you want to buy?
Go on.

869
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,820
- But...
- It's on me.

870
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,610
Easy. See it as your task.

871
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,570
But I have a condition.

872
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,210
Whenever you pick something,

873
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,500
you have to tell me a story about it.

874
00:38:42,914 --> 00:38:44,570
I'm going to hold you to that, Mr. Xue.

875
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,500
Of course.

876
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,340
I'm really good at this.

877
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,010
Oh, they sell this candy here.

878
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,900
You know what?

879
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,260
I was amazed

880
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,650
when I first ate it.

881
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,540
I was in primary school then,

882
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,090
and I remember

883
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,130
one day after school,

884
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,940
I was extremely drowsy.

885
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,380
My boyfriend,

886
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,650
who was also my neighbor and classmate,

887
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,020
gave me this candy.

888
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,530
I felt refreshed instantly
and became sober.

889
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,170
I got full marks
on the test the next day.

890
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,250
It was amazing.

891
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:16,820
As if it were an elixir.

892
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,610
More or less.
It has the effect of an elixir.

893
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,500
It's magical.

894
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,040
There is a sample.
Do you want to try?

895
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,460
No, I need to sleep tonight.

896
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,860
You can buy it.

897
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,940
Do you have other stories?

898
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,610
Mr. Xue, should we get a trolley?

899
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,770
Sure.

900
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,730
Do you like fruits?

901
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,860
Yeah. I love fruits.

902
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:46,285
When I pick strawberries,
I always go for the red ones.

903
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,690
Bright red.

904
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,250
The fruit you like is cute.

905
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,610
Do you know strawberries are deceptive?

906
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,170
Its sugar content is less than
half of blueberries'.

907
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,820
Really?

908
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,420
In nature,

909
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,340
any flavor needs

910
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,250
to blend with another flavor

911
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,170
to reach a balance.

912
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,050
For example, sweetness and sourness

913
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,060
are a balance.

914
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,860
Before

915
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,460
they ripen, they taste sour

916
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,860
and a bit bitter.

917
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,250
It's to prevent other animals
from eating them.

918
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,210
However, when they are ready

919
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,420
for reproduction,

920
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,820
they become bright red

921
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,540
and sweet.

922
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,380
To attract others to eat them.

923
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,210
Correct.

924
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,940
Other animals will

925
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,090
process them through
the stomach, the guts,

926
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,770
and the works.

927
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,380
They spread everywhere.

928
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,500
Thus, the kingdom of strawberry expand.

929
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,690
So...

930
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,500
What?

931
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,460
So, strawberries are cunning.

932
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,090
If you have to pick a fruit

933
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,130
to represent yourself,

934
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,650
it should be strawberries, right?

935
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,900
What I mean to say is

936
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,420
that everything needs a balance

937
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,820
to sustain longer.

938
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,940
This is one of the reasons

939
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:09,250
I don't think positively about

940
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,540
the overgrowth of e-commerce.

941
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,420
Goodness.

942
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,860
You can relate a strawberry to this.

943
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,170
What's the other reason?

944
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,540
Look over there.

945
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Do you see that mom in white?

946
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,460
Mom, is this tasty?

947
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,770
You can try it.

948
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,770

More than 800 yuan.

I'm so sorry about that day.

969
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,650
I was rude.

970
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,170
No, it was a normal talk.

971
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,210
I thought about it carefully

972
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,820
and I went to the site.

973
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,210
You were right.

974
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,130
I blindly follow the trend

975
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,090
and have ignored the functionality
and practicality of the space.

976
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,860
I was ahead of myself.

977
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,570
It shows that you are confident
about your career.

978
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,610
It's good.

979
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,610
So,

980
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,060
do I have the honor

981
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,090
of having you design my flower shop?

982
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,540
I will respect your opinion.

983
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,980
Sure.

984
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,130
I can't be hearing this.

985
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,940
That's great.

986
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,690
I thought you would reject me.

987
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,900
I didn't take offense to that.

988
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,860
It's normal to exchange ideas.

989
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:11,380
Last time, we talked about

990
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,820
the space and structure.

991
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,060
This is too small.

992
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,650
Come here.

993
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,250
Why are you drawing on this?

994
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,540
I will wipe it later.

995
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,690
If we move this downwards,

996
00:44:40,828 --> 00:44:42,170
the available space of this space

997
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,570
will increase by 30 percent.

998
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,020
The display area won't be affected.

999
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,650
If you want an area

1000
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,640
of the display cabinet,

1001
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,900
we can use the light strip.

1002
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,940
Why did you choose

1003
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,290
to come to Shanghai alone?

1004
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,690
I didn't come here alone

1005
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,900
in the first place.

1006
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,685
My boyfriend was supposed
to come with me.

1007
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,420
But something came up in his family,

1008
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,460
so he couldn't make it.

1009
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,420
How do you feel

1010
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,610
after these few months?

1011
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,770
Well,

1012
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,250
there are good and bad.

1013
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,170
Didn't I tell you this a few days ago?

1014
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,570
Career women need
a simple love relationship

1015
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,940
and a complicated job.

1016
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,060
In fact, it's quite challenging

1017
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,250
when it's put into practice.

1018
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,420
You still feel insecure

1019
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,860
even with a personal space,

1020
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,130
right?

1021
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,730
I will try to overcome it.

1022
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:50,860
If you love him,

1023
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,980
you should give him
the freedom to choose.

1024
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,570
Right.

1025
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,530
Yu Jian,

1026
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,685
I will have to trouble you
to work on the proposal.

1027
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,820
Are you free tonight?

1028
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,690
Let me buy you a meal.

1029
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,420
No thanks.

1030
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:09,057
I will give you the design proposal
as soon as possible.

1031
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,380
I have to video call Guo tonight.

1032
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,380
Yu Jian, to be honest,

1033
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,020
having a long-distance
relationship is amazing.

1034
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,730
You two are far apart and need

1035
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,120
to maintain your relationship
with phone calls and video calls.

1036
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,130
If I were you,

1037
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,500
I wouldn't let her go.

1038
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,460
I know a long-distance
relationship isn't easy.

1039
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,340
But if a relationship can't withstand
the test of time and distance,

1040
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:33,740
it means the relationship

1041
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,130
isn't stable enough.

1042
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,170
Besides,

1043
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,500
if you love her,

1044
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:39,570
you should give her the freedom
to choose.

1045
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,420
Speaking of freedom,

1046
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,860
I believe

1047
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,170
if you had had a choice,

1048
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:47,420
you wouldn't have let her leave
for Shanghai, right?

1049
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,570
You would want her to
stay in Leshan with you.

1050
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,020
If I were her,

1051
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,650
I wouldn't leave.

1052
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,130
I only want to be with the man I love.

1053
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,060
Yu Jian and I

1054
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,940
are childhood friends.

1055
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,570
I can't guarantee

1056
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,420
that I know what he thinks every moment.

1057
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,530
But I'm sure

1058
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,690
he won't lie to me,

1059
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,340
and he can't.

1060
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,400
What are you thinking about?

1061
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,610
Is the junction of Jiangsu Road

1062
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,810
and Yuyuan Road right ahead?

1063
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,060
Right. Almost there.

1064
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,210
So?

1065
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,570
I was taking a stroll the other day

1066
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,742
and I ended up at Yuyuan Road.

1067
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,090
It is a beautiful place.

1068
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,570
It has the Old Shanghai vibes.

1069
00:48:01,885 --> 00:48:03,380
Are we going to pass by there later?

1070
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,820
No, we take the flyover.

1071
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:06,170
The traffic there is terrible.

1072
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,460
Should I stop here?

1073
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,860
Yes, stop here.

1074
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,860
The alley is narrow.

1075
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,420
You can't make a U-turn inside.

1076
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,860
All right, then.

1077
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,130
Contact me if there is anything.

1078
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,420
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Xue.

1079
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,940
I'm off.

1080
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,130
Do you need me to carry this?

1081
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:46,860
No.

1082
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,090
I have great strength.

1083
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,500
