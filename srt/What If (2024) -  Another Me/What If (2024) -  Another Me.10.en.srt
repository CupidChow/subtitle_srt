(Reference value:

(The result shows)

7
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,610
(your progesterone
has increased manifold.)

8
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,840
(It's confirmed that you are pregnant.)

9
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,800
(Xia Guo: Let's have dinner
at your parents'.)

10
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,960
(I have good news for you all.)

11
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,800
(Yu Jian: Mom won't be home afternoon.)

12
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,240
(She can't prepare dinner.)

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,050
(Xia Guo: It's okay.
I will buy braised dishes.)

14
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,920
Jian.

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,130
Jian.

16
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,410
Come here.

17
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,730
How is it?

18
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,360
Did you get any information?

19
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,480
The company has been emptied.

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,640
Nowhere to be found.

21
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,850
By the time I reached,

22
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,640
there was a crowd demanding money.

23
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,050
The police came

24
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
and shut down the place.

25
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
Where is your mom?

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
She went to meet her friends.

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,360
She said

28
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,130
she gathered money from them to invest.

29
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,890
Can the police

30
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,290
claim back the money for us?

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,330
I doubt it.

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,800
Dad.

33
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,330
- Slowly.
- Your mom is so bold!

34
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,890
How could she get involved
in that thing?

35
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,480
I was also foolish. I trusted her

36
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,570
when she said it was a fund.

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,960
Dad,

38
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,520
just say this between us.

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,200
Don't say that

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,360
when Mom comes back.

41
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,760
She must've been

42
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,410
struggled since this happened.

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,800
Jian,

44
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,760
it's fine

45
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
we lost our own money.

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,960
But what about others' money?

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,290
Do you know

48
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,640
how much they invested?

49
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,640
Mom said it wasn't much.

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,890
But I have the feeling

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,610
that she didn't tell me the truth.

52
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,640
Just what happened to our family
these days?

53
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,290
We have been plagued by bad luck.

54
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,730
Jian,

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,680
don't tell Guo about it first.

56
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,050
I don't want to worry her.

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,920
Finally, you came back to your senses.

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
That's great.

59
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,920
The workload here

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
will keep you busy until the next life.

61
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,320
From today on,

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
you will focus on designing.

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,050
We are the great duo.

64
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Don't put me on a pedestal.

65
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,440
Before that, I have to tell you this.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,320
I won't resign from my job,

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,320
and I won't take a salary from you.

68
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,650
I'll do the projects

69
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,050
and get wages.

70
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,770
All right.

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,410
As long as you come and help me.

72
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,170
You can do it in your ways.

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,730
But

74
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,850
can you handle

75
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,120
to work at two places?

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,290
No problem.

77
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,530
Tell me if you need money.

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,880
I'll definitely help you.

79
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,320
It's fine, thanks.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,680
I don't care.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,290
You must work hard to earn for me.

82
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,240
Who is the expert

83
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,650
that works hard
to make money for you?

84
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,800
Wen Ya, perfect timing.

85
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,410
You can meet Yu Jian,

86
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,920
who you have been meaning to see.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,850
He agreed to work in my humble studio.

88
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,290
The level of this studio

89
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,290
has been raised, right?

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,480
Look how happy you are.

91
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,560
Here's your gift.

92
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,410
A gift?

93
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,090
Yu Jian, it has been a while.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,770
Yeah, Wen Ya.

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Wen Ya,
are you going to say it yourself,

96
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,480
or do you need my help?

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,530
Yu Jian isn't an outsider here.

98
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,850
I will tell you right away.

99
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,610
I want to open a flower shop.

100
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,410
Not the ordinary one.

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,880
It's a cultural and creative

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,170
gift store with fresh flowers.

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,480
Yiming said

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,440
you were coming today.

105
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,050
So, I rushed here.

106
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,290
I have brought the blueprint.

107
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,610
Could you design it

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,440
for me?

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,730
Just so you know,

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,770
Yu Jian

111
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,530
has strong opinions

112
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,560
and not anyone

113
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,880
can make him change his mind.

114
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,050
I think

115
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
you can discuss it first

116
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,120
before reaching the collaboration.

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
No need.

118
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm in.

119
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,170
That's a fast answer.

120
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,850
Wen Ya, did you cast a spell

121
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,290
on Yu Jian?

122
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,410
That would be amazing.

123
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,730
You know what?

124
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
When you decided not to go to Shanghai,

125
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,290
she wanted me to keep an eye on you.

126
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,800
She asked me to replace Gao,
but I didn't agree.

127
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,410
It's good now. She got her wish.

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,850
Yiming said

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,170
you are an all-rounder.

130
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,650
You are good at every field.

131
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,320
You are picky.

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,050
I can't guarantee if Yu Jian

133
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:53,800
can fulfill

134
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,050
all your requests.

135
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,850
It's like you are choosing
a boyfriend for me.

136
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,530
Of course, the guy must be perfect
in every way.

137
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,240
Don't get any ideas about him.

138
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,240
He's going to get married.

139
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,920
I know.

140
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,290
They are the most clingy couple
in Leshan.

141
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,850
I just have
a high standard of aesthetics.

142
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,730
I'm sure

143
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,970
Yu Jian can manage that.

144
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,920
You are twisting my words around.

145
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,780
Says who!

146
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,610
All right.

147
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,530
Stop.

148
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,050
Wen Ya, let's get back to business.

149
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,320
If you have any requests, ask away.

150
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,650
There is no rush.

151
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,290
Let's have dinner together.

152
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,650
Invite your wife too.

153
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,320
I came up with some ideas.

154
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,360
We can talk about it then.

155
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm so sorry.

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,730
I promise my parents

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
to go back for dinner.

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,850
Let's find another time then.

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,090
That works too.

160
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,320
Let's meet next time.

161
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,560
You are running around these days.

162
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,770
Finally, we caught you.

163
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,290
The investor fled, but I didn't.

164
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,120
This is my home.

165
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,740
- When did I run away?
- We won't listen to that.

166
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,020
Stop your lies.

167
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,050
How can you say that?

168
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,240
You forget what you agreed...?

169
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,120
What did we do?

170
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,220
We believe you.

171
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,040
We believe you.
And this is what we got...

172
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,850
No need to say more.

173
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,200
Listen, pay up what you owe us.

174
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,730
Are you still my friends?

175
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,440
Likes who cares. You better stop lying.

176
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,120
We don't believe you, you know?

177
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,680
We promised to make money together...

178
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,170
Xia Guo. Xia Guo is here.

179
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,620
What has happened, Madam Xu, Madam Li?

180
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,920
Xia Guo, it's good you are here.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,480
Listen.

182
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
Your mother-in-law borrowed our money

183
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,360
for investment.

184
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,860
That's right. She borrowed our money

185
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,700
and didn't pay back.

186
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,920
Should we demand the money from her?

187
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,560
Why should I pay you the money?

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,320
- What's going on?
- Don't listen to them.

189
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,730
How much did she borrow?

190
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,680
It was 120,000.

191
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,610
Xia Guo,

192
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,530
this money means nothing to you.

193
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,240
You are rich.

194
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,010
- Help her pay up.
- That's right.

195
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,020
- Why must she do that?
- Help her pay.

196
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,720
Unreasonable.

197
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,050
No friendship at all...

198
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,560
Pay up!

199
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,480
Pay up!

200
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,050
- Trying to run away?
- Pay up!

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,560
You can't run away.

202
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,480
Guo.

203
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,410
Guo, does it hurt?

204
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
Let me see. Are you all right?

205
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm good.

206
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,800
What are you doing?

207
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,890
How can you hit her?

208
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,800
I didn't.

209
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,180
Did you see me hitting her?

210
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,050
- That's right.
- Listen.

211
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,250
- Stop talking.
- That's right.

212
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,080
- Anyway, you owe us money.
- Pay back.

213
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,890
You signed the contract yourself.

214
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,680
I also wasted more than 300,000.

215
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,760
How could you demand money from me?

216
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,770
Enough, stop already!

217
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,770
Madam Li, Madam Xu.

218
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,840
You have been friends
with Mrs. Yu for years.

219
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,680
You know

220
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,490
what of a person she is, right?

221
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,960
It was a good intention

222
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,320
when she invited you to invest,

223
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,890
thinking you could make money together.

224
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,770
Besides, I believe

225
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,920
she has analyzed

226
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,440
both the benefits and risks to you

227
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,250
before the investment, right?

228
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,530
It's risky for sure.

229
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,980
You can share the money if you get.

230
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,660
If you lose money,

231
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,130
you should bear the risk together.

232
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,370
She is also a victim.

233
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
No one wants to lose their money.

234
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,650
If you keep like this,

235
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,010
we'll call the police.

236
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,560
If you say so,

237
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,900
fine, go and call the police.

238
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,220
The police'll arrest who?

239
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,320
You guys, of course.

240
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,200
You think I dared not?

241
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm calling the police now.

242
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,040
Let's see who will get arrested.

243
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
Do you own the police station?

244
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
- Calm down.
- Just pay up.

245
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,130
Enough.

246
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,800
We will pay the money

247
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,040
we owe you.

248
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,560
But you have to give us time

249
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,530
to gather money, right?

250
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
Nonsense, Guo.

251
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,170
At least pay us half.

252
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,250
- Right. Half.
- No more haggling.

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
I have no money.

254
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
You keep saying that.

255
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,000
That's right.

256
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,050
You can't have it your way.

257
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:08,720
Madam Li.

258
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,860
Come. Let's talk.

259
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,530
What?

260
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,680
Come here.

261
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,490
Guo.

262
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,600
What are you going to tell her?

263
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,890
All right?

264
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,890
Fine.

265
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,370
That's it for this.

266
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Hurry and gather the money

267
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,600
to pay us back, okay?

268
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
- Okay.
- Wait. What was it?

269
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,650
Tell you later.

270
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,170
That's it for today.

271
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
Everyone, leave.

272
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,370
Just leave.

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,770
- Let's leave.
- Why are we leaving?

274
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,560
Did she talk to you

275
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,800
and fool you?

276
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Let's go.

277
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,530
It's all right, Mrs. Yu.

278
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,080
- It's all right. Let's go home.
- What did you tell them?

279
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,840
Let's go home.

280
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,680
It's nothing here. Please leave.

281
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
- Please leave.
- Come on.

282
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,530
Guo,

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,490
what's wrong?

284
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
- Are you all right?
- Are you good?

285
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,440
Should we go to the hospital?

286
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,290
I'm good.

287
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,320
Really?

288
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,290
Yes.

289
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,650
Thanks to Guo earlier.

290
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,600
The two crazy women

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,050
were going to bite me.

292
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,130
Guo, what did you say to Li Cuifen?

293
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,650
Why she didn't say anything

294
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,600
after that?

295
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,050
Her daughter-in-law just
gave birth to a second child.

296
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,290
The couple barely makes ends meet.

297
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,800
A while ago, her daughter-in-law
wanted to buy a car.

298
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,890
But Madam Li said
she didn't have the money.

299
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,680
They had a fierce argument late night.

300
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,840
The entire block could hear.

301
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,200
Just now, I reminded her that if she

302
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,960
wanted to keep the money

303
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,410
from her daughter-in-law,

304
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,250
she should quit seeking us trouble.

305
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,200
Guo, you are smart.

306
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,200
It was my fault.

307
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,890
I lost my mind

308
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,650
and owed so much money.

309
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,010
I brought trouble to you.

310
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,530
Mom.

311
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,770
I don't want to be mean,

312
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,890
but how could you borrow that much?

313
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
How did you get the nerve?

314
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,250
Jian,

315
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
let's do

316
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,890
by my way.

317
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,010
Guo and you stay out of this.

318
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,490
Your mom and I

319
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,770
can handle this

320
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,130
by ourselves.

321
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,650
How?

322
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,200
Dad, we have spent a lot

323
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,490
on your surgery, hospitalization,

324
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,560
and recovery.

325
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,920
We don't have money now.

326
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,490
But you just rented a house
and want to buy a car.

327
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,370
You don't have much left too.

328
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,600
Leave it to me.

329
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,960
I'm doing part-time at Yiming's studio.

330
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,080
I got the first project today.

331
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,890
I've advanced part of the design fee.

332
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,010
I will use that to pay back.

333
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,530
We

334
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,410
mustn't owe anyone a dime.

335
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,490
Okay.

336
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,600
(Shuangli Trading Co., Ltd.)
Hi, I would like to meet Ms. Liu.

337
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,560
I had an appointment.

338
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,170
She is in the second room on the left.

339
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,840
All right. Thank you.

340
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
(Leshan No.3 People's Hospital,
Name: Xia Guo)

341
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,440
Miss Xia,

342
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,010
you got good results in the assessments.

343
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,170
But...

344
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,490
Yes?

345
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,130
Why are you pregnant?

346
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,800
Didn't you know about this before?

347
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
Yes, I just found out.

348
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,200
If I may,

349
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,170
do you and your husband plan to keep it?

350
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,600
Why?

351
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,720
Will it affect my job

352
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,290
if I do?

353
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,960
No,

354
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,250
but I have to warn you

355
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,080
that there's a three-month probation

356
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,770
without any day to take off.

357
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,600
Besides, you have entrance exams.

358
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,050
Are you sure you can handle them?

359
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,840
Besides,

360
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,650
our company

361
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,960
has never recruited pregnant women.

362
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,440
Your qualifications

363
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,890
aren't outstanding either.

364
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,200
I can't be sure

365
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,840
how my superior will decide.

366
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,770
Fortunately, you were there
with Dad and Mom.

367
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,050
Try the egg with rice wine.

368
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,490
Your reward.

369
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,080
Let's drop the lease.

370
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,290
Drop the lease?

371
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,920
Why?

372
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,410
We are in debt.

373
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,410
I have money.

374
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,840
I have a part-time job.

375
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,650
Don't worry about Mom's debt.

376
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,370
How could I not worry?

377
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,650
We will become a family soon.

378
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,320
It's just a debt.

379
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,650
I will pay it off.

380
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,410
The rent doesn't cost much.

381
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,320
I don't want it to affect your life.

382
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,960
I can't cut

383
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,010
the expenses on you.

384
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,290
What happened?

385
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,080
Is there anything else?

386
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm pregnant.

387
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,290
Seriously?

388
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,290
It was tested in the medical checkup.

389
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm a dad now?

390
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
We have a child?

391
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,050
You...

392
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,410
You didn't eat much just now .

393
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,440
Don't eat this.

394
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,250
Containing alcohol.

395
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,800
I will fix something good for you.

396
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,650
What's wrong?

397
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,130
I don't want to keep this child.

398
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,250
I know

399
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,600
you're saying this

400
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,530
because you worry

401
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,680
about Mom's debt.

402
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,050
Don't be.

403
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,130
I won't let a child

404
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,050
starve.

405
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,720
I won't let you and the child starve.

406
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,170
Don't be worried, okay?

407
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,680
How could I not be?

408
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,080
Do you think having a child

409
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,320
is as simple

410
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
as paying off debt?

411
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,770
This isn't enough at all.

412
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,680
We must have a stable income

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
and salary.

414
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,170
I just got pregnant.

415
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,770
I don't know

416
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,080
if the new company will hire me.

417
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,100
- Guo.
- What if...

418
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,410
You are already pregnant.

419
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,410
You don't have to work.

420
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,800
I can support all of you.

421
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,800
How are you going
to support the entire family?

422
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,890
Uh...

423
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,680
I will do as you say.

424
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,800
I...

425
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,130
I will drop the lease

426
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,490
to raise our child.

427
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
This should be enough.

428
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,680
So, it's like robbing Peter

429
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,410
to pay Paul, right?

430
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,010
You drop the lease

431
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,160
for the child.

432
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,290
Then, you will start to skimp

433
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,730
on the clothes, food,

434
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,970
and traveling expenses.

435
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,450
I don't want

436
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,320
a thrifty life.

437
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,560
I don't want my child

438
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,490
to be born
in a compromised situation, okay?

439
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,490
I told you I would earn money.

440
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Why can't you believe me?

441
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,930
Is it really that easy?

442
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,880
What if something happens halfway?

443
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,080
We have been facing

444
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,530
many accidents in the past half year.

445
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,160
Accident.

446
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,120
Keep thinking this,

447
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,450
there is nothing else you can do.

448
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,290
Isn't that

449
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,770
what you want?

450
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,800
Fine, I quit my job.

451
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,400
Over time, I will become

452
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,530
a housewife
on a different wavelength with you.

453
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,600
I will get stuck in mundane matters,
lose myself,

454
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,320
and ask you for money.

455
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,290
Is this a life I want?

456
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,640
Is this the me you want?

457
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,490
What nonsense are you talking about?

458
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,640
What I'm trying to say

459
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,730
is I have already lost

460
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,970
a chance to go to Shanghai.

461
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,490
I don't want to lose it a second time.

462
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,880
Do you understand?

463
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,010
Come on.

464
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

465
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,450
What's wrong?

466
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,210
The construction of the florist

467
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,290
is going to begin tomorrow.

468
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,770
Why pull the long face?

469
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,360
Just need

470
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,640
to raise a child, right?

471
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,560
Just work harder to make money

472
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
starting today,

473
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,080
right?

474
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,360
Yeah.

475
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,880
Yu Jian,

476
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,450
having a child is a joyful thing.

477
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,450
If you need it,

478
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,880
I can make

479
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,360
an advance payment for the project.

480
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,580
Right, Yu Jian.

481
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,700
We can do that too.

482
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,780
- How much money do you need?
- I can transfer you the money

483
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,840
I prepare for a camera.

484
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
We can help you.

485
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,120
Yu Jian, tell us how much...

486
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,840
You don't have to...

487
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,530
- It's okay.
- You don't have to do that.

488
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,730
I appreciate

489
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,690
your kindness.

490
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,160
Wen Ya,

491
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,160
you already paid

492
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,320
the deposit to the company.

493
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,120
You don't have to pay me.

494
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,800
Actually,

495
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,930
it's not about money.

496
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,930
Guo...

497
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,320
She...

498
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,450
She doesn't want to keep the baby.

499
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,250
Why?

500
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,160
She wants to go to work.

501
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,290
She gave up the opportunity

502
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,640
to go to Shanghai for me.

503
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,560
Yet, I couldn't even

504
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,640
give her a wedding

505
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,970
or the dowry.

506
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,360
How can I

507
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,360
decide

508
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,880
what she has to choose?

509
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,320
If you ask me,

510
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,080
it's about money.

511
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,600
If you can provide her with a good life,

512
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,530
she won't need a job now.

513
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,080
Look,

514
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,320
anyhow,

515
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,450
Wen Ya wanted you

516
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,880
to work on her project.

517
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Once you get the money,

518
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,450
Guo will agree to keep the child.

519
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,050
It's as simple as this.

520
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,690
Listen,

521
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,640
don't let family matters

522
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,880
affect your work.

523
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,490
Understood?

524
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,080
Wen Ya,

525
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,880
don't worry.

526
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,530
I will handle

527
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
my family matters well.

528
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,320
It won't affect your project.

529
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,640
Of course, I know you will.

530
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,450
Yu Jian,

531
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,490
to me,

532
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,970
you are not an ordinary designer.

533
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,120
Your value

534
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,730
can't be gauged by money.

535
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,490
Building a family

536
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,120
needs courage.

537
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,880
You're braver
and more responsible.

538
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,560
You have my respect.

539
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,930
What does that mean?

540
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,320
Don't you respect me?

541
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,770
Well, I respect all of you.

542
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,010
I respect you.

543
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,360
I always respect you.

544
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,050
Me too.

545
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,160
Come on.

546
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,210
Here's to our project going smoothly.

547
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,120
Anyone in trouble and need a listener,

548
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,210
come to me at any time.

549
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,450
May our project go smoothly.

550
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,530
Cheers!

551
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
You drank so much.

552
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,840
Does Guo know about this?

553
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,290
I will get you some congee.

554
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,210
(Yu Jian: Are you there?)

555
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
(Xia Guo: In the hospital now.)

556
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,800
(Yu Jian: Do you have to do that today?)

557
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,320
(Xia Guo: Yes.)

558
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,490
(Yu Jian: I will come.)

559
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,560
(Xia Guo: No need.)

560
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,600
What are you up to?

561
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,640
Huh?

562
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,600
Why did Guo go to the hospital?

563
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,320
Mom, how could you peek at my phone?

564
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,530
You want to abort the child?

565
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,690
No wonder I noticed

566
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,770
Guo throwing up yesterday.

567
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,120
She's pregnant?

568
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:32,930
You tell me,

569
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,770
this is serious.

570
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,120
How could you not discuss with me?

571
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,250
You are so foolish.

572
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,800
Why do you want to abort the child?

573
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,530
Guo.

574
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,120
Guo, please listen to me.

575
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,840
You are sensible.

576
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,050
Don't abort the child.

577
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,690
Just wait up.

578
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,450
You brat.

579
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,050
I'm so furious.

580
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,600
Mom.

581
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,840
Mom, sit down.

582
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,210
Mom, calm down.

583
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,690
With the issues in our family,

584
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,290
it's not appropriate
to have a child now.

585
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,800
Nonsense.

586
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,560
When we had you

587
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,640
and Yan,

588
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,050
things were tougher than now.

589
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,250
But the situation

590
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,690
is different now.

591
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,490
I didn't marry Guo

592
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,160
for her

593
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,530
to bear my child.

594
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,690
The situation now

595
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,970
is she doesn't want a child.

596
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,120
She wants to work.

597
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,930
I can't influence her future, can I?

598
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,770
Just use your brain

599
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
and think carefully.

600
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,080
Had Guo not wanted the child,

601
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,290
she could have done that.

602
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,560
Why must she discuss it with you?

603
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,460
She discussed it with you

604
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,210
because she still had hope.

605
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,640
Since the child has come to us,

606
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,800
that means we are fated.

607
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,800
How could you

608
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,400
abandon the child?

609
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,320
Still sitting?

610
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,010
Go and get her back.

611
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,120
Now!

612
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,360
If you can't get Guo

613
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,770
and the child back,

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,690
don't come back.

615
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,690
Sir, please drive faster.

616
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:45,300
(Leshan Maternity and Infant Hospital)

617
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,880
Sorry, Guo.

618
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,800
I'm late.

619
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,530
Dear.

620
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,840
I will give you a wedding

621
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,050
and give your mom the dowry.

622
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,840
We can have another child later.

623
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
I won't put you

624
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,970
through this ever again.

625
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,080
Does it hurt very much?

626
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,160
Come. I will carry you home.

627
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,640
You are smooshing the child.

628
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Put me down.

629
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,490
The baby is with me.

630
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,160
What?

631
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,160
You kept the child?

632
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,600
I couldn't bear to abort it.

633
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,210
That's wonderful.

634
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,250
You kept the child.

635
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,930
I'm a father now.

636
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm a father now.

637
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,560
Promise me,

638
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,970
Drop the lease

639
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,010
and save all the money

640
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,290
for our child,

641
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,840
all right?

642
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,290
Yes, I will do what you say from now on.

643
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,770
Everything you say.

644
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,010
(The life inside me)

645
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,010
(is my weak spot)

646
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,120
(and also my armor.)

647
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,880
(It makes me more resolute)

648
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,970
(about my decision to stay.)

649
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,800
(Striving for the common goal)

650
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,600
(and none of us give up.)

651
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,800
(Perhaps)

652
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,250
(this is what family means.)

653
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,290
Slowly.

654
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,800
Slowly.

655
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,970
Please have a look. This is all.

656
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Please sign it.

657
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,640
Okay. Here?

658
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,970
Yes.

659
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

660
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,930
Contact us next time.

661
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
When I first rented this apartment,

662
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,530
I thought about

663
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,530
showing you the most beautiful sunset.

664
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
Unexpectedly,

665
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,690
we are moving out so soon.

666
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,450
It's not sunny every day.

667
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,730
Most of the time,

668
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,730
we don't have time to see the sunset.

669
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,970
So, don't hold on to that.

670
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,400
You don't have to console me.

671
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,080
Making you happy

672
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,730
is something I hold on to.

673
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,730
You gave up the chance

674
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,160
to Shanghai and look after Dad

675
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,300
because of me.

676
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,250
Well, let's get this over.

677
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,010
This is my choice.

678
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,320
I don't need you to sacrifice
or repay me anything.

679
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,400
That's not what I mean.

680
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,290
When I was in the operating room
that day,

681
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,560
I was really scared.

682
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,690
I felt upset,

683
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,930
even regretted it.

684
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,970
I hated you for not coming to stop me.

685
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,210
But when I saw you

686
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,730
in the hallway,

687
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,970
I felt reassured.

688
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,930
I knew you were by my side.

689
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,970
I could trust and rely on you.

690
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,600
Yu Jian,

691
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,970
with you around,

692
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,640
we can overcome all the difficulties.

693
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,690
(Marriage Certificate)

694
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,560
Guo,

695
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,730
today is the day
we register for marriage.

696
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
I swear

697
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,080
on the marriage certificate

698
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,400
that I will

699
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,450
give you a bigger

700
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,050
and finer house in the future.

701
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,010
I will give you

702
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,210
the grandest wedding.

703
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,050
If I can't do that,

704
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,210
I will...

705
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,970
What?

706
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,600
Bet your life?

707
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,880
(Tang Yiming: 30,000 yuan to you)
Take it. I wish you double happiness.

708
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:40,970
After child is born,

709
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,450
I'll be the godfather.

710
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,320
Tang, you sent me money?

711
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,250
Not only me,

712
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
a few from our alumni group

713
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,290
chipped in

714
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,080
after knowing this.

715
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,210
Take it.

716
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,320
I can't.

717
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,630
Don't overthink. It's not for you,

718
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,730
it's for your child.

719
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,530
Keep it for your child.

720
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,970
No, it isn't appropriate.

721
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,770
Cut that out.
We are friends, aren't we?

722
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,010
Hurry up and settle the things

723
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,770
and come to work.

724
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,970
We have more projects now.

725
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,880
It's going to be busy.

726
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,050
By the way,
don't forget the wedding banquet.

727
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,970
All right.

728
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,210
Tang...

729
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,360
He's insane.

730
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
It's our luck to have friends like him.

731
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,730
(Wen)
Double happiness. Be happy.

732
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,560
(Guan)
Leader, this is for your child.

733
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,530
- Please keep it.
- Congratulations, Yu Jian.

734
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,360

We're waiting for the wedding banquet.

Yu Jian, I paid the design fee early.

737

Keep up the good work.

Hello?

Hello, Xia Guo.

741
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,450
This is Shuangli Trading.

742
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,120
I have discuss

743
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,360
with the superior.

744
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,210
We decided

745
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,690
to hire you as planned.

746
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,880
Really?

747
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,970
You work so hard when you are pregnant.

748
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,320
The superior expects your work.

749
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,400
Seize the opportunity.

750
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,400
Work harder.

751

Sure, I will.

Please come

753
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,560
to sign the contract next Monday.

754
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,250
We will

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,840
Yes, sure.

758
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,160
I will be there on time.

759
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,010
Thank you.

760
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,800
What's wrong?

761
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,970
I got the job.

762
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,010
Guo,

763
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,800
we will be very happy

764
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,400
and lead a good life.

765
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,620
♪Our life amidst the gale...♪

766
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,600
(Wedding Vow)
Look at this.

767
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,840
How did you take it?

768
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,210
Everyone reads the vow

769
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,010
when they register for marriage.

770
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,490
So I took it.

771
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,050
Let's make up for it.

772
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,080
I, Yu Jian.

773
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,600
I, Xia Guo.

774
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,120
We voluntarily become husband and wife.

775
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,560
Starting today.

776
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,800
Starting today.

777
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,010
Starting today,

778
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,930
we will shoulder

779
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,640
the responsibility and duty
of marriage together.

780
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,490
Look, let's respond to the national call

781
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,010
and have two children.

782
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,360
When we grow old,

783
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,560
we will have grandchildren.

784
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,250
(Isn't it wonderful)

785
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,050
(to have all of them)

786
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,360
(waiting on us?)

787
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,930
(Guo.)

788
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,620
(Marry Me)

789
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,970
(Let's get married.)

790
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,600
(I can't wait any longer.)

791
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,050
(From this day forward,
for better or for worse,)

792
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,400
(for richer or for poorer,)

793
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,770
(in sickness or in health,)

794
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,210
(young or old,)

795
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,530
(we will endure hardships)

796
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,880
(and share joy and sorrows.)

797
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,120
(We are lifelong partners
to each other.)

798
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,640
(We will uphold our vows made today.)

799
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,770
(We will firmly uphold our vows
made today.)

800
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,400
Thanks.

801
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,120
Mr. Wang.

802
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,200
Miss Xia,

803
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,720
I'm in your room.

804
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,200
It's raining hard today.

805
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,530
The windows were blown open,

806
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,890
and the room is flooded.

807
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,330
It's leaking to the floor below.

808
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,050
I have reached the entrance
of the alley.

809
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,410
I will be there soon.

810
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Mr. Wang.

811
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Xia, you are finally back.

812
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Mr. Wang, thank you so much

813
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,890
for helping me.

814
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,010
This place hasn't been repaired
for years.

815
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,080
Look, the window blew open,

816
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,050
and the walls cracked.

817
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,600
The property management promised
to repair all the houses,

818
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,760
but they did nothing.

819
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,560
The rain is heavy today.

820
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,010
You can't stay here.

821
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,530
Don't worry, Mr. Wang.

822
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,810
I will find a hotel

823
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,010
and manage one night.

824
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,890
One night isn't enough.

825
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,600
The weather broadcast says

826
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,530
this rain will continue
for at least two days.

827
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,370
Xia, sorry about this.

828
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,160
I don't want

829
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,010
to rent this place for now.

830
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,160
Sorry?

831
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,280
You paid the rent for six months,

832
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,330
and it has been five months.

833
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,080
I'll only take rents for three months.

834
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,760
Wait, Mr. Wang.

835
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,560
I have many things here.

836
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,930
Don't worry.

837
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,680
You can get them
once you find another place.

838
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,530
(Xue Yuming: Have you reached home yet?)

839
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,720
(Xia Guo: Yes.)

840
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,420
(Peak hours, waiting for a cab)

841
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,120
It's a downpour. Why still come here?

842
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,530
What's wrong with you?

843
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,120
It's not that.

844
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
The place I rent is leaking.

845
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,490
I can't stay there.

846
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,450
I wanted to find a hotel
but there's no cab.

847
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,240
So I came here for shelter.

848
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,640
The houses across are a bit run-down.

849
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,490
I rent a place in Shanghai too.

850
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,810
I'm quite close with the agents.

851
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,050
I could ask around for you.

852
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,370
Sure. If you feel it's convenient,

853
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,120
help me.

854
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:47,890
Thanks.

855
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,890
No problem.

856
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,120
Here you go.

857
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,530
Thanks.

858
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,010
Wrong taste?

859
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,410
The taste doesn't change,

860
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,330
maybe I have changed.

861
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,120
It's rude
that you stare at me like that.

862
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,970
I just want to observe
what has changed.

863
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,080
You look the same.

864
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Leaving my hometown

865
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,560
and tasting a strong kindness
from the drink

866
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,930
feels strange to me.

867
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,600
What are you on about?

868
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,720
You just

869
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,930
don't like it today, right?

870
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,530
Here's another for you.

871
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,160
This isn't the right way to do business.

872
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,680
I only make this exception for you.

New flavor?

879
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,240
Nice.

880
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,850
Does it have a name?

881
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,080
It hadn't have one

882
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,970
before you asked.

883
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,490
But now it does.

884
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,490
What's it?

885
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,010
Fruit of Midsummer,

886
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
or Summer Fruit.
[*Xia Guo]

887
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,050
A nice name, right?

888
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,890
If you want to bloom and bear fruits

889
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,120
ahead of others,
you have to blossom in midsummer.

890
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,890
Is it correct to force oneself

891
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,970
to mature quickly?

892
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,160
Hard to say whether it's good or bad.

893
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,240
Anyway,

894
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,600
you stay true to yourself.

895
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,890
Stay true to ourselves.

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,370
One cares about you

899
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,370
in this rainy night.

900
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,450
Count your blessings.

901
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,200
Where are you?

902
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,530
I'm at home.

903
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,410
Be honest.

904
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,200
My place is flooded,

905
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,080
so I take shelter at Crossroad.

906
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,850
Wait for me.

907
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,530
Let's go.

908
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,890
Where to?

909
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,680
Come home with me.

910
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,890
Hi.

911
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,120
Hi.

912
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,490
If you are hungry,

913
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,370
there is food in the fridge.

914
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,600
I cut some fruit.

915
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,760
There are wines in the wine cabinet.

916
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,450
Thank you.

917
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,490
Right. I saw it at your place,

918
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,930
so I bought one too.

919
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,890
If you don't like this scent, you can

920
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,010
change it.

921
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,760
I need to go inside

922
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,280
to attend an online meeting.

923
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,560
No worries, go ahead.

924
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,120
By the way,

925
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,050

Correct.

I want you to remember it.

932
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,490
Get rest early.
