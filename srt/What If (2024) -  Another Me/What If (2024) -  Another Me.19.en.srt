Over here, huh?

5
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,280
Are you walking?

6
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
Great job.

7
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,810
Are you looking for Dad?

8
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,890
What is Dad doing?

9
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,540
What is Dad doing?

10
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,779
Chen, come. Dad is working.

11
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,500
Let's play outside.

12
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,569
Just let him play wherever he wants to.

13
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,330
Mom, don't spoil him too much.

14
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,770
He can go wherever he likes.

15
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,700
Come, Chen, Let's have some noodles.

16
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,890
Let's have some noodles.

17
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,220
How can he eat while crying?
Let me carry him.

18
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,569
Chen, stop crying.

19
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,009
Alright now.

20
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,180
I know it's tough on you.

21
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,100
Mom was fierce to us, huh?

22
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,500
Mom was so fierce.

23
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,140
Was Mom too fierce?

24
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,219
Poor boy.

25
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,779
She doesn't want us to use the walker.

26
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,739
I'm working! Can you lower your volume?

27
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,810
Your son's crying. It's not me.

28
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,479
The more you coax him,
the more he'll cry.

29
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,379
He'll stop crying
if you stop coaxing him.

30
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,179
Everything would've been fine
had Guo not picked him up

31
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,299
from the walker.

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,929
Guo was worried that Chen
might affect my work.

33
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,969
Can't you tell?

34
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,020
Stop crying. Good boy. Alright now.

35
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,609
Stop crying, baby.

36
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,569
Let's forget about Dad.

37
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,060
Let's go and find Grandpa.

38
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,489
Let's go and find Grandpa.

39
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,500
Look at how he's crying. Poor baby.

40
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,569
Stop crying.

41
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,299
We can eat now.

42
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,250
Look. What's this?

43
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,850
You should talk to Mom nicely.

44
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,779
I have to submit this by 2 P.M.

45
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,060
And, she was blaming it on you.

46
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,859
I couldn't stand it.

47
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,140
Even so, you shouldn't
treat her like that.

48
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,320
I know. This is a tough period.

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,920
Since all of us are living
under the same roof,

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,250
it'll be frustrating sometimes.

51
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,899
But you have to control

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,379
your emotions too.

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,180
You shouldn't add fuel to the flame.
We can't live in peace if you do.

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,980
Alright, I got it.

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,220
You have something to do later, right?

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,410
I'll leave after feeding him the noodle.

57
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,290
Alright. Go now.

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,730
Don't make Mom angry again.

59
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,449
Remember to keep yourself protected.

60
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,540
Got it.

61
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,220
Great job.

62
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,700
Sorry for making you
come all the way here.

63
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,330
It's what I should do.

64
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,140
Ms. Ping said you were very capable.

65
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,450
She was right indeed.

66
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,339
Once the project is approved,

67
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,409
I'll transfer the money to you.

68
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm glad that you're happy with my work.

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,500
Ms. Du, my internship period is up.

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,140
When can we sign the official contract?

71
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,969
That's the reason I told you

72
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,580
to come today.

73
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,819
Initially, I was planning to discuss

74
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,140
the signing of your official employment.

75
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,929
However, for our trading companies,

76
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,220
the impact of the pandemic is huge.

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,850
we have no choice
but to delay the process for now.

78
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,850
I see.

79
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,969
It's fine. I understand.

80
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,699
If so,

81
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,929
please tell me if you need my help

82
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,220
for any projects in the future.

83
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,020
Okay. Thank you for your understanding.

84
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,299
I heard from Ms. Ping that
your child just reached one year old.

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,299
Yes, but his weaning period
is already over.

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,020
And, my mother-in-law
is looking after him.

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,700
So, it won't affect my work.
Please don't worry.

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,489
Your child is so young.

89
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,930
I'm sure it's tough on you.

90
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,609
Last year,

91
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,730
we recruited a first-time mother too.

92
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,450
At first, she said
the same thing as you.

93
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,899
But once she joined the company,

94
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,060
she had plenty
of family affairs to attend to.

95
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,700
In the end, she still became
a drag to the company.

96
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,220
However, sudden occurrences do happen

97
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,410
when you're raising a child.

98
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,450
I'm not picking on you here.

99
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,250
Please don't take it to heart.

100
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,440
(WY.FLORIST
Flowers &amp; Plants &amp; Community)

101
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,810
(These are preserved flowers.)

102
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,180
You can't find them in typical florists.

103
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,060
(This florist is new.)

104
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,810
(Your husband was the one
who designed it.)

105
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,290
The gathering tonight was merely
for the opening of the florist.

106
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,770
Do you suspect that Yu Jian
is having an affair?

107
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,009
When Yu Jian was helping Wen Ya

108
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,330
to design the florist, he said

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,339
that he would stop contacting Wen Ya

110
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,180
once the project was over.

111
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,009
So?

112
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,980
But they started contacting each other
since one year ago.

113
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,100
Don't you understand?

114
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,659
No one knows

115
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,299
how many meals they have had together

116
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,770
in the past year.

117
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,810
Are you overthinking it?

118
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,219
Even if they do see each other often,

119
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,410
that doesn't mean that
there's something between them.

120
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,859
Ms. Ping, you don't understand.

121
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,259
Yu Jian has been acting strange lately.

122
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,290
Do you know something?

123
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,299
His shopping cart

124
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,290
is filled with female products.

125
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,540
Like clothes and balloons.

126
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,529
And, when he was pouring water for me,

127
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,250
he was holding his phone.

128
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,290
That was so suspicious.
He doesn't do that usually.

129
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,960
Since you're looking at him
from a doubtful POV,

130
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,529
everything he does is a mistake to you.

131
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,140
Everything he does is strange to you.

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,219
Are you doubting him because you have
too much free time on your hands,

133
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,040
now that your mother-in-law
is looking after your son?

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,929
You should utilize that time

135
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,370
to make arrangements for yourself.

136
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,739
Go for a hair or facial treatment
when you're free.

137
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,730
You should invest in yourself more.

138
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,899
I have to look after my son
and work part-time jobs.

139
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,330
I don't have the time for that.

140
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,089
Say, do you think

141
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,980
he's tired of me

142
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,060
now that I'm not tending
to my appearance?

143
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,579
Just rest at ease, won't you?

144
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,209
Even if all men
in the world cheat on you,

145
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,780
Yu Jian would never do so.

146
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,740
Think about it.
You're intelligent and pretty.

147
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,460
Are you still afraid that people
might steal your husband from you?

148
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,370
But people say

149
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,650
that the grass is always greener
on the other side.

150
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,940
Men don't care about that
when they're itching to mate.

151
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,209
And, the two-year period
after Chen's birthing

152
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,570
is the period when
most men commit mistakes.

153
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,419
Anyway, my instinct is telling me

154
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,220
that there's something between them.

155
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,780
No, I have to get to the bottom of this.

156
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,570
This is so annoying.

157
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,969
Thanks, Mom.

158
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,060
Is Chen asleep?

159
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,739
He just fell asleep.

160
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,980
I'll go and take a look.

161
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,169
No need for that, Mom.
He's sleeping soundly.

162
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,220
We should eat first.

163
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,820
This is nice.

164
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,490
Jian, you're back.

165
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,020
Wash your hands and join us.

166
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,530
This is pretty good.

167
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,220
Where are you taking it?
Have you sanitized it?

168
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,410
Unwrap it here.

169
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,860
Pass the box to me.

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,229
Don't you know you have to sanitize
everything before bringing them inside?

171
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,100
Be careful!

172
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,570
Guo, I told my friend
to buy this especially for you.

173
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,530
It's a limited-edition makeup gift set.

174
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,419
There's a lipstick shade with the model

175
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,499
206 Terracotta Red-Brown.

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,650
It's suitable for fall and
winter makeup. It's hard to get.

177
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,410
How did you know about this model?

178
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,499
I have to know what I'm buying, right?

179
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,180
Is this for me?

180
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,740
What? Do you think it's for me, then?
You're hilarious.

181
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,129
Maybe you bought it for someone else.

182
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,249
And, I saw it.

183
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,290
That's why you're giving it to me now.

184
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,570
Why would I bring it back
if I was buying it for someone else?

185
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,330
Your thinking is kind of eccentric,
don't you think?

186
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,940
Since when did Guo put on any lipstick?

187
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,330
Now, she's looking after Chen.

188
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,220
What if Chen consumes it by accident?

189
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,490
It'll be dangerous.

190
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,009
It must be expensive.
How much did it cost?

191
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,129
Look at you.

192
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,100
What are you trying to say here?

193
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,579
He can buy all the things he wants,

194
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,410
but the price must be reasonable,
don't you think?

195
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,289
You guys can tell me
what you want in the future.

196
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,209
I'll buy them for you.

197
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,610
No thanks.

198
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,220
Jian, give me the leather shoes
that you're not wearing.

199
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,740
Give them to him.
He had his eyes on them long ago.

200
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,100
You're not wearing them anyway.

201
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,140
Why aren't you talking?

202
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,410
Is it that hard to praise me for once?

203
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,819
I rarely put on makeup
now that I'm looking after Chen.

204
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,220
You know that too.

205
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,740
You should get a refund.

206
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,490
I already bought it.
Why should I get a refund?

207
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,009
Why do I feel like
you're in a bad mood today?

208
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,740
The gift box is too small.

209
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,169
If you want to buy something,
it should be practical.

210
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,610
Buy them in bulk or bigger sizes.

211
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,129
Alright, I understand now.

212
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,740
I'll buy you a bigger one in the future.

213
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,250
Alright now. Let's eat.

214
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,330
I'll go and check on Chen.
You guys can continue.

215
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,650
Alright, understood.

216
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,250
It's decided, then.

217
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,450
I need to head to Shanghai tomorrow.

218
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,690
Shanghai?

219
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,820
Why so sudden?

220
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,060
I was thinking

221
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,539
that I want you to take me

222
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,330
to the new WY Florist tomorrow.

223
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,530
I wish to check out the flowers there.

224
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,610
Hey, I'm talking to you.

225
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,250
Give me a second.

226
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,330
What were you saying?

227
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,579
Are you heading to Shanghai alone?

228
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,060
What's wrong? Will you be joining me?

229
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,060
Can you answer my question
properly for once?

230
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,740
What's wrong? Why are you
throwing a tantrum?

231
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,820
Tang has already arrived in Shanghai.

232
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,049
I already rejected the job,
but he insisted on making me go there.

233
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,450
I have no choice too.

234
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,619
Why did you buy lipsticks for me

235
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,780
out of the blue?

236
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,290
Did you buy them for me?

237
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,859
What do you mean by that?

238
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,100
Didn't I tell you already?

239
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,650
I rarely put on makeup
now that I'm looking after Chen.

240
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,459
Or do you dislike me

241
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,859
for turning into an old hag
after giving birth?

242
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,249
Do you want me to change?

243
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

244
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,100
Can you stop acting
unreasonably this late at night?

245
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,419
Why am I at fault
for buying you a gift here?

246
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,419
Yu Jian, listen up.

247
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,820
If you think I look ugly,
you can tell me directly.

248
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,020
Enough. I'll stop arguing with you.

249
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,610
I have a flight to catch
tomorrow morning. I need to sleep.

250
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,020
Don't wake Chen up.

251
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,900
You're always busy
from morning till night.

252
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,530
Your body can't take it, you know?

253
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,980
You can never make enough money.

254
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,140
Your health is the most important thing.

255
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,410
That's right.

256
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,570
Mom, we live in a competitive society.

257
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,570
Many people don't get
to be as busy as I am.

258
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,049
You should be content

259
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,570
that your son is
actually busy with work.

260
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,459
Our son is right.

261
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,220
His work is already tough enough.

262
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,220
You should stop nagging him.

263
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,020
Hello?

264
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,220
You're here?

265
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,650
Alright.

266
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,650
Dad, Mom, I'll be leaving now.

267
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,020
Wear your mask.

268
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,209
Chen, say goodbye to Dad.

269
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,530
Here, say goodbye to Dad.

270
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,860
- Dad is going on a business trip.
- Goodbye, Chen.

271
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,780
Dear, I'll be leaving now.

272
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,290
Remember to keep yourself protected.

273
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,459
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay.

274
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,739
Take care.

275
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,820
Okay.

276
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,140
I'll be leaving now.

277
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,370
Mom, carry Chen for me.

278
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,859
Yu Jian is so forgetful.

279
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,619
He forgot to take his gloves.

280
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,329
The weather forecast said
Shanghai would be cold.

281
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,440
The temperature there is lower.
I'll deliver his gloves to him.

282
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,819
Come to Grandma.

283
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,020
Take care.

284
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,940
Where are you going? Say goodbye to Mom.

285
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,370
(Wen Ya is just like a magic mirror.)

286
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,100
(She reflects my dullness
at this precise moment.)

287
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,290
(The dullness that I'm not
willing to acknowledge or face.)

288
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,780
(This intolerable feeling)

289
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,820
(is just like an invisible drain.)

290
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,780
(I could overcome it
with just one step.)

291
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,180
(However, my self-doubt alone
is enough to stop me in my tracks.)

292
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,530
(And, this man whom
I've been sharing the same bed with,)

293
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,940
(was he telling me the truth?
Or was he lying to me?)

294
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,020
(Can I still trust him?)

295
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,490
Thank you.

296
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,780
What do you think?
Do you have any ideas?

297
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,140
You're the boss here.

298
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,610
I wish to hear your opinion first.

299
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,330
I heard from Shan

300
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,980
that many of your designs
became popular spots for influencers.

301
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,539
And, they're famous in the circle.

302
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,940
She flatters me.

303
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,020
She told me that
there's a project for me.

304
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,980
I didn't expect it to be yours.

305
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,940
Yeah. Who would've thought, huh?

306
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,900
You're still the same.
You didn't change at all.

307
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,980
How could that be? I've changed a lot.

308
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,220
It's been two years
since we last met, right?

309
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,060
Do you have a child now?

310
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,859
She just turned one year old.

311
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,900
Is it a daughter?

312
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,650
That's pretty good.

313
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,490
Let's talk about your shop.

314
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,940
What kind of style would you like?

315
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,330
The pace in Shanghai is very fast.

316
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,740
You see,

317
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,980
I hope my shop can give out

318
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,530
a relaxing vibe.

319
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,249
I hope that people can
spend their day there

320
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,419
even if they have nothing to do.

321
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,929
I want it to be filled with
plants and flowers.

322
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,060
No problem.

323
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,410
I'll come up with
a great design for you.

324
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,220
Your shop

325
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,250
will be unique to you, Xia Guo.

326
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,739
However, I won't lower my standards

327
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,530
just because you're designing it.

328
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,820
You're still the same, huh?

329
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,370
You didn't change at all.

330
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,659
Just now, you said

331
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,169
you have plenty of furniture
and decorations here

332
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,739
that you can bring to the shop.

333
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,940
I'll select them for you.

334
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,819
Okay.

335
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,619
Okay. I'll select them, then.

336
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,740
Okay.

337
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,650
I checked out the place.

338
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,169
Those sofas are usable.

339
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,530
By then, I plan to put
a walnut wood coffee table

340
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,330
beside your French windows.

341
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,250
Do you need anything else?

342
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,060
You can decide for me.

343
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,140
Understood.

344
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,980
If so,

345
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,820
can I give you the proposal in one week?

346
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,570
I won't urge you.

347
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:55,819
By the way,

348
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,570
I have several design references
on my phone.

349
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,169
You may choose from them.

350
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,250
Okay.

351
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,290
Let me see.

352
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,250
Sorry about that.
My family is calling me.

353
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,490
Tian.

354
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,929
Look who's talking. It's Dad.

355
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,129
Look at Dad.

356
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,780
Tian, I saw you.

357
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,250
Tian, have you been a good girl?

358
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,459
Did you listen to Mom?

359
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,330
Tian was obedient.

360
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,650
How's your side doing?
Are you done meeting your client?

361
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,060
She's pretty nice.

362
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,410
The project isn't complicated.
It's just some soft decor.

363
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,250
Not a tough one.

364
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,570
Say goodbye to Dad. Wave to him.

365
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,459
Goodbye.

366
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,419
Goodbye, Tian.

367
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,140
Let's wait for Dad to come home.

368
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,370
No wonder people say that
daughters warm their parents' hearts.

369
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,780
That was great.

370
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,049
Actually, I'm someone

371
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,650
who's easily satisfied.

372
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,180
I'll try to lead a life

373
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,060
that's stable and straightforward.

374
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,180
A steady stream of happiness,
and cherishing what you have, huh?

375
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,900
What about you? Have you
encountered the right one for you?

376
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,690
He went overseas. He went to Singapore.

377
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,370
Sometimes, I would imagine

378
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,089
what would happen if I followed him

379
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,290
to Singapore.

380
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,940
I would also imagine

381
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,220
what would happen
if I remained in Leshan

382
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,450
instead of moving here in Shanghai.

383
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,020
Yeah.

384
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,780
I wonder what would happen
if my dad didn't injure his legs.

385
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,450
I wonder what would happen
if I followed you to Shanghai.

386
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,530
I wonder what would happen
if today was the end of the world.

387
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,020
If so, I wonder what would happen

388
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,060
if we're unable to
see the sunrise tomorrow.

389
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,760
- Let's go to admire the sunrise.
- Let's go to admire the sunrise.

390
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,140
Why are you only here now?

391
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,450
I bought some breakfast.

392
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,690
There's nothing to eat at the seaside.

393
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,020
Thanks.

394
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,200
We have to wait for some time
before the next train arrives.

395
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,900
Let's have a seat.

396
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,370
Hurry! We won't make it in time!

397
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,330
It's truly gorgeous.

398
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,820
It's been so long
since I saw the sunrise.

399
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,690
Admiring the sunrise

400
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,330
does make people happy, huh?

401
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,860
Thank you for coming.

402
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,220
We meet again,

403
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,820
even though it's just a coincidence.

404
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,860
Even if it's a coincidence,

405
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,410
it's predestined by the heavens.

406
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,900
Yeah.

407
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,289
If so, we should trust in

408
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,220
the arrangements made by the heavens.

409
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,180
We should trust that every path

410
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,900
exists to make us
better version of ourselves.

411
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,020
Let's work hard to improve ourselves.

412
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,940
I'm sure both of us will be happy.

No need for that. Head to the airport.

Guo,

427
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,570
you must eat well, work hard,

Why did you park so far away?

475
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,490
There's a jam in front of the hospital.
I can't enter the entrance.

476
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,100
How come other people
can enter the entrance?

477
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,440
You shouldn't come
if you don't feel like it.

478
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,490
I could've hired a cab.

479
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,250
Good boy.

480
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,100
Put your arm through here.

481
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,610
What did the doctor say?

482
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,490
He caught the viral flu.

483
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,740
What was his temperature?

484
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,900
39.2°C.

485
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,410
I already told you not to
take ice cream yesterday.

486
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,900
Can you have some common sense for once?

487
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,820
What has the viral flu
got to do with ice cream?

488
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,280
If you're complaining about
my ineptitude in raising our child,

489
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,060
you can raise him yourself.
Stop criticizing me.

490
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,089
I already said one sentence.
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

491
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,740
Why can't I throw a tantrum?

492
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,249
Have you stayed at home
ever since you returned from Shanghai?

493
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,650
I was panicking alone
in the hospital when our son fell sick.

494
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,539
I went to work, you know?
I didn't go there for a trip.

495
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,530
I have to attend a meeting in the studio
after sending you guys back.

496
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,499
By the way, I'm not
returning home for dinner.

497
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,610
Suit yourself.

498
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,600
You must've woken up
on the wrong side of the bed.

499
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,650
Good boy. We'll be home soon.

500
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,499
Have one more. Hurry.

501
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,289
I want water.

502
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,530
Yan, the trip must've been tough on you.

503
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,820
What did you guys have
at the quarantine hotel?

504
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,980
Actually, the meals
we had were pretty good.

505
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,819
It's just that I gained weight
because I didn't exercise.

506
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,040
It's good as long as you're back.

507
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,739
We're back.

508
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
You guys are back.

509
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,699
Guo.

510
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,140
My eldest grandson is back.

511
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,539
Go and take a look.

512
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,619
Yan, you're back.

513
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,740
My dear nephew!

514
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,089
Call Aunt.
Do you want Aunt to carry you?

515
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:49,899
Let me carry you.

516
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,089
What did the doctor say?

517
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,140
It's not a big deal.
He gave us some medicine.

518
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,610
Didn't Yu Jian go and pick you up?
Where is he?

519
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,490
He went back to the studio directly.

520
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,220
He said he wouldn't
be returning home for dinner.

521
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,819
Jian is working overtime again?

522
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,650
His son is sick,
yet he's not concerned at all.

523
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,009
Guo, it's been tough on you.

524
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,140
Dad, it's fine.

525
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,980
It's not like Yu Jian
is wasting his time away.

526
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,289
You two should go and rest.

527
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,539
I'll go and make dinner.

528
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,940
Mom, I'll help you out later.

529
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,579
Guo, Chen resembles you a lot.

530
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,250
He's much better-looking
compared to Baby Jian.

531
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,859
Yan, I'm sure it was not easy for you

532
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,049
to come back this time around.

533
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,929
Yeah.

534
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,610
I had to take a transit,
and it took so long. I'm dead beat.

535
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,490
But I'm lucky that I get to come back.

536
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,370
Yeah. I'm glad that you're back.

537
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,220
You should go and rest.

538
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,619
I'll take him to his room
and feed him some medicine.

539
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,659
Come, Chen.

540
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,839
We can play with Aunt later.

541
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,450
- Goodbye.
- Okay? Come.

542
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,250
Yan,

543
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,249
are you sure you'll look for a job here

544
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,690
and not return to the U.S.?

545
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,570
It's either Shanghai, Guangzhou,
or Shenzhen.

546
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,740
Shanghai? Shenzhen?

547
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,530
Don't you think it's too far?

548
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,220
Leshan is developing
at a rapid pace too.

549
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,250
Leshan needs
talented individuals like you.

550
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,740
Precisely. You should stay at home.

551
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,969
Just look at Guo.
She didn't move to Shanghai.

552
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,779
Now, she has a stable job.

553
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,410
She got married and had a child.

554
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,570
This is how life should be
for ordinary folks.

555
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,370
I will consider your opinions.

556
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,209
However, it's my job.

557
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,940
I wish to make the call here.

558
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,740
Alright.

559
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,860
What about your marriage, then?

560
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,020
Just leave it to me.

561
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,980
We'll definitely find
a better husband for her.

562
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,049
What are you saying?
Why did you have to bring that up?

563
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,220
What's wrong?

564
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,650
Mom, you might not like
what I'm going to say next.

565
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,980
I don't think I'll get married again.

566
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,610
To be honest,

567
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,610
I don't believe in marriages at all.

568
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,289
Yan, this too shall pass.

569
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,819
You have to move on,

570
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,860
am I right?

571
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,819
Look at how happy
your brother and sister-in-law are.

572
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,780
Precisely.

573
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,570
Guo, don't you agree?

574
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,610
I'm full. You guys can continue.

575
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,739
I'll go and check on Chen.

576
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,780
Okay.

577
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,089
Why do I feel like something's off

578
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,140
between Guo and your son?

579
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,330
What do you mean?

580
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,490
Are you too sensitive?

581
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,499
It felt off

582
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,060
ever since Yu Jian
came back from Shanghai.

583
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,980
I also think Guo is in a bad mood.

584
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,140
Did they argue?

585
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,180
No, they didn't.

586
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Are they giving each other
the silent treatment? That's worse.

587
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,450
Silent treatment?

588
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,579
(Wen Ya: See you downstairs
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.)

589
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,940
(I'm ready.)

590
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,140
Yu Jian, what time
did you come back last night?

591
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,450
Before 12 A.M.

592
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,290
Jian, today's the weekend.

593
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,570
You should take your child
for an outing or something.

594
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,650
Not today.
I have to meet a client later.

595
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,699
Look at you.

596
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,980
You're never home.

597
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,919
You.

598
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,410
(Wen Ya: I'm downstairs.)
You think this is a hotel, don't you?

599
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,180
(Wen Ya: I'm downstairs.)

600
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,610
Get in.

601
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,200
