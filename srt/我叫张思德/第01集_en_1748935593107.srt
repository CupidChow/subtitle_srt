Mr.Li

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,840
How are you from Tri-J-A

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,720
Fine

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,720
Good morning, Uncle.

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
Hello, Uncle.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720
Hello, Uncle.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,720
Hello, Uncle.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,720
Zhang Side, you've done your job.

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
You've done it.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Zhang Side, you really have something to do.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
How did you come up with this idea?

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,720
It's much more convenient for the host to call us.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
I'd like to try some dinner.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Want an ordinary man to baby-head me out of his Chinese genes?

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
How about playing with me?

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
How did you find this man?

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Bake.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I need your signature.

Episode 1

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,020
Chief.

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,720
You can't just stay up all day and sleep.

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
You can only sleep one night.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
It's dawn again.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
How can you be so healthy?

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,520
Li Gang, you're really...

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,320
I like working while others are sleeping.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
When I'm done with my work,

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,320
I'll let them see my work success.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I'll be very happy.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,320
Right.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Did you write down the letter you gave your mother last time?

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,920
I did.

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,320
How about I help you with the idea?

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Mother, I'm a widow.

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,320
You and Guixiang are still fine.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,920
I've been staying at home for ten years.

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,520
I haven't returned home.

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,720
Is everything good at home?

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,920
Have you planted all the beans this year?

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,120
Do you still have the fish in the water?

52
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
Is it enough to eat?

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,920
You're getting older.

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,320
There's something good to do. You can do it yourself.

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm doing pretty well here.

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Mother, I've grown up now.

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm doing a lot of meaningful things.

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm sorry I can't think of you anymore.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,320
Can you forgive me?

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,120
Son, Zhang Side.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,920
You wrote the full letter.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
The love letter is all in one letter.

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
But you still mean it.

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Look.

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,120
There are still some wrong notes.

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
How about it?

67
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Let me cover it for you.

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,520
You...you're all in a big trouble.

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,720
I'm not going to trouble you with this little thing.

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,120
We're here to help the mother of the guest.

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
For the people.

72
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Right.

73
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Mother Li is also the first person to be in the people's life.

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I have to say goodbye to you today.

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
I'll go to the market to cook at the market.

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll report to the people.

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll leave tomorrow.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay.

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,920
When you come back, I'll definitely be your new friend.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
I also want to add one more thing.

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,320
When the people's life is over,

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,920
I'll definitely bring mother Li here and make a good use of her.

83
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Is that okay?

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,520
Hurry and get up.

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
Okay.

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,920
Hurry and get up.

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,120
Hurry and get up.

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Hurry and get up.

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Everyone, don't let the rain drop.

90
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Keep your eyes open.

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Hurry and get up.

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
My spirit water!

93
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
It's raining.

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
This family is really destroyed.

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Hurry and run!

96
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Hurry and run!

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Hurry and run!

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Xiao Pan, your wife is so fast.

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Hurry and run!

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Hurry and run!

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Hurry and run!

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Hurry and run!

103
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Hurry and run!

104
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Why are you running?

105
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm with you.

106
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
What's wrong, Xiao Pan?

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Hurry and run!

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Hurry and run!

109
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Hurry and run!

110
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Hurry and run!

111
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Hurry and run!

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
This is a baby.

113
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Look.

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
It's so hard to get a baby.

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
It's so hard to get a baby.

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Is this a baby?

117
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
No.

118
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
It's a baby.

119
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I have to go to the hospital to die.

120
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
My brother brought me some baby.

121
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I have no life to live.

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,120
So these baby are not enough.

123
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
They are enough to give us.

124
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120
We are like the baby we have.

125
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Baby, wait for us.

126
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Baby.

127
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Baby.

128
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
He's coming.

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
He's finally here.

130
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Our Yilong is the best place for soldiers.

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,120
My brother will come back soon.

132
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Hurry and run.

133
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Hurry and run.

134
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Hurry and run!

135
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Run away!

136
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
The war is over.

137
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,120
It's time for a fight.

138
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Run away!

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Run away!

140
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Run away!

141
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Run away!

142
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Run away!

143
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Run away!

144
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Run away!

145
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Run away!

146
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Run away!

147
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,320
Run away!

148
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
We need to find the leader of the blood-thirsty team.

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,360
It's an excellent business life.

150
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,620
There will always be thoseleeves.

151
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,540
After eating,

152
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,880
It's nice again.

153
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,940
It's a great valley!

154
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,300
Looking at you,

155
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,660
Why do you look at us like that?

156
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,700
타이마다,

157
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,600
Let's go.

158
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
The people are happy, the people are happy

159
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,800
The people are happy, the people are happy

160
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
The people are happy, the people are happy

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hello, Mr. Hong Jun

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,600
Mr. Hong Jun?

163
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
You are so kind

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Mr. Hong Jun, he is not a private person

165
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
So he is used to calling you Mr. Hong Jun

166
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Don't be so hard on him

167
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Our Hong Jun is called Tongzhi

168
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Comrade Hong Jun

169
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
You are here to help us

170
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
People are poor

171
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes

172
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Our Hong Jun is a group of people

173
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
who help poor people

174
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
to move to the house

175
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Where are you from?

176
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
We are from the Sixth River

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
The relatives of the Sixth River are all sent to Hong Jun

178
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Sixth River?

179
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
Chief Niu

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Look, is it the Sixth River?

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes

182
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Big brother, what are you doing?

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Big brother, what are you doing?

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Why are you here?

185
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
We are here to pick you up

186
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Chief Niu, didn't you always think of going to the fire field?

187
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Are you going to fight?

188
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Fight

189
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Good

190
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Brother San

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
We are so angry every day

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
We don't have enough water

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Chief Niu, Hong Jun just arrived at the Sixth River

194
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
He is so late

195
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Let's go now

196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
I am going to pack up

197
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Let's go to see Hong Jun

198
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,200
Yes

199
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Chief Niu

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Chief Niu

201
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,000
Chief Niu

202
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
Come on

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Let go of me

204
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Chief Niu

205
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Let go of me

206
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Let go of me

207
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,800
Chief Niu

208
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Let go of me

209
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Niu Yidang

210
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,400
You are the first son of Hong Jun

211
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,600
You can just bite him

212
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Let go of me

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,400
Let go of me

214
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,200
You all listen to me

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
With my chief

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,400
We can't get into the Yilong City

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Who dares to follow the palace?

218
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,000
You have a family?

219
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
They are your family

220
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,960
Let's go

221
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Let down

222
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,400
Let down

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,400
Let down

224
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
Never mind

225
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,800
Come on

226
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Go!

227
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Go!

228
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Go!

229
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Where's the gun?

230
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
The gun!

231
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
The gun!

232
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
The gun!

233
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Is the boat ready?

234
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes!

235
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Go to the city and kill Wang Jing.

236
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Yes!

237
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
What's your plan?

238
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
You're going to save me?

239
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Do you believe I'm going to kill you?

240
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Get out of my way!

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm going!

242
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
I'm sorry, Director Jiao.

243
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Tell my parents that I'm going to kill you.

244
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
What do you want to do?

245
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
You're dead!

246
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Go!

247
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Director Jiao, don't talk nonsense!

248
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Come on!

249
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Put the gun down!

250
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Put the gun down!

251
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes!

252
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
You're dead!

253
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
You two, stop him!

254
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm going to see the situation.

255
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Go!

256
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Go!

257
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
You're going to kill me!

258
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
What are you doing?

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Listen,

260
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
you're going to the capital city now.

261
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
You're going to die, you know?

262
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm not afraid of dying.

263
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
The capital city has a famous god,

264
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
a man of the south.

265
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Let me ask you,

266
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
how many people are there in the city?

267
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
How many people are there?

268
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
You're going to the city,

269
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
I don't even know

270
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
how many people are there in the city.

271
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Why are you going up there?

272
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
My parents were killed by Wang Jing.

273
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I'm begging you,

274
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
can you let me go to the mountain

275
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
and kill Wang Jing?

276
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Wang Jing,

277
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
do you know who killed

278
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
the one who went with the red army?

279
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Let's just watch.

280
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Is there no way to do anything?

281
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Just let him die?

282
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
If you want to go to the city,

283
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
you must take the capital city.

284
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I know it better than you.

285
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
And like Wang Jing,

286
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
the biggest evil

287
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
that can harm the people of the five nations,

288
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
must be destroyed.

289
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
But you can't act rashly.

290
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
You act rashly

291
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
and only destroy

292
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
our whole war plan.

293
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
War plan, war plan.

294
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I want to hear

295
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
what our war plan is.

296
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
You two,

297
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
go back and train.

298
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Yes.

299
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Calm down first.

300
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Let me tell you,

301
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
when President Mu comes back,

302
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'll let him go to the city

303
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
to fight with his own strength.

304
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
And if he doesn't,

305
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
he'll attack with one strike.

306
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
What do you mean?

307
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
You mean

308
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
he hasn't got a strike?

309
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Of course, it's not true.

310
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Wang Ji is fighting with his own strength.

311
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
They want to support

312
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
the Red Army

313
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
before they go to the capital.

314
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
And I believe

315
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
there's a son

316
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
who's a leader of the army

317
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
who hasn't put Wang Ji in his eyes.

318
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Isn't this

319
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
the opportunity

320
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
to know about the layout

321
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
of the capital city?

322
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
President Mu is very experienced.

323
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
He can speak well.

324
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
So we decided

325
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
to let him go to the capital city.

326
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
President Mu didn't come back.

327
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
But I can go.

328
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I can go.

329
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
I can go.

330
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Old woman.

331
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
You're a local.

332
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Maybe

333
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
many people know you on the mountain.

334
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
And you're in this state now.

335
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Can we be a big hit?

336
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Now I order you

337
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
to go back to your family

338
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
and deal with the situation.

339
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
When you get the house,

340
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
come back.

341
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Come back.

342
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm going to kill Wei Feng.

343
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Don't let Chang Shengying

344
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
lose.

345
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Now no one

346
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
wants to cry.

347
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Cry for a while.

348
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Cry...

349
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Look at me...

350
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Hold him...

351
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Take him away...

352
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Pull him.

353
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Help him pull me...

354
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Kill him!

355
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Liu Wazhi, calm down!

356
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Kill him!

357
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Liu Wazhi, don't move!

358
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
You can't just come and fight back!

359
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
You can't forget the two monkeys!

360
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
You go back and kill them!

361
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Liu Wazhi, Old Nongzhu!

362
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
You have a half of the lives to save my life!

363
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'll avenge you!

364
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I'll avenge you!

365
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Liu Wazhi, I'll think of a way!

366
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
We'll avenge you together!

367
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
If you see it, you can burn it!

368
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I'll avenge you!

369
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I'll avenge you!

370
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I'll avenge you!

371
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I'll listen to Mr. Tang!

372
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
They're fighting in the palace.

373
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
They need to take the first step to attack the palace.

374
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
But now, there's no life-saving.

375
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
We pretend to be the leader of the big brother.

376
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
We go to the palace to see the situation.

377
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
We come back to protect Hong Jun.

378
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Then, Mr. Tang can send the military commander.

379
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Then, we'll avenge the big brother!

380
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's go!

381
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Hurry up!

382
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Go back to the village to prepare gifts.

383
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Go to the spirit station.

384
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Hurry up!

385
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Hurry up!

386
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
We have to go.

387
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Go!

388
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I thought it was Hu Tan's.

389
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
He's really dead.

390
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Go!

391
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Wait!

392
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Wait!

393
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
We can't go up together.

394
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Once we make a mistake,

395
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
we'll be in trouble.

396
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Go up together.

397
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Go down together.

398
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Mr. Tang,

399
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
it's like this.

400
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
If there's any problem,

401
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
we'll take it to the emergency.

402
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Yes.

403
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
The problem is now...

404
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
which country is going to go to?

405
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I'll pay you.

406
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
You can't go.

407
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
You can't go to the first country.

408
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Look at the face of you.

409
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
You're so bright.

410
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
You've taken two big money from the country.

411
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
You haven't been to the gate yet.

412
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Are you sure?

413
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I'm not afraid of death.

414
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
You're not afraid of death.

415
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
We're afraid of death.

416
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
If you're found out like this,

417
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
don't say that you're going to avenge.

418
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
We'll kill you.

419
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Zhang Dabai,

420
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I think you're the best

421
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
among the few people.

422
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I want to be the leader

423
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
and be the leader.

424
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
You can't go.

425
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
You're so dangerous.

426
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
You need a leader like this

427
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
to be the leader.

428
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm a scholar.

429
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I don't look like

430
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
the dog-head who sent the letter to Lin Jia.

431
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Let me say,

432
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
among the few people

433
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
who are like the dog-head and the dog-head,

434
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I think you're the best.

435
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Didn't you crack the cheery key?

436
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
You can't be angry with us!

437
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
No, has to be!

438
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I don't look like the dog-head

439
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
whether it is draggy or not.

440
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Does it look like the声?

441
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
All right!

442
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
What do you say?

443
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Did the wolves went to attack?

444
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I heard dogs!

445
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Then why do you think

446
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
should've run afterwards?

447
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
I'm afraid that

448
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
pretentious 불�抓 you with what you've got.

449
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
You took that too hard.

450
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
If you really did let me know,

451
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
even a dog-head would have hurt yourself.

452
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I think you're raisins now.

453
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
All jaggery will go away.

454
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
And above all,

455
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,760
I'll go with you.

456
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,200
Let's go.

457
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,800
Let's go.

458
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,200
Grandma, wait.

459
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Let's go.

460
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,800
Change your clothes.

461
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,200
Come on.

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,600
Come on.

463
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,600
Come on.

464
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Lin Shouxin.

465
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Lin Lang's lighter.

466
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Open the gate.

467
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,000
Guazi,

468
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm here to make up for my mistake.

469
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Then I'll make a record.

470
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Look.

471
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Go.

472
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Hurry.

473
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,000
Go.

474
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,200
See?

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Those big brothers

476
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
sent a girl here.

477
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
To your home.

478
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,800
I don't care.

479
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
I just want to live in my home.

480
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,800
What are you doing?

481
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
Lin's lighter.

482
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,800
He's here to see you off.

483
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Don't move.

484
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,000
You said it's Lin's lighter.

485
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,600
Lin Shouxin's lighter?

486
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,400
No.

487
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,400
No.

488
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
I'll stay here.

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,800
Tan Yinzhang is locked up.

490
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Lin Shouxin and I

491
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,800
won't be together.

492
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,200
Guazi, I'm not a liar.

493
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Guazi.

494
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,000
Guazi.

495
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Come back.

496
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Guazi.

497
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Come back.

498
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,400
You're only looking for Winniang.

499
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,200
I love you.

500
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,600
With algal

501
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,400
with keluar

502
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,080
the dangers ofros

503
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,920
we find the true reason

504
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,800
keep running

505
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,720
inwardly

506
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,200
and let's label the enemy

507
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,640
Come on All comes

508
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
I'll go to the left.

509
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Here.

510
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I'll go to the left.

511
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I'll go to the left.

512
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I'll go to the left.

513
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Brothers,

514
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
the dishes are ready.

515
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Don't be anxious.

516
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Go.

517
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Report.

518
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
There was a person who was kind to Master Ling.

519
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I'll go to the forest.

520
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Go to the rescue.

521
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Go to the rescue.

522
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
He's in the wild.

523
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Go to the Red Army.

524
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Go to our national team.

525
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
The Red Army.

526
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
You go quickly.

527
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Hurry up.

528
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Hurry up.

529
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
You go.

530
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Let me go to the forest.

531
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Be safe.

532
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll tell you one last time.

533
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Stay here.

534
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Don't go anywhere.

535
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Don't go anywhere.

536
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Wait for me to come back.

537
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I won't go.

538
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
You go quickly.

539
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Go quickly.

540
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Here, here, here.

541
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Boss,

542
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I'll make you a chicken soup.

543
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Come and make it.

544
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Come on.

545
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Go.

546
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
It's dirty.

547
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Fatty.

548
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
You try it.

549
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Chief Wang,

550
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Master Ling sent 500 sheep to our village.

551
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
You sent them here?

552
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Yes.

553
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
You sent them here, too.

554
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Do you know him?

555
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
We sent them here.

556
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
The young man doesn't know him.

557
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
What do you say?

558
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
You sent them here.

559
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
You sent them here.

560
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
You sent them here.

561
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Yes.

562
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Are you after me?

563
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Yes.

564
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
What's wrong?

565
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
A他, a hخر,

566
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
a Youtuber.

567
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
What're you writing?

568
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Chief,

569
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,280
didn't you see

570
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,200
a fellow Leo?

571
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
This must be a fake one.

572
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,240
You stayed here

573
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,200
for five years.

574
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,360
There are 15-hp teeth in the stone stone.

575
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,160
There are 16-hp teeth in the right stone stone.

576
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
Master Lin asked me

577
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
to clean the stone stone every day.

578
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Do you know why?

579
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
Because it's the door of the Lin family.

580
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,960
I asked Master Lin

581
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,960
why the teeth are different.

582
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,040
Master Lin said

583
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,960
when it was pulled, it was broken.

584
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,920
Stop.

585
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,960
Let's go.

586
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
Why did Master Lin give me a gift?

587
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,160
Open it.

588
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,960
Master.

589
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,960
Get up.

590
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,760
Master.

591
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,160
Save the old man and the big mother.

592
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,160
Battalion commander,

593
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,360
these flowers have caused a big trouble.

594
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,760
Master.

595
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,760
Master.

596
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,960
Brother, brother.

597
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,760
Brother.

598
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,960
Brother.

599
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,360
How can I let him go?

600
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,960
Oh, no.

601
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,160
I'll kill him.

602
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
You just said something.

603
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Do you want to do something?

604
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,760
What... what... what do you want to do?

605
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,960
Get out of here.

606
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
Brother Niu said

607
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,160
if you want to be the Red Army,

608
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,560
you can't be afraid of the sacrifice.

609
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,160
We haven't been the Red Army yet.

610
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,160
I... I...

611
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,960
I'll kill him.

612
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,760
Don't go, brother.

613
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,360
Go and search him.

614
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,960
Can't you stop saying something?

615
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,760
I...

616
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,160
Brother.

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,760
Brother.

618
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,760
What's the matter?

619
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,760
What's the matter?

620
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,760
What's the matter?

621
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,760
What's the matter?

622
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,120
What's the matter?

623
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,120
What's the matter?

624
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,120
What's the matter?

625
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,320
Inform the 1st, 2nd, 3rd consecutive rounds.

626
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,320
Get in the military.

627
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,120
Yes.

628
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,920
Wait a minute.

629
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Do you want to be the Red Army?

630
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,920
Although Wang Ji is not the Red Army,

631
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,320
there are hundreds of traitors in the army.

632
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,520
Even if we want to fight,

633
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,920
we have to inform the regiment first.

634
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,920
We have to borrow people to borrow the cannon.

635
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,920
Borrow?

636
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,120
We must borrow it.

637
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,920
First, we have to borrow the two doors of the two gates from the regiment.

638
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,920
And the one that stops the gun.

639
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,720
A bandit in the mountain battle

640
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,720
dares to call himself a copper wall iron wall.

641
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,520
Okay.

642
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,520
Let's get the guy who fought the fight ready

643
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,320
to blow this iron up.

644
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,920
Yes.

645
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,120
Get ready.

646
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,120
Get off the mountain with me later.

647
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,720
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

648
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

649
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,520
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

650
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

651
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,920
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

652
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,520
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

653
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

654
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

655
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

656
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

657
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

658
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

659
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

660
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

661
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

662
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

663
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,320
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

664
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,880
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

665
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,880
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

666
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,880
Change into the Red Army's clothes.

667
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,880
I think

668
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,880
we should go to Jincheng Village

669
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,080
or some place.

670
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,880
To be honest,

671
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,880
I forgot that he's been surrounded by the Japanese army.

672
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,880
But after all,

673
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,880
he ran away from the army.

674
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
He's just a

675
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,640
stubborn guy.

676
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,440
I can't believe it.

677
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,840
Come on, kid.

678
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,040
Let's eat.

679
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,440
Come on.

680
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,040
Don't scare the kid.

681
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,640
Come on.

682
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,040
Lin, it's your business.

683
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,040
Go back to work.

684
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,600
You're so pitiful.

685
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,600
Don't move.

686
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,600
I won't hit you.

687
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,600
You have a job.

688
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,600
Hurry up and eat.

689
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,560
Hurry up and eat.

690
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,760
If you're not careful,

691
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
it's good.

692
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,960
You can't control your body.

693
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,760
You're in a hurry to go to Jincheng Village.

694
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,160
I've been waiting for you.

695
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,760
You're so pitiful.

696
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,320
You can't do such a dangerous thing.

697
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,320
Do you hear me?

698
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,320
Why are you crying?

699
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,320
Look at you.

700
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,720
Hurry up and eat.

701
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,320
After eating, let's go to find a baby.

702
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,320
Master.

703
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,320
Who is it?

704
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,320
It's me.

705
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm looking for Master.

706
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,520
It's not a rule.

707
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,720
What's the matter?

708
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,920
It's so late.

709
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,520
Master, you have to come out.

710
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,520
I have an important thing to tell you.

711
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,920
Recently, there are many things.

712
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
I don't have the heart to

713
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
have a baby with my daughter.

714
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,320
Master, I didn't mean that.

715
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,920
Tell you an important thing.

716
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,520
It's my son's matter.

717
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,320
Master.

718
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,720
Master.

719
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,120
Don't be so hard on me.

720
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
Who are you?

721
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,320
How did you come in?

722
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,120
Master.

723
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,320
Master.

724
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,520
I didn't scare you.

725
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm Wang Jinchi.

726
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm here to see you.

727
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,920
What's going on?

728
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,520
I can't do anything.

729
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,920
They kidnapped Yao'er.

730
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,520
I'm here to find you.

731
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,520
It's not a rule.

732
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,520
How can you be so hard on me?

733
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,520
Master.

734
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,920
Master, it's okay.

735
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,920
Mr. Wang.

736
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,920
What's the matter?

737
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,520
Listen to me.

738
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,320
My son, Lin Jinqin,

739
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,520
is in Changsha.

740
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,920
You're a respected general.

741
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,320
I'm telling you.

742
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,120
My son, Lin Jinqin,

743
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,920
is the general of the whole army.

744
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,520
Master.

745
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,520
Master.

746
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,520
Master.

747
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,520
Master.

748
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,520
The place is where the enemy is.

749
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
The place is where the enemy is.

750
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,120
Are you sure?

751
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm sure.

752
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
Where's the emperor?

753
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,720
Where's the emperor?

754
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh, no.

755
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,120
The emperor.

756
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,720
He must be in Wang Jinbao's house.

757
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,920
Where's the emperor?

758
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,920
Where's the emperor?

759
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,520
Where's the emperor?

760
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,920
The emperor is killed.

761
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,920
The emperor is killed.

762
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,920
The emperor is killed.

763
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,560
Well.

764
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,920
I don't know you.

765
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,220
Could it be...

766
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,320
Master?

767
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,120
Yes.

768
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Could it be...

769
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,320
Let me get my mouth out.

770
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,620
Never mind the і forecast.

771
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,120
Oh, my god.

772
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
Li Zhi Yu is in a mess and is in a state of security.

773
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
But now,

774
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,600
I, the leader of the national army,

775
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,800
can't even protect my family

776
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,760
and the Wei State.

777
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
What's the point of me being the leader?

778
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,800
Leader,

779
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
this is not your fault.

780
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,960
It's my fault.

781
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,400
It's the red army that's blamed for it.

782
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,160
They killed the innocent.

783
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,840
You're the great man of Yi Long.

784
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,320
It's the red army that's blamed for it.

785
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,720
You're really challenging me.

786
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
You're challenging me.

787
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,960
Even if I'm humiliated,

788
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,360
I can't do anything for you.

789
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,480
Leader,

790
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,960
we'll fight back

791
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,640
and avenge for Master Li.

792
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,480
Put it down.

793
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,160
Yes.

794
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Put it down.

795
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,320
Let me go.

796
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,720
I can't do it.

797
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,640
Brothers,

798
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,040
do you agree?

799
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,920
As long as you agree,

800
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,280
it's the red army that's blamed for it.

801
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,960
I can't give up.

802
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,000
No matter how delicious or bad it is,

803
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,080
I can let you go.

804
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,660
If you can't,

805
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,200
we'll easily get married.

806
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,880
We're still friends.

807
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,680
Director,

808
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,180
you have to go home.

809
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,280
Go.

810
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,920
Go.

811
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,760
Go.

812
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,400
It's too late.

813
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
I'm OK.

814
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,920
Come.

815
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,560
Director.

816
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
I can't be with you anymore.

817
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,760
I have to let you and your mother go.

818
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Father, mother.

819
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,760
I will give you a new head.

820
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Father.

821
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
I will give you a new head.

822
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I will give you a new head.

823
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Father.

824
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Father.

825
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Father.

826
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,760
I promise.

827
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I promise I will give you a new head.

828
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
If you can't be with or hate me,

829
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,760
I will not be with you.

830
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I will not be with you.

831
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
You saw Wang Ji did it.

832
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Yes, sir.

833
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Wang Ji took a snakehead from my house.

834
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
I saw him.

835
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
I'm sure it's him.

836
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,760
That means they came out of the Lin family.

837
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
They were in the middle of the night and shouted,

838
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
The Red Army has killed them.

839
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
This is your own opinion?

840
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Yes, I personally saw it.

841
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
I saw it.

842
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I saw it.

843
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
I saw it.

844
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,760
The location of the Yilong Sizhou is taken by the Red Army.

845
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Although Jincheng Village is in danger,

846
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
after all, it's hard to understand.

847
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Wang Ji is the only one who can get rid of the Red Army.

848
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,760
He wants to kill Lin Junqing and fight the Red Army with him.

849
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Jincheng Village is hard to deal with.

850
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Add another Lin Junqing.

851
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,760
The war is getting more and more lively.

852
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
According to my judgment,

853
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Lin Junqing will definitely come to me.

854
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
When he comes here,

855
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
you will definitely go through the White Claw.

856
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
The White Claw.

857
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Let's go down the wall first.

858
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Let's go.

859
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Let's fight a ambush.

860
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Okay.

861
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Sit down.

862
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
The Yilong Sizhou is in trouble.

863
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Wang Ji once asked me three times.

864
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
He asked me to stay away from him.

865
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
I refused him.

866
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
And before he was taken by Wang Ji,

867
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
he and I had a brotherhood.

868
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Then why?

869
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,760
When I was in the Lin family,

870
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Wang Ji sent people to express his sincerity at the first time.

871
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,760
You mean the murderer is Wang Ji?

872
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
His purpose is to kill people and get them.

873
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
He forced the group to leave the army.

874
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Let me ask you again.

875
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Did Hong Jun send it?

876
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Wang An.

877
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,760
It's really Director Lin who sent it.

878
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Tang Tong.

879
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
You are so stubborn.

880
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Brother.

881
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
My name is Zhang Sine.

882
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,760
I am a man of the sea.

883
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,760
I am a man of the sea.

884
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I am a man of the sea.

885
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I am a man of the sea.

886
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I am a man of the sea.

887
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I am a man of the sea.

888
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,760
I am a man of the sea.

889
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,760
I am a man of the sea.

890
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,760
I am a man of the sea.

891
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
I will not let you go.

892
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I will not let you go.

893
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
I will not let you go.

894
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
I will not let you go.

895
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I will not let you go.

896
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
I will not let you go.

897
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
I will not let you go.

898
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
I will not let you go.

899
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
I will not let you go.

900
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,760
I will not let you go.

901
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,760
I will not let you go.

902
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
I will not let you go.

903
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
I will not let you go.

904
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
I will not let you go.

905
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I will not let you go.

906
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
I will not let you go.

907
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
I will not let you go.

908
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
I will not let you go.

909
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I will not let you go.

910
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,760
I will not let you go.

911
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,760
I will not let you go.

912
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,760
I will not let you go.

913
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,760
I will not let you go.

914
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
I will not let you go.

915
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,760
I will not let you go.

916
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,760
I will not let you go.

917
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I will not let you go.

918
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,960
I'm sorry.

919
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
I'm sorry.

920
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
I'm sorry.

921
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I'm sorry.

922
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I'm sorry.

923
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,960
I'm sorry.

924
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I'm sorry.

925
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
I'm sorry.

926
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
I'm sorry.

927
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I'm sorry.

928
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I'm sorry.

929
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I'm sorry.

930
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I'm sorry.

931
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,960
I'm sorry.

932
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,960
I'm sorry.

933
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
I'm sorry.

934
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,960
I'm sorry.

935
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
I'm sorry.

936
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm sorry.

937
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
I'm sorry.

938
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
I'm sorry.

942
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm sorry.

943
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm sorry.

944
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
I'm sorry.

945
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
I'm sorry.
