The Brain's Make-Up

00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,740
Episode 20

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,960
You only know Zhang Bining

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,860
Yes sir

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,840
Come here

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,940
Take a look

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,080
Go

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
What is he doing

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will sing for you

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will sing for you

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will sing for you

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My heart is in a mess

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will sing for you

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 20

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Bring the edamame inside

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and帆1-2-3-4 on corn

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Later.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,240
Stop!

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,360
What is it?

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,360
It is different from the soybean milk.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
Go ahead.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hello, brothers of the Yan factory.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why is Ling Da Ya here?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I heard that he is here to protect the Red Army.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What I'm here for is to protect the Red Army.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is troublesome.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
From today on, my Yan factory security team

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
will be here.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We don't just want to protect the Red Army.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We want to protect the Red Army.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yan's criminal is also a criminal.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And he is a thief.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Especially those who are smart.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It was originally thought that we were all in the same team.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's almost the same as the South Bukit's Gang Yan.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We can be the Japanese to hit a target.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I didn't expect to meet Ling Da Ya.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
First, we do not encounter the AND here,

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but we are surrounded by another person here.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
>- I can see it with my own eyes.-

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, why don't we check the operation Across Separation office?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's Heefen Dome.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Which one is the person that is hurt?

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hang on for a while.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Firstly, we have to find email form any source.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Herя not under investigation.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you want to be killed and the mole?

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,960
You little kitten!

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,260
I think you took my fat face off me,

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,800
but I tried to make you admit it.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,720
Hei.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,840
You're just trying a bit tricks!

54
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm telling the truth,

55
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,860
do you think it's that famous?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,320
It's bad!

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
The road is broken.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,560
Help me repair it.

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,320
Go.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
The road is broken.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,680
Hurry up.

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,440
Hurry up.

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm Wang Yanzi.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
The commander of the army is 3,000 soldiers.

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,760
You want to build a 2,000-man group.

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,400
Don't put it on the list.

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
The enemy, the army, the road,

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
the enemy is in the military force.

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,760
That's great.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,840
The land we need the most is the war.

71
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,360
Thank you, Comrade Wu.

72
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
The intelligence is available now.

73
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,840
It's available now.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,040
Ding, if we withdraw now,

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
will there be any trouble for you?

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay.

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,280
I said you are young and can't bear the pain.

78
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
You can't take the control.

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,400
You have to go back to the mountains to fight.

80
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
You can be free.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
But it's wrong.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,880
But I just got a report.

83
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,640
You are worried that we will be in trouble.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,520
We will have to solve all the problems.

85
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,640
Once the Red Army is in the air,

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
they will destroy the army.

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
They will destroy the eyes.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
They will be in trouble.

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
And the village salt.

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,160
That is to say, even if we occupy the salt field,

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,240
we will have to go back to the village

92
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
and restore the body.

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,600
It won't be easy for you.

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400
Let the Red Army continue to do business.

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,560
It seems that we can't leave now.

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
At least the big salt field of the three rivers and this daily production.

97
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
We are too familiar.

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,880
Wu.

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,240
Yes.

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
You help me find some good players.

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,440
And make yourself a good dancer.

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,120
Okay.

103
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,120
Old Li.

104
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,160
Take Zhang Side.

105
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,000
You and my son.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
Send the map back to the camp.

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,760
Remember.

108
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,600
You must teach the leader and the instructor.

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes.

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
You have one more task.

111
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,000
You have to spread the salt that is 200 jin away.

112
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,000
No problem.

113
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,720
The rest of you,

114
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
keep your eyes on the salt field.

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,200
Keep the village salt and equipment safe.

116
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,320
Comrades.

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,800
When the gun is fired,

118
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
bring it back to the salt field.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,080
Come in.

120
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,640
Come in.

121
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,560
Come in.

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
Tell the director

123
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,360
to take the salt field within three days.

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
You are so stubborn.

125
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,280
You must come back early.

126
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,680
Stubborn.

127
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
You can't get hurt when you encounter something.

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,120
You must move the old salt field.

129
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,120
Be careful.

130
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,720
You must keep your hands on it.

131
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Remember.

132
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't take too many bullets.

133
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Wait for me.

134
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm sorry, Captain Liu.

135
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,160
What is this?

136
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
You look like a wind.

137
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,240
It's working.

138
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,920
Let's go, Captain Liu.

139
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
You must be smart.

140
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,000
Paraí!

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go.

142
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,440
Go.

143
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,240
Hurry up.

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,960
That guy is...

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
You're too devoted to him.

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
I beg you,

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
The son of a knife.

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
It's him.

149
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
The red army is strong and strong.

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
We have captured several of them.

151
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Li Le Gong is more important than you.

152
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Maybe we can reward him with a better meal.

153
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
We can reward him with a better meal.

154
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Captain Pei.

155
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
The little boy.

156
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
What's wrong?

157
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm sorry, brother.

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm here to pick you up.

159
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Okay.

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I'll take you to the ghost house.

161
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
You're so thoughtful.

162
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm not going to die.

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Be careful, Li Le.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Wait for me to open the door.

165
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Go.

166
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm the boss of the three-year-old.

167
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm a big man.

168
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I can't fight with any red army.

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm Pei.

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Let's go to the cold-headed capital and see what we can do.

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
What's wrong with you, young master?

172
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Don't invite me to dinner.

173
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Otherwise, I won't finish my work.

174
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
It's a good idea.

175
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
You're so stubborn.

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Let's go.

177
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Don't move.

178
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Don't move.

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Don't move.

180
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Don't move.

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't fight.

182
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Don't fight.

183
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Don't fight.

184
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Boss.

185
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
You're the boss.

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Don't lie to me.

187
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm the boss of the three-year-old.

188
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm the boss of the three-year-old.

189
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Pei.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I don't need your money.

191
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Boss.

192
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Tell everyone to take the gun.

193
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
How to talk to them?

194
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Captain Yao.

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I'll take the gun.

196
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Follow me.

197
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
We must fight hard as soon as possible.

198
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
The enemy will be surrounded soon.

199
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
As long as we stay in the battlefield,

200
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
the highest and largest production,

201
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
the enemy will not be that easy to capture the battlefield.

202
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't move.

203
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Don't move.

204
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Don't fight.

205
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Brothers.

206
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Don't shoot.

207
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
We're on the way to attack the commander.

208
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Big brother.

209
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Don't shoot.

212
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,200
Captain Gu.

213
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,640
Li Dahia sentMuscle advertisement for our team.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,880

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200

216
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,320
we currently tomatoes operation in Shandong.

217
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,840
I suppose Li Dahia is also a player in問題.

218
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,400
His caliber is aückenloema.

219
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
It will surely help him soon.

220
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
May I?

221
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,000

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Liu Zi Zi, how did he get out?

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
If he didn't use this car, he would have been in the same place.

226
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Let's go together!

227
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200

I can't go anymore.

231
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
You must teach the camp leader this game.

232
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Go!

233
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200

What is this?

237
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
You can't kill yourself.

238
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
You must protect yourself.

239
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Go!

240
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
They are inside.

246
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I just left the army and came back after the opening.

247
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Da Ya, you control them.

248
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,360
These guys

286
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
is not the best way to defend yourself.

287
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
I want to give you this credit

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
as a contribution to the commander-in-chief.

289
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,480
This is a little bit

290
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,240
of a small deal for you, Hong Jun.

291
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,160
Commander Ming,

292
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,200
if you don't go out,

293
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm afraid you can't get the credit.

294
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm afraid

295
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,080
I'll have to pay for my life.

296
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,120
Fine.

297
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,680
Since you've said so,

298
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,640
I'll go with you to the commander-in-chief.

299
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Come on.

300
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,000
Come on.

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,640
Come on.

306
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,360
Wait.

307
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,880
Commander Jia.

308
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,800
What's wrong?

309
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,960
Commander Jia.

310
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,640
Commander Jia.

311
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Commander Zhang.

312
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,960
You've done a great job.

313
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,520
Commander Jia.

314
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,760
Commander Jia.

315
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
Commander Jia.

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,680
How about this?

317
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,160
You two,

318
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
take him to the medical center.

319
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,120
I'll go to the commander-in-chief.

320
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,880
Yes.

321
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Liu He is a劉 Sheng Qiao from the Han family.

322
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,120
I know you're there.

323
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm Lin Jun Qing.

324
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,800
You'll know me for sure.

325
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,000
As you know,

326
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,080
we're worded.

327
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,680
If this isn't the case,

328
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,660
you'll have nothing left toBI片 or

329
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,400
if you're not scared of death,

330
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,540
you're talking about the former

331
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,840
and you're just doing this?

332
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
I got coming from the south.

333
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,960
Can they believe that you didn't get Bню's order?

334
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
Don't lie.

335
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,940
I have refused to answer,

336
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,500
which means you dropped it too early.

337
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,700
As soon as we get back to Shui rang to kill him.

338
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,360
Yong Perhaps,

339
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,860
he is afraid of what will happen later.

340
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,060
Goodbye.

341
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,280
Be careful.

342
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,080
I'm afraid he is tired.

343
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,180
Tell him to just follow his had prepared right.

344
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,820
We can't keep up with the time.

345
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,340
I'll talk to him.

346
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
We can delay the time.

347
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,460
And maybe there's something else.

348
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,060
If I can't come back,

349
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,860
I'll leave it to my brothers.

350
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,140
Until the last day,

351
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
I'll stick to it.

352
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
We'll wait for him.

353
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,700
I know who you are.

354
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,140
The Red Army reported the murder.

355
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,340
They said I should release you.

356
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,940
But Lin Moran is responsible for it.

357
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,140
Don't worry about it.

358
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Wang Ji killed my father.

359
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,260
He killed the one who killed the princess in the New Year.

360
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,460
Yes.

361
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,460
I love you.

362
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:07,980
Thank you.

363
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,180
So we're finally

364
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
on the same boat.

365
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,180
Yes.

366
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,460
But we don't have any troubles.

367
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,340
The Red Army won't let Wang Ji

368
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,940
do nothing to make a living.

369
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,060
So you don't have to worry about it.

370
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,020
Liu Jingxiang.

371
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,340
Now immediately surrender.

372
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,740
I won't let the commander

373
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,180
and Li Daya's friends.

374
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Listen to me.

375
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,540
As long as you're strong,

376
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,580
I'll take you away.

377
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,020
I'll take you through the border.

378
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,620
Promise me.

379
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,740
Don't come back when you leave.

380
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,140
I want to ask

381
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,380
these Yinglu brothers.

382
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,540
I can only help you.

383
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,100
How can I leave such a big house?

384
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,340
It's your choice.

385
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,900
I can only help you here.

386
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,940
Then you have to give me some time, right?

387
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,900
Even if I can't do it,

388
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,540
I have to discuss with the brothers.

389
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,500
Okay.

390
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,180
Thank you.

391
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,060
I'll take food from Ye구�íanor.

392
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,660
Don't accept an environment of beauty.

393
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,140
I need food first.

394
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,100
I want to settle home with you.

395
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,780
Let's drink a little bit.

396
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,100
Yes.

397
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
I'm sorry.

398
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
You're a little bit long.

399
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,580
I might not be able to do it.

400
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,580
I just want to take you away.

401
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,580
I'm worried about you.

402
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
Okay.

403
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
You're worried?

404
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I'm worried about you.

405
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
Okay.

406
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,580
Dad.

407
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,580
Dad.

408
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
Dad.

409
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Dad.

410
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580
I'll kill you if you want to.

411
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,580
I'll pay you back if you want to.

412
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,580
I'll pay you back if I want to.

413
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,580
I'll die if I want to.

414
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Hurry up!

415
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
Hurry up!

416
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Hurry up!

417
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
We're the Red Army!

418
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
We're the Red Army!

419
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
The Red Army is back!

420
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,580
The Red Army is back!

421
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,580
They're all back.

422
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
You guys!

423
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,580
Get ready to attack!

424
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Yes!

425
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
Li Danyang!

426
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Li Danyang,

427
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
you can't run away.

428
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
You Qingxiang,

429
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
please forgive me.

430
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Please let me go.

431
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,580
Come here.

432
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,580
Do you dare to make a fool of me?

433
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,580
I heard that you Red Army have a good reputation.

434
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,580
You don't want to kill them, do you?

435
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
Li Danyang,

436
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,580
I'll kill you now.

437
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
Brother Niu,

438
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
although we were a little bit too much,

439
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
you hit my teeth.

440
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,580
I don't remember you.

441
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Let me go today, okay?

442
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Brother Niu!

443
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Such a good gun.

444
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
It's a bit sharp.

445
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Brother Niu.

446
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
It's sharp.

447
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Mr. Han,

448
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
we should still be careful.

449
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
There are too many Red Army people.

450
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
We can't be too careful.

451
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,580
You're right.

452
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,580
What are you doing?

453
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
The enemy is coming!

454
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Are you okay?

455
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,580
If you don't come,

456
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
how are you going to get out?

457
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Come on.

458
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
Listen,

459
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
this is our independent group,

460
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Mr. Chen Baoming.

461
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Mr. Lin,

462
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
the third round of the battle,

463
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,580
thank you for your mercy.

464
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,580
Tell me how you want to treat me.

465
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
If you want to stay,

466
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
we welcome you.

467
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
If you want to leave,

468
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
we won't force you to stay.

469
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
What do you think?

470
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
I'm sure to leave.

471
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Okay.

472
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
In Yilong,

473
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
you're the one who reported my murder.

474
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
But the third round of the battle,

475
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
we're out of the game.

476
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
But I lost Nan Buxian

477
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
as a waiter.

478
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,580
It's my great honor.

479
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Next time,

480
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
I'll tell you

481
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
the real-life meeting

482
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
on the battlefield.

483
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Mr. Lin,

484
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
we're a unified army.

485
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
I'm sure of it.

486
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Do you think there's anything wrong?

487
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
What do you mean?

488
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
For the safety of the people of Baoyi,

489
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
for the safety of the people of Baoxiao,

490
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
can you do it?

491
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Okay.

492
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Do you know that

493
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,580
the Japanese are in the northeast of the East,

494
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,580
and the war in the second month of this year

495
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
is near now?

496
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
The Japanese are fighting for the country

497
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,580
to fight for the country.

498
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,580
The Japanese have been living in the north.

499
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,580
The Japanese are not the same age.

500
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
We're a unified army.

501
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
We must fight for the country

502
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,580
to fight for the country.

503
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
Do you think so?

504
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Mr. Zhang.

505
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Yes.

506
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
As the Red Army,

507
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
what's the chance?

508
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
Mr. Gao,

509
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
the Japanese are not the same age.

510
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
They can fight for the country.

511
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
The Japanese are not the same age.

512
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Okay.

513
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
See you.

514
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Yes.

515
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
What he said

516
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
is the fact that the Red Army

517
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
is the only one.

518
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Because of this fact,

519
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
we never thought about it.

520
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
We didn't care about the failure of the Japanese.

521
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Because we are the first to wake up,

522
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
to win,

523
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
to win.

524
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,580
And you

525
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
are the second to kill.

526
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
If you have a conscience,

527
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
I hope you can be so clear.

528
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
Please.

529
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,360
Emperor Li fautong Xichao

530
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:40,660
izes to seek revenge against Yan

531
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,740
What is this noise?

532
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,060
Those spoons are like diving into fish eggs.

533
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,420
So!

534
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,700
I only watch the older kids in room.

535
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,220
If they take into亲, we want to eat,

536
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,460
watch the younger kids now,

537
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,700
and enjoy it like historical movies.

538
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,940
Does it mean that we don't care to teach them us?

539
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,820
Didn't they expect that we could not throw it?

540
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,700
Good.

541
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
Good.

542
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,340
Good.

543
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,980
Get ready.

544
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,540
Get ready.

545
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,420
I'm going to have a meeting.

546
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,980
OK.

547
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,580
OK.

548
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,300
Mr. Zhang.

549
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,300
Come here.

550
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,380
You're awake.

551
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,140
If you don't bring the luggage back,

552
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,860
I might be in a group.

553
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,060
I might not be able to go to the hospital in time.

554
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,900
If I do,

555
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,620
I might not be able to go to the hospital.

556
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,460
Good.

557
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,540
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

558
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,260
Mr. Li.

559
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,700
I heard you're a good fighter.

560
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,900
You're a good fighter in the war.

561
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,100
I'm not talking about that.

562
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm the one who's in charge of this.

563
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,700
So, Mr. Tang said

564
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,180
I'm the one who's in charge of this.

565
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,780
You're the one who's in charge of this.

566
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Since you're a good fighter,

567
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,580
you're the one who's in charge of this.

568
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,300
Yes.

569
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,660
Come on. Get ready to have a meeting.

570
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,260
OK.

571
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,860
Mr. Li, you're still a good fighter.

572
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,180
We're not good fighters.

573
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,060
You're a good fighter.

574
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,180
Let's have a look.

575
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,060
No.

576
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,340
Hey,

577
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,580
let's have a talk.

578
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,180
What do you want?

579
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,700
I want to have a Han Yang Zhao.

580
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,660
Your Han Yang Zhao is a long story.

581
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,260
You've been in the Han Yang Zhao

582
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,740
for a long time.

583
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
What's wrong with you?

584
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
Han Lopan,

585
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,180
Gu Wazi is the man in our camp.

586
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,540
Tomorrow, Mr. Tang will see

587
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,420
his gun.

588
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:45,980
Ask Gu Wazi.

589
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,060
He'll tell you.

590
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,780
Tell him?

591
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,300
Mr. Zhang, where's your gun?

592
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,980
It's in the black shop.

593
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,700
Why is it in the black shop?

594
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,860
He said he wanted to change it.

595
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,100
Why?

596
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
Because he wants to be a man in the shop.

597
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,460
Then, go ask Han Lopan

598
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,860
if he can't afford his own leg.

599
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,900
Why?

600
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,220
Because I want to

601
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,580
give him his leg.

602
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,420
Go.

603
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Go.

604
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,260
Go.

605
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,500
Go.

606
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,980
Go.

607
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,300
Who are you?

608
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,140
You beat me.

609
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,220
You beat me.

610
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,940
Go.

611
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,660
Get up.

612
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,460
Yan An Chao is a fighter.

613
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,020
Your performance is very good.

614
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,940
So,

615
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,020
I'll show you the overall performance.

616
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,980
How's it?

617
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,860
You two are the first and last.

618
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,100
Come on.

619
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,820
Go.

620
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,380
Go.

621
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,100
You don't want to write it?

622
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,300
It's okay.

623
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,620
You can write down

624
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,260
the words you want to write.

625
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,060
Yes.

626
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,780
Do you want to write your own name?

627
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
Yes.

628
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Yan An Chao is a fighter.

629
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,820
You can write your own name.

630
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,980
Go.

631
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,100
Go.

632
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Go.

633
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,260
Go.

634
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Go.

635
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,140
Go.

636
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,100
Go.

637
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Go.

638
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Go.

639
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Go.

640
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Go.

641
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Go.

642
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Go.

643
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Go.

644
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Go.

645
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Go.

646
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Go.

647
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Go.

648
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Go.

649
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Go.

650
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Go.

651
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Go.

652
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Go.

653
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Go.

654
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Go.

655
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,500
Your aunt and your mother

656
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,420
wanted to give you this name.

657
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,860
My mother

658
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,980
passed away on my 7 month watching watch.

659
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
I gave her the radial fame

660
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,340
my dad gave me chocolateritol.

661
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,340
I kept forcing my parents to give me

662
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,820
bubble with me

663
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,140
at her old home.

664
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,260
I was pretty grown up.

665
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,300
My mother said

666
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,660
don't forget

667
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,100
my ダわナペダ

668
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,780
OK.

669
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,180
But the only thing that can do is to write a few words.

670
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,980
I don't think I can do it.

671
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,180
I have to say to those who are more wise than you,

672
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,780
I am the one who will protect you.

673
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,180
But to those who are more kind to you,

674
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,980
to those who make you live a better life,

675
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,980
to those who make you live a more meaningful life,

676
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,180
you are also the one who will give you a lot of grace.

677
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,780
Who are they?

678
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,380
They are Hong Jun.

679
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,380
They are the Hong Jun of the Communist Party.

680
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,380
You will not only be the leader of the party,

681
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,980
but also learn to ask questions and advice.

682
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,180
Learn to give people a chance to know that I am the Hong Jun of the Communist Party.

683
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,580
I am the leader of the Communist Party.

684
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,980
That way, you will become a better Communist.

685
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,380
President, I am the only one who can make the Han family a master.

686
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,780
Let me teach them later.

687
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,980
Let me see.

688
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,380
Come.

689
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,380
Sister Song.

690
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,380
You are so kind.

691
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,380
The legend has already developed Lianning School.

692
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,780
President Zhu decided to go to Shenzao for a visit.

693
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,380
Shenzao?

694
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,780
What's the name of the three children?

695
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,380
Lianning School.

696
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Lianning School.

697
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Lianning School.

698
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Lianning School.

699
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,380
You just reported it, right?

700
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,380
Yes.

701
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,580
Which one is wrong?

702
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,980
The one who won the independence group.

703
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,780
Show me the introduction.

704
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,380
You are Zhang Side?

705
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,780
I also said that you are not a new soldier.

706
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,380
Don't be so bold.

707
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,380
I heard from your team leader.

708
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,780
You know our team leader?

709
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,780
You just came here.

710
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,980
This is not your team.

711
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,380
I hope you can be a good leader.

712
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,380
I hope you can be a good leader.

713
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,380
I hope you can get familiar with your team leader.

714
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
Get into the situation.

715
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,380
Xiaoxiang.

716
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,380
Here.

717
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,380
President Chen.

718
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,380
Arrange them to give the gun to the library.

719
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,380
Then take them to the separate class.

720
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,380
Yes.

721
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
Follow me.

722
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Go.

723
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,380
Yes.

724
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
Give me the gun.

725
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,380
Give me the gun.

726
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
The independence group.

727
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,380
One, two, one, two.

728
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
And the newspaper.

729
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Give me the gun.

730
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
The independence group.

731
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,380
One, two, one, two.

732
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
And the newspaper.

733
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Excuse me.

734
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Can you give me the gun?

735
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,380
It's a private newspaper.

736
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,380
You can come to the library when the gun is on the stage.

737
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,380
I will.

738
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
You are all Changsheng's students.

739
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
I am the second-class student here.

740
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,380
Liao Xiaoxiang.

741
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,380
I am the third-class student here.

742
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380

I am the fifth-class student here.

746
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

747
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

748
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

749
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

750
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

751
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

752
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

753
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

754
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

755
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

756
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

757
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

758
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
I am the fifth-class student here.

759
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
I am the fifth-class student here.
