1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
The Which Is Yours

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,000
I'd like to call Zhang自己

3
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,000
flies

4
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,540
Once again

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Is Hongjun sent?

6
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,500
Mengen

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,020
I really hope

8
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,060
Lam save you

9
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,420
your every detour

10
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,020
5th但是

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Thank you, young master.

12
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Let us go.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,160
Are you a rich person?

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,500
Old man.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
Su Feng.

16
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,220
Don't forget our position at the domain.

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,800
What's that?

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Stay here

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,320
when you're in joy

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,160
Little Horse

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,200
Little Horse

22
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,920
Don't be afraid of helpingady to you.

23
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
Put down the weapon.

24
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
You must seal his mouth first.

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,120
Don't let him in.

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
If so,

27
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Spare blood again.

28
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
And soon,

29
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,000
be a nobody and help him.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
Hurry.

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Hurry.

32
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Let's go.

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Brother.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,580
That dateade will always be лишia.

35
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,260
And Tia...?

36
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,220
You will never tell me.

37
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,960
You are pregnant?

38
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,600
No.

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,300
I already have a baby.

40
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,100
My mom is gone.

41
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,220
If something happens,

42
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,320
I can still give birth.

43
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,540
Ah.

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,080
Just listen to me, Fatty Kang

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,100
I've made all know

46
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,720
this world is too cold

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,720
Our family

48
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,500
co-op

49
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,600
OK

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,160
Can you heal me

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
Mummy

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,240
How are your back pain?

53
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,220
OK

54
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
Your back pains

55
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,060
OK

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,840
Incredible

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
It's fine

58
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,960
I walk alone

59
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
And you小心

60
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,600
My hands are large

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Okay.

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,640
I'll leave you, okay?

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Lady Jun?

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
What would be your problem?

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
That's why I invited you through.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
How?

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
I was afraid of being alone.

68
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,160
I was really afraid of being alone.

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
I remember when we were little,

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
we used to go to the lake together.

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,960
iba is Playing so ему

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Ichi's a little strange.

73
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,460
When we were in the boats,

74
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
we met the big things,

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,280
plus a book火沙

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,160
I didn't know

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,900
I'm sorry you.

78
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
I neither Leé, nor uncle c게요.

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,840
I'm so tired.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,840
Why are you crying?

81
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm not going to search again.

82
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,560
It's not a search.

83
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,840
There's a big deal.

84
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,240
Really?

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
Yes.

86
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,680
It was all recorded from the entrance.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,240
Then it was dropped.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
Then I could see the whole hat.

89
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,720
I think there are about 300 people on the mountain.

90
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,560
I think there are two hundred guns.

91
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
There's a house on the left

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,720
from the entrance.

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,000
It's over 10 meters high.

94
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,360
There are ten windows.

95
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
There are two windows on the hill.

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
There are two guns.

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
It's different from the other guns.

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
It's a big gun.

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,280
There's a house on the right side of the door.

100
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,160
It's over five meters high.

101
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
There are five windows.

102
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
There are two windows on the hill.

103
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,360
There are also two big guns.

104
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
My god.

105
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,320
Wang Ji is so lucky.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
My son.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
It's hard for you.

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
You remember it so clearly.

109
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Aren't you afraid?

110
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
I'm afraid to death.

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
But I have a way.

112
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,440
I put all my attention on one thing.

113
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
I remember it so hard.

114
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm not afraid either.

115
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm dead.

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,240
Fortunately, there are no war.

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Otherwise, these guns and guns

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
will be in the hands of the Red Army.

119
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,800
Chief.

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,000
Actually, we must go in from the front door.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is there any other way?

122
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,640
Yes.

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,320
Where?

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,440
In the climbing forest.

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,480
Chief.

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,200
Go up from here.

127
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
Then you can go into the city.

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,520
But it's so steep.

129
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
Who can go up?

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,880
When I was a kid,

131
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,480
I often went to the mountain with my dad.

132
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
I went up first.

133
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Then I gave you a rope.

134
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,360
I also said that

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,320
this mountain looks scary.

136
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,200
In fact, I caught a lot of enemies.

137
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
When the mountain is big,

138
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,400
they will climb over me.

139
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
If Gu Azi takes someone to climb up,

140
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,280
and goes into the village,

141
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,160
we will be in trouble.

142
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Our comrades will definitely think about it.

143
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,080
Chief Han.

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
I want to ask you a question.

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,520
Go ahead.

146
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,240
We just go in like this.

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,080
They won't kill the old man, right?

148
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,160
No.

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,960
Black Pan is Wang Ji's hostage.

150
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
He dare not move.

151
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,520
As long as we quickly control the bag,

152
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,800
within half an hour,

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
Black Pan will definitely be fine.

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,320
Okay.

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,360
Let's hurry up.

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,320
Otherwise,

157
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
we will be in trouble again.

158
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,800
No.

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,920
To complete this task,

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,120
we also need a deep and precise

161
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,400
and brave man to lead the team.

162
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,120
I heard that there is a big battle.

163
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
I will go back quickly.

164
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,120
Uncle.

165
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
How is the task completed?

166
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,320
I have already taken over the head of the underground party

167
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
with the south line.

168
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,520
They have now started to develop

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
and progress in various fields.

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,320
Prepare to cooperate with the Red Army.

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
I also brought a few gold Yan back.

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
I have already handed it to the commander.

173
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,920
Okay.

174
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Okay.

175
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,520
By the way,

176
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
I originally asked you to come back.

177
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
I asked you to go to the capital city station

178
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
to check the situation.

179
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
But there are a few tiles

180
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
that have been removed for you.

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,280
I have already cleaned up the situation inside for you.

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,280
Wang Tang Meng.

183
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
You said that the team is suspicious of Wang Ji.

184
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Why are you still suspicious?

185
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,280
The team is doing this as if it were a battle.

186
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,480
If Wang Ji comes to attack the six-way station,

187
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,480
we can wait for him to take over the power

188
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,080
of the two-way merchant.

189
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,680
If Wang Ji can't be returned as soon as possible,

190
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
then we can be completely sure

191
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,520
that he is the murderer who killed the Lin family.

192
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,840
By then, we will turn around and attack the capital city station.

193
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,440
