1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,160
自己

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,700
My name is Zhang Junle

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,740
Always one

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,900
The sky is one become more suddenly

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm afraid I'll be late.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
I'll go to the temple.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,900
I'll go to the temple.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,900
I'll go to the temple.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,900
I'll go to the temple.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
I'll go to the temple.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,900
I'll go to the temple.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,900
I'll go to the temple.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,900
I'll go to the temple.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,900
I'll go to the temple.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,900
I'll go to the temple.

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,900
I'll go to the temple.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
I'll go to the temple.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,900
I'll go to the temple.

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
I'll go to the temple.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
I'll go to the temple.

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
I'll go to the temple.

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
I'll go to the temple.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,900
I'll go to the temple.

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
I'll go to the temple.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
I'll go to the temple.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
I'll go to the temple.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,900
I'll go to the temple.

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
I'll go to the temple.

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
I'll go to the temple.

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
I'll go to the temple.

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
I'll go to the temple.

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I'll go to the temple.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,900
I'll go to the temple.

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,900
I'll go to the temple.

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
I'll go to the temple.

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
I'll go to the temple.

37
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,900
I'll go to the temple.

38
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
I'll go to the temple.

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,900
I'll go to the temple.

40
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
I'll go to the temple.

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,900
To the temple.

42
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
When the Amulet came out,

43
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
You are the books of the three of them.

44
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Okay. Since it's a book,

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,900
you are the elder.

46
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,900
The elder will do the same.

47
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
You need to take the model to do it.

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

49
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,900
You are the one who has the talent.

50
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
I'm good at acting.

51
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,900
You are smart.

52
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,900
You are good at acting.

53
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
But it's not good to be good at acting.

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
You are also lacking in acting.

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
You are good at acting.

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,900
You are good at acting.

57
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
You are good at acting.

58
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
You have skills in acting.

59
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Remember.

60
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Don't play smart with me.

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
You are good at acting.

62
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
You are good at acting.

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,900
You are good at acting.

64
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
You are good at acting.

65
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
You are good at acting.

66
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
But remember.

67
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Don't cry anymore in the future.

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Yes.

69
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Even if you cry,

70
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
you can't use your military uniform to hide your nose.

71
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Yes.

72
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Zhang Si Tu.

73
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
Yes.

74
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
You dare to be brave and be good at acting.

75
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
It means you have faith in yourself.

76
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
And you are very firm and loyal.

77
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
I believe you are a good person.

78
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
But,

79
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
in the future,

80
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,900
don't be brainwashed.

81
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Be brave and be good at acting.

82
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,900
Understand?

83
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,900
Yes.

84
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
If you want to be a good person,

85
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
you have to be brave.

86
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
How is it?

87
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Are these soldiers good?

88
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Zhang Si Tu.

89
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
He is a good student.

90
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes.

91
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,900
Commander Chen.

92
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
This is our treasure.

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Don't try to get away from me.

94
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Commander.

95
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
What's the situation?

96
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Did you find out?

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
The old men left the town early this morning.

98
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
They are not coming back now.

99
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,900
What's the matter?

100
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
I am going to fight against you.

101
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
I am going to fight against you.

102
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
Now, I am sure that

103
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
I am going to die.

104
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
All of you.

105
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Jiang Qian Tan.

106
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Commander.

107
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Comrades.

108
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,900
I have a new task for you.

109
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Commander.

110
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Who is going to fight against him?

111
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Who is going to fight against him?

112
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Who is going to fight against him?

113
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
I have never fought against him.

114
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
I am going to fight against him.

115
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
I am going to die.

116
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,900
Yes.

117
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Send the things to them.

118
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,900
What are you doing?

119
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
Commander.

120
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
This is for the knife.

121
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,900
We are going to shoot.

122
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
We are going to shoot.

123
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
We are going to shoot.

124
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
We are going to shoot.

125
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
All of you.

126
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Get ready for the new face.

127
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Yes.

128
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
It turns out that the old people are so early.

129
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
They are making fun of the old people.

130
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
I told them that I am going to work here.

131
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
You are not going to the battlefield.

132
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
I thought that I would not have to work here.

133
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Commander.

134
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Commander.

135
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Commander.

136
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
We are here.

137
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Yes.

138
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Commander.

139
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
That's right.

140
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
He is the commander of the army.

141
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Commander Chen.

142
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
No.

143
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Commander is a big officer.

144
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,900
He is a big officer.

145
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
He is a big officer.

146
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,900
He is a big officer.

147
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
He should not be in the room.

148
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Or he will not be able to walk.

149
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
He should be in the room.

150
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
He should be in the room.

151
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,900
I don't know.

152
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,900
I tell you.

153
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
In our Red Army.

154
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Whether it is a officer or a soldier.

155
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
They are all the same.

156
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
I see.

157
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Come on.

158
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's do it.

159
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
Come on.

160
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Come on.

161
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Be careful.

162
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Don't let others imitate your trick.

163
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Cut.

164
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Don't need to polish them.

165
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
spraying more���

166
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,020
Those are not bad.

167
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
That is not good.

168
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
We should cover them.

169
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Come on.

170
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm sure you're the leader.

171
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
I'm the leader.

172
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I've tried before.

173
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm the leader.

174
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,900
We've tried ice.

175
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I believe that the fruit has this effect.

176
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
I said you're really a human.

177
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
I believe you just look at it.

178
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Are you done?

179
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm afraid that I can't stand it.

180
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
I have to take care of it.

181
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Tangcao,

182
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
how about drinking some water?

183
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Okay.

184
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Take a rest.

185
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Let's go to the water.

186
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Okay.

187
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Xiao Wozi,

188
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
let's go to the water.

189
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Yes.

190
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
You're so generous.

191
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
You're so generous.

192
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Please go.

193
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
Tangcao,

194
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
you're so generous.

195
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Are you the leader?

196
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Our leader,

197
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
he's the leader of the household.

198
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
He's the leader of the household.

199
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
He's the leader of the household.

200
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Then,

201
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
you're the leader of the household.

202
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm the leader.

203
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
I'm the leader of the household.

204
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
I've worked hard for the country.

205
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,900
I've worked hard for the country.

206
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
What's your name?

207
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm the only one

208
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
who has ever been to a private house

209
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
in the country.

210
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
My name is Zhang Xingfa.

211
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,900
I'm their uncle.

212
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
I don't want to do it.

213
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Chief, I'm Pan Xiaocai.

214
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
He's called Niu Wazi.

215
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
And I'm the one

216
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
who joined

217
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
the family with the old man.

218
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
His name is Gu Wazi.

219
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
His name is Zhang Side.

220
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
You're so smart.

221
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
You're a great man.

222
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Chief,

223
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
I have a question for you.

224
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Go ahead.

225
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
The director said

226
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
that we're far from

227
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
the real Red Army.

228
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
What's the real Red Army?

229
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm asking you.

230
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Do you welcome the Red Army

231
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
in the old people?

232
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
I know.

233
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Because

234
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
the people of Red Army

235
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
received the news.

236
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm sure it's not

237
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
the Red Army

238
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
who gave the land to the people of the land

239
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
to the old people.

240
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Actually,

241
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
the country is like a book.

242
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
The country is like a coin.

243
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
The people

244
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,900
have no good intentions

245
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
to be the soldiers.

246
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,900
The Red Army

247
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
is different from the army

248
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
in the old days.

249
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,900
The biggest thing

250
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
is how to treat the old people.

251
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
The Red Army

252
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
is a great leader.

253
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
It's a good leader.

254
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
It's not a line of the people.

255
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Treat the people

256
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
as your own family.

257
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
In this way,

258
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
the people will trust us.

259
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
They will sell the food

260
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
to us and give the children to us.

261
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
They will support the Red Army

262
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
in the new land.

263
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
So,

264
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
the Red Army

265
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
is the real Red Army.

266
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
It's the Red Army

267
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
who can really

268
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
protect the old people.

269
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Red, red, blue,

270
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
the mountain is too strong.

271
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,900
The young people are like the sky.

272
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Who can

273
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
protect the old people?

274
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,900
They will sacrifice their lives.

275
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Red, red, blue,

276
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
the mountain is too strong.

277
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Who can

278
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,900
protect the old people?

279
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
It's the Red Army

280
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,900
who can really protect the old people.

281
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
We will attack the Red Army

282
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
today.

283
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
You will be shot

284
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
by bullets.

285
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Remember

286
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
bullets are very precious.

287
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,460
Ta-da!

288
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
Zhiyou,

289
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,260
Great.

290
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,980
Give me the positions from now on.

291
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,960
Xu the Military Lieutenant.

292
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,140
Get to the position of Senior鹊.

293
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,780
I'm not expecting any honor from you to represent here.

294
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,020
I'm so excited to perform this ceremony.

295
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,180
Enjoy the meal yourself.

296
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Zhang Si Ze!

297
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Yes!

298
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
How did you hit him?

299
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Let me tell you.

300
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
One shot in the air.

301
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
The enemy has more chances to shoot you.

302
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Bring the poison to the egg.

303
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Practice.

304
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Yes.

305
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Zhang Si Ze.

306
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
You're smart.

307
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
You're kind.

308
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
You're brave.

309
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
You're not bad.

310
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
You can't defeat me with your heart.

311
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
I'll shoot you long time.

312
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Zhang Si Ze.

313
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Zhang Si Ze.

314
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Air gun.

315
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Did you see that?

316
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
The gun is...

317
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
It's...

318
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Let me see.

319
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll shoot you long time later.

320
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I'll shoot you when I'm free.

321
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
I'll shoot you when I'm free.

322
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
You're smart.

323
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900

Very.

328
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Thank you.

329
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Friendly συільки.

330
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
I can't beat you yet.

331
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Who will you beat down?

332
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm here from Dagmahorne.

333
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
I'm here for the Bellw whether you should beat me or not.

334
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Xiao Ming.

335
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Get out!

336
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,700
Don't fly!

337
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,300
In the months after day,

338
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,300
in the mountains."

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,700
Soulhood has become basic in a long and fanciful life."

340
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,700
deciron, let us and you hold company.

341
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:41,780
In the

342
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,260
I'll love you forever.

343
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:54,060
I can't help but love you so much.

344
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,980
I'm afraid that the fate I know doesn't live for me.

345
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,460
After leaving the Red Prefecture and returning from our,

346
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,960
we didn't have much time forinfAutumn festival.

347
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,960
The research is daily necessities.

348
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,960
It's not comparable to the usual factory.

349
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,960
The red zone is heavily attracted to the outside world.

350
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
The red zone is extremely close to the outside world.

351
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,960
The other side is less famous.

352
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
It's extremely crowded.

353
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,960
But the goods are very limited.

354
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Gu Zi has become the first serious problem in the red zone.

355
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,960
There are always so few people who are not afraid to die.

356
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
They secretly sneak out.

357
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,960
We must be careful.

358
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Let those red zone soldiers have a little bit of suspicion.

359
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Beat them to death.

360
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Yes.

361
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Father, mother.

362
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
You're not coming?

363
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm not coming.

364
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
You're really here.

365
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
You haven't come home for 11 years.

366
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,960
We thought you were not with me.

367
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
What have you done wrong?

368
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
You've been here for so many years.

369
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
You're not coming home.

370
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Mother.

371
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
It's my fault.

372
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Captain Tan, you asked me to bring his clothes.

374
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
There's salt in it.

375
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Let me see.

376
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Captain Tan, I didn't find salt in the clothes.

377
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Wait and see.

378
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
It's been a long time.

379
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,960
里

380
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Fatty, it has salt in it.

381
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Did you find salt?

382
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
That's great.

383
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,960
The food is salty and tasty at home.

384
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Alright.

385
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Good message.

386
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,560
Yes.

387
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,320
Mr. Lin.

388
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,200
President Lin has left Changxi

389
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,360
to the south.

390
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,200
He has been in charge of the south for ten thousand years.

391
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
He has been in charge of the south for ten thousand years.

392
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,760
You are here.

393
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,600
We will have a lot of work to do.

394
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,680
I should.

395
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,320
Come on.

396
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,040
Let me introduce you.

397
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,320
These are all our

398
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,360
four major businessmen in the south.

399
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,680
These are the four major businessmen.

400
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,360
Mr. Qian, Qian Binduo.

401
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Mr. Qian.

402
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
President Lin.

403
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,560
We all support you.

404
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,360
I dare not.

405
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,680
Protect the police and lock up the military.

406
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,160
We should work together.

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,560
Look.

408
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,880
Everyone is drinking very closely.

409
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,520
I will drink with you.

410
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:45,960
Okay.

411
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
I really admire you.

412
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
I admire you very much.

413
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
You turn from Changxi to the south.

414
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,960
You are so good.

415
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Mr. Ning.

416
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,960
I have some work to do.

417
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,960
I'm sorry.

418
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
I can't be free.

419
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
President Lin.

420
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,360
President Lin.

421
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,960
President Lin.

422
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,960
President Lin.

423
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
You stay here for a while.

424
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,960
You are so drunk.

425
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
You are so bright.

426
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
Don't worry.

427
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,360
Look.

428
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
Yi Long is dead.

429
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,360
Your group is in Changxi.

430
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
He can let you

431
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,760
do something good.

432
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,560
The most exciting team in Yangshen Army

433
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,160
is the second group.

434
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
The leader of the second group,

435
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
Li Xiaoxin.

436
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,560
You are the senior in the Su Chen Group.

437
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,760
In the future,

438
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,560
you will be able to

439
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,760
be rich and wealthy.

440
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,960
President Lin.

441
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,160
I will be able to

442
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,560
take care of you.

443
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,760
President Ning.

444
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,160
We will cooperate together.

445
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,760
Goodbye.

446
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
The problem of the food supply

447
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,760
is related to the people's physical strength.

448
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,560
It is related to the battle of the Red Army.

449
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
It is related to the survival of the land

450
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,560
and the development of the river.

451
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
This is a strategic problem.

452
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,560
From the year of the 28th,

453
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,560
the party is in the south border of Guangda.

454
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,560
Can we cooperate with them

455
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,160
to unite and guard the river?

456
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Is this strategy

457
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
the key to winning?

458
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,160
Make way.

459
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,760
Make way!

460
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,960
Back off.

461
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm firing.

462
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,260
Did you calm down?

463
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,760
The 화는!

464
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,760
The 화는!

465
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I heard you.

466
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,360
Han Yuhua, Jiuhun, Zhang Yufang, Jiuhun, Zhang Siqiang.

467
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,760
Baohun!

468
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,760
I have new cloth.

469
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
I can do it.

470
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Go to the tower!

471
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,560
Yaojun!

472
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
The King of the World

473
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Shi Huan!

474
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
You are all in the same boat.

475
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Zhibin, I like Zhang Siqiang.

476
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,560
You want to take him as a colleague?

477
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,160
Why are you here again?

478
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,360
Why do you always hit me?

479
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,560
Let me tell you, we win, anyone can win.

480
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,360
Zhang Siqiang can't.

481
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,960
I won't tell you.

482
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,960
Be careful.

483
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,360
Zhang Siqiang, do you want to be a colleague?

484
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,360
Let me tell you, the victory of the comrades will be very important.

485
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,760
The main task is to report the important information on the battlefield,

486
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,360
and some important instructions to the various teams.

487
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Are you going to the regiment?

488
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,960
Are you the treasure of our Changsheng Camp?

489
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,760
What's wrong? You want to go to the regiment?

490
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,360
I don't want to go. I just want to stay in Changsheng Camp.

491
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
I don't want to go.

492
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
I don't want to see your face.

493
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,760
Please forgive me.

494
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Go.

495
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,160
Manager Lu,

496
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,880
Why must we worship the popular government?

497
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I am right.

498
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
onte,

499
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,780
I hope you can become a brave military soldier

500
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,360
like them in the future.

501
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,040
What are you suffering from?

502
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,780
رف

503
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,000
Are you taking it as a serious son,

504
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,720
What's wrong?

505
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,840
He's a member of the group.

506
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,720
He stays here as a member of the group.

507
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,840
Two things.

508
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,600
Right?

509
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,680
Yes, Gu Wazi.

510
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,560
The leader asked you personally.

511
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,600
What do you think?

512
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,320
I...

513
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,160
I just want to be with you.

514
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,600
You've done so many things for the people.

515
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,560
Didn't you waste it?

516
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,520
Why?

517
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,240
We're the Red Army soldiers.

518
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,680
The leader said

519
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,320
the real Red Army soldiers

520
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,520
should be called the leader's surname

521
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,080
in the heart of the people.

522
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,560
Leader.

523
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,200
Brother.

524
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,760
Brother Liu.

525
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,640
Leader Liu.

526
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,920
Did he sleep well?

527
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,600
No.

528
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,640
Let's have a look.

529
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,360
What's so good about it?

530
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,720
Leader, this is a case of

531
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
what we usually talk about.

532
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,360
Let me tell you.

533
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,560
These four

534
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,240
are the precious brothers of our Xinmili Company.

535
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,160
You should stay with me.

536
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,160
Don't worry, Leader.

537
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,640
They're very close.

538
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,200
They're very close.

539
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,040
They're my best friends.

540
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,240
You mean we're the men?

541
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,920
Qin Fang.

542
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
So you're very important.

543
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,000
You must

544
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,040
move your smart mind

545
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,120
in the future.

546
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,840
Do you understand?

547
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,320
Yes.

548
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
One and a half years.

549
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't hold it.

550
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,600
Tomorrow morning,

551
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,040
change the clothes of the people

552
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,080
and start the mission.

553
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,280
Yes.

554
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,680
Leader Liu.

555
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,240
Where are we going?

556
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,200
South line.

557
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,080
Let's go.

558
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,760
Where are you from?

559
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm from the county.

560
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,440
Let's go.

561
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Stop.

562
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,800
I'm sorry for your face.

563
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,600
Where are you from?

564
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,000
Yilong.

565
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,960
Get up.

566
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,800
Come on.

567
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,920
Go.

568
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,000
Why are you looking for me?

569
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,720
Go.

570
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't touch my son.

571
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,200
Don't touch my son.

572
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,520
I'm a weirdo.

573
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,760
This is more scary than the Golden City.

574
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm afraid that

575
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,400
I'll get drunk.

576
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,360
Don't forget

577
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,520
the Golden City

578
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,480
where we went last time.

579
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,960
Go.

580
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,720
Go.

581
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,320
Go.

582
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,040
Go.

583
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,840
Go.

584
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,800
Go.

585
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,720
Come on.

586
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,440
Let's go home.

587
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,800
Let's use the blood pressure to make a call.

588
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Go.

589
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,320
I will.

590
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,840
Come on.

591
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,360
What's the matter?

592
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,000
Is it Ding?

593
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,440
's brother and sister?

594
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,200
It's me.

595
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,820
Chief Steward talking up.

596
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,800
Nianjing.

597
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,640
What a great Youtube guys.

598
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,120
The bloody men

599
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,200
are watching us.

600
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,160
They came here sooner.

601
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
You've worked hard.

602
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,680
No.

603
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,720
Brother,

604
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,920

605
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,080

606
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,280
見 subject?

607
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,580
I don't know plainly

608
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,800
that it was really hard to get in.

609
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,480
Any way breaks?

610
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
Comrades, follow me.

611
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,680
Hurry, I'll go this way.

612
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,280
What are you doing?

613
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
A young man is making a fuss.

614
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,880
A dog is making a fuss.

615
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
His side is a dog.

616
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,080
A dog is making a fuss.

617
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
He's hiding in a pile.

618
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,680
You two are so big.

619
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,280
You're so stupid.

620
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,480
Let's go.

621
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,080
All the other roads are blocked.

622
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,880
Only this way can pass.

623
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,880
There are patrol teams on the mountain.

624
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,080
The wind and rain lines are very strict.

625
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,880
We have to register in the first floor.

626
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
When we get out, there are two people.

627
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
We have to have two people when we get back.

628
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
You have to send me a small tent.

629
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,280
I'll take the small Ding.

630
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,280
I'll take the small Ding and take you to the road.

631
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,480
All right.

632
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,880
You and Ding will go later.

633
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Okay?

634
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Take care.

635
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,680
Is this it?

636
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,880
Yes, this is it.

637
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,280
This railway has been here for a long time.

638
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,280
When you pass later, you must try it.

639
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,680
Miss Liu, three more stitches.

640
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Okay.

641
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's go.

642
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Ding, you two.

643
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,280
Yes, we're here.

644
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,880
Be careful.

645
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
I'll go first.

646
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
Miss Liu.

647
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
I'll go first.

648
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
If your mother falls,

649
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,880
no one will take them.

650
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Brother.

651
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I'll go.

652
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Don't forget how I got the rope.

653
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
He's gone.

654
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,880
The rope is already gone.

655
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
What are you doing?

656
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Boss, we went out to get a relative.

657
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
We registered.

658
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
How many people?

659
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Two people.

660
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Come here.

661
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Is it him who went out last night?

662
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Yes, it's him.

663
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
How can I remember that

664
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
the child who went out last night didn't wear long-sleeved shirts?

665
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
The relative's condition is not bad.

666
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
After sending the child to see the long-sleeved shirt,

667
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
the child's mood has been changed.

668
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
I think it's better to wear it.

669
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
I think it's better to wear it.

670
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
I think it's better to wear it.

671
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
I think it's better to wear it.

672
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I think it's better to wear it.

673
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
The child's mood has been changed.

674
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,880
The relative's condition is not bad.

675
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
It's not bad.

676
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
You've worked hard.

677
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Let's go.

678
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Thank you, boss.

679
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Go, go, go.

680
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
It's said that every Hong Yun soldier

681
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,880
has a deep hatred for him.

682
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Brother Liu, we're going to revenge.

683
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Brother, let them fight.

684
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
We're going to revenge.

685
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
We must revenge.

686
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
This is the most important thing we have now.

687
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Think about it.

688
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
I remember this name.

689
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Captain Liu.

690
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Lei.

691
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Go.

692
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
You're wearing a beautiful dress.

693
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Come back at 10 o'clock.

694
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Don't forget me.

695
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Brother Liu.

696
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Brother Liu.

697
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Brother Liu.

698
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Fall down, fall down.

699
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,880
There are 28 factories in this river.

700
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,880
This is the largest and the closest to the northernmost.

701
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
It's the closest to the one we have.

702
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,880
And this one factory has 52 factories.

703
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
128 factories.

704
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Brother Liu.

705
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,880
How many factories can you produce a day?

706
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
About 900 to 1000.

707
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Mr. Wang.

708
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Good boy.

709
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,880
It's been eight months since we last met.

710
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Great.

711
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I don't know the mission.

712
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
We're here to split up.

713
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Wang,

714
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Zhao, Cheng and Song.

715
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
You two are going to the old house.

716
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Go to Yuanba, Anba, Xiehe and Beiyuan.

717
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Go to the research area.

718
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
The point is to find out

719
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,880
the local residents and the terrain.

720
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
You also have to contact the local secret council

721
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
and the business community.

722
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Fight for it.

723
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Let them cooperate with us.

724
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
I'll make a deal with you in three days.

725
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Is that enough?

726
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Yes.

727
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I'll take you to the director

728
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
after three days.

729
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Got it?

730
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Yes.

731
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
Come on.

732
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Go.

733
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
This way.

734
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Two-digit savings.

735
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
You're our two-digit savings now.

736
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
No.

737
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Fine.

738
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I'll be the two-digit savings.

739
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
We'll have two-digit savings

740
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
for the three-digit savings.

741
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
We'll do the research and report.

742
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Oh, right.

743
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,880
The guys you have are hiding.

744
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I think this little girl looks like a prince.

745
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,880
She looks like a Liang family girl.

746
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
She's much more handsome than the prince.

747
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,880
She doesn't know how to act.

748
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
She's still a good actress.

749
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
She's so good at acting.

750
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm impressed.

751
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Come on.

752
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'll give you the money.

753
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
No.

754
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Where's my son?

755
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Give him back.

756
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Son?

757
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Don't ask me.

758
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I'll give you the money.

759
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Where's my son?

760
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Little girl.

761
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Don't be anxious.

762
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
If you want a son,

763
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I'll make you a big boy.

764
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Commander.

765
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I don't know where you are.

766
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
You look like a army.

767
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
I'm a person.

768
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
You should know me.

769
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
You're a woman.

770
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Tell me.

771
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Lin Junqing.

772
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Lin Junqing?

773
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
You're related to him.

774
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm the third aunt of the Lin family.

775
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Lin Junqing saw me.

776
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
He wanted to call me aunt.

777
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
He said that the whole family

778
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
was slaughtered by the Red Army.

779
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
He's the third aunt of the Red Army.

780
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
Commander.

781
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Let me see Lin Junqing.

782
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
If I see him,

783
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
everything will be clear.

784
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Not at all.

785
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Take him to

786
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
let me

787
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,880
let him know tonight.

788
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Yes.

789
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
Commander.

790
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Wait.

791
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Li Dayang.

792
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Li Dayang.

793
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
I'm the third aunt of the Lin family.

794
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Commander.

795
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
He can prove that

796
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm the third aunt of the Lin family.

797
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Don't make a scene.

798
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Commander.

799
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Brother.

800
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
He's the third aunt of the Lin family.

801
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
I saw him at the door.

802
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
He's a little familiar.

803
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
He knows the details.

804
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,880
But the Red Army killed Lin Junqing.

805
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
I don't know how he survived.

806
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Now that he knows he's dead,

807
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,880
he left him to be the third aunt of the Lin family.

808
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Isn't that good?

809
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Yes.

810
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Yes.

811
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
But...

812
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,880
You want to get close to Lin Junqing, right?

813
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I think

814
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
this is a good chance.

815
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
You son of a bitch.

816
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Do you want to break my relationship with the Lin family?

817
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,880
You dare to catch the third aunt of the Lin family.

818
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
You're so stubborn.

819
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
I...

820
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
I thought the third aunt had died.

821
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Where's my son?

822
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Where's my son?

823
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,880
He's on the street.

824
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Go find him.

825
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,880
You ruined my cooperation with Commander Lin.

826
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
I'll kill you.

827
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Yes.

828
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Come in.

829
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Come on.

830
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
This is our scene.

831
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Commander.

832
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Look at him.

833
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,880
He's still in the dark.

834
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Nobody will know this.

835
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Commander.

836
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Commander.

837
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Commander.

838
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Commander.

839
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Commander.

840
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Commander.

841
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Commander.

842
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Commander.

843
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Commander.

844
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Let's go.

845
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,080
Young Master, we're going to work too.

846
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Go and work with me! Hurry!

847
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,280
Put your hands and feet on the horse. This way!

848
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,280
Ding, I'm going to go up to the salt field.

849
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,680
Take them and beat up Yanluo.

850
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Let's go.

851
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Go!

852
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,080
Take these loaves to Tongli and then go up.

853
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Okay.

854
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Old Pei.

855
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
What's wrong?

856
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
You're still here?

857
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
Let's go.

858
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Okay.

859
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
This way.

860
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
Let's go.

861
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Hurry.

862
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Hurry.

863
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Let's go.

864
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,880
What's wrong?

865
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Hurry.

866
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
What are you doing?

867
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
Go.

868
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Come here.

869
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
What are you doing?

870
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Go back.

871
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Go.

872
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
Go.

873
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:16,680
I am always with you.

874
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Don't use me.

875
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
What?

876
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Jun Chen.

877
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
More food.

878
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,520
Eat more, you must feels hungry.

879
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,360
Eat more, son.

880
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,520
Mother.

881
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,640
What's the name of our red,

882
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Okay, come.

883
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,640
That Niu Qingxiang

884
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,640
thought we were from the village.

885
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,440
He almost shot us.

886
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,040
But later, they said

887
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,840
Hong Jun can't kill innocent people.

888
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,440
So Hong Jun didn't make it difficult for you?

889
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
No.

890
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,040
They also killed Wang Qi.

891
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,240
They even avenged the old man.

892
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,640
They were kind to our mother.

893
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,240
They even gave us a meal.

894
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,040
Jun Qing.

895
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
Speaking of which,

896
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Hong Jun is kind to our family.

897
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,240
Enough.

898
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,440
Hong Jun is kind to our family.

899
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Don't say that again.

900
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,040
And don't mention this to anyone.

901
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Okay.

902
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,440
Let's eat.

903
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Don't move.

904
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
Don't move.

905
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,040
Don't move.

906
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Don't move.

907
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:38,040
The night is deep, the days are bitter

908
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,040
The night is burning, the scenery is deep

909
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
I'm the one who ate the meal.

910
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Mother said

911
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,040
don't forget the kindness of others

912
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
when I have a meal.

913
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
The director said

914
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
we were from the real Hong Jun War.

915
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
It's still a long time.

916
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,040
What's the real Hong Jun War?

917
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
It's a war between our people and Hong Jun.

918
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
It's a battle between the old and the old.

919
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
We must fight for the truth.

920
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Don't make the old becky.

921
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
The truth is very important to you.

922
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
I'm the one who ate the meal.

923
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
Don't say that again.

924
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
Don't say that again.

925
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Don't forget the kindness of others.

926
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
when I have a meal.

927
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Don't say that again.

928
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
Don't forget the kindness of others.

929
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,040
when I have a meal.

930
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
Don't forget the kindness of others.

931
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
when I have a meal.

932
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,040
Don't make the old becky.

933
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
The truth is very important to you.

934
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Don't make the old becky.

935
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,040
The truth is very important to you.

936
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,040
Don't make the old becky.

937
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,040
The truth is very important to you.

938
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Don't make the old becky.

939
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
The truth is very important to you.

940
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Don't make the old becky.

941
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,040
The truth is very important to you.

942
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Don't make the old becky.

943
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
The truth is very important to you.
