The boss said no one came.

193
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,460
Maybe she went to the wrong place.

194
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,060
Check over there.

195
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,500
Okay.

196
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,340
Sir, hello.

197
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,020
Show me some talent.

198
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,460
What can you do?

199
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,540
I can do a bit of everything.

200
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,700
Sing me a song.

201
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,700
♪Love♪

202
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,180
♪Love♪

203
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,980
♪Love, love♪

204
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,220
♪Love till I die♪

205
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,820
♪It's not love

206
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,900
Okay, that's enough.

207
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,180
You look nice.

208
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,260
Can you dance?

209
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,380
Something hot.

210
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,020
Hot?

211
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,620
Hot, like...

212
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,300
Yeah, that'll do.

213
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,660
Alright.

214
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,460
You're hired.

215
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,300
Pretty looks

216
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,380
matter the most.

217
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,420
So

218
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,580
you come to work tomorrow.

219
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,940
Remember

220
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,940
to dress sexily.

221
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,380
Why does an Internet cafe administrator

222
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,300
have to dress sexily?

223
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,460
Cafe administrator?

224
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,500
You came to apply
as a Cafe administrator?

225
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,660
Didn't you see the sign

226
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
at the door?

227
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,060
What sign?

228
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,740
We're hiring live streamers,

229
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,340
internet celebrities.

230
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
You know what they are?

231
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,140
One-night trial.

232
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,940
If you can last

233
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,820
from 8 PM tonight

234
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,980
to 8 AM tomorrow morning,

235
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,580
then you're officially hired.

236
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,660
For power outage,

237
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,660
call this number.

238
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,460
If a customer's computer breaks,

239
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,060
get them another one

240
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,700
and report for repair.

241
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,060
Got it?

242
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,260
Okay, start working.

243
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,620
How much is the salary?

244
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,940
1,500 a month.

245
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,940
Isn't that too little?

246
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,660
It's even below

247
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,580
the minimum wage standard.

248
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,180
If it's too little,

249
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,220
go find another job.

250
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
Does it include room and board?

251
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,740
Yes, it does.

252
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,980
Three cup noodles a day,

253
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,300
anything more is on you.

254
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,460
I have to eat instant noodles all day?

255
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,820
If you find it too cheap,

256
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,460
then find another job.

257
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,620
If you want better meals,

258
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,620
you can go to my place...

259
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,980
For prices and top-up,

260
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,940
just follow these instructions.

261
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,500
Don't touch the money
in the cash register.

262
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,220
Because

263
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,300
I can see

264
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,340
every move you make.

265
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,300
Sir.

266
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,820
Clean this up

267
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,940
and bring two beers.

268
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,100
Okay, coming right up.

269
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,300
Hurry up.

270
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,820
Go.

271
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
Are you blind?

272
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,820
Sorry, sorry.

273
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,300
What's this about?

274
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,220
She's new here, brand new.

276
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,020
Clean it up.

277
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,860
Alright, doing it right now.

278
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,620
Beers, man, my treat!

279
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,180
Clean it up now.

280
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,900
Why did you hire her?

281
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,780
I'm on it.

282
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Hurry up.

283
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,860
Really sorry about that.

284
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,300
My apologies.

285
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,980
She's new here.

286
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,820
Be careful, "brand new".

287
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,100
Good-looking but useless.

288
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,060
If it weren't for your looks,

289
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,980
I wouldn't have hired you.

290
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,060
Oh, right,

291
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,060
your ID card.

292
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,740
Why do you need my ID?

293
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,580
What if you run off

294
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,340
with the money in the cash register?

295
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,980
Where would I find you?

296
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,300
Sir,

297
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,340
do you have a charger

298
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,700
for this phone?

299
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,660
This phone is good for nothing

300
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,620
but calls and texts.

301
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,540
It can't even be connected
to the internet.

302
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,020
Give me some money,

303
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,220
I'll throw it away for you.

304
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,780
Get to work.

305
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,540
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

306
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,140
Datou?

307
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,860
Why are you still eating instant noodles?

308
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,500
I brought you some good food.

309
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,620
How did you get here?

310
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,660
Me?

311
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,260
I time-traveled here too.

312
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,700
Do you know how to get back?

313
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,340
Of course, I know.

314
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:51,980
Eat first,

315
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,660
I'll take you back after you're done.

316
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,380
Come on, eat up, You won't be hungry.

317
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,620
Eat it up.

318
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,660
Tastes good, right?

319
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,860
Quick, eat up.

320
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,620
Why are you crying?

321
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,260
Tell me what's wrong,

322
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,980
I'll definitely take you back.

323
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,780
Okay?

324
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,020
Stop crying now.

325
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,460
Tonight,

326
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,260
I've arranged a gathering.

327
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,940
We'll definitely
have a good time drinking.

328
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,220
My treat.

329
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,020
Stop crying.

330
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,100
Eat up.

331
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,580
Only this much income

332
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,420
for the whole night?

333
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,780
How much we make

334
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,140
is none of my business.

335
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,220
How can it not matter?

336
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,900
With such little income,

337
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,740
how am I supposed
to maintain all this equipment?

338
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,540
I hired you

339
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,980
because you're good-looking.

340
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,660
You need to attend to the customers

341
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,260
and get them to buy VIP cards.

342
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,060
Understand?

343
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,900
Can you act cute?

344
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,020
I can't.

345
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,460
Then you need to learn.

346
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:14,980
Alright,

347
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,740
you've passed

348
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,060
the probation.

349
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,660
From now on,

350
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,500
every night

351
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,380
work from 8 PM to 8 AM.

352
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,340
Any issues?

353
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,100
None.

354
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,100
Can I get off work now?

355
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,660
Where am I supposed to stay?

356
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,340
The storage room at the back.

357
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,780
Or you can stay at my place if you like.

358
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,140
(I can't power on the phone)

359
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,220
(Mr. Xu gave me.)

360
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,460
(Maybe only by turning it on)

361
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,540
(can I connect)

362
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,460
(with my world)

363
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,420
(and call my dad.)

364
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,500
(I've searched all the internet cafes)

365
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,340
(around here)

366
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,740
(and still haven't seen her.)

367
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,140
(That's odd.)

368
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,700
She wouldn't have gone

369
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,500
into some illegal internet cafe,
would she?

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,700
Five yuan.

00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,420
I'll have a bowl, then.

381
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:55,860
Okay.
