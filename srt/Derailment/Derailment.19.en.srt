[Episode 19]

4
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,510
(September 9, 2009,)

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,760
(the day I started
my first year of high school,)

6
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,190
(my parents had a car accident)

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,190
(on their way to work)

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
(and never came back.)

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,190
(They went off the mountain road )

10
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,560
(with the car,)

11
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,600
(and their bodies were never found.)

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
(Grandma and I made a grave,)

13
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,920
(burned paper money,)

14
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,150
(and kowtowed,)

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,750
(but the grave)

16
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,790
(only held their clothes.)

17
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,790
(Their souls,
thousands of miles far away,)

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,710
(may never return.)

19
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,000
(When I was little,)

20
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,350
(Grandma fell seriously ill.)

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,430
(To treat her illness,)

22
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,200
(we scraped together money)

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,310
(and borrowed a lot.)

24
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,680
(My parents had to work away)

25
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,950
(Little did we know)

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
(that fate could be so heartless.)

27
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,150
(My parents were gone,)

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,760
(and Grandma fell ill.)

29
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
(October 16,)

30
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,350
(2009.)

31
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,200
(Our family seemed
to owe a lot of money)

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,350
(to the villagers.)

33
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,950
That's 20 in total.

34
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,310
Good girl.

35
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,150
Eat.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,430
Grandma.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,870
How much do we owe others?

38
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,560
Go ahead and eat.

40
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,510
It's getting cold.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,710
Eat.

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,710
You're going to school tomorrow.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,470
Put this away

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,240
and use it at school.

45
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,150
Grandma, 20 is enough.

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,360
Be good.

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
Put it away and don't lose it.

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,310
If you need anything

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
at school,

50
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,560
just tell me.

51
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,310
Keep it safe.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,470
Eat.

53
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,080
(September 26,)

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,310
(2009.)

55
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,870
(Today my homeroom teacher)

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,910
(called me out to the corridor.)

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,800
The school knows

58
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,560
that your family situation is special,

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,080
that's why we haven't rushed you.

60
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,560
But you see,

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,750
your tuition

62
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
has been overdue for three weeks.

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,520
Why don't you go home

64
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,840
and talk to your grandma,

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,750
see if you can pay

66
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,560
the tuition?

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,400
Madam.

68
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,680
Can you give me

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
some more time?

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,150
I'll find a way to pay it

71
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,030
within this year.

72
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
Please don't tell my grandma.

73
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,310
What are you doing?

74
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:07,800
Go back!

75
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,870
Well,

76
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,190
come with me to the office

77
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,360
and write a statement
about your special situation.

78
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,710
I'll apply for a subsidy

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,870
from the school.

80
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,120
All right.

81
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,150
Let's go.

82
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,520
I heard a few days ago

83
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,360
that she stole money from Ding Xiangling
in the neighboring class.

84
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,630
No way. She doesn't seem like
that kind of person.

85
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,590
Who knows?

86
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,120
That's nonsense!

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,680
I didn't steal any money.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,190
Then why are you
in such a hurry to deny it?

89
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,800
Quiet!

90
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,630
Do you have any proof?

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,600
Sit down.

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,270
Stand up.

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,190
- Hello, madam.
- Hello, madam.

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,040
Sit down.

95
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,870
Get ready for class.

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,360
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

97
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,630
It's time for class.

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,830
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

99
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,360
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

100
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,720
Hello.

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,070
She's home safe.

102
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,070
Don't worry.

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,800
Okay.

104
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,830
Thank you.

105
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,390
(Are you sure it's a good idea)

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,560
(to send her back?)

107
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,240
Back then, her neighbors

108
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
in the village had a falling out

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,070
with her family

110
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
because they borrowed money from them.

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,430
Instead of being judged here,

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
it might be better for her
to stay in Luoshan.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,310
I know that,

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
but there are some truths

115
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,870
that only she can find out.

116
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,870
Qi Lian.

117
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,240
Either you find a way

118
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,160
to make her stay,

119
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,310
or you just make a clean break.

120
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,390
You can't be so capricious.

121
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,680
(Over the years,)

122
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,600
(Xiaoyuan)

123
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,560
(hasn't changed at all.)

124
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,390
(Instead,)

125
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,750
(you've become indecisive)

126
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,720
(and hesitant.)

127
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,600
Sometimes I think,

128
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,510
after what happened

129
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,360
six years ago,

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
(you seemed to have become
a different person.)

131
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,630
(You can't keep being like this.)

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,000
I know.

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,190
Qi Lian.

134
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,270
Come with me.

135
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,560
Someone from Chongqing wants to see you.

136
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,630
What happened?

137
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
Huo Boyu committed suicide.

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,720
He didn't make it.

139
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,360
Chen is on the way to the hospital.

140
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,240
Come with me now.

141
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,310
Yes.

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,510
It has been confirmed.

143
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, I see

144
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,680
Keep a record.

145
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,950
Qi Lian.

146
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,480
Today is New Year's Eve.

147
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,830
Go home to celebrate the new year.

148
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,190
Don't get yourself

149
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,070
involved in this.

150
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,920
Thank you.

151
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,800
Hello.

152
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,920
Is this Prof. Lu?

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Yes.

154
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,270
I'm Qi Lian.

155
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,480
I'll be on my way.

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
(The date of the last diary entry)

157
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,560
(is August 31,)

158
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
(2010.)

159
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,190
(Since this Jiang Xiaoyuan)

160
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,480
(has the habit of keeping a diary,)

161
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,390
(there must be)

162
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,270
(other diaries.)

163
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,030
(But I've searched)

164
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,510
(the whole room,)

165
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,510
(and can't find any.)

166
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,510
(Where could they be?)

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,750
Grandma.

168
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,120
Coming.

169
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,670
Grandma.

170
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,750
Do you know where I keep

171
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,630
my other diaries?

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,630
Diaries?

173
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,390
No.

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,600
Is there anything important

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,240
in it?

176
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,910
I remember

177
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,910
you had a notebook

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,150
with the secret contract in it.

179
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,480
Do you mean that notebook?

180
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,960
The secret contract?

181
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,510
It was a year ago.

182
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,270
Have you forgotten?

183
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,960
You brought back 100,000 yuan,

184
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,750
saying you found a good job.

185
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,630
I asked what it was about,
but you wouldn't tell me.

186
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,000
You mentioned

187
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,630
that the boss signed a secret contract

188
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,790
with you,

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,390
and it was in that notebook.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Is it that notebook?

191
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,480
The secret contract...

192
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Don't worry.

193
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll find it for you.

194
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,200
I'll find it for you.

195
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,960
Grandma.

196
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,360
How did I give you the money?

197
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,440
You transferred it

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
through the bank in the city

199
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,870
into my account.

200
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,750
Well...

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,030
Do you remember

202
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,030
which bank?

203
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,670
I don't understand such things.

204
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,750
The village secretary knows.

205
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,480
He took me there that time.

206
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,550
Grandma.

207
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,120
It's been too long since I came back.

208
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,790
I kind of forget.

209
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,440
Where does the village secretary live?

210
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,510
The village secretary is living

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,750
behind the woods.

212
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

213
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Grandma, I'll be back soon.

214
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,270
Professor Lu.

215
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,200
Thank you for coming all the way here.

216
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,750
Qi Lian.

217
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,670
You mean,

218
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
you suspect

219
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
your friend

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
has memory issues

221
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,440
and take this place

222
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,630
as a virtual game world.

223
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes.

224
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,600
I want to know

225
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,910
what kind of technological means

226
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,480
could lead to such results.

227
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,080
In fact, many internet addicts

228
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,960
may confuse the boundaries

229
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,150
between the real world
and the virtual world.

230
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,910
But to

231
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,390
actively induce hallucinations

232
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,080
with a specific purpose,

233
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
even if

234
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,360
successful,

235
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,270
the effect is not unstable,

236
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,750
and the duration is limited.

237
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,000
Is it possible

238
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,320
to completely replace

239
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
a person's memory

240
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,270
and make him think of himself

241
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,510
as someone else?

242
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,150
Are you writing science fiction?

243
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,080
Is it

244
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,030
really technically impossible?

245
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,910
I've heard
that some medical experts in China

246
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,910
have developed

247
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,840
a brain-machine interface technology.

248
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,870
It can stimulate

249
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,630
specific neural systems in the brain

250
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,240
through electrodes,

251
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
making the body

252
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,960
produce more dopamine.

253
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,790
It's used as

254
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,240
an invasive treatment

255
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,630
for depression
and other mental illnesses.

256
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,360
However,

257
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,630
in theory,

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
if a patient

259
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,550
is at

260
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,630
a painful memory node

261
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,390
and receives

262
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,630
continuous electrode stimulation,

263
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,150
it might be possible to achieve

264
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,240
memory replacement.

265
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,080
Of course,

266
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,240
this is purely theoretical.

267
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,270
As for whether any team
has developed it,

268
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,600
no one

269
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,200
knows.

270
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,550
Have you heard of

271
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,790
Mingguang Laboratory?

272
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,750
As far as I know,

273
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,910
they were

274
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,030
conducting research

275
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,150
related to brain science before.

276
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,030
The laboratory you mentioned

277
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,270
has been closed for a long time, right?

278
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,360
Does it ring a bell?

279
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,910
I heard

280
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,270
they were

281
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,510
also interested

282
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,510
in deleting painful memories.

283
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,200
I met them once

284
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,870
at a research summit.

285
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,030
their head of research

286
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,080
mentioned a science fiction movie

287
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,790
in which the two main characters

288
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,670
can erase past memories

289
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,910
through a fictitious program

290
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
called

291
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,510
Targeted Memory Erasure.

292
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,120
The head

293
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
was quite ambitious,

294
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,870
thinking that replacing painful memories

295
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,390
with happy ones

296
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,510
might be even better

297
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,270
than erasing painful memories.

298
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,080
It was him

299
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,200
who told me

300
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,870
that it's theoretically feasible.

301
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,630
Do you know

302
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,550
their head?

303
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
What's his name?

304
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,550
I only met him once.

305
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
I think his name was

306
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,510
Noah,

307
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,150
a Chinese-American,

308
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,080
very young.

309
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,030
Do you have his contact information?

310
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,120
No.

311
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,000
It's been a long time,

312
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,510
and he hasn't been out

313
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,480
for any events for a while.

314
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,030
If you remember anything

315
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,270
or find any information about it,

316
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
please let me know.

317
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,000
Okay.

318
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,240
I'll keep an eye out.

319
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,910
Now when I think about it,

320
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,120
if the memory replacement system

321
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
proposed by Noah

322
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,240
at that time

323
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,960
could be successfully developed,

324
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,790
maybe

325
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,480
it really can replace people's memories

326
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
and create

327
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,440
some beautiful dreams.

328
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,910
Now Huo Boyu is dead.

329
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,670
The clues from him

330
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,790
have been cut off.

331
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,870
The police took the body back

332
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,000
for an autopsy,

333
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:12,910
and the results

334
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,790
will probably come out
after the New Year.

335
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,150
What's your plan?

336
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Are you going to let it go?

337
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,790
I'm going to

338
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,720
visit Mingguang Laboratory.

339
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:21,960
There might be

340
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,670
the answers I've been looking for.

341
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,000
It closed down six years ago.

342
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,910
Not to mention
that it's likely empty now;

343
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,030
even the land

344
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
might have changed hands.

345
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,870
Can you help me find out

346
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,790
who owns

347
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,150
the land now?

348
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,630
I can,

349
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,240
but let's talk about it
after the New Year.

350
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,720
(Take a good rest
during the Spring Festival.)

351
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,480
Don't strain yourself too much.

352
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,630
You need to relax.

353
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,080
I know.

354
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,240
You little girl.

355
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,480
Jiang Xiaoyuan, don't run!

356
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,840
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

357
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,510
Did you steal money

358
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,360
from our classmates?

359
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,910
Don't move.

360
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,550
What are you doing?

361
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,910
Are you still not gonna stop?

362
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you believe

363
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll report this to the teacher?

364
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,550
Go ahead.

365
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,200
Do it.

366
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,670
Am I bullying you?

367
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,240
Go ahead.

368
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,550
Report the teacher.

369
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,030
No.

370
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

371
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,880
Do you want to report to the teacher?

372
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,160
Qi Lian.

373
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,640
They're going to beat me.

374
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,880
Aren't you going
to report to the teacher?

375
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,270
Yeah.

376
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,200
Wait here.

377
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,880
I'll report to the teacher now.

378
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,070
Go ahead. We'll wait for you.

379
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,830
What about you?

380
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,750
Why don't you leave?

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,550
You're asking for trouble.

382
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,640
Let's go.

383
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,830
- Hurry.
- Just wait.

384
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,030
Just wait.

385
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,240
Let's go.

386
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,220
♪Now every time I can feel the wind♪

387
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,340
♪The whole world draws back as it roars♪
