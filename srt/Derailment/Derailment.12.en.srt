00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,430
Mr. Jiang,

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
I've checked out how you do training.

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,280
The overall competency

7
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,350
of these trainees is limited.

8
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,670
Honestly,

9
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,800
do you truly believe that,

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,510
they'll emerge as stand-alone

in each branch

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,070
after the training?

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,710
Becoming a makeup artist

16
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,760
in two weeks is not realistic,

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,320
especially given the current

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,280
skill levels of these trainees.

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,960
If they are truly stand out,

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,240
it will require

21
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,430
at least two more weeks.

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,520
Mr. Jiang, do you think that

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,200
among the current trainees,

24
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,960
there is no one with
a high level of proficiency?

25
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,880
Of course,

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,030
Every trainee's capability

27
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,030
is different.

28
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,600
But looks that your company's priorities

29
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,600
may not solely be on business expansion.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
I'd better leave to you.

31
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,520
Don't involve me, an outsider,

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,320
in your internal discussion.

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,040
Well, well.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,310
I've heard him is a freak.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,070
Don't take it personally.

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,000
Qi Lian,

37
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,760
you are the only son

38
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,590
of the renowned entrepreneur, Mr. Qi.

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,760
We greatly value

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,430

41
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,120
and opportunity

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,590
to collaborate with you.

43
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,000
But you see,

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,710
even Mr. Jiang doesn't think

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
it's a good idea.

46
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,870
So are you planning

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,150
to halt this business?

48
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,150
Mr. Jiang,

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
I have a new eye makeup style here,

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
could you give me some advice?

51
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,430
No need.

52
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,790
Your boss Cai

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,280
is just playing around with Qi.

54
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,560
Playing around with whom?

55
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,280
If we call it off now,

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,950
it's like telling those
who are earnestly

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,310
participating in the training

58
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,790
that their efforts are worthless.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,240
It could affect how seriously

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
others take future company training.

61
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,630
I get your points.

62
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,630
but company decisions

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
require a big-picture view.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,150
We need to weigh

65
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,240
the investment

66
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,310
against the returns,

67
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,870
not dwell solely on

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,910
individual sentiments.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,360
If they feel it's unfair,

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,150
they can leave.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
but there will certainly be many others

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,240
who need these positions.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,590
What do you think?

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Cai.

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,560
I can't agree with you.

76
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,240
I'd prefer hardworking ones

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,750
to receive rewards.

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,030
Some have faced immense pressure

79
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,910
during this training,

80
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,310
dedicating themselves
tirelessly to practice.

81
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,560
You should know,

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,030
what matters to us

83
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,150
is the result,

84
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,280
not the process.

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,150
In that case,

86
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,080
Mr. Cai, you could organize

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,360
a final test.

88
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,630
Based on the number who pass,

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
we can then decide whether
to proceed with the project.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,630
What do you think?

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,400
Alright.

92
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,310
How about this?

93
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,120
If everyone passes

94
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,520
the test,

95
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,710
we will proceed.

96
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,030
Close your eyes now.

97
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,870
This part can be a bit more emphasized.

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,590
Here, this part.

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,190
Open your eyes now.

100
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,910
Everyone, gather around.

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
I've got something to tell you.

102
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,080
What?

103
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,590
What's going on?

104
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,150
I just heard this from downstairs.

105
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,750
Our CEO Mr. Cai

106
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,520
will set a final test for us.

107
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,430
If even one person doesn't pass,

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,910
our training will be canceled.

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
All our efforts in these two weeks

110
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,150
will be in vain.

111
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,520
That's fine.

112
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,910
We have 12 people here.

113
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,630
Not everyone

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,750
likes makeup.

115
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,520
Right?

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,840
Also,

117
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,360
Mr. Cai must know this, too.

118
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,240
He must do this on purpose.

119
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,910
You know, to let us give up

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,710
since that's difficult.

121
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,630
Exactly.

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,080
I understand you all.

123
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,560
But why Mr. Cai

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
can casually deny our efforts.

125
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,280
Right.

126
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
That's too much.

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,120
But,

128
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,630
everyone should pass

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
at our current level?

130
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,680
Kind of hard, huh?

131
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,480
That's right.

132
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Anyway,

133
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,630
lying flat

134
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,680
isn't that bad.

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,310
Even though we pass the test,

136
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,430
we can't get promoted or a raise.

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
It might be a bit challenging.

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,560
But that's reachable.

139
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,000
We should be confident.

140
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,390
Yes, this isn't ideal.

141
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
But someone get

142
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,870
this opportunity for us.

143
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
The other one hasn't given up on us,

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,630
why should we

145
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,630
give up on ourselves?

146
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,160
Exactly.

147
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,920
We can't give up.

148
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,270
Moreover, if we don't make it this time,

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
we'll lose half a month's

150
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,630
performance for nothing.

151
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,800
But if we make it,

152
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,750
there is a new makeup service
waiting for us.

153
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,630
I'm confident that getting promoted

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,830
and a raise shouldn't be a problem.

155
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,480
Yes.

156
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,430
That's true.

157
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,480
Are we going to endure

158
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
two weeks of torment from Jiang Bo

159
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,160
and leave unhappily,

160
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,720
or are we going to take this chance

161
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,800
and make others recognize

162
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,800
our achievement?

163
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,750
I say take this chance.

164
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,000
Of course.

165
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,560
Take this chance.

166
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,310
Let's do this.

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,950
Yes.

168
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,310
Great.

169
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,870
Who says we can't do this?

170
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,800
Xiaoyuan,

171
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,560
why don't you lead us

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,310
in practicing together?

173
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,600
I...

174
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,190
(Don't back down.)

175
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,800
(Qi Lian even did this for us,)

176
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,630
(I should be brave.)

177
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,040
Sure.

178
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,360
Let's start additional training together

179
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,360
from tonight.

180
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,390
- Great!
- Cool.

181
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,270
Here.

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,630
Come.

183
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,950
One, two,

184
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,120
go for it!

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Applying it like this would be fine.

186
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,920
My apology.

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,510
Starting tonight,

188
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,750
I won't join you for supper.

189
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,750
What's going on?

190
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,160
I overhead your talk

191
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,870
with Mr. Cai yesterday.

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,920
Since you trust us,

193
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,160
we won't let you down.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,360
Okay.

195
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,310

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,960
and finally, 11 of them

390
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,360
passed the test.

391
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,550
What's going on?

392
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,510
Why only one didn't pass?

393
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,360
This one trainee

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,960
does not lack the required skills.

395
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,480
She helped

396
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,750
another one

397
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,030
after she completed herself.

398
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
This deviated from our intention

399
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,510
of evaluating each trainee's

400
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,720
individual capabilities.

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
This has stirred debate

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,030
among judges.

403
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,240
Some hold

404
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,870
canceling her score,

405
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,270
while others argue for

406
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,840
granting a passing grade.

407
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,790
Finally...

408
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,790
Mr. Jiang,

409
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,720
you can cancel her score.

410
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,840
Anyway, she was helping us.

411
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,550
That's right.

412
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,030
Whether it's us or Xiaoyuan

413
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,270
who didn't pass,

414
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,630
the result would be the same

415
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,870
if at least one person fails.

416
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,790
Right.

417
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,870
That's not fair.

418
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,440
She was just being kind, but...

419
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,390
Exactly, sir.

420
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,150
Please,

421
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,550
please don't do that.

422
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,840
As the fifth judge,

423
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,510
I find Jiang Xiaoyuan's

424
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,600
test result

425
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,670
to be excellent.

426
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,120
As for her exploitation

427
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,080
of test loopholes,

428
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,390
We decided giving her verbal criticism

429
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,120
without pursuing further consequences.

430
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,150
The judging panel has decided

431
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,670
to award her the title of
Outstanding Trainee

432
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,550
as an encouragement.

433
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,390
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

434
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,790
congratulations!

435
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
Congratulations to Jiang Xiaoyuan!

436
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,120
We all passed!

437
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
That's amazing!

438
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,550
Well done, Xiaoyuan.

439
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,390
Good job!

440
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,240
You are Jiang Xiaoyuan

441
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,550
from branch in Luoshan?

442
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,550
Good job!

443
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,000
Thanks to your efforts,

444
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,830
our pilot business project

445
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,400
has been secured.

446
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,400
Mr. Qi put in a lot of effort to secure

447
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
this opportunity for you. Well done.

448
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,240
Thank you so much.

449
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,510
I told you.

450
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,440
She is a talent.

451
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
She really does a good job

452
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
in the makeup field.

453
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,240
You bet. I brought her to this.

454
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,030
Never mind.

455
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,590
The key is that I have taught her well.

456
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,880
Keep it up!

457
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,550
Sure.

458
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you.

459
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,440
Am I impressive?

460
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,110
Pretty good, honestly.

461
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,400
A raise! Remember that!

462
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,880
What do you say?

463
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,440
Well done.

464
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,510
For those who underestimate me,

465
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll show them the results.

466
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,350
As for those who believe in me,

467
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,350
I won't let them down.

468
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,240
Oh, right.

469
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,000
I want to ask you.

470
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,510
Did you write the proposal

471
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,310
for this new business?

472
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,960
That Jiang Xiaoyuan

473
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,920
also likes makeup?

474
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,830
It really confuses me.

475
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
How does it benefit you?

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
Or how does it benefit her?

477
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Give me a hint.

478
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,400
Later, I'll know how

479
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,200
to cooperate with you.

480
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,440
Do you think I wrote that proposal

481
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,960
to take advantage of you?

482
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,790
Doesn't it?

483
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,920
You couldn't write that for me.

484
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,310
If you don't like,

485
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,920
you can quit.

486
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,550
You are stingy.

487
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,720
I said I'll cooperate with you.

488
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,070
Attention, everyone!

489
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,920
Let's tidy up

490
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,480
this space together

491
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,270
We take a group photo together,

492
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,270
is that okay?

493
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,790
Sure!

494
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,590
- Great.
- Good.

495
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,070
Come. Gather around.

496
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,310
Qi Lian, here!

497
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,310
Watch it out.

498
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,270
OK.

499
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,680
Alright, line up.

500
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,070
Stand closer, everyone.

501
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,830
Why didn't you hold me?

502
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,270
Now, look at my camera.

503
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,000
Three,

504
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,920
two,

505
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,550
one.

506
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
Cheese!

507
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,550
Mr. Jiang...

508
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,510
Don't thank me.

509
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,160
Now,

510
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
I have to say think you.

511
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,750
You have a bad temper,

512
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,720
and your taste isn't the best.

513
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,000
But I have to admit

514
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,480
that I've learned a lot from you.

515
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,400
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

516
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,720
Seriously,

517
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,160
do you want to turn it into a career?

518
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
I never thought about it before,

519
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
but after going through all this,

520
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,030
I'd say I want to do it.

521
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,750
Why?

522
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,550
I just want to do

523
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,590
what I love.

524
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,270
Do you really need so many reasons?

525
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,750
You said you love to do this.

526
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,750
You feel happy.

527
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,640
That's because you haven't faced

528
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,550
real challenges.

529
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,750
But one day,

530
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,030
when your efforts don't pay off,

531
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,270
you might not feel

532
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,920
the same way.

533
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,000
Are you saying that

534
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,030
I'll back down when facing challenges

535
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,880
in the future?

536
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,310
You underestimate me.

537
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,160
We'll see.

538
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,240
Goodbye.

539
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,070
Go back to pack.

540
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,960
I'll take you somewhere.

541
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,270
Where?

542
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,270
Why did you take me here?

543
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
I have to return to Luoshan
in the afternoon.

544
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,880
What?

545
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,830
Take you back to your childhood.

546
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
[Ice cream]

547
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,400
An ice cream van!

548
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you.

549
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,160
How did you find it?

550
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,750
What flavor do you want?

551
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,750
I'll take this one.

552
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,920
Two of those, please.

553
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,270
You go first.

554
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,160
No, take it.

555
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,590
Thank you.

556
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
Human is complicated.

557
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,750
When I first came here,

558
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,590
I didn't want to stay even for s minute.

559
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,110
But now,

560
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,310
I've met these people,

561
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
and I've had

562
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,720
these experiences.

563
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,640
If I go back now,

564
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,750
I may miss all of that.

565
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,750
But I still want to go home.

566
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Don't slack off.

567
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,000
You promised me to find clues.

568
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,480
Don't worry.

569
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,510
I'll do

570
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,110
what I promised you.

571
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,350
Come here.

572
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,400
Come.

573
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,480
Let me show you something.

574
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,790
Look.

575
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,440
What's wrong?

576
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,200
Who kissed you?

577
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,750
Tell me.

578
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,110
Spill the truth.

579
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,640
Oh, come on.

580
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,510
Let's take more photos.

581
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640

from HQ.

655
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Our colleague, Jiang Xiaoyuan,

656
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,440

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,550
Next,

658
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,270
She'll lead the beauty business

659
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,440
during the trial phase.

660
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,720
As is customary,

661
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
our salon will arrange

662
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,750
a new position for her.

663
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,830
Xiaoyuan,

664
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,310
you get a promotion.

665
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:31,920
Yes,

666
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,750
a promotion.

667
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,310
as chief makeup artist

668
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,920
Here.

669
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,440
[Jiang Xiaoyuan, Chief Makeup Artist]

670
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,270
Chief!

671
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,590
The chief makeup artist.

672
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,480
Mr. Chen,

673
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,680
does this chief makeup artist

674
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,160
is at the same level

675
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
as me,

676
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,200
the chief hair stylist?

677
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,830
Technically, it's the same.

678
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,880
Because, after all,

679
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,550
beauty and hairdressing

680
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,960
are two parallel business lines.

681
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,960
So, does this mean that

682
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,880
anyone can come up with
some random new business,

683
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,030
get a chief title,

684
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,680
and be on the same level

685
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
as experienced professionals like me?

686
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,720
Well,

687
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,960
when we signed up firstly,

688
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,830
I asked you all.

689
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,880
You didn't want to go.

690
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
You felt it was a waste of time.

691
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,880
The notice

692
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,720
is still posted on the wall.

693
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,510
At least, it confirmed

694
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,550
that the registration was fair.

695
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,310
But it didn't state that

696
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,590
you would receive a chief title.

697
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,830
Boss,

698
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,720
don't take me wrong.

699
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,350
The new business

700
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,350
can't rely solely on

701
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,590
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

702
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,400
If she decides to have an assistant,

703
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,510
that person's career will skyrocket.

704
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
And their rank will likely be higher

705
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,680
than most of us

706
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,830
in our hair styling department.

707
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,110
In that case,

708
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,240
who would still want to make an effort?

709
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
What do you think we should do?

710
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,270
Boss,

711
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,270
people say more power comes with
more responsibility,

712
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,510
As the director of hair styling

713
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,750
and chief hair stylist,

714
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,480
what are the usual responsibilities

715
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,110
that Helen takes on?

716
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,400
What do you mean?

717
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,550
What do I mean?

718
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,480
You don't buy it

719
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,640
because my abilities don't match up.

720
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,750
That's easy.

721
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,160
Whatever you can do for your department,

722
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,270
I can do for the makeup department.

723
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,000
What a big talk.

724
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,030
Not even considering team management

725
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,030
and technical training,

726
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,400
just in terms of the business volume,

727
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,310
you are not on the same level

728
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,110
with me.

729
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,240
Alright, stop that.

730
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,920
New and existing businesses are different.

731
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,640
Let me finish the announcement first.

732
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,750
Since HQ has scheduled

733
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,160
a one-month trial,

734
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,750
they must have set

735
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,480
business goals

736
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,680
and performance benchmarks.

737
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,510
Today, in our salon,

738
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
I promise you

739
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,680
that I'll take on

740
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,510
the responsibility for the KPIs

741
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,240
of our branch store.

742
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,880
No...

743
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,480
OK.

744
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Let's make it clear.

745
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,880
It's your responsibility.

746
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,030
This way, our manager won't always

747
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,590
have to clean up after you.

748
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:31,920
Deal.

749
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,720
What if you can't do that?

750
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,350
If I let our store manager

751
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,830
lose face at HQ,

752
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,640
you don't have to kick me out.

753
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,720
I'll leave on my own.

754
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,790
That's a deal.

755
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,110
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

756
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,750
are you crazy?

757
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,640
Yes, you are the Chief

758
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,920
of makeup department now.

759
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,160
Is it possible for you alone

760
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,750
to handle

761
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,270
the KPIs

762
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,790
of the whole branch store?

763
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,000
Do you know what HQ set

764
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,350
as the performance benchmark?

765
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,590
The first month's revenue needs to

766
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,270
reach ten thousand yuan.

767
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,680
Ten thousand?

768
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,440
That's okay.

769
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,750
That's okay?

770
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Are you okay now?

771
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,510
Let me do the math for you.

772
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,030
The current makeup pricing

773
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,750
is 128 yuan.

774
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,590
I'll consider 33 days for one month.

775
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,310
You need to serve

776
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,440
at least two to three clients

777
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,440
every day.

778
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,680
That's not too much.

779
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:14,920
Alright.

780
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,440
Let's see how many

781
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,400
of clients you can serve.

782
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,030
And this doesn't even include

783
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,110
the price difference
in discount marketing.

784
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,830
While HQ promises

785
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,830
unified purchases of cosmetics,

786
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,240
each branch store has to cover

787
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,240
all promotional expenses.

788
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,110
Also, the final cost

789
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,030
cannot exceed two thousand yuan.

790
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,750
What?

791
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,160
Two thousand yuan?

792
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,640
Two thousand for promotion?

793
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,830
That's not possible.

794
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
Renting a subway billboard

795
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,000
costs more than this.

796
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,920
So I asked you to stop

797
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,510
and let me finish that announcement.

798
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,550
But you didn't listen to me.

799
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,310
It seems a bit tough.

800
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,270
What should I do?

801
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
I've already said that.

802
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,510
I can't take it back.

803
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,310
I'll figure it out.

804
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,880
Hold on.

805
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,960
If you have any difficulties,

806
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,960
come to me.

807
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,550
After all, I'm your boss.

808
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Can you rent a billboard

809
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,960
at a low price?

810
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,030
No.

811
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,200
Oh, come on.

812
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,790
I'm useless because

813
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,720
I can't rent a billboard.

814
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,550
What a snob!

815
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,350
Sir,

816
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,680
your head injury is quite serious.

817
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,350
You need to be careful.

818
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,270
This incident is really terrible.

819
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,400
They will definitely

820
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,310
catch the culprit.

821
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,880
But first,

822
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,830
you need to take care of your health.

823
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:36,790
Sure.

824
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,720
Hi, Mr. Zhong.

825
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,790
Qi Lian,

826
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,550
you are here.

827
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,640
I heard that you were transferred

828
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,550
to a regular ward today.

829
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,510
So I'm here to visit you.

830
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,070
Your updates are quick.

831
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,110
Really.

832
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,310
I've only been here

833
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,400
for less an hour.

834
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,350
And you are here.

835
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:52,880
Let me introduce you.

836
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,880
These are students

837
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,550
I've taught before.

838
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,880
Our company occasionally assigns me

839
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,920
to give them lectures

840
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,160
at their school.

841
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,400
Sir,

842
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,400
we'll leave you to it.

843
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,070
Please take care of yourself.

844
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,030
We'll visit you next time.

845
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,350
Good.

846
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
You go back now.

847
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,030
Goodbye, sir.

848
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:09,790
Bye, Mr. Zhong.

849
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,880
Here.

850
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,590
Have a seat.

851
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,310
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhong.

852
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,160
If we hadn't come to you that day,

853
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,270
you wouldn't have gone to the archives

854
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,550
and wouldn't be in this situation.

855
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,720
Qi Lian,

856
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,920
can you tell me

857
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,110
where did you

858
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,790
get the photo

859
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,070
of that tracker?

860
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,030
Is there a problem?

861
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,680
I thought about it later.

862
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,790
The one ordering the tracker

863
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,070
probably isn't from

864
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,270
any animal protection organization.

865
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,350
And the file you want to check

866
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,030
went missing

867
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,030
on the day I was attacked.

868
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,070
Even the electronic file
in the database

869
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,750
was wiped out.

870
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,200
Do you think

871
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that's just a coincidence?

872
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,110
Did you talk about this to the police?

873
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,720
No.

874
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,160
I don't know what are you looking for.

875
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,270
And I don't want to get involved.

876
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
I just don't have any

877
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,030
more information

878
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,590
about that tracker.

879
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,480
OK.

880
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,880
I'd better take off now.

881
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,830
That is...

882
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,270
One of my students

883
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,070
broke the thermos

884
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,960
and didn't clean it up.

885
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,880
Mr. Zhong,

886
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,110
during the past hour,

887
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,510
is there anyone else here?

888
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,000
No.

889
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,000
Just my students.

890
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,360
You can go in and rest now.

891
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:50,960
OK.

892
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,590
We just checked the surveillance footage

893
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,800
for this corridor,

894
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,110
and there's no sign of
any suspicious ones

895
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,400
entering Mr. Zhong's ward.

896
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,590
The identity and motives

897
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,670
of the person

898
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,150
who installed the listening device here

899
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,670
are still unknown.

900
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,030
But we will

901
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,000
arrange for police officers

902
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,760
to be on duty here.

903
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,480
You don't have to

904
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,630
worry about Mr. Zhong' s safety.

905
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,550
Thank you.

906
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,000
You're welcome.

907
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,360
Thanks for your information.

908
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,760
If you have time,

909
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,590
could you please come with us

910
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,510
and file a report?

911
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,880
No problem.

912
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,190
Before we go,

913
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,960
can I have a quick talk

914
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,590
to Mr. Zhong?

915
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,920
I don't understand.

916
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,000
If there was a tracker

917
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,510
in your phone,

918
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,230
why didn't you just call the police?

919
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,550
Why did you come to our company

920
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,440
for information?

921
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,760
I did call the police,

922
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,320
although that's not for the tracker.

923
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,760
I didn't get a satisfactory result.

924
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,230
What I have experienced

925
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,190
are too complex

926
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,710
and almost unbelievable.

927
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,960
There is almost on one

928
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,840
can fully accept them

929
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,150
after hearing the whole story.

930
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,590
Mr. Zhong,

931
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,360
I'm really sorry

932
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,190
for what happened today.

933
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,640
If you have

934
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,600
some updates later on,

935
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,200
please let me know.

936
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,870
That's it.

937
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,910
You'd better

938
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,160
not come to find me.

939
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,270
I'm just

940
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,710
an ordinary technician.

941
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,390
I don't want to get involved in

942
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,600
these troublesome matters.

943
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,480
OK?

944
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,160
By the way,

945
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,560
as for those students,

946
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,270
do you know every one of them?

947
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:46,960
Wait.

948
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,710
You have done this to me.

949
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,080
Isn't that enough?

950
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,120
Do you have to harm my students?

951
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,600
What does it have to do with them?

952
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,560
Please calm down.

953
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm not up to something.

954
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,520
I just want to know

955
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,390
who broke the thermos

956
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,350
and bent down

957
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
to clean it up.

958
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,200
Because that must be

959
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,710
a good opportunity

960
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,680
to install that listening device.

961
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,430
I don't know what are you talking about.

962
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,390
They are my students.

963
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,790
Why do they

964
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,750
put a listening device

965
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,000
under my bed?

966
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,310
Please tell me.

967
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,790
After this,

968
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,270
I promise I'll never disturb you.

969
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,830
The one who nearly bumped into you

970
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,790
when you walked in.

971
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,080
His name?

972
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,000
Huo Boyu.

973
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,710
Thank you.

974
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,430
Shang,

975
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,200
help me find someone.

976
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,160
named Huo Boyu.

977
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,040
Hello,

978
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,560
our store launched a beauty service.

979
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,270
Would you like to check it out?

980
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:51,680
Thank you.

981
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,680
Hello, we ...

982
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,350
Hello,

983
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,120
our store launched a beauty service.

984
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,200
Would you like to give it a try?

985
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,640
It's just over there.

986
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,520
For makeup?

987
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:03,710
No.

988
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,520
Let's go.

989
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:05,870
Hello,

990
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,870
are you interested in

991
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,600
our new beauty service?

992
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,270
Hello, we launched...

993
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:10,830
No, thanks.

994
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,830
Hello, interested in

995
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,600
makeup service?

996
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,430
Xiaoyuan,

997
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't think

998
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,120
it's a good idea.

999
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,080
Seems no one

1000
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,830
is interested in

1001
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,830
our leaflets.

1002
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,640
Then what else can we do?

1003
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,680
We are on a tight budget.

1004
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,040
We can only stick with

1005
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,680
this traditional way.

1006
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,230
Let's keep going.

1007
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,910
Hello.

1008
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,560
Hello.

1009
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:36,960
Hello.

1010
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,350
We launched a new

1011
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,160
beauty service.

1012
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,960
Interested?

1013
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:39,960
It's just over there.

1014
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,120
Hello?

1015
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:53,830
Hey,

1016
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,390
I got something about Huo Boyu.

1017
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,960
Huo Boyu

1018
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,520
was Jiang Xiaoyuan's

1019
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,520
boyfriend in college.

1020
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,480
(Hello?)

1021
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,270
Are you listening?

1022
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,120
Go on.

1023
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,310
Huo Boyu left Chongqing

1024
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,040
this morning.

1025
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,680
Is there any chance that

1026
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,040
he'll go find Jiang Xiaoyuan?
