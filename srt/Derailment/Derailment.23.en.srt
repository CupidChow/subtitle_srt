I'm here to return the books. Thank you.

571
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,190
Okay, you're welcome.

572
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,070
Just leave them there.

573
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,070
You're amazing.

574
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,030
I can't believe you learned

575
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,710
such a complicated makeup look
in just one try.

576
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,030
Can you go to

577
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,760
the film special effects class with me

578
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,920
when you have time?

579
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,760
After you learn it,

580
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,670
you can teach me.

581
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,440
Okay.

582
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,670
Can I borrow

583
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,510
your clothes?

584
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow,

585
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,630
but Jiang Bo said I looked outdated.

586
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,710
I'm afraid if he's unhappy tomorrow,

587
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,150
he'll stab me with a knife.

588
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:35,960
Okay.

589
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,590
My clothes

590
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,360
are all here.

591
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,590
They're all from the street market.

592
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,440
Don't mind.

593
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,920
It's okay.

594
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,630
Even if I wear street market clothes,

595
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,710
I'll still impress him.

596
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,670
He only pays me

597
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,000
so little a month.

598
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,630
He really thinks he's the boss.

599
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,550
Speaking of which,

600
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,710
the salary for teacher assistants

601
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,760
is quite low,

602
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,000
only 1,600 yuan a month.

603
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
It's only enough for food.

604
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,880
1,600 yuan?

605
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,590
Isn't it 3,000 yuan?

606
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,230
3,000 yuan?

607
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,760
I had a senior

608
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,920
who worked as a teacher's assistant.

609
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,880
There is a standard salary,

610
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,150
1,600 yuan a month.

611
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,590
Did Mr. Jiang

612
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,480
give 3,000 yuan to you?

613
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,230
Yeah.

614
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,480
Probably

615
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,590
he covered the extra.

616
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,630
But 1,600 yuan

617
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,760
is too little indeed.

618
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,320
I'll take this one, okay?

619
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,670
Sure, I think it suits you.

620
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,960
Thanks.

621
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,880
No problem.

622
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,760
- Bye-bye.
