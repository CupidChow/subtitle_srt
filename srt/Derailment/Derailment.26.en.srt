[Episode 26]

4
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,670
Hello, Qi Lian.

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,830
Something's wrong.

6
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,960
What is it?

7
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,990
Did you check the news online now?

8
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,030
(There is an actress called Xie Yi.)

9
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,920
(As she walked down the red carpet,)

10
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,070
something went wrong with her makeup.

11
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,430
And Xiaoyuan did her makeup.

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,430
(I saw someone from the organizers)

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
(taking Xiaoyuan away.)

14
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,390
What should we do now?

15
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,600
Leave it to me.

16
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,800
We have verified it.

17
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,920
Jiang Xiaoyuan

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,310
is the one who did makeup

19
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,240
for Miss Xie.

20
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,280
And she is with Amy.

21
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,630
I don't care whether she is

22
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,390
an official employee of your studio.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,520
You're responsible

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,030
for her actions

25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,640
and any resulting issues.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Miss Xie, we sincerely apologize...

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,470
I swear, I've never used

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,520
the wrong powder.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,640
I suggest you

30
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,110
check the on-site surveillance footage.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,880
You sent someone torch up my makeup.

32
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,160
Now you're pretending to be unaware?

33
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,800
I warn you,

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,000
I can expose your name online,

35
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,110
and have industry insiders
to boycott you.

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,360
It's the organizer's work

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,550
to uncover the truth.

38
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,160
I didn't do it.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
So I won't take the blame.

40
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,240
You did this?

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,830
Finally, you come to see me.

42
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,080
Is it her suggestion

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
or is it your call?

44
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,030
You know Ms. Fan well.

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,440
Resorting to this may be beneath me,

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
but I had no choice.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Things went south

48
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,080
because

49
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,360
you brought her here.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,270
Don't blame me.

51
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,160
I didn't want to leave on my own.

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,270
Ms. Fan pushed me to do so.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,270
You know her.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,990
She doesn't want to see

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
you cultivate your own team.

56
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,870
You want to climb the social ladder,

57
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,640
that's your choice.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,590
No need to explain to me,

59
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,270
and you won't get my forgiveness.

60
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,590
You go on.

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,390
I'll take a call.

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,150
Lian,

63
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,320
finally, you called me.

64
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,360
Can you help me out here?

65
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,200
It's urgent.

66
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,360
In all these years,

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,990
you've never asked me

68
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,110
for a favor.

69
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,360
(What is it?)

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,830
There is an actress called Xie Yi.

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,520
(If I'm not wrong,)

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,320
(she must be Mr. Xie's daughter
from Xie Group.)

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
Could you please apologize

74
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,710
to him on my behalf

75
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,760
(about Xie Yi's gala makeup today?)

76
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,240
If he can let it slide,

77
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,670
I'll visit him in person

78
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,640
to provide an explanation.

79
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,360
Alright.

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,390
I'll talk to him.

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
She's my assistant.

82
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,990
I'll handle any issues.

83
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,990
Jiang Bo,

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,080
you didn't even touch Miss Xie's makeup.

85
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,080
You'd better not

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,870
to get involved.

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,270
First of all,

88
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,240
Jiang Xiaoyuan is my assistant.

89
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,920
Second of all,

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,270
all her contracts are signed with me.

91
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,670
As her employer,

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
it's reasonable for me

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,640
to take responsibility for her.

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,830
Excuse me, who are you?

95
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,200
What are you talking about?

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,110
My image is ruined.

97
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,990
Can you compensate for that?

98
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,390
Miss Xie,

99
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,670
feel free to make

100
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,640
make any demands.

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,150
Jiang Bo...

102
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,110
Don't speak.

103
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm truly sorry for

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,590
the negative impact today.

105
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,760
To make up for it,

106
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,960
I can offer you a red carpet look,

107
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,590
a feature on a magazine cover,

108
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,760
a brand ambassador role,

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,910
or a new acting opportunity,

110
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,030
whatever you'd like.

111
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,590
Quite a big talk.

112
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,590
Seriously,

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,150
who are you?

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
The chief editor of Galaxy Magazine,
Fan Xiaoxiao...

115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
She is my mother.

116
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,790
I will deliver on

117
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,790
my promises.

118
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,000
I've never heard of

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,910
that Ms. Fan has a son.

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
How could I trust you?

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,800
[Mother]

122
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,230
(Bo, what's going on?）

123
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,390
Mother,

124
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,440
Miss Xie

125
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,830
(is looking into the
incident responsibility)

126
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,710
(for her makeup tonight.)

127
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,320
She said I can't afford

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,230
the damage to her image.

129
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,350
But I don't think

130
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,120
it's all my fault.

131
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,590
(They are with me now.)

132
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,390
Mother,

133
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,590
what do you think I should do?

134
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,760
Alright,

135
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,080
bring her to me.

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,470
OK.

137
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,830
Miss Xie,

138
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,440
please come with me.

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,080
Miss Xie,

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,150
I just got a message from your father.

141
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,880
He said not making a big fuss
about this matter.

142
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,230
How about we meet with

143
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,270
Ms. Fan now?

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,680
I almost forgot.

145
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,590
I owe you an answer.

146
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,910
Actually, Qi Lian only guessed
half right.

147
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
When I hired you,

148
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,590
I did have other plans.

149
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,760
I wanted to keep you around for

150
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,440
making a deal with someone else.

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,320
But I relented.

152
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,590
What a pity.

153
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,960
I couldn't bear to see

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,830
your talent go to waste.

155
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,710
I won't work as

156
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,560
a makeup artist anymore.

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,710
But you...

158
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,790
You must keep going.

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,800
[Fire Control Center]

160
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,590
Xiaoyuan,

161
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,830
I've heard about it.

162
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,990
Xie Yi gave you a hard time.

163
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,350
Jiang Bo took the blame for me.

164
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,920
But I didn't do it.

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
And I can't ask him

166
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,470
to make that kind of sacrifice for me.

167
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,510
What are you going to do?

168
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,280
I want to check the
surveillance footage,

169
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,230
but they won't allow it.

170
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,470
Hold on a moment.

171
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,920
Xiaoyuan,

172
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,750
come on in.

173
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,510
How did you

174
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,710
manage to convince him?

175
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,960
Haven't I told you?

176
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,510
Qi Group invested

177
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,160
in building this theater.

178
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,510
Found it.

179
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,920
Is there a different angle?

180
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,350
Please hold on.

181
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,510
Here.

182
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,200
Zoom in here, please.

183
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,350
OK.

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,280
[Mei]

185
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,630
Mei?

186
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,800
Thank you.

187
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,750
You are welcome.

188
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,830
Leave the rest to me.

189
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,350
You don't need to worry about Xie Yi.

190
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,830
She won't trouble you again.

191
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,230
Then I have to tell Jiang Bo.

192
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,400
He doesn't need to

193

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,720
keep quiet online,

385
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,590
she can easily distance herself

386
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
from this situation.

387
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,960
Rui,

388
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,000
can you help me check

389
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,920
if Qi Lian is here?

390
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,030
Go.

391
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,960
I'll just say it.

392
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,200
I hope you can

393
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,270
ask your boyfriend to stop.

394
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,760
[Fan Xiaoxiao schemed
to make Jiang Bo a star.]

395
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,000
Jiang Bo revealed his secret

396
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,000
he had kept for many years

397
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,960
without hesitation

398
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,000
to help you out.

399
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,000
But you sold him out

400
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,550
and made him quit the industry.

401
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,110
That's not true.

402
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,550
It's your setup yesterday

403
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,550
that implicated Jiang Bo.

404
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,790
Seems like you need

405
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
someone cover for you.

406
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,110
Did you leak this news

407
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,110
to the media?

408
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,350
My future

409
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,310
is in Ms. Fan's hands.

410
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,270
I can't get benefits

411
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,480
by doing so.

412
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If you have an ounce of decency,

413
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,830
tell your boyfriend to stop.

414
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,000
I know what he's up to.

415
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,750
It will kill Jiang Bo.

416
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,350
Get out.

417
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,240
I don't want to talk to you.

418
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,880
Go.

419
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,720
For so many years,

420
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,510
Ms. Fan has been pushing him

421
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,750
to give up his makeup career.

422
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,550
Whenever he has a chance

423
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,350
to stand out,

424
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,960
Ms. Fan always puts a stop to it.

425
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,160
When they were

426
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,270
at their worst fight,

427
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,680
Ms. Fan

428
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,350
almost broke his hand.

429
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,310
But he still persevered.

430
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
He once told me that

431
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,720
he wanted to gradually

432
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,680
break free from Ms. Fan.

433
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,070
But because of you,

434
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,350
he had to confront Ms. Fan

435
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,240
earlier than planned,

436
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,000
and now it's all messed up.

437
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,310
You know the sacrifices I've made

438
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,480
to keep this secret

439
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,350
for so many years.

440
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,550
Now, you're asking me
to throw it all away

441
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
for the sake of Jiang Xiaoyuan?

442
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,680
Do you forget

443
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,790
that I gave everything

444
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,830
you have now?

445
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,070
(You owe me this.)

446
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,110
Go away.

447
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,550
Don't leave me.

448
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,440
Let me go.

449
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:06,830
I...

450
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,680
Where are you going?

451
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,110
I'll go wherever I want.

452
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,070
Leave me alone.

453
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,720
(He promised me to stay)

454
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,000
(if we have a kid.)

455
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,200
(But he's gone)

456
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,480
(even though we adopted you.)

457
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Mom, don't cry.

458
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,240
Dad has left,

459
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,750
but I won't.

460
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,000
I'll always be here with Mom.

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
Yummy！

462
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,550
(Can you help Mom)

463
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,110
(through this tough time?)

464
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,830
They're checking my account
every single day.

465
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,350
I'm worn out.

466
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,880
You are my only family

467
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,240
in this world.

468
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,270
If you don't help me,

469
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,750
I might be done for

470
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,070
in a couple of days.

471
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,110
(Facing days of questioning,)

472
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,830
(Mammoth Games)

473
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
(responds today.)

474
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,070
According to reports,

475
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,110
Tonight, Mammoth Games will unveil

476
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
(the gaming capsule of Noah's Ark,)

477
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
(accompanied by a positive response)

478
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,240
(to the previous online concerns.)

479
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,750
How do you feel? Better now?

480
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,720
Did you leak those news

481
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
online about Jiang Bo?

482
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,440
Qi Lian,

483
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,110
I told you his privacy

484
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,510
because I trust you.

485
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
You can't do this

486
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,240
just because

487
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,070
you want to deal with Fan Xiaoxiao.

488
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,510
You see,

489
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,510
people are saying

490
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,510
something bad about him.

491
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,790
Jiang Bo is much more complex

492
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,270
than you imagine.

493
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,070
Check this out.

494
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,790
This boy is Jiang Bo?

495
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,000
Jiang Bo was adopted

496
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,350
by Fan Xiaoxiao

497
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,680
and her first husband.

498
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,480
They are not biologically related.

499
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,000
When he was ten,

500
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
one day, a neighbor reported that

501
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Jiang Bo was going through

502
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
severe domestic violence.

503
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,310
But later,

504
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,310
when the police showed up,

505
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,480
turns out he stabbed his foster father

506
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,440
with a kitchen knife.

507
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,590
The police found out

508
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,400
he had serious PTSD

509
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
from past violence.

510
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,750
And with his neighbor's testimonies,

511
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,000
they ended up saying
it was self-defense.

512
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,350
After that,

513
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,000
he spent four years

514
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,880
in a mental rehab center

515
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
before getting back to a regular life.

516
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,920
But by that time, Fan Xiaoxiao

517
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,830
got married again.

518
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,920
She didn't tell her second husband

519
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,000
anything about Jiang Bo.

520
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,240
After that, Fan Xiaoxiao gradually

521
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,590
kept Jiang Bo as a secret
from the outside world.

522
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,640
So, that's the beginning

523
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,310
of his troubled teenager life.

524
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
He dropped out of high school,

525
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,400
then transferred to a private school,

526
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,880
and dropped out again.

527
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,960
The doctor's notes say

528
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,350
he had bipolar disorder.

529
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,240
I can tell that he is moody.

530
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,550
But overall,

531
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,440
I think he's

532
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,680
doing okay mentally.

533
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,200
I understand your concerns.

534
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,920
But from what I know about Jiang Bo,

535
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,160
he won't be like that

536
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,590
when he was a kid.

537
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,920
And,

538
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,830
if you post that,

539
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,750
- his career will be ruined.
- But don't forget,

540
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,790
Jiang Bo is on Fan Xiaoxiao's side.

541
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,830
He had bad intentions

542
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
from the start.

543
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,750
Do you want me to sit back

544
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,750
and watch while others use you,

545
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,440
but I don't do anything about it?

546
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,240
Actually, Jiang Bo explained to me.

547
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,270
He didn't use me.

548
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,510
(Hello?)

549
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,720
(Hey, bro.)

550
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,680
(Professor Lu)

551
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,960
(got some news about Noah.)

552
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,160
Qi Lian,

553
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,160
sorry to keep you waiting.

554
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,830
Professor Lu,

555
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,240
this is...?

556
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,550
Let me introduce you.

557
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,550
This is Mr. Bai Yuanshan.

558
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,310
He was an investor

559
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,960
of Light Laboratory,

560
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,160
and one of Noah's earliest supporters.

561
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
He's probably the person

562
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,590
who knows the Lighthouse system best.

563
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,200
Nice to meet you.

564
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,830
Please have a seat.

565
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,550
After all these years,

566
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,160
I never expected anyone would still be

567
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,440
paying attention to this.

568
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,920
What do you want to know?

569
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,030
Feel free to ask.

570
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,550
Do you know where is Noah?

571
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
I've looked for him for many years.

572
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,350
But I've got nothing.

573
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Noah...

574
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,590
passed away five years ago.

575
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,590
After the closure of Light Laboratory,

576
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,200
Noah planned to ship the Lighthouse's

577
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,240
cabin equipment,

578
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,720
research materials and experimental data

579
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,440
to the United States

580
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,400
in search of new funding.

581
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,310
He was on the transport truck,

582
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,270
had an accident halfway,

583
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,030
and he fell off a cliff.

584
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
Everything was ruined.

585
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,880
Did you...

586
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
Find his body?

587
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,720
The police went down to the cliff,

588
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,070
found him,

589
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,590
and did a DNA test.

590
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,790
Other friends and I

591
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,350
laid him to rest.

592
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,160
The current Noah's Ark

593
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,270
of Mammoth Games

594
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,750
is actually a plagiarism of

595
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,000
the Lighthouse System

596
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,110
from the former Light Laboratory.

597
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,480
Unfortunately,

598
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,400
the Lighthouse System

599
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,880
only left a few records.

600
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,720
We don't have enough evidence
to sue them.

601
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,680
I still remember someone

602
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,720
named Fan Xiaoxiao

603
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,030
once came to Noah.

604
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,030
She wanted to acquire Light Laboratory,

605
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,550
but Noah turned her down.

606
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,350
I don't know

607
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,440
how she managed to

608
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:10,960
copy the core code

609
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,270
of the Lighthouse.

610
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,160
Technically,

611
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,680
Noah wouldn't be so careless.

612
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,030
Noah's Chinese name...

613
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,110
Was Xu Jingyang, right?

614
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,960
Do you even know this?

615
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,270
He was a Chinese American.

616
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,960
When he was young,

617
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,270
he was adopted by a white couple.

618
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,960
But he did have a Chinese name,

619
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,440
which is Xu Jingyang.

620
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,550
An artificial dimple.

621
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,070
You're back.

622
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,310
Why didn't you come in?

623
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,790
What's going on?

624
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,510
I went to meet someone

625
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,880
who knows Xu Jingyang,

626
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,680
and learned something

627
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,960
about him.

628
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,240
That's great.

629
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Why are you crying?

630
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,440
I've looked for him

631
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,720
for so long,

632
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,070
but I'll never have a chance

633
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,070
to meet him.

634
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,270
What happened to him?

635
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,310
He died.

636
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,790
Don't cry.

637
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,790
Don't cry.

638
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,480
Don't cry.

639
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,030
So Fan Xiaoxiao stole

640
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,160
the core code

641
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,920
of Xu Jingyang's Lighthouse System

642
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,160
and secretly conducted

643
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,110
her own research?

644
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,550
Exactly.

645
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,480
Mr. Bai told me that

646
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,750
although Noah's Ark

647
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,310
is just a gaming capsule,

648
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,160
its system settings

649
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,750
and hardware technology

650
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,000
are quite similar to
the Lighthouse System.

651
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,240
The only difference is that

652
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,070
Noah's Ark didn't mention anything

653
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,110
about memory intervention.

654
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,920
That's strange.

655
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,240
How did Fan Xiaoxiao know that

656
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,040
Xu Jingyang was working on

657
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,310
this research?

658
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,200
Perhaps even Professor Lu

659
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,240
wasn't fully aware of that.

660
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,920
Xu Jingyang turned down

661
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,520
Fan Xiaoxiao,

662
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,630
then he got into a car accident.

663
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,280
The dead can not give witness.

664
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,240
She stole Xu Jingyang's efforts

665
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,870
for dirty things and money.

666
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I must find evidence

667
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,440
to make her stop.

668
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,150
Do you have something on your mind?

669
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,520
I'm worried doing this

670
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,150
might put you in danger.

671
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:56,960
Well,

672
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,070
I'm going to interview

673
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,000
Fan Xiaoxiao tomorrow.

674
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,110
You can come with me.

675
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,270
If I don't guess wrong,

676
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Jiang Bo will be there.

677
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,670
Tell him everything you want to,

678
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,070
and then let it go.

679
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,840
OK.

680
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,480
[Nanshanli House]

681
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,710
When we get in, you take Fan Xiaoxiao,

682
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
and I'll find Jiang Bo.

683
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,230
Play it by ear.

684
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,710
Although we have the interview
as a cover,

685
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,630
Fan Xiaoxiao won't easily

686
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,270
give us the opportunity

687
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,440
to find Jiang Bo.

688
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,480
Let's go.

689
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:02,920
Mr. Qi,

690
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,590
having your girlfriend around

691
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,800
at work doesn't seem appropriate,

692
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,270
does it?

693
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,070
Seems like Ms. Fang

694
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,070
knows us well.

695
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,110
But I didn't invite you.

696
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,230
Please send her out.

697
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,670
I'm here to meet Mr. Jiang.

698
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,920
I have some work hand-over matters,

699
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
and I need to talk to him

700
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,960
face to face.

701
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,230
He is not here.

702
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,070
Really?

703
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,480
Then I have to call the police.

704
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,840
I haven't reached him

705
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,630
for two days.

706
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,360
Oh, Qi Lian,

707
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,550
did you turn on your recorder?

708
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,000
Yes.

709
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,550
Ms. Fan,

710
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,670
asking him to come down for a while

711
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,000
won't be too much trouble, right?

712
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,000
Well, since you are so insistent,

713
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,750
I'll be honest with you.

714
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,190
He's upstairs. But he can't meet you.

715
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,150
Mr. Qi,

716
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,270
please note down

717
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,590
what I'm about to say

718
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,360
in your report as well.

719
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,920
Jiang Bo

720
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,230
has severe bipolar disorder.

721
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,480
I don't want him

722
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,110
to stay indoors all the time

723
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,440
or fully

724
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,520
integrate into society.

725
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,070
Also, I don't want unrelated people

726
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,150
bothering him because of me.

727
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,230
I also found an old story

728
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,520
that you've been hiding.

729
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,190
When Jiang Bo was ten,

730
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,800
he stabbed his foster father

731
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,040
and was sent to a mental rehab center.

732
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,750
That dead man is also a makeup artist.

733
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,840
I remember he was amazing.

734
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,550
Unfortunately, later on,
there were constant scandals.

735
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,750
He had trouble with alcohol,

736
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,840
engaged in gambling,

737
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,670
domestic violence,

738
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,190
and even had extramarital affairs.

739
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,480
You must

740
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,440
hate this husband.

741
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,190
Have you ever wished more than once

742
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,270
that you could just stab him to death

743
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,630
without going to jail?

744
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,920
But you have a ten-year-old son

745
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,920
with minor mental issues.

746
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,480
As for doing this thing,

747
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,750
no one is more suitable than him.

748
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,150
Mom, I'm back.

749
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,110
Bo,

750
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,750
Mom didn't mean to do this.

751
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,070
The police will be here soon.

752
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,070
You can't not say

753
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,190
it was me. Do you hear me?

754
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,400
Do you hear me?

755
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,230
You hear me?

756
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,480
You hear me!

757
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,920
This must be the reason that

758
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,670
you've been hiding the fact that
Jiang Bo is your son.

759
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,150
Of course,

760
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,440
these are just

761
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,480
my personal speculations,

762
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,710
and don't hold much weight.

763
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,000
But once they become public,

764
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,070
they can spread like wildfire
and are hard to control.

765
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,550
Ms. Fan,

766
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,440
we just want to meet Jiang Bo.

767
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,670
Isn't this request reasonable?

768
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,590
You've been beating around the bush,

769
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,040
all this just to see Jiang Bo, right?

770
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,550
Fine.

771
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,070
Zhou,

772
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,670
you take Miss Jiang

773
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,230
to meet Jiang Bo now.

774
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,480
Let her see for herself

775
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,840
whether I'm lying or not.

776
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,150
This way please, Miss Jiang.
