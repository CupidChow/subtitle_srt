00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,320

Then turn right.

112
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,520
This is weird.

113
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,120
It's so deserted,

114
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,910
doesn't seem like there's someone here.

115
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,520
Why isn't he handling

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,640
his own clients?

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,230
Something came up

118
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,230
and he had to take care of it.

119
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,350
There you are.

120
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,470
Just give me a moment.

121
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,760
I'll finish up soon.

122
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,680
Sir, your car

123
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,520
is blocking the truck unloading.

124
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,030
Please move it.

125
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,080
I'll be right back.

128

130
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,030
is not ready to be removed.

131
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,080
We may need a few more days
of observation.

132
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm running out of time.

133
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,150
You must get that chip

134
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,080
for me!

135
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,200
I just need the data.

136
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,960
I don't care

137
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,030
if she lives or dies.

138
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,030
Ms. Fan,

139
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,120
we've held on

140
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,910
for this long.

141
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,120
It would be better to keep it.

142
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,840
I've observed Jiang Xiaoyuan

143
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,120
and I'm certain

144
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,200
she's reaching

145
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,120
the tipping point.

146
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,030
We must wait for her to overcome it.

147
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,150
Only then will our data

148
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,150
be useful.

149
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,150
I don't have time!

150
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,720
Ms. Fan,

151
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,270
Jiang Xiaoyuan and Qi Lian

152
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,200
are here now.

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
What is Qi Lian doing here?

154
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,000
Bo came to me

155
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,910
with a recorder.

156
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,910
And now Qi Lian is here?

157
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,390
What are you thinking about?

158
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,390
We are totally in a mess now!

159
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,750
I'm sorry, Ms. Fan.

160
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,000
Li Qian was with them

161
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,960
at that time.

162
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,150
I was afraid that

163
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,080
if I didn't bring him here,

164
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,870
he might call the police.

165
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,840
He's always in touch with the police.

166
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,670
If he goes missing,

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,720
will they come

168
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
knocking on my door?

169
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,480
Can you think

170
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,790
before you act?

171
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,840
And you.

172
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I want the data

173
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,440

174
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,320
Ms. Fan,

175
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,120
I've got an idea

176
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,080
that might speed up

177
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,510
Miss Jiang reaching the tipping point.

178
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,030
What is it?

179
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,080
Intense external stimuli.

180
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,390
Everyone, get out.

181
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,750
Without my command,

182
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,360
no one can come in.

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

184
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,960
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

185
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,790
you are good,

186
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,600
making two men

187
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,030
all over you.

188
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,120
Even my son,

189
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,870
whom I've raised for years,

190
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,000
has broken ties with me because of you.

191
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,870
Today,

192
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,270
your good luck will come to an end.

193
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,080
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

194
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,670
you've always been arrogant.

195
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,720
I despise people like you

196
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,080
the most.

197
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,790
But,

198
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,720
I can stand tall

199
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,080
because of people like you.

200
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,630
I'll make you regret being alive.

201
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,150
Who's this guy?

202
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,080
He is so handsome.

203
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,030
Do you wish

204
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,360
not to see him disfigured?

205
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,150
No,

206
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,630
that won't hurt you.

207
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,270
If he hurts,

208
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,720
you'll be hurt,

209
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,600
right?

210
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,390
You're also doing this?

211
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,550
Are you betraying me as well?

212
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,790
Jiang Bo,

213
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,360
you are really

214
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,870
letting me down.

215
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,720
How can you do this to Mom?

216
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,910
It's punishment for him...

217
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,360
Mother...

218
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,960
And all of you.

219
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,670
Mother,

220
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,510
I'm begging you.

221
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,550
Please,

222
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,000
don't hurt them.

223
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,150
Please, mother.

224
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,600
You are begging me?

225
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,630
Mother!

226
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,790
You all come and beg me!

227
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,120
Come and beg me!

228
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,120
Beg me!

229
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,870
Beg me!

230
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,870
Mother!

231
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,550
Stop it!

232
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
You are crazy!

233
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,910
Crazy!

234
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,240
Fan Xiaoxiao,

235
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,670
you killed Xu Jingyang

236
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,910
and stole his work.

237
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,480
You use the Lighthouse System

238
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,080
as a tool for murder.

239
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,870
I...

240
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,240
I swore.

241
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,720
When I got you,

242
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,790
it would be my chance

243
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,270
to get justice for Xu Jingyang!

244
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,000
Qi Lian,

245
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,790
let her go.

246
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,870
Leave her to the police.

247
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
If you kill her,

248
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
what will Xiaoyuan do?

249
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,870
Xiaoyuan.

250
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,070
No matter what happens today,

251
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,640
go for your dreams.

252
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,590
Remember that!

253
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,680
Mother!

254
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,030
How do you know Xu Jingyang?

255
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,030
How do you know Xu Jingyang?

256
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,720
You are User 001,

257
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,240
right?

258
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,310
Are you User 001?

259
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,790
You are the only one

260
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,790
who made it。

261
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,830
Are you?

262
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,400
Are you?

263
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,160
Tell me!

264
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,510
Tell me!

265
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,350
Tell me

266
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,550
how did you make it?

267
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,400
Tell me.

268
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,790
Tell me.

269
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,790
Tell me!

270
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,200
Tell me!

271
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,750
Mother...

272
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,790
Tell me now!

273
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,200
You...

274
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,720
Don't move!

275
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,510
Call the ambulance.

276
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,110
Go get them.

277
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,510
Let me go!

278
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,680
Let me go!

279
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,680
Hurry up!

280
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:53,880
Move!

281
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Let me go!

282
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,440
Fast!

283
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Let me go!

284
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,720
Take them now!

285
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,270
Qi Lian...

286
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,750
Qi Lian!

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,070
(Thankfully, Miss Zhou)

288
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,590
(called us just in time.)

289
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
(Otherwise, things could)

290
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,000
(have gone really bad today.)

291
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,750
Move it on over!

292
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,720
Hold on.

293
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,790
Xiaoyuan,

294
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,550
I don't want you

295
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
to leave any regrets.

296
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,790
Promise me,

297
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,830
you'll go to the finals

298
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,270
and prove yourself.

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,400
You can come in now.

301
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,160
Don't worry.

302
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,750
(I don't want you)

303
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,270
(to leave any regrets.)

304
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400

(No matter what happens today,)

307
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,830
(go for your dreams.)

308
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,680
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

309
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,790
the channel is created

310
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,310
for you.

311
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,110
When can we go back?

312
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,750
Please take your position.

313
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,640
Quickly.

314
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,550
What's wrong with her?

315
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,550
Is she okay?

316
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,830
Are you okay?

317
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
What's going on?

318
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Is she feeling unwell?

319
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,720
Go back

320
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,110
and be a princess.

321
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,830
Isn't that good?

322
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,350
You can be at the forefront

323
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,750
of the fashion circle

324
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,960
without joining any competitions.

325
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,000
By then, Galaxy Magazine

326
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,920
will have to beg you

327
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
to design its cover.

328
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,480
Look at you.

329
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,830
You must be tired.

330
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,920
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

331
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,880
stop it.

332
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,590
The channel is ready.

333
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,000
We're running out of time.

334
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:33,960
Come.

335
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,200
Come with me.

336
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,440
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

337
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,240
no one can control you.

338
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,550
The current you is the real you.

339
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,960
Only you

340
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,240
can save yourself.

341
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,720
(Calm down.)

342
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,110
(Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

343
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,030
(you can do this.)

344
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,830
I'm right here.

345
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,880
I'll help you out.

346
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,640
I just know that

347
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,550
I'm your friend and

348
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,240
should be here with you now.

349
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,510
Would it kill you to wait?

350
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,110
Do you want to

351
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,720
risk your hand

352
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,310
and miss being a makeup artist?

353
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,750
You're a restless girl.

354
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,270
It's not you

355
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,200
if you really like something

356
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,960
but you let it go.

357
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,550
Take care of yourself.

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,480
Don't have too much takeout food.

359
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Remember to drink water.

360
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,510
Don't worry about everything at home.

361
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,550
I went to the salon,

362
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,590
but you were not there.

363
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,030
I thought you...

364
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you worried about me?

365
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,640
Oh, come on.

366
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,790
I can keep them as memories

367
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,550
when I go back.

368
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,350
When you woke up in the hospital,

369
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,790
I just knew

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,750

377

Officer Chen,

378
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,590
what about Fan Xiaoxiao?

379
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
She is suspected of intentional injury

380
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
and has been officially probed

381
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,790

Mammoth Games

384
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,310
has been seized.

385
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,640
Huo Boyu's case is likely

386
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,000
connected to hers as well.

387
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,440
After her ex-husband's death,

388
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,240
she inherited the Galaxy Studio

389
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
and then found a gaming company.

390
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,110
According to Miss Zhou,

391
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,590
Fan Xiaoxiao has serious

392
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,590
paranoid delusions

393
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,030
and schizophrenia.

394
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,880
After Fan Xiaoxiao fell ill,

395
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,480
Miss Zhou took charge of all companies

396
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,680
except Mammoth.

397
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,790
But Fan Xiaoxiao invested the profits

398
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,510
into Light Laboratory.

399
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,510
Did she admit

400
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,680
that she killed

401
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,680
Xu Jingyang?

402
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
Yes, she did.

403
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,960
She said that

404
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,550
she didn't intentionally

405
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,240
kill Xu Jingyang.

406
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,920
It was an accident.

407
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,790
We carefully checked the main server

408
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
of the Lighthouse System.

409
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,720
It seems

410
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,240
Fan Xiaoxiao may have a point.

411
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,510
We found an encrypted audio file

412
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,350
on the main server.

413
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,240
After the technical analysis,

414
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,030
turns out it's a message

415
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,790
from Xu Jingyang to you

416
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,680
before his death.

417
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,920
You can have it.

418
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,750

419
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,110

420
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,030
(I want to give you something.)

421
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,960
(But unexpectedly,)

422

(it's also the last time.)

423
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,350
(It ends like this.)

424
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,790

431

She's a talented newcomer

477
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,390

Please come up and accept your award.

Hey,

483
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,870
are you jumping off

484
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,480
just because you didn't win?

485
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,200
I'm not.

486
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,790

I'll definitely be the winner.

490
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,790
You're just boasting.

491
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,390
The final competition was fair.

497

498
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,200
Did you forgive her?

499
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,040
Mr. Jiang,

500
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,630
Ms. Fan slit her wrists.

501
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,520
Mr. Jiang,

502
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,070
there's no deep-seated hatred
between mother and son.

503
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,920
Even though Ms. Fan may be

504
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,830
strict with you at times,

505
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,280
deep down,

506
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,390
she cares about you.

507
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,110
She raised you up on her own.

508
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,110
You can't forget

509
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,920
about it, right?

510
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,590
That's it.

511
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,960
That's the excuse

512
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,110
to manipulate me every time.

513
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,550
I'm sorry.

514
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,830
But ever time Ms. Fan falls ill,

515
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,870
she avoids everyone else,

516
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,680
insisting on seeing you.

517
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,480
Maybe she always sees you

518
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,870
as her closest person

519
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,960

521
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,830
(I've never hated her.)

522
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,790
(She's just sick,)

523
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,110
(very sick.)

524
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,680
(For her, the Lighthouse System)

525
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
(might be the only hope)

526
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,240
(to get her through this.)

527
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,350
(She lost her mind)

528
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,920
(in extreme pain.)

529
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,440
(She is my mother.)

530
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,960
And also,

531
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,110
she's received

532
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,110
the deserved consequences.

533
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,070

534

535
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,750
I still want to be your assistant.

536
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,960
You wish.

537
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,320
Can you handle it without me?

538
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,550
Xiaoyuan's right.

539
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,920

540
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,480
You always agree with whatever she says.

541
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,440

542
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,590

even though Xiaoyuan didn't win,

547
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,800
she surpassed her own limits

548
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,110

550
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,800

583
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,150
Xiaoyuan.

584
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,630
Oh, my sweetie.

585
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,630
Good.

586
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,550
My granddaughter looks so pretty.

587
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,040
Good.

588
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,960
I'm so happy that

589
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,630
you've come back home.

590
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,270
Look at this.

591
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,800
What is it?

592
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,750
Look.

593
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,000
So many fireworks!

594
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,630
I bought the big ones.

595
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,320
I love this one, this one,

596
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,880

597
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,550
Are you hungry?

598
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:18,710
Grandma,

599
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,070
happy new year.

600

I had a dream yesterday.

651
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,670
I wasn't a makeup artist.

652
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,110
I worked as a stylist

653
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,440
in Fangzhou's salon.

654
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,360
That's okay.

655
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,270
You'd definitely be

656
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,360
an excellent stylist.

657
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,670
Not bad.

658
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,360
I became the chief stylist,

659
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,710
serving customers everyday,

660
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,960
and mentoring newcomers.

661
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,960
Watching customers in the salon,

662
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,960
coming and going,

663
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,710
I gradually got used to

664
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,070
that unchanging life.

665
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,440
Until one day,

666
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,590
I was hit by a car.

667
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,630
Then you wake up?

668
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,320
Then I had another dream.

669
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,960
I didn't participate in

670
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,190
the Lighthouse System experiment.

671
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,040
Grandma didn't make it

672
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,880
and passed away.

673
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
I was all alone in this world,

674
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,440
lonely for a long time.

675
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
Finally, I went back to Luoshan.

676
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,880
I even met you.

677
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,270
But...

678
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,550
You married someone else.

679
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,110
Were you sad?

680
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,840
So sad.

681
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,190
Luckily, it was just a dream,

682
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,150
or I would be sad as well.

683
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,550
After waking up,
I couldn't help but wonder

684
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,040
if there's a predestined rail

685
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,550
in life,

686
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,800
or

687
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,920
if we simply

688
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,040
pick one rail

689
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,550
from all available ones,

690
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,440
regardless of whether
it's right or wrong.

691
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,480
The choices of life

692
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,710
are not absolutes right or wrong.

693
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,270
That's right.

694
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,590
As ordinary people,

695
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,750
we don't have many opportunities

696
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,710
to judge right from wrong.

697
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,000
We can only persist in

698
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,070
our own rails of life.

699
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,750
Look at rich Jiang Xiaoyuan

700
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,480
and the struggling one.

701
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,840
Everyone's starting line
of life is different.

702
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,480
But as long as you work hard,

703
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,110
you can control your own life.

704
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,520
Just like you are now.

705
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Although I don't know

706
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,590
if the rail I'm on

707
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,520
is the only right one,

708
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,520
I believe that

709
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,190
as long as I keep going,

710
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,190
and be more brave

711
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,710
facing challenges,

712
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,670

713
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,400
And I know one thing for sure.
