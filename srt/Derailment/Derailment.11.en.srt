00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,750
Let's start our class now,

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
beginning with
an introduction to cosmetics.

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,110
The term

7
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,670
[Table of Contents]
"cosmetics"

8
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,750
originates from ancient Greek.

9
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,110
(This is such a basic course.)

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
(I guess he's here to fool us)

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,000
(and get money from the company.)

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,640
Through cosmetics,
we can enhance our strengths,

13
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,670
conceal flaws,

14
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,830
ultimately achieving

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,670
the goal of beauty.

16
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,030
I believe that many of you

17
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,030
already have some understanding

18
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,030
of cosmetics.

[When do you finish your class?]
However, today,

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,510
[I'll be leaving in half an hour.]
we will

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,960
try to

22
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,800
understand it comprehensively

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
from a fundamental aspect.

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,030
According to the regulations

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200

of Quality Supervision

That student.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,840
Who gives you the permission

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,350
to leave early?

33
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,030
Mr. Jiang.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,710
I have something urgent.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,840
Can I leave first?

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,470
No.

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,840
Go back and sit down.

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,520
Why not?

40
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,320
Since we're here

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
just to go through the motions,

42
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,430
why make things difficult
for each other?

43
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,640
If you force me to stay here

44
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,040
and listen to you read

45
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,710
this uninformative
popular science knowledge,

46
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,430
what's the point of that?

47
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,680
From your tone,

48
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,790
you seem dissatisfied

49
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,790
with what I'm teaching.

50
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,870
So, you didn't know that before.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,870
Everyone here

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,790
comes from various branches,

53
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,950
hoping to learn

54
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,510
practical skills

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,560
within two weeks

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,480
to provide services to customers
when they go back.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,790
With your teaching speed,

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,480
we won't be able
to get started next year.

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,680
So?

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,680
So what?

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,200
So,

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,480
you can teach for money,

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,680
and I'll skip classes.

64
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,150
Let's not interfere with each other.

65
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,640
But if you have to make a fuss

66
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,000
about attendance rates,

67
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,430
I'll consider reporting
the quality of your classes

68
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,150
to the company.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,870
You seem confident

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,870
in your abilities.

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,040
Have you studied in other places before?

72
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,120
No,

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,510
but at least I can distinguish

74
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,590
between substance and nonsense.

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Fine.

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,400
Give me a makeover.

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,360
If you do it well,

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,310
I'll let you skip class today.

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,360
Really?

80
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,520
Of course.

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
If you do it well,

82
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,800
it means my class

83
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,680
won't help you.

84
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,840
You can skip class

85
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,870
as you want,

86
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,430
and I'll take your advice

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,750
to adjust the teaching plan.

88
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,430
But if you don't do it well...

89
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,750
There's nothing I can't do well.

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,400
Let's get started.

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,400
I didn't bring any make-up,

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
so the theme and time

93
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,590
are unlimited.

94
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,310
Show me

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,630
what you got.

96
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Any way I want?

97
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,150
Any way you want.

98
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,470
Can I redo your hair?

99
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,310
I said do what you want,

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
as long as you can handle it.

101
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,960
Okay.

102
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,470
That's impressive.

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,190
On the first day of class,

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,280
she dares to challenge the teacher.

105
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,560
Do you think she can make it?

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,000
Take a look.

107
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,430
Is Jiang Sam this handsome?

108
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,870
She's good.

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,120
Who did you learn from?

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,080
I didn't learn from anyone.

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
I figured it out myself.

112
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,840
Considering your face shape,

113
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,270
facial proportions,

114
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,720
and the optical effects

115
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,430
of your contour,

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,190
I think this makeup style

117
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,070
suits you best.

118
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,830
But if you still prefer

119
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,800
your original look,

120
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,430
I can't do anything about it.

121
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,800
After all,

122
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,310
everyone's aesthetic preferences

123
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,310
are different.

124
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,560
You talked about facial contours

125
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,680
and optical effects.

126
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Did you study art before?

127
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,120
So what if I did?

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,950
Can I leave now?

129
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,160
[Beichen Electronics]

130
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,430
Is this the manufacturer

131
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,630
of the locator?

132
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,630
Yes.

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,190
Those two locators in the phone

134
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,630
should be customized.

135
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,720
Due to protection

136
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
of trade secrets,

137
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,270
a big company like this

138
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,190
won't give out
customer information easily.

139
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
What if we report to the police,

140
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,680
saying we're being tracked,

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,480
and ask them for information?

142
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,190
Then the police will ask you

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,310
how you got the phone.

144
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,240
Are you going to tell them

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,240
that Xu Jingyang gave it to you?

146
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,160
How are you going to explain about

147
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,950
Xu Jingyang?

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,360
A time traveler?

149
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,000
What should we do then?

150
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,750
Can you use a camera?

151
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Don't look down on me.

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,070
From now on,

153
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,270
you're my assistant.

154
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,310
Even though it's self-media,

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,480
you should look professional.

156
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Take the camera,

157
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,630
and when I tell you to take photos,

158
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,430
just do it.

159
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,360
Understand?

160
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,750
I don't.

161
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,480
Well,

162
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,310
after eight hours of rescue,

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,310
the stranded Sousa chinensis

164
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,430
was finally rescued.

165
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,430
The rescuer told us

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
that the reason

167
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,070
they could find the dolphin in time

168
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,480
was because

169
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,830
it had a locator

170
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,190
implanted in its body a year ago.

171
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
And this locator

172
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
is a product

173
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,390
produced by your company.

174
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,070
That's right.

175
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,310
It's indeed

176
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,310
a product of our company.

177
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
I remember it.

178
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Mr. Zhong.

179
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,360
As you know,

180
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,120
Sousa chinensis has always been known

181
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,390
as the "panda of the sea."

182
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,510
Rescuing such an animal

183
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,430
has made a significant contribution

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,190
to the protection

185
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
of endangered species.

186
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,950
Can you tell us about

187
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,270
the collaboration between your company

188
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,390
and the relevant organizations?

189
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
It's a good thing.

190
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,430
We're glad

191
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,360
that our products

192
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,480
could help.

193
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
This product

194
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,480
should be custom-made by our company

195
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,800
about seven or eight years ago.

196
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,630
I think there was a laboratory

197
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,480
that came to us.

198
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,630
I don't think they were doing

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
animal rescue work.

200
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,360
Do you remember

201
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,510
which lab it was?

202
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,270
I don't.

203
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,070
Why don't you wait here for a moment?

204
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,390
I'll go to the archives.

205
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,310
Okay, thank you.

206
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,920
If it was a lab,

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,190
then everything makes sense.

208
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,070
How does it make sense?

209
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,600
Think about it,

210
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,430
what if they are

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,480
conducting

212
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,190
time travel experiments now?

213
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,800
But with the current level

214
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,920
of scientific research,

215
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,190
there is no laboratory in the world

216
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,310
that has mastered

217
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,510
the technology of time travel.

218
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,560
They must have kept
their research secret,

219
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
so you wouldn't know.

220
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,920
Moreover,

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,720
the lab he just mentioned

222
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,190
must have had

223
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,190
the locators customized

224
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,630
with an ordinary reason.

225
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,310
If we know

226
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,800
which lad it is,

227
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,510
we can

228
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,390
come to them

229
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
and tell them

230
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,190
to terminate the experiment immediately

231
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
and send me home.

232
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,600
Zhang.

233
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,150
I remember clearly

234
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,000
that I filed 112094.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,910
Why can't I find it?

236
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
Check the surveillance footage for me.

237
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
[Police]

238
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
What happened to Mr. Zhong?

239
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
We're his guests.

240
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,630
Let us through.

241
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,750
No, you can't go through.

242
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,240
We're here to do an interview.

243
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,550
You still can't go through.

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,080
The police are sealing off the scene.

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,750
No one can leave.

246
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,870
Go back.

247
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,480
We're close to the answer.

248
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,750
We can't leave like this.

249
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,600
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,670
We can talk about it at home.

251
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,750
Let's get out of here first.

252
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,510
Mr. Zhong said himself

253
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,720
that he remembers the locator.

254
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,720
The answer we're looking for

255
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,550
is right here.

256
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,550
At this exact moment,

257
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,240
something happened to him

258
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,720
Don't you find it strange?

259
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,390
I think someone is trying to stop us

260
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,200
from finding the truth

261
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,360
and attacked Mr. Zhong.

262
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,670
Are you saying

263
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
that someone found out we came here

264
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,790
and beat us to...

265
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,550
Someone is following us.

266
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,750
They are monitoring us.

267
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,870
Last time we counter-located them

268
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,480
and got discovered by them.

269
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,550
Then we escaped.

270
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,750
This time in Chongqing,

271
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,150
we didn't bring a locator,

272
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,270
but they still followed us here.

273
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,150
I'm scared.

274
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,240
Don't be scared.

275
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,600
So far,

276
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,150
they haven't laid a hand on us

277
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,910
other than trying to stop us

278
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,550
from finding the truth,

279
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,440
right?

280
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,150
Do you think

281
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,120
they're trying to cover up the crime?

282
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,600
What if I become their next target...?

283
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,720
Don't scare yourself.

284
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,150
I'll check

285
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,440
what happened to Mr. Zhong later.

286
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
However,

287
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,480
I think

288
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,440
you should stop

289
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,480
getting involved in the investigation.

290
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,440
You're their target.

291
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,440
With you,

292
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,600
we may

293
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,790
never find the truth.

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,750
Will they

295
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,000
come after you?

296
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,550
If I stop investigating,

297
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,390
how can you go back?

298
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,150
Promise me,

299
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,240
if you're in danger,

300
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,270
you must call the police.

301
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,240
Let's get out of here first.

302
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,270
When are you going back to Luoshan?

303
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,390
In a couple of days. Why?

304
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,270
Nothing.

305
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,510
Are you going to

306
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,120
keep looking into that company?

307
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,840
Before I head back to Luoshan,

308
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,150
I'll come to you

309
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,840
every day

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,910
during suppertime

311
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,840
to give you an update

312
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,000
on the investigation.

313
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,360
Okay.

314
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,630
Let's keep in touch.

315
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm going home now. Bye.

316
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,550
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

317
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
Qiangzi told me the other day

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,150
that the locator could only work

319
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,000
for one year.

320
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,510
After a year,

321
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,150
the locator will stop working.

322
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
I've been thinking about it
for the last few days.

323
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,600
Why does the locator

324
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,600
only work for one year?

325
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Maybe...

326
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,150
You're saying

327
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,630
since the locator

328
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,630
can only work for one year,

329
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,080
the experiment

330
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
won't last more than a year.

331
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,120
One year later,
when the experiment is over,

332
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,200
I'll be able to go back, right?

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,630
Yes.

334
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,150
After a year,

335
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,750
even if you don't

336
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,720
find out the truth,

337
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,630
there's a good chance

338
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,670
that you'll be transported back,

339
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,270
just like what happened to Xu Jingyang.

340
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,720
Do you think so?

341
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Can I go back a year later?

342
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,790
It's just a reasonable inference.

343
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,120
A year

344
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,200
is not too long

345
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,550
or too short.

346
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,270
Use the time

347
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,240
to do something you like.

348
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,480
But I'll keep looking into it.

349
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,870
No matter what,

350
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,320
I must find Xu Jingyang.

351
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,550
Be careful.

352
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,790
Don't worry.

353
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,670
Hello, Shang.

354
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm being followed.

355
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,670
Keep an eye

356
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
on the leader of Beichen Group

357
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,510
at the hospital.

358
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,630
Why isn't Mr. Jiang here yet?

359
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,360
Did he really resign?

360
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,750
He left on his own.

361
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,790
It's normal that he doesn't dare
to come today.

362
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,080
I wonder

363
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
what kind of person will come later.

364
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,120
If it's a strict one,

365
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,670
we won't be able to slack off.

366
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,550
Yeah, what should we do?

367
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,910
Sorry to disappoint you.

368
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,790
I'm still the teacher today.

369
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,550
However, considering

370
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,750
Jiang Xiaoyuan's performance yesterday,

371
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,360
I've adjusted my teaching plan,

372
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,000
skipping the theoretical part

373
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,960
and going straight to practical exercises.

374
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,240
You're amazing.

375
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,390
Jiang Sam actually gave in

376
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,360
for you.

377
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,960
Today's lesson is on drawing eyebrows,

378
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,480
lasting two minutes.

379
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,080
After you finish watching,

380
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,790
come up and get the eyebrow pencil.

381
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,880
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

382
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,440
Aren't you going to do the demonstration?

383
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
Shouldn't you be the one
doing the demonstration?

384
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,270
Are you scared?

385
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,830
Why should I be scared?

386
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,200
You,

387
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,110
come up and be her model.

388
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,750
What type of eyebrows?

389
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,920
Standard eyebrows.

390
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,640
Then I need to change the pencil.

391
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,240
What's wrong with the one in your hand?

392
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,400
The color is wrong.

393
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,550
For Asians with warm skin tones,

394
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,960
gray as a cold color

395
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,640
will look dirty on the face.

396
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,030
I need

397
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,640
a brown-gray one.

398
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,790
Go ahead.

399
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,590
There is something I'm curious about.

400
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,750
You studied art before.

401
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Why are you doing hairdressing now?

402
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,550
Does it have anything to do with you?

403
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
Do you want to be
in the makeup business?

404
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,350
Jiang Sam wants to take you
as his student.

405
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,680
Finished.

406
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,830
The peak of the eyebrow is off.

407
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,270
The front is too wide.

408
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,400
Where it should be light is heavy,

409
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,510
and where it should be heavy is light.

410
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,720
Do it again.

411
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,680
Am I wrong?

412
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,000
Do you disagree?

413
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,640
No.

414
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,400
You're right.

415
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,590
Finished.

416
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,550
The arch is too wide,

417
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,000
the tail is too short,

418
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
and they're asymmetrical.

419
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,960
Do it again.

420
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,350
Finished.

421
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,270
Nope.

422
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,160
Finished.

Nope.

Nope.

426

Nope.

427
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,920
Nope.

428

Finished.

429
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,920
Go back.

430
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,590
I don't have time to waste with you.

431
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,510
These are the eyebrows
you drew on me yesterday.

432
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,200
Do you see any issues?

433
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,920
[Eyebrows]

434
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,750
The peak is off.

435
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,240
The front is too narrow.

436
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,830
The color is not enough,

437
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,070
and they're asymmetrical.

438
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,680
What about the base makeup?

439
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,790
You think my skin is too pale

440
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
and used the darker color,

441
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,240
but you didn't apply it

442
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,480
to my neck and the back of my ears.

443
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,200
From the side,

444
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,000
it looks like I applied
a layer of charcoal.

445
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Also, the eyeline

446
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,550
and the hairline are terrible.

447
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,240
What else can I say?

448
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,110
Nothing.

449
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,790
Makeup

450
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,070
is about enhancing one's appearance

451
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,160
according to personal preferences,

452
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,920
not judging others' appearances

453
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,550
based on personal preferences.

454
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,200
What's more,

455
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,960
with your limited skills,

456
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,680
you're not qualified to show me

457
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,790
your prejudices.

458
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,920
Do you think you won yesterday

459
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
with your terrible skills?

460
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,750
You just can't afford to lose.

461
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,270
Get out.

462
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,830
You're disrupting the class.

463
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,160
Get out.

464
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,920
Let's start.

465
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,920
I don't want to see your face

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,510
in tomorrow's class.

467
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,920
Why are you kicking me out?

468
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,590
You lost, so I make the deal.

469
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,350
Do I need a reason?

470
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,680
You made a bet with me

471
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,200
just to keep me

472
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,440
from skipping class, right?

473
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,240
From now on, I won't miss

474
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,400
any of your classes.

475
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,310
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

476
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,350
Why should I care
if you attend class or not?

477
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
I admit

478
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,550
I'm kind of arrogant,

479
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,640
and the makeup yesterday

480
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,510
is flawed.

481
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:18,960
But...

482
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,440
It's not just flawed.

483
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,350
It's worthless.

484
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,400
How is it worthless?

485
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,960
Why are you so against me?

486
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,240
With your skills,

487
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
You don't deserve my attention.

488
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,680
I see.

489
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,750
You're used to acting like a big shot

490
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,880
and making training fees easily.

491
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,750
But now you're being questioned

492
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,350
by a nobody like me.

493
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,960
You must be upset.

494
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,350
I thought you had your pride.

495
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,240

That's what

501
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,720
I hate most about you.

502
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,550
Why do you think
I should bow down to you

503
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,400
just because you gave me money?

504
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,350
Can't you live

505
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,750
without a sense of superiority?

506
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,200
You stopped me

507
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,480
only because

508
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,000
you don't want your sense of superiority

509
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,590
to be trampled on,

510
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,720
and you don't want others to find out

511
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,750
that you're worthless, right?

512
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,480
Who are you to say that about me?

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,920
Do you know me?

Don't you feel embarrassed about

516
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,790

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,920
Explain to him now

577
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,070
that there's no need
to find someone else.

578
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,270
All right.

579
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,030
I was lying.

580
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,960
I didn't tell him about you.

581
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,070
You...

582
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,400
You forgot

583
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
to tell him you're okay.

584
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,590
He's just worried about you.

585
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,350
I see.

586
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,440
The only person in the world

587
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
who's good to me

588
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,720
is Chen Fangzhou.

589
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,030
I got news

590
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,830
that Mr. Zhong

591
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,920
is still in the ICU,

592
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,880
not awake,

593
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,310
but his life

594
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,070
is no longer in danger.

595
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,480
As for what happened yesterday,

596
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,550
the police are investigating it.

597
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,960
A lot of information

598
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,160
has been completely sealed.

599
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,270
I know what happened to him yesterday

600
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
really scared you,

601
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,030
so I rushed over to tell you.

602
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,880
When he wakes up,

603
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,680
I'll find out more about the situation.

604
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
Here's the pot.

605
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,270
Enjoy.

606
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,440
Eat while it's hot.

607
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,110
You can practice later.

608
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,070
I noticed that you cut your hand

609
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,720
when you were sharpening the pencil.

610
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,160
Be careful

611
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,510
not to get an infection.

612
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,350
Thank you, ma'am.

613
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,350
You're welcome.

614
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,640
You eat first.

615
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,110
I'll make a call

616
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,790
to Chen Fangzhou.

617
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,160
After eating, I need to
practice drawing eyeliner

618
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,960
in case someone gives me
a hard time tomorrow.

619
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,070
Well,

620
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,350
are you not leaving?

621
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,440
You said yesterday

622
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,480
you didn't want to see my face,

623
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,240
but you didn't say
I couldn't attend the class.

624
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,280
[Eye Makeup]

625
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,880
Today, I'll teach you how to draw eyeline.

626
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,110
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

627
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,880
Come up and demonstrate.

628
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,030
The eyeline you drew

629
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,920
looks like it's been chewed by a dog.

630
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,110
Can't you make it look smoother?

631
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,030
Redraw it.

632
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,480
The outer line is too thick.

633
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,240
Redraw it.

634
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,880
The blending

635
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,590
looks unnatural.

636
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,440
Redraw it.

637
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,400
Redraw it.

638
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,640
You came just in time. Come in.

639
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,440
Do I look good?

640
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,760
Not bad.

641
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,880
This is my secret "Heartbreaker" makeup.

642
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,440
The base

643
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
must be light and transparent.

644
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,550
Lips and cheeks
should be naturally rosy.

645
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,800
Eyebrows should be distinct.

646
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,760
Overall,

647
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,880
it looks innocent yet subtly alluring.

648
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,280
Well,

649
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,590
have you been attracted?

650
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,440
I ordered takeout for you.

651
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,550
With my skills now,

652
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,590
I don't believe Jiang Bo will ask me

653
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,440
to redraw it again.

654
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,230
The color is not rich enough.

655
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,400

I remember when I was little,

there were many ice cream trucks here.

668
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
If I felt sad,

669
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,070
I would come over

670
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,320
and have an ice cream.

671
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,670
If I didn't want to go back,

672
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,630
I'd sit here

673
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,440
all night.

674
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,510
Didn't your family look for you?

675
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,760
No.

676
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,630
My dad is rarely at home,

677
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,030
and my mom

678
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,110
is on duty at the hospital.

679
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,190
She doesn't have time to worry about me.

680
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,960
Even I don't go back

681
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
until morning,

682
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,920
they wouldn't know.

683
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,150
I'm like you in this regard.

684
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,630
My family is the same.

685
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,400
My dad is rarely at home,

686
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,110
and my mom

687
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,030
mostly stays in the laboratory.

688
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Do you have many friends?

689
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,150
I have some.

690
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,590
Well, I'm not like you.

691
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,150
Although I have a lot of friends

692
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,110
in that world,

693
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,550
most of them play with me

694
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,030
for their own interests.

695
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,070
In fact, they don't consider me

696
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,880
as someone important.

697
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,320
I know that.

698
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,760
Except for Rui.

699
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,550
Looks like

700
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,550
you didn't have a happy time

701
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,480
in that world.

702
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,110
Well,

703
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,190
I think I was happy.

704
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,070
In that world,

705
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,960
I lacked nothing,

706
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,800
yet it felt like I had nothing.

707
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,360
No family, no friends.

708
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,550
Someone asked me

709
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,510
before

710
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,280
if I ever thought about

711
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,840
the meaning of life.

712
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,510
I didn't answer.

713
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,320
I dare not think about the answer.

714
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,710
Actually, after coming here,

715
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,070
I felt

716
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,710
a lot of warm things,

717
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,070
and I've learned a lot.

718
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,160
But I still want to go home.

719
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,710
I don't know why.

720
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,270
Even though this world

721
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,160
seems like

722
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,200
the same as before,

723
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,870
those tiny things

724
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,830
that could prove my existence

725
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,430
are gone.

726
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,870
Then I realized,

727
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,750
this is not my city.

728
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't belong here.

729
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,750
They're just a little alike.

730
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,430
Wait here for me.

731
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,350
Where are you going?

732
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,560
I'll be right back.

733
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,960
Although there is no ice cream truck,

734
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,430
at least something

735
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,960
remains the same.

736
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,600
Thank you.
