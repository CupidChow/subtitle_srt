00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,510
Well,

195
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,150
it's been a while since we gathered.

196
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
Having her wouldn't hurt.

197
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,080
Or you didn't tell her?

198
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,440
Say something.

199
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,480
Did you tell her?

200
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,510
You had this hairstyle

201
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,790
six years ago.

202
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,390
Where are you going?

203
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,240
Right here.

204
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,390
Too crowded inside.

205
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,750
It's more spacious out here.

206
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,670
Lian.

207
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,670
Lian.

208
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,120
Lian.

209
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,030
Sit.

210
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,200
Take your seat.

211
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,360
Sit.

212
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,910
Lian,

213
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,030
it's been years.

214
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,790
We knew you were busy,

215
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,670
so we didn't want to bother you.

216
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,790
Yes, Lian.

217
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,790
Qi Lian is here.

218
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,120
The dust has settled.

219
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
The past is all behind us now.

220
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,840
Everyone is doing well these years.

221
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,000
Dong's running a business

222
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,200
and got married.

223
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,510
Yong opened a courier station.

224
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,840
He's quite a busy man now.

225
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,030
San works on a construction site.

226
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,960
He is a subcontractor,

227
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,120
throwing his weight around.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,320
He's quite the character.

229
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Don't joke around.

230
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,000
I got a family to support.

231
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,720
Aren't you doing great yourself,

232
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,320
managing such a big hair salon?

233
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,360
I owe a lot to Mr. Qi for helping out,

234
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,600
both with money and energy.

235
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,510
He helped me set up the salon.

236
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
That's right.

237
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,240
Lian also lent a hand

238
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,750
with my courier station.

239
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,790
Lian also helped me...

240
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,320
Lian chipped in

241
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
for the startup money for my business.

242
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,510
That taxi...

243
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,670
Lian bought it for me.

244
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,270
That's fine.

245
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,510
We are close friends.

246
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,120
Don't make it awkward

247
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,910
and keep the gratitude in our hearts.

248
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,510
Raise your glasses,

249
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,960
to Lian.

250
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,550
Yes.

251
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,120
To Lian.

252
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,550
Right,

253
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:23,790
to Lian.

254
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,720
To Lian.

255
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,150
Qi Lian?

256
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,550
Let me fill it up for you.

257
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,720
No, thanks.

258
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,600
I've been set up.

259
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,150
She doesn't like me
smoking and drinking.

260
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,030
You are not in a relationship yet.

261
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,390
Already got... some rules?

262
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,870
Stop that.

263
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,080
I'll replace alcohol with tea.

264
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,270
Here we go.

265
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,510
Qi Lian,

266
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,480
over all these years,

267
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,600
that's in the past.

268
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,790
You've done what you could,

269
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,390
and you gave it your best shot.

270
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,630
I do think

271
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
you should let it go.

272
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,750
I've got good news.

273
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,550
I found Xu Jingyang.

274
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,000
But he's not the real Xu Jingyang.

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,880
Have you all been
hiding something from me?

276
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,350
I just want to know

277
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,880
if there any wrong with my mind

278
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
or if there's something

279
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
you're not telling me!

280
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,200
Close friends?

281
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,110
That's it, huh?

282
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,160
Lian!

283
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,720
Alright.

284
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,590
Lian!

285
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,160
After this drink,

286
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,310
we'll be strangers.

287
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,400
Lian!

288
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,240
No, Lian!

289
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,270
Lian!

290
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,480
I said we shouldn't hide it.

291
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,720
What about now?

292
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,680
There is indeed such a person.

293
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,790
But he wasn't Xu Jingyang.

294
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,830
His name was Chen Tianyang.

295
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,590
What did you say?

296
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,350
Lian,

297
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,000
did you really forget about him?

298
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,440
That day when we fought,

299
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the yellow-haired guy

300
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,070
almost pushed you off the second floor.

301
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,920
Yang pushed you away,

302
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,720
but he fell down.

303
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,480
Then he was sent to the ICU.

304
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,030
And where did he go?

305
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,720
He died.

306
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,030
What are you thinking, Xiaoyuan?

307
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,640
Grandma, have a seat right here..

308
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,480
I was thinking

309
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,000
Grandma's doing much better now,

310
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
and I can make money.

311
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,550
Things are looking up
for the days ahead.

312
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,750
When I make more money,

313
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,590
I'll take you to the city.

314
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,790
The fireworks are way more amazing.

315
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Good.

316
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,200
I can tell you've got something

317
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,880
on your mind these days.

318
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,750
I want to ask you,

319
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,030
but I can't really help.

320
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,110
Actually, I was thinking...

321
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,310
I...

322
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,000
I want to change my job.

323
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,510
Is it about work?

324
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,030
A famous makeup artist

325
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,270
wants me to join him.

326
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,310
Well,

327
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,480
I really like

328
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,240
this work.

329
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
But I'm not sure

330
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,400
whether it's reliable.

331
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,510
This job might not be

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
as steady as

333
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
working in the salon.

334
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,000
You're a restless girl.

335
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,440
You're just naturally

336
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,640
not into being steady.

337
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,790
It's not you

338
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,750
if you really like something

339
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,400
but you let it go.

340
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,790
Xiaoyuan,

341
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,240
go ahead and be wilful.

342
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,070
Grandma supports you.

343
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,310
Over these years,

344
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,000
You've suffered a lot

345
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,200
because of my illness.

346
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,880
Grandma has seen it all.

347
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,270
Xiaoyuan,

348
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,070
I'm so sorry.

349
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,680
That's okay, Grandma.

350
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,310
We are family.

351
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,310
Sweetie...

352
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,000
From now on,

353
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,550
do whatever

354
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,830
you want to do.

355
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,350
Remember that.

356
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,590
Grandma's always behind you.

357
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,070
My sweetie?

358
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,880
After Yang was taken to the hospital,

359
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
they tried hard to save him.

360
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
But he couldn't make it.

361
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,160
Later,

362
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,400
their family

363
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,790
moved away from Baiyang.

364
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,510
You were depressed for a long time

365
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,790
after knowing about this

366
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,030
You always believed that

367
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,110
it was my fault.

368
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,550
Things got worse,

369
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
so your father took you overseas

370
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,070
to see a psychiatrist.

371
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,200
And then,

372
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,310
we didn't stay in touch for many years.

373
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,310
After you returned,

374
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,720
Fatty told us

375
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,590
you had forgotten about Yang

376
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,270
and you constantly searching for someone

377
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,270
named Xu Jingyang.

378
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,030
But Yang's full name

379
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,310
was Chen Tianyang.

380
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,640
So we were thinking,

381
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,160
maybe your psychiatrist

382
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,310
hypnotized you for treatment,

383
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,400
making you forget about all of this.

384
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
I insisted that we say

385
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,440
that we don't know Xu Jingyang.

386
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,880
Anyway, in your mind,

387
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,270
Xu Jingyang is alive.

388
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,270
It's better to search for
a missing person

389
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,590
than to regret a lifetime

390
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,510
over someone who's gone.

391
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,000
Chen Tianyang...

392
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,830
Do you have his photo?

393
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,790
Hello?

394
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,030
(Are you Jiang Xiaoyuan?)

395
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,510
Yes, and you are...?

396
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,750
(Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

397
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,720
(get yourself organized)

398
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,400
(for the little sober time.)

399
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,720
(Stop digging for any more truths.)

400
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,400
(Or,)

401
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,880
(we will retaliate)

402
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,200
(against you like mad.)

403
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,510
(You go crazy alone,)

404
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,680
(or make everyone around you)

405
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,550
(die together?)

406
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,240
(It's up to you.)

407
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,400
Hello, Qi Lian.

408
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,590
Are you okay?

409
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,790
(Hi, Xiaoyuan.)

410
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,110
Fangzhou?

411
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,160
Is Qi Lian

412
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
with you now?

413
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,070
Come over quickly.

414
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,110
He's in trouble now.

415
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,680
[Hou Hot Pot]

416
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,240
Easy.

417
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,240
You didn't drink that much,

418
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,960
just two bottles.

419
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,680
Are you this drunk already?

420
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,350
Take it slow.

421
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,110
Slow down.

422
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,720
If you can't handle it,

423
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,480
just drink less.

424
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,110
Qi Lian!

425
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,030
Qi Lian! What's going on?

426
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,590
Did you call the police?

427
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,720
Xiaoyuan, why are you crying?

428
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Tell me. What's wrong with him?

429
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,310
I didn't expect that to happen.

430
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,160
He... Nothing's wrong with him.

431
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,030
He's just drunk.

432
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,200
I was kidding.

433
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,240
Here, hold him for a second.

434
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,110
I need to use the bathroom.

435
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,550
I... I really have to go.

436
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,480
Mind that step.

437
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,640
Your injury hasn't healed.

438
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,110
Let's get into the car.

439
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,350
Let's go.

440
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,550
Xiaoyuan,

441
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,070
don't go.

442
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,280
Don't leave me.

443
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,960
I'm not leaving.

444
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,110
I'll be here with you.

445
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,200
Thankfully, you're okay.

446
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,830
Actually,

447
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,390
I was so eager to uncover the truth.

448
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,110
But now, I know the truth.

449
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,680
It scares me.

450
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,280
I fear for people around me

451
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,590
will get hurt.

452
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,550
I worry about

453
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,680
what should I do

454
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,110
if one day

455
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,150
I go crazy.

Why do you sit there?

462
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
Xiaoyuan,

463
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,200
Don't sit there.

464
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,150
The ground is cold.

465
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,680
Let's go.

466
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,790
How come he is so heavy?

467
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,070
Careful.

468
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,720
What did you talk about?

469
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,310
He is so drunk now.

470
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,200
Just some past matters.

471
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,150
Something about Xu Jingyang?

472
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,520
You know him?

473
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,550
All those things are in the past.

474
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,590
Just move on, and it'll be okay.

475
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,150
So does Xu Jingyang

476
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,390
really exist?

477
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,310
Xiaoyuan,

478
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,310
you don't have to get into this.

479
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,440
And don't bring it up
in front of Qi Lian.

480
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,870
Yang has gone for many years.

481
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,720
It's time to move on.

482
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,350
Living in the present

483
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,280
is what matters most.

484
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,720
That's Qi Lian exactly.

485
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,630
He'll treat someone he cared about

486
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,480
for the rest of his life.

487
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,070
Still remember back in high school,

488
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,110
we all knew

489
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,070
that he liked you.

490
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,070
But at that time,

491
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,310
you were fully focused on your studies.

492
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,480
He didn't tell you

493
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,960
for disturbing your studies.

494
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,000
He planned to tell you

495
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,480
after the exam.

496
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,390
But who knows?

497
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,110
So many years have passed.

498
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,390
All joking aside,

499
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,680
hasn't he told you

500
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,630
about his feelings?

501
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,870
Xiaoyuan,

502
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,440
I can tell

503
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,590
that he has been waiting for you.

504
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,830
For what?

505
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,440
Waiting for you to embrace the reality,

506
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,280
and envision the future.

507
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,590
Think about it.

508
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,040
When you first came to the salon,

509
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,200
you were acting that

510
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,350
you were a stranger

511
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,200
to this world.

512
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,870
Seems you don't value real life.

513
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,630
If you like him too,

514
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,150
don't let him

515
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,280
wait in vain for you.

516
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,150
(You go crazy alone,)

517
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,200
(or make everyone around you)

518
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,070
(die together?)

519
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,720
(It's up to you.)

520
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,960
(What a pity for you waiting for me
all these years.)

521
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,200
(In the end,)

522
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,680
(the one you've been waiting for)

523
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
(will end up being crazy.)

524
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,000
Let me help you to get him inside.

525
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440
No, Fangzhou.

526
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,590
You'd better

527
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,550
take Qi Lian to your place.

528
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,790
Our home is not very peaceful lately.

529
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I'm afraid I can't have him.

530
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,630
Your home...

531
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,920
Something wrong?

532
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,520
That's just it.

533
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,040
If you have time,
take him for a walk to relax.

534
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,720
And I can figure out

535
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,760
about my stuff.

536
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,240
Then you take care.

537
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,790
If you need anything, just call me.

538
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,550
See you.

539
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:14,590
Hey, Miss.

540
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,440
You can't go in.

541
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,150
Miss!

542
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,070
Miss!

543
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,110
You can't enter the crime scene.

544
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,440
My boyfriend is there.

545
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,070
Please make way!

546
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,230
Make way!

547
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,630
Chen Fangzhou?

548
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,230
Hurry!

549
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,480
Give us a hand.

550
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,710
Qi Lian?

551
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,440
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

552
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,400
Is it you again?

553
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,550
Is this car accident

554
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,670
also related to you?

555
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,360
Did you forget

556
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,400
what I had warned you?

557
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,400
Who are you? Go away.

558
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,710
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

559
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,960
Qi Lian has finally

560
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,960
recovered not long ago

561
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,550
from the past.

562
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,000
If you can't help him,

563
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,840
stop torturing him.

564
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,960
(You go crazy alone,)

565
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,040
(or make everyone around you)

566
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,110
(die together?)

567
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
(It's up to you.)

568
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,000
(Qi Lian...)

569
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,360
(Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

570
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,670
(get yourself organized)

571
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,550
(for the little sober time.)

572
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,960
(Or,)

573
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,960
(we will retaliate)

574
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,360
(against you like mad.)

575
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,520
(No.)

576
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,840
(I have to go)

577
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,000
(as far as I can.)

578
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,480
(Only if I go,)

579
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,190
(you all can be in safe.)

580
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,590
Thanks, Granduncle Seven.

581
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,960
Sweetie, take this.

582
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
Eat it on the way.

583
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,920
Grandma,

584
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,520
remember to call me,

585
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,270
OK?

586
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,840
Of course.

587
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,960
I'll call you for sure.

588
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,960
That knitting work

589
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,150
is too straining for your eyes.

590
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,110
Don't do it and have some more relax.

591
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,480
I'll come back to see you
when I have time.

592
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,110
Good.

593
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,000
Grandma is right here for you.

594
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,480
You are Grandma's life.

595
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,400
Time to hit the road, sweetie.

596
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,880
Goodbye, Grandma.

597
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,270
Don't worry about home.

598
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,840
Get inside, Grandma.

599
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,800
It's cold out here.

600
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
Take care of yourself...

601
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,800
Take care of yourself.

602
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,800
Don't have too much takeout food.

603
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,630
Remember to drink water.

604
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,800
Don't worry about everything at home.

605
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,270
How are you doing?

606
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,000
(I'm out of the hospital,)

607
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,520
(but Qi Lian stayed.)

608
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,590
(His father just worried about
potential complications,)

609
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,000
(and he insisted to stay.)

610
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,670
But don't worry.

611
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,320
We just had some minor injuries.

612
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,670
After that accident,

614
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,360
I didn't go to visit you.

615
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,920
Don't apologize.

616
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,710
Qi Lian didn't want to to tell you

617
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,550
about the accident.

618
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,000
(He's afraid you'll worry.)

619
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,840
(Just act like you don't know, okay?)

620
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,320
Anyway, his father was there.

621
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,070
I even got a VIP ward.

622
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,920
The service is so good.

623
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,070
That's good.

624
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,190
You don't tell him

625
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,400
I resigned, don't you?

626
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,750
No.

627
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,960
But I think

628
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,630
you'd better tell him yourself.

629
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,520
(When are you going to tell him?)

630
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,920
I don't know.

631
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,230
Xiaoyuan,

632
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,670
resigning is your decision.

633
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,710
Since you've made up your mind,

634
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,440
I won't make things difficult for you.

635
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,520
(But if you find it hard out there)

636
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,360
(and want to come back,)

637
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,150
I've got your back.

638
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,550
Thank you, Fangzhou.

639
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,590
Bye.
