00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 8]

4
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,390
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

5
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,840
have you been practicing

6
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,790
here all night?

7
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,390
I don't know

8
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,520
which step went wrong.

9
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
They always look different.

10
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,750
Oh, my god.

11
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,600
Things can't be accomplished in one go.

12
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,310
And you really don't have to use

13
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,590
so many mannequin heads.

14
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,710
If not for

15
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
our friendship,

16
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,950
I'd deduct that money

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,950
from your salary.

18
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,560
But where exactly

19
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,920
did I go wrong?

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,710
You don't have to think about that now.

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,350
This won't work.

22
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,710
Learning requires consistent effort.

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,310
You can't exhaust your energy

24
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,230
all at once.

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,920
You go home...

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,000
and get some sleep.

27
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,120
Now!

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,920
Leave them there.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll tidy up later.

30
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,200
OK.

31
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,590
What a silly girl.

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,920
These are ten mannequin heads.

33
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,040
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

34
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,120
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,950
Exactly.

36
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,790
I don't know what's wrong with her.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,150
She must pass the test in one month.

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,350
That girl's so stubborn.

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
She doesn't listen to me.

40
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,840
Oh, my goodness.

41
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,120
Well,

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,240
you had a fever of 39 degrees.

43
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,400
Don't you feel that?

44
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,280
How long have I slept?

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,800
I need to go practice.

46
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,470
What? You...

47
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,630
You wait. Stop.

48
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,310
Skills aren't developed this way.

49
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,840
But I have to go to work.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
You have some rest, please.

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,430
I'll give you two days off.

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,190
Take care of your health first.

53
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,710
You're so sick right now.

54
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,960
You can't go practice like this.

55
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,910
Understand?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
I can take some medicine.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,430
I have nothing left now.

58
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,560
I don't want others to think

59
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,150
that my existence is unnecessary.

60
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,400
I must excel

61
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,360
to avoid

62
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,630
being overlooked.

63
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,800
Hey,

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,030
Xiaoyuan,

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,310
what are you talking about?

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,120
I noticed you haven't been well lately.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,430
What's going on?

68
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,400
It's not a big deal.

69
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,800
You can just tell me.

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm right here.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll help you out.

72
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,430
You don't want to hear

73
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,240
what's on my mind.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,470
Nobody in this world

75
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,080
cares about me.

76
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,870
(If you know)

77
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,360
(I'm not that Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

78
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,870
(you'll hate me just like Qi Lian does.)

79
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,520
What's on earth is going on?

80
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,080
Maybe I should have Qi Lian

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
come over and check on you?

82
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,870
Don't tell him.

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,190
Alright.

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
Then promise me

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,680
you'll take good rest at home.

86
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm off to the Salon.

87
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,680
Sure, go ahead.

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,560
I can take good care of myself.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,630
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,950
For dinner.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,270
Get out with your food.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,070
Even if you don't want to eat,

93
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:31,870
that's her body.

94
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
She needs nutrition.

95
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,630
And don't let me repeat

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
the same words.

97
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,240
Eat.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,190
Is it worth starving yourself

99
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,120
just to be mad at them?

100
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,680
Why do both of you

101
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
like acting on tough?

102
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,040
Take a good look at

103
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,560
who's in front of you.

104
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,430
Eat.

105
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,830
Eat!

106
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,240
Alright,

107
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,600
you brought this upon yourself.

108
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,360
Leave me alone.

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Don't touch me!

110
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,720
You only know how to bully me.

111
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,680
Why not go and figure things out!

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
You know that I should not be blamed

113
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
for space traveling.

114
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,920
Why take it out on me?

115
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,630
Hello,

116
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,720
Grandma Jiang.

117
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,440
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

118
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,910
Grandma Jiang fell seriously ill

119
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,790
this afternoon

120
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
and has been urgently

121
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
taken to the hospital.

122
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
Luckily, she pulled through.

123
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,720
Can you give her a call?

124
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,720
Consider it a comfort for her.

125
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
I comfort her,

126
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,320
but who comforts me?

127
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,030
Xiaoyuan has worked hard

128
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,440
and endured much

129
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,910
for her grandma's medical bills.

130
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,910
I don't want

131
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,000
her years of efforts

132
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,360
to end with regrets

133
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,200
between them.

134
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,270
So, it is a request from me.

135
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,360
You've used her body,

136
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,670
now just do her a favor.

137
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,750
Is that okay?

138
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,910
I can't do that.

139
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,480
I have never met my grandmother.

140
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,270
I have never experienced

141
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
her love.

142
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,960
I don't even know

143
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
how to get along with her.

144
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,550
Can't help you.

145
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,270
I grew up alone.

146
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
My parents didn't care about me.

147
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,600
Hi, I'm back.

148
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,600
Okay,

149
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,270
I understand.

150
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,200
Xiaoyuan,

151
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,030
growing up alone is not easy.

152
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,510
I know that feeling.

153
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,390
I'm sorry

154
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,150
for my attitude.

155
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,440
I can't

156
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,120
ask for your help.

157
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,870
Just hoping you

158
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,030
could give it another thought.

159
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,240
Just this time,

160
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,960
okay?

161
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,030
Hi, Qi.

162
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
Did you find Xiaoyuan?

163
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,030
Grandma...

164
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Xiaoyuan.

165
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,360
Xiaoyuan,

166
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,510
is that you?

167
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,790
Yes.

168
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,030
Xiaoyuan is here.

169
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,720
Xiaoyuan,

170
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,840
we haven't spoken to each other

171
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,670
for a long time.

172
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,390
Xiaoyuan...

173
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,120
Is everything okay?

174
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
Grandma,

175
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm good over here.

176
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,750
Don't worry about me.

177
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,840
Did you catch a cold?

178
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,630
Your voice sounds really hoarse.

179
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,150
(Have you been eating well?)

180
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,320
(Don't have too much takeout food.)

181
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,550
(Remember to get enough sleep.)

182
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,390
(Cut down on your drinking.)

183
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,960
Put on more clothes. It's cold.

184
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,200
(Got it?)

185
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,670
(You really need to listen up)

186
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,120
(and take care of yourself.)

187
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,000
(Otherwise, when you're as old as me,)

188
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,670
(you'll go through a lot troubles.)

189
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,790
Grandma,

190
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,960
how are

191
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,480
you feeling now?

192
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,510
Do you feel better?

193
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
I'm fine, really.

194
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,390

The rules are fair

386
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,270
for everyone.

387
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,550
Let's continue.

full score.

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,440
- Great!
- Wow!

391
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,350
Good for you, K.

392
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,440
That's excellent.

393
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,680
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

394
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,350
also a full score.

395
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,440
How is that possible?

396
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,750
Mr. Chen,

397
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,240
I don't think

398
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,960
Jiang Xiaoyuan's score is convincing.

399
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,550
What if

400
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,200
her seat was tampered with

401
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,240
before the test?

402
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,550
She might cheat in that way.

403
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,160
That's nonsense.

404
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,590
She wrote her paper under your eyes.

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,720
Please continue.

406
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,070
OK.

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,350
Let's go on.

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,240
entered the section

taking into account the model's

individual features.

423
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,550
Remember,

this round only has

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,790

Boss, are you

429
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,510
intentionally cutting some slack?

430
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,200
You bet.

431
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,680
No, I'm not.

432
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,480
This is HQ's decision.

433
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,830

434
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,240

00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,440
That's too hard.

439
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, that's not good.

440
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,400

441
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,510
you put the cards

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,200
that's the right card.

do you want to do?

472
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,590
Since she wants to prove herself,

473
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,720
we have to ensure

474
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,550
absolute fairness.

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,480

00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,310

477
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,440
Do you really think she can pass it?

478
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,270
Of course she can pass the test.

She is so fast.

This timing is spot-on.

494
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,480
I think K will win.

495
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,270
But check her out.

Jiang Xiaoyuan is quite something.

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,110
she's a bit slow?

She is a green hand. You can see that.

00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,960
You see,

501
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,550
Mr. Chen usually takes

502
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,680
such good care of her.

503
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,510

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,240
Usually, we could

quickly fix it for customers.

512
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,680
But it's a test.

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,480
There's no time.

514
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,590
I'll have a date tonight.

515
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,510
How can I go out with it?

516
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,240
How come the curling iron

517
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,510
break down at this moment?

518
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,750
Hurry up,

519
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,270
there's only five minutes left.

520
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,590
Jiang Xiaoyuan is so careless.

521
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,550
She didn't even

522
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,550
check the curling iron.

523
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,750
What a pity.

524
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,440
Li,

525
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,960
can I use

526
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,830
your silk scarf?

527
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,440
For what?

528
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,680
You'll know later.

529
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,830
Thanks.

530
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
Who do you think looks better,

531
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
Li or Fang?

532
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,960
I prefer Li.

533
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,510
Do you?

534
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,360
Me too.

535
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,400
Her silk scarf...

536
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,630
What are you talking about?

537
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,840
Do you have a sense of aesthetics?

538
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,480
What did you...

539
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,360
What?

540
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,150
Be quiet.

541
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,030
Stop that.

542
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,670
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

543
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,840
tell us,

544
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,030
why did you do it this way?

545
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,760
Li told me that

546
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,320
she'll have a date with her boyfriend

547
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,110
at a Western restaurant.

548
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,920
Considering the setting, vibe,

549
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,440
and her personality,

550
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,030
I think and elegant

551
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,110
and cute look

552
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,840
suits her better

553
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,630
rather than the playgirl's style

554
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
in the picture.

555
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,760
Playgirl's style?

556
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,510
I think that's cute.

557
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,440
Moreover, her face

558
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,800
is a bit round

559
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,440
with a slightly high hairline.

560
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,150
Her forehead is a bit wide.

561
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,150
So,

562
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,110
I elevated the height of her hair

563
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,230
at the top of her head,

564
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,840
refining her facial proportions.

565
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,280
I also gave her see-through bangs

566
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,280
for partial forehead coverage.

567
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,230
And finally, I used this silk scarf

568
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,000
to create a subtle

569
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,960
front-to-back depth,

570
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,630
which we can see

571
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,710
that her face looks smaller.

572
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,840
No kidding,

573
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,510
her face really looks smaller now.

574
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,230
Did you catch that?

575
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,320
No, I didn't.

576
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,150
But I think what she said

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,320
makes a lot of sense.

578
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,550
In a nutshell, what I did

579
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
was maximize her strengths.

580
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,960
Helen,

581
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,230
what do you say?

582
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,400
Well, as you asked,

583
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
I have to say that

584
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,320
this look is really good.

585
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,840
But Jiang Xiaoyuan's mistake

586
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,070
is also quite obvious.

587
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,760
I don't think

588
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,590
cutting corners should

589
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,840
be promoted.

590
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,800
Cutting corners?

591
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
The requirements are based on

592
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,150
hair perming and personal features.

593
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,880
In the end, we provide them with

594
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,550
the most suitable look.

595
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,110
Is this hairstyle

596
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,360
not suitable for Li?

597
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,630
No, it suits.

598
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,960
But

599
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,150
the focus of test for junior stylists

600
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
is basic skills.

601
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,480
But this is a test for junior stylists.

602
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,880
In that case,

603
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,800
advanced hair perming works

604
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,440
should not be included.

605
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
I agree with Helen.

606
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,960
This hairstyle is not bad.

607
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,190
But there is a noticeable mistake

608
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,440
in the hair perming.

609
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,150
If it's a promotion system,

610
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,590
I can let you pass this round.

611
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,920
But there's only one slot.

612
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,630
And K's performance

613
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,760
is clearly better than yours.

614
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,510
I'm sorry.

615
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,670
You don't pass.

616
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,520
I declare

617
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,310
that the winner

618
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,080
is K.

619
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,160
Honestly,

620
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,520
I think Li's hairstyle is great.

Qi Lian!

623
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,390
Wait!

624
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,040
What?

625
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,910
Do you want to push me

626
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,710
into letting you pass?

627
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
Admitting I'm better than you thought

628
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
must be tough for you.

629
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,080
Do you really believe

630
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,960
that achieving the current level

631
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,960
within one month

632
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,830
is entirely due to your own efforts?

633
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,080
Chen Fangzhou is always busy with work.

634
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,430
Why would he

635
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,350
bother to teach you?

636
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
You really have no idea?

637
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,830
Are you saying

638
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,390
that Chen Fangzhou taught me

639
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,310
out of consideration of you?

640
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,270
Alright,

641
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,680
I see.

642
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,600
You always look down on me.

643

You think I'm not as good as

00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,230
that Jiang Xiaoyuan in everything.

645
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,750
Even if I make a small achievement,

646
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,520
you still feel like I'm taking advantage

647
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,160
of what was supposed to be hers.

648
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,910
Qi Lian,

649
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,160
you are super narrow-minded.

650
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,960
That's how you see me.

651
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,430
Or how should I see you?

652
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,750
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

653
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,310
you are not the only one in the test.

654
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,750
Rules are fair

655
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,710
to everyone.

656
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,430
K fulfilled

657
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,640
all of the requirements,

658
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,600
so she passed.

659
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,200
I just made the decision

660
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,830
based on my own understanding,

661
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,640
what I thought

662
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,750
was the most appropriate.

663
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,390
If you pass,

664
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,830
would that be fair to her?

665
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,230
Whatever you say.

666
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,350
But I'm sure

667
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,120
that without your favor,

668
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,230
I can still achieve something.

669
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,920
