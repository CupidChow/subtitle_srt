00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,550
about Light Laboratory,

195
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,600
then I can show you this agreement.

196
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,680
If I try to take it

197
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,070
from you now,

198
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,350
can you stop me?

199
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,680
I have a knife.

200
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,830
As far as I know,

201
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,920
Light Laboratory closed down

202
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,960
six year ago.

203
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,000
Their final project

204
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,550
before closing down

205
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,510
was called Lighthouse System.

206
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,350
I don't know why

207
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
Huo Boyu insisted that

208
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,750
the Lighthouse System

209
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,030
is a game he developed.

210
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,510
But I can be sure that

211
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,310
more people, beyond the two of you,

212
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,240
are aware of the Lighthouse System.

213
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,000
From this point,

214
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,750
it can't be confirmed
that I'm the virus.

215
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,270
Do you have any proof?

216
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,160
If I'm not mistaken,

217
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,030
the Lighthouse System

218
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,440
should be mentioned
in this agreement.

219
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,440
Perhaps, you,

220
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
Huo Boyu and Xu Jingyang

221
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,070
come to this situation

222
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,310
mainly due to your participation

223
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,440
in that experiment.

224
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,160
But why did Huo Boyu...

225
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,830
Clearly,

226
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,350
he had some

227
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
memory issues,

228
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:08,960
mistakenly perceiving

229
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,270
this world as virtual.

230
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,270
As for the system task he mentioned...

231
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,440
I bet

232
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,550
there were someone

233
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,440
intentionally guided him

234
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,920
to maintain his confusion.

235
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,590
This also clarifies

236
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,270
why he could

237
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,070
receive tasks,

238
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,590
but you couldn't.

239
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,880
But I did go back to my world.

240
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,400
I met Mr. Xu.

241
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,350
He told me

242
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,000
that Huo Boyu and I

243
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,550
had been trapped in the gaming capsule.

244
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,000
And then?

245
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,750
Then,

246
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,200
Huo Boyu turned you.

247
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,000
And after that...

248
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
Don't you think

249
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,110
this is absurd?

250
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,590
Much of the logic

251
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,720
can't hold up to scrutiny at all.

252
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,550
Did I have a dream?

253
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,590
No,

254
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,880
I must still be in the gaming capsule.

255
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,830
That's why

256
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,680
I have her memory now.

257
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,790
I need to see Huo Boyu.

258
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,680
I need to see him. I...

259
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,550
I have to ask him,

260
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,270
does he have

261
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,510
another Huo Boyu's memories?

262
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
What if he doesn't?

263
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,350
He doesn't?

264
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,590
That's not possible.

265
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,310
I have her memory.

266
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,440
Check out the agreement

267
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,480
in your hands.

268
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,680
What's the signing date?

269
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,080
[May 17th, 2018]

270
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,510
It's May 17th, 2018.

271
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,720
How did a closed laboratory

272
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,110
sign an agreement?

273
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,350
There must be a truth

274
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,790
they want to conceal.

275
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,510
You were set up.

276
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,110
Huo Boyu was misled

277
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,880
into believing I'm a virus.

278
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,350
Does this mean

279
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,240
that I can get back

280
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,440
when I find the Light Laboratory

281
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,200
and Lighthouse System?

282
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,830
And so does that Jiang Xiaoyuan?

283
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,440
Right?

284
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,920
Then Let's go find them.

285
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,680
Let's go.

286
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,960
Now.

287
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,720
Do you really believe

288
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,750
what Huo Boyu said

289
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,960
that I'm a virus?

290
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,640
If you don't trust me,

291
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,240
why should I go with you?

292
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,510
(If what he said is true,)

293
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,400
(maybe I've misunderstood him.)

294
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:50,880
(I,)

295
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,880
(Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

296
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,200
(solemnly declare:)

297
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,240
(I owe Qi Lian a debt.)

298
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,960
(I'm determined to repay it,)

299
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,510
(ready to go to any lengths for him.)

300
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,880
(If I break this vow,)

301
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,110
(may I... never get back home.)

302
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,830
Let's get off here.

303
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,590
Or those two shadows

304
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,160
might catch up with us again.

305
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,030
Who are those shadows

306
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,920
that you are talking about?

307
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
That Jiang Xiaoyuan,

308
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,480
and...

309
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,880
And another one.

310
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,070
If you can meet

311
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,110
that Jiang Xiaoyuan,

312
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,070
don't you want to ask her

313
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,310
what happened?

314
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,680
I do want to.

315
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,110
I also want to know

316
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,270
what the Lighthouse System is

317
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
and how it got me involved.

318
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,350
And also...

319
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,880
How did you...

320
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,830
drift apart?

321
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,880
I feel that you've always

322
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,070
cared about her.

323
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,350
Why was she struggling so much

324
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,270
but didn't reach out to you?

325
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,750
I don't know.

326
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,750
Maybe you can ask her

327
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
next time.

328
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,510
Let's go.

329
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,200
Go.

330
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,270
Xiaoyuan.

331
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,880
Let me see.

332
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,720
Are you okay?

333
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,440
Did you get hurt?

334
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,000
What's wrong with you?

335
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,400
You just left without a word.

336
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,590
Where did you go?

337
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,350
Your Granduncle Seven and I
searched for you everywhere.

338
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,590
We didn't get any sleep.

339
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
What's happening?

340
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,200
Did you want to leave Grandma?

341
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,750
Where did you go?

342
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,840
[Qi Maoqing]

343
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,960
I didn't expect you to come back.

344
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,640
Every Lunar New Year,

345
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,640
I come to visit your mother,

346
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,480
and stay a few days at home here.

347
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,110
The house is a bit old,

348
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,590
but I've had it fixed up.

349
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,030
Want to come?

350
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,550
No.

351
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,880
I just passed by.

352
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,720
I miss my Mom

353
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,920
so I came over.

354
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,790
Lian.

355
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,310
I know you're still upset

356
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,160
about me leaving you and your mother.

357
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,030
Today is Chinese New Year's Day.

358
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,200
It's a rare chance

359
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,960
for our family to get together.

360
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Stay and have a meal, okay?

361
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,440
Our family?

362
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,240
You are not my family.

363
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,270
I know there has been
some misunderstanding between us.

364
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,350
But your mother and I

365
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,350
didn't get divorced.

366
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,550
I didn't sign

367
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,790
the divorce agreement

368
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,400
until she passed away.

369
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,510
That doesn't matter.

370
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
For this matter,

371
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,350
Dad didn't handle it well.

372
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,270
I apologize to you.

373
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
No need.

374
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,270
If you are truly sorry,

375
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,510
come visit my Mom.

376
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,640
Lian,

377
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,960
if you need any help,

378
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,160
contact me

379
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,110
anytime.

380
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,590
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

381
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,310
But I'm doing great now.

382
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,550
What's there to do today?

383
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,510
Family dinner?

384
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,720
How strange.

385
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,350
