00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,400
It was the day
before she signed the contract.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,080
Did she come back?

00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,480
She put this in it later.

11
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,240
How is the life she drew

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,070
exactly like

13
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,960

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Have you ever thought

15
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,750
that maybe the Lighthouse System

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
is not a time-travel machine,

17
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,430
and you didn't time travel

18
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,430
to this world?

19
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,400
That's impossible. That's not true.

20
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,560
I have all the memories

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,590
since my childhood.

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,230

34
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,280
Come here.

35
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,240
Lean against here first.

36
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,910
How do you feel?

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,030
I'm not her.

38
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm here.

39
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,030
I'm not her.

40
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,960
It's okay.

41
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,750
I'm not her.

42
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Am I sick?

43
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,120
When people are overly stressed

44
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,150
or stimulated emotionally,

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
they tend to feel dizzy.

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,960
It can be relieved by rest.

47
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,910
Qi Lian.

48
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,800
Can you go to the laboratory

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,800
with me tomorrow?

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,360
You just experienced a shock.

51
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,080
You should rest for a couple of days.

52
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,400
No.

53
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,280
I have to see the Lighthouse System

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,190
with my own eyes;

55
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,150
otherwise, I won't believe it.

56
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,430
I've been thinking about

57
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,630
how to tell you

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,870
about Huo Boyu.

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,120
What happened to him?

60
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,080
He's dead.

61
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
How?

62
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,910
Before he died,

63
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,080
he had a mental breakdown.

64
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,560
Later, he committed suicide

65
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,590
in the ward,

66
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,910
on the day
you returned to Baiyang County.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,630
You're afraid
that I'll end up like him, right?

68
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,310
I won't.

69
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,920
Before I find out the truth,

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,510
I won't let myself go crazy.

71
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,830
Have some warm noodles first.

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
You didn't tell me you were coming back.

73
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,480
I should have cooked something.

74
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,360
Thank you, Grandma.

75
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Come on, sit down and eat.

76
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,240
Sit down.

77
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,560
Qi, it's getting late.

78
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,160
Why don't you stay overnight here?

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
Just stay overnight here.

80
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,870
Eat before it gets cold.

81
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,480
I'll tidy up the room for you.

82
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,430
Do you mind?

83
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Anyway, the room

84
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,510
of Jiang Xiaoyuan's parents is empty.

85
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,270
I quite like this house.

86
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,240
Hello, Professor Lu.

87
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,680
(Happy New Year, Qi Lian.)

88
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,160
(I've found something)

89
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,510
(about Noah)

90
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,600
(that you asked me for last time.)

91
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
(But it was just a photo.)

92
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,310
(I'm afraid it's gonna take some time)

93
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,120
(to know his contact information.)

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
(Don't worry.)

95
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,920
(I'll keep looking for it.)

96
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
Can you send it to me first?

97
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,070
(Okay, I'll send it to you now.)

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,920
(Noah is standing)

99
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,310
(in the third position
from the right in the back row.)

100
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800

Qi Lian.

102
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,830
You're my best friend.

103
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,270
I hope

104
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,430
you're well.

105
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,040
Do you think

106
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,190
we'll see Mr. Xu today?

107
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,920
I don't know.

108
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,680
Could Mr. Xu

109
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,560
be the one who almost killed

110
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,870
me and Huo Boyu?

111
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,430
I don't know.

112
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,550
Why did they choose

113
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,720
such a remote place
for their experiments?

114
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,200
It's probably to prevent

115
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,030
experimental personnel
from contacting the outside world,

116
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,790
concealing their activities.

117
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,720
This place seems

118
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
to have been abandoned for a long time.

119
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,360
There are two possibilities.

120
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,000
One is

121
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,870
that the Light Laboratory

122
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,150
claimed to have closed

123
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,720
but is still operational.

124
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,910
This base

125
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,790
was registered

126
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,720
six years ago.

127
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,630
They closed it down and moved elsewhere.

128
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,870
What's the other possibility?

129
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,630
The second possibility is

130
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
that the Light Laboratory

131
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,320
indeed closed,

132
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,910
but someone intentionally continues

133
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,870
the Lighthouse System experiments

134
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,480
under their banner.

135
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,510
No matter which is true,

136
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,120
the Light Laboratory

137
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,550
is probably not here anymore.

138
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,790
They moved out cleanly.

139
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,960
It looks like they left nothing here.

140
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,030
Don't you find

141
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,030
something odd?

142
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,360
It seems to be too clean here.

143
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,030
It's not like it's been deserted
for six years.

144
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,910
Could they have just moved out?

146
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,870
Are you okay?

147
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,840
Let me carry you down.

148
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,150
Be careful.

149
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,840
Be careful.

150
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,440

Be careful.

152

How are you feeling?

153
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,480
Does it still hurt?

154
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
Maybe I should take you back first.

155
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,670
No.

156
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,480
Since we're here,

157
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,480
I need to find out the truth quickly.

158
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,320
Wait for me here.

159
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,150
I'll be back soon.

164
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,790
Come on, get up.

165
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,510
You've entered

166
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,510
the Lighthouse System four times,

167
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,270
and it's a crucial moment

168
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,000
for data observation.

169
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,200

to avoid getting injured.

171
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,920
Otherwise, the pain signals

172
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,110
will interfere with
the memory implant module

173
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,240
of the Lighthouse System.

174
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,350
Module?

175
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,750
What module?

176
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,790
I've never heard you mention it before.

177
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,830
Ms. Jiang.

178
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,030
The director is looking for you.

179
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,200
Please go over there.

180
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,200
How many times have I told you

181
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,350
not to mention the memory module

182
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,550
to the subjects?

183
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,400
They only know
that the Lighthouse System

184
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,030
is a virtual reality game

185
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,030
and have no idea

186
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
about the true nature of the project.

187
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,400
If they become alert,

188
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,200
it might affect

189
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,070
the later memory overlay.

190
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,880
I'll be more careful.

191
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,830
But

192
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,440
isn't it against the rules

193
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,240
not to tell the subjects

194
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,790
the truth?

195
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,550
Don't worry about that.

196
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,310
But I heard

197
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,640
that the previous subjects

198
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
were fine at first,

199
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,550
and the painful memories

200
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,350
were successfully erased,

201
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,510
but when they were disconnected
from the machine,

202
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,070
less than a year later,

203
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
those people all went insane.

204
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,110
Some even committed suicide
by jumping off buildings.

205
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Do you believe everything you hear?

206
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,400
Since we took over
the Lighthouse System,

207
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,440
this is the first batch of subjects

208
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,590
we've received.

209
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,510
Who committed suicide
by jumping off buildings?

210
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,550
It could have happened

211
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,110
before we took over.

212
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm just worried

213
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,200
that there might be a bug

214
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,110
in the memory implant module

215
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,200
of the Lighthouse System.

216
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,790
If you really think there's a bug,

217
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,960
then go fix it

218
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,590
instead of overthinking.

219
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,350
What's wrong?

220
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
I joined this experiment

221
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,960
because you said it wasn't dangerous.

222
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,920
Tell me the truth.

223
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,270
What exactly is

224
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,310
the Lighthouse System?

225
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,030
It's a game.

226
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,000
What's wrong?

227
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,880
It's really just a game.

228
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,070
There's no danger at all.

229
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,070
I told you about it.

230
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,750
Xiaoyuan.

231
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
I participated in creating

232
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,680
the dream module of this game.

233
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,960
It took me five years,

234
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,350
and I put my heart and soul into it.

235
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I guarantee that it's not dangerous.

236
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,160
Didn't you always say

237
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,440
you want to be rich?

238
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,030
In this game,

239
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,350
you can experience everything.

240
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,350
They're looking for me.

241
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,590
I have to go.

242
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,270
Xiaoyuan.

243
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,790
I promise you there's no problem.

244
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,880
It's safe and secure. Trust me.

245
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm gonna go.

246
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,240
(August 11, 2018.)

247
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,830
(Cloudy.)

248
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,550
(Today)

249
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,590
(is my 87th day participating
in the Lighthouse experiment.)

250
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,030
(The staff here)

251
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,830
(slipped out,)

252
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,480
(and I found out)

253
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,640
(that the Lighthouse System)

254
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,350
(is not actually a game.)

255
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,510
(I don't know what it is.)

256
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,920
(Even Huo Boyu)

257
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,590
(seems to have been kept in the dark.)

258
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,070
(I don't know if I'll go crazy,)

259
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
(But I can feel)

260
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,680
(that the Lighthouse System)

261
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,310
(is altering my memory.)

262
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,830
(Sometimes I can't remember)

263
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,830
(what happened the day before.)

264
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,880
[Lighthouse System]
(Sometimes)

265
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,920
(I even think of myself)

266
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
(as the character in the game.)

267
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,030
(If one day)

268
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,400
(I forget)

269
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,030
(everything about myself,)

270
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,240
(I hope)

271
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,880
(this diary)

272
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,880
(will help me remember.)

273
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,880
(August 29th.)

274
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,480
(I sneaked into the room)

275
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,590
(next to the meeting room.)

276
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,680
If this experiment continues,

277
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,310
the subjects are likely

278
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,790
to go insane within a year.

279
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,160
How's the condition

280
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,790
of the subjects recently?

281
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,550
Not so good.

282
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,030
There have been fainting episodes.

283
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,400
Jiang Xiaoyuan?

284
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,160
What are you doing here?

285
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,160
Go inside.

286
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,270
You can't just

287
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,110
quit the experiment.

288
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,720
The Lighthouse System

289
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,160
(is indeed not a game.)

290
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,880
(During the game,)

291
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,680
(they kept mentioning)

292
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,070
(my past that I don't want to remember.)

293
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,480
(But for some reason,)

294
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,070
(the more they mention it,
the faster I forget,)

295
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,720
(and she in the virtual world)

296
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,880
(becomes more real.)

297
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,640
Sign the disclaimer.

298
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,750
We looked into your background,

299
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,240
and your life isn't easy.

300
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,680
Doesn't your grandmother

301
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
need the money?

302
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,350
Why are you thinking so much?

303
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,590
It could take a few months

304
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,880
or up to a year

305
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,000
before those people all go insane.

306
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,070
Just sign it.

307
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,590
Even if you do go crazy,

308
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,240
it's better than being tormented

309
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,790
by reality.

310
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,400
Sign it.

311
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,830
Sign it.

312
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,750

(they persuaded me
to treat the Lighthouse System)

316
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,510
(as a dream machine,)

317
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,640
(where I have everything)

318
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,510
(I don't have now.)

319
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,200
(Money, friends, and freedom.)

320
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,070
(It's like the opposite
of my current life.)

(September 13th.)

323
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,000
(return to reality?)

to distinguish)

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,720
(between reality and dreams.)

326
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,200
(Maybe I'm in the dream now.)

327
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,440

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,480

you've always been

She doesn't remember anything

375
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,960

as another person.

377
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
I know her situation is uncommon,

378
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,280
but is it possible

379
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,840
to help her through medical means?

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,280
Let me do it.

384
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,760
I want to go home.

385
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,920
I want to go back to my original home.

386
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,710
When it's daylight,

387
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,280
I'll take you back.

388
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,630
I'll buy you something to eat.

389
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,480
I'm not hungry.

390
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,590
Have some sleep then.

391
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,920
I'll stay here with you.

392
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,630
What's on your mind?

393
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,030
I'm thinking about the movie

394
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,440
Chen Fangzhou likes.

395
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,030
The movie?

396
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,030
A movie where everyone

397
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,070
lies in sleeping pods,

398
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,190
treating the virtual world

399
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,000
as the real world.

400
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,670
I was convinced

401
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,190
that the world I was in

402
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,630
was the virtual world,

403
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,800
and one day,

404
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,840
I would wake up from the sleeping pod

405
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,280
and go back to the real world.

406
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,030
But I never expected

407
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,360
that what I thought was the real world

408
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,880
was the virtual world.

409
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
The luxurious life

410
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,630
was just a dream.

411
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,190
From beginning to end,

412
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,710
there has been one Jiang Xiaoyuan.

413
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,670
We all wake up from a dream.

414
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,150
The good thing is that you're back,

415
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,590
right?

416
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,320
Do you think I'm really back?

417
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,590
I have so many memories

418
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,190
related to that dream.

419
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,190
In the long future,

420
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,880
I'll miss that dream.

421
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
I'll miss the world

422
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,480
in that dream.

423
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,800
What's the difference between it

424
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,400
and trapping me

425
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,920
in a world that doesn't belong to me?

426
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,480
Xiaoyuan.

427
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,640
I...

428
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,790
I've consulted some experts.

429
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,230
They may have a way

430
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,870
to help you regain
your previous memories.

431
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,080
Do you want me

432
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,390
to regain my old memories?

433
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,390
What I want

434
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,750
is to minimize the impact

435
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,920
of the Lighthouse System on you.

436
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,440
I hope you won't feel painful

437
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,440
because your life

438
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,390
has deviated

439
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,560
from its original course.

440
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,790
Perhaps forgetting those things

441
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,960
in the dream

442
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,160
and turning back
into the original Jiang Xiaoyuan

443
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,790
will prevent you
from ending up like Huo Boyu.

444
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,440
I don't want to forget those things,

445
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,520
and I don't want to turn back

446
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,960
into the original Jiang Xiaoyuan.

447
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,710
Xiaoyuan.

448
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,160
Whether you can remember

449
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,440
the past or not,

450
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,230
you'll always be you.

451
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,960
It's not the same.

452
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,750
Even you said

453
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,520
that we are different

454
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,000
in your eyes.

455
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,000
People's memories

456
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,120
determine who they are.

457
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,000
Erasing their memories

458
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,670
is equivalent to erasing their existence.

459
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,270
If one day

460
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,960
you discover

461
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,120
that your memories are fake,

462
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,000
would you be willing to forget them?

463
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,790
Would you let yourself become someone

464
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,640
you don't even know?
