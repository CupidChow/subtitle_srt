[Episode 14]

4
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,910
Hey, man.

5
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,640
I've been there.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,710
Listen,

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,440
I have to say this.

8
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,030
You'd better move on

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,120
from Jiang Xiaoyuan.

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,760
When they were in college,

11
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,110
Huo Boyu was actually

12
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,070
with another girl.

13
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,640
But Jiang Xiaoyuan

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,960
broke them apart.

15
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,520
Well, Jiang Xiaoyuan

16
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,470
was totally into him.

17
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,560
She stalked him like crazy,

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
for quite a while.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,390
But finally,

20
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,070
that girl kicked her

21
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,470
out of the picture.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,640
There must be

23
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,670
some misunderstanding.

24
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,960
Come on, man.

25
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,960
How can you don't get it?

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,590
Jiang Xiaoyuan has liked

27
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,230
someone else for a long time.

28
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,920
The person she's waiting for

29
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,950
is not you.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,560
Ruixue,

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,400
I've finally found

32
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,640
this makeup artist.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,430
The best part is
she can design for free.

34
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,480
The performance is around the corner.

35
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,120
If you... if you let her go,

36
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,120
what else could I do?

37
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,840
(Oh, god.)

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,870
(I can't believe)

39
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,920
(I work for her now.)

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,200
So?

41
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,310
What did she say?

42
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,350
Just tell me straight.

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,150
Well,

44
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,120
just go in, say something nice,

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,040
and apologize to her.

46
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,040
You see,

47
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,710
she's always been

48
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,350
a spoiled little princess.

49
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,310
She is a princess?

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,590
What about me?

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,280
What?

52
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,750
Well, I mean

53
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,870
I'll go in, apologize,

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,800
and brace myself

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,120
for a bit of life's struggles.

56
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,310
Be nice!

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,960
I offended you just now.

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,630
I apologize.

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,470
Want to apologize?

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,000
Drink.

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,430
After this drink,

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,310
can we get down to business?

63
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,360
It never ends, right?

64
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,800
Drink up,

65
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,040
or get lost.

66
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,680
My apologies

67
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,870
for my bad attitude.

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,390
But I've had three drinks.

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,720
If you're going to be

70
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,750
that way,

71
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,270
I'm out.

72
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm here for work.

73
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,800
My patience has its limits.

74
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,830
Don't take it too far.

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Mr. Cui told me

76
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,830
that you're both an investor

77
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,000
and the lead actress in the musical.

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,680
So, do you

79
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,000
have any specific ideas

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,120
for the makeup?

81
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,000
I think the makeup

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
should match the character.

83
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,720
So my suggestion is

84
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,040
to customize it based on the role.

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,360
You really want to talk about business?

86
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,950
Now, you are the one
who can't afford to waste time,

87
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,750
not me.

88
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,240
If you want to take more time,

89
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
that's fine.

90
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,160
But the longer you take,

91
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,950
the later my design will be ready.

92
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Understand?

93
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,310
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

94
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,360
I know you the best.

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
Even if my performance falls short,

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,000
I won't hire you.

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,160
Fine,

98
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,270
I'll take off.

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,190
Given your taste,

100
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,430
I doubt you could offer

101
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,480
any good advice.

102
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,630
We'll have time to do our nails.

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,070
Jiang Xiaoyuan?

104
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,480
Ruixue,

105
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,560
what's she doing here?

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,830
Who are you?

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

108
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,120
you're up to Ruixue's boyfriend.

109
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,680
Still have the nerve to see her?

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
What a shame.

111
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,510
That's right.

112
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,720
Shame on you.

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,510
Who?

114
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,120
Your boyfriend?

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you pretending

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
to forget so soon

117
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,160
about Huo Boyu?

118
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,830
Huo Boyu

119
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,160
is your boyfriend?

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
You're good at fronting,

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,720
Feng Ruixue.

122
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,240
Have you lose your mind?

123
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,000
You don't know who you really are.

124
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,750
When did

125
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,920
Huo Boyu, that two-timer

126
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,830
become your boyfriend?

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,870
Why isn't

128
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,040
Huo Boyu my boyfriend?

129
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
Just ask around.

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,310
Everyone knows

131
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,630
you took him away from me.

132
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,720
What a shame.

133
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,120
How dare you.

134
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,510
(Is Feng Ruixue telling the truth?)

135
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,120
(She's not a space traveler?)

136
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
(So she...)

137
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,750
(is from this world.)

138
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,630
(So in this world,)

139
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,430
(Jiang Xiaoyuan)

140
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,360
(stole her boyfriend?)

141
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,160
Are you playing dumb with me?

142
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Is something wrong with you?

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,510
You stole Huo Boyu

144
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,920
and disappeared for so many years.

145
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,750
Why do you treat me like this?

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

147
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,560
Here we are.

148
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,390
Huo Boyu's formal girlfriend,

149
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,190
Feng Ruixue,

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,310
is also from Luoshan.

151
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,510
Tonight,

152
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,240
she'll host a party at Room 888.

153
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,390
Don't blame me, bro.

154
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,390
But listen.

155
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,750
Don't be so complicated.

156
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,190
If you like her,

157
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
just tell her.

158
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,310
I know.

159
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,190
I'll take it from here.

160
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,800
You can go back now.

161
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,360
Take care.

162
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,390
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

163
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,270
Don't be so vulnerable.

164
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,920
Get up!

165
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,950
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

166
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,560
Get up!

167
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
Xiaoyuan?

168
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,510
Xiaoyuan!

169
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,360
Xiaoyuan.

170
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,550
Xiaoyuan?

171
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,390
Taxi!

172
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,150
Xiaoyuan?

173
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

174
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,080
are you drunk?

175
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,840
Mind your own business.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
Don't be so fake.

177
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,910
I know you hate me.

178
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,750
You wish for me to disappear.

179
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
and not to bother

180
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,600
your sweetheart.

181
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,120
Go away.

182
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,960
Get lost.

183
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,750
Go.

184
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,120
What are you doing?

185
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,270
Qi Lian,

186
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
I feel like I'm dying.

187
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,000
Stop talking.

188
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,510
There might still be time for rescue.

189
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,120
I have my last words.

190
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,150
I must say them.

191
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,030
Go on.

192
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Record it on your phone.

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,910
It's just drunken talk,

194
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,910
nothing worth recording.

195
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,870
Just follow me.

196
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,200
If you don't, we'll have a problem.

197
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,670
This is evidence of

198
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,440
my existence in this world.

199
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,320
I feel ill.

200
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,120
[Recorder]

201
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,000
It's recording now.

202
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,750
Hurry up and speak.

203
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,390
I've kept our agreement,

204
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,270
working so hard

205
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
at the salon.

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,320
Why are you treating me so badly?

207
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,630
You got the leads,
but you didn't tell me.

208
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
It's not like that.

209
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,670
I haven't figured out

210
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,840
what's going on.

211
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,440
No.

212
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,120
You're on her side.

213
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,550
You're on her side.

214
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,120
Yes.

215
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,080
I have my own concerns.

216
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,750
I don't want you to get her wrong

217
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,360
because of some rumors.

218
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,670
You're on her side.

219
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,390
But you can't

220
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,120
ignore my feelings.

221
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,360
You were kind to me

222
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,240
at the beginning.

223
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,870
You were kind to me

224
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,550
at the beginning.

225
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,910
I haven't met

226
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,030
many people who have been

227
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,960
truly good to me.

228
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,960
They were nice to me,

229
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,910
but it was either

230
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,550
because of my family

231
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,200
or they found me pretty.

232
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,270
I feel terrible.

233
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,630
Only you, Qi Lian.

234
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,910
You helped me

235
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,870
when I was at my lowest.

236
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
Now I have nothing left,

237
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,960
but you never looked down on me.

238
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,720
You smells so good.

239
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,360
Sometimes I think,

240
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,120
although I'm not really

241
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
that lucky to find myself

242
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,670
in this world out of nowhere.

243
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,670
But,

244
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,510
meeting you guys

245
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,960
who treat me so well

246
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,630
makes it not so bad at all.

247
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,200
It would be the best

248
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,030
if I could meet others

249
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
who treat me well like you

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
when I go back.

251
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,030
You will.

252
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,840
After you go back,

253
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,080
you'll surely encounter people

254
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
who truly treat you well.

255
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,320
But I'm dying.

256
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,150
Not someone who talks so much nonsense.

257
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm not done speaking.

258
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,030
Qi Lian,

259
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,390
you should apologize to me.

260
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,030
You broke the agreement

261
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,960
that we made.

262
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,630
That's your fault.

263
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,360
Say you are sorry.

264
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,670
Alright.

265
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,670
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

266
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,150
You are even...

267
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,440
You even hit me

268
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,600
and yelled at me

269
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,080
for that Jiang Xiaoyuan.

270
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,390
You embarrassed me

271
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,440
at that classmate party

272
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,030
You are...

273
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,360
a bad guy.

274
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,440
Aren't you a bad guy?

275
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,630
You almost ruined my path

276
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,440
to becoming a senior stylist.

277
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
You were mean to Chen Fangzhou

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,440
because he cared about me.

279
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,510
Qi Lian, I'm falling down.

280
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,200
Eh, my snot.

281
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,720
That's also my mistake.

282
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,510
My apology.

283
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,030
Apology not accepted.

284
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,270
I'm a tsundere princess.

285
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,840
Do you know what that means?

286
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,270
Get some sleep.

287
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
We still have a way to the hospital.

288
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,960
No!

289
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,670
I won't wake up if I fall asleep.

290
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,910
I checked her blood test.

291
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,870
Nothing serious,

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,030
she is just drunk.

293
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,870
Make sure she gets good rest.

294
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,670
When she wakes up,

295
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
have her drink plenty of water.

296
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320

Yes.

named Feng Ruixue.

332
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,440

What's wrong?

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,550
Shang found out the person

337
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,550
spied on us before.

338
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,030
His name is Huo Boyu.

339
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,400
Huo Boyu?

340
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,030
Feng Ruixue is his ex.

341
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,110
Does this world also have him?

342
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,790
He was spied on us?

343
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,350
He is my ex in my world.

344
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,070
That's weird.

345
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,480
In both worlds,

346
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,480
Huo Boyu likes cheating,

347
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,200

Jiang Xiaoyuan.

349
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,750

get my own things back?

380
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,790
You'd better think it through.

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,200
This way,

382
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,110

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,590
it's not always easy

388
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,750
to get good results.

389
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,200
You make it sound nice.

390
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,790
Why don't you admit

391
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,070
that you can't get over her

392
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,480
and want to get her back.

393
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,440
If she doesn't come back,

394
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,110
I'm afraid all your years of hoping

395
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,110
will be in vain.

396
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,000
Why do you become so moody

397
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
when you wake up from drinking?

398
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,830
Can you just get over someone

399
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,880
you really love?

400
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,920
Of course I can.

401
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,440
I was over Huo Boyu

402
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,550
as soon as I found him cheating.

403
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,830
What if it's the person

404
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,310
you could never forget,

405
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,240
and after many years,

406
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,000
you unexpectedly meet again?

407
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
Won't you have something in your mind?

408
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,070
You just ran into me

409
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,640
and mistook me for her.

410
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,960
I was in mess,

411
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,270
so I naturally

412
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,270
accepted you help.

413
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Then you thought you had a chance?

414
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,160
Well,

415
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,830
you said it's not because of her.

416
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,480
No wonder you were in a rush

417
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,350
to send me away.

418
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,070
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

419
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't know why are you angry about.

420
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,110
Don't you want to go back home?

421
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,550
I do want to go back.

422
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,960
It's none of your business.

423
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,680
Hate it.

424
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,960
I promised you

425
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,030
to send you back.

426
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
I won't go back on my words.

427
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,590
Also,

428
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,790
mistaking you for her

429
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,720
was a thing of the past.

430
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,590
You two do have

431
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,920
a lot in common.

432
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,400
But in my eyes,

433
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,310
you are different.

434
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,790
Then tell me.

435
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,480
What's the difference?

436
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm sorry.

437
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,030
I won't avoid you anymore.

438
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,120
[Chen Fangzhou]

439
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,000
That's Chen Fangzhou.

440
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,720
He might have noticed

441
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,480
you're not in the dorm.

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,880
I'll take you home first.

443
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,160
Leave finding Huo Boyu to me.

444
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,400
(Ruixue,)

445
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,270
(please don't be mad.)

446
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,590
(I won't let her work for us.)

447
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,440
Did I tell you to do so?

448
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,200
Er...

449
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,830
Ruixue,

450
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,110
I don't get it.

451
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,680
She'll be our makeup artist.

452
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,270
Remember,

453
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,960
don't let her go.

454
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,270
(I'll give her a hard time.)

455
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,200
Feng Ruixue and I had a falling out.

456
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,160
I can't take this work.

457
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,550
No, please.

458
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,830
We can talk about that.

459
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,030
Please, give it another thought.

460
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,790
But...

461
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,960
Feng Ruixue

462
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,240
has clearly turned me down.

463
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,350
I don't know the details.

464
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,310
But she changed her mind

465
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,440
early this morning.

466
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,790
Time is really tight now.

467
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,830
Could you...?

468
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,110
Things went down

469
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,960
like that yesterday,

470
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,160
she still wants to invite me?

471
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,350
Doesn't she is an amateur?

472
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,200
Seems she doesn't really care

473
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,550
about the performance.

474
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,270
Instead of arguing with me here,

475
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,880
You'd be better tell her

476
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,550
that we can't complete on time.

477
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,200
Who knows, she might just

478
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,750
cancel the performance.

479
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Miss Jiang,

480
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,920
please trust us.

481
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,240
We are definitely professionals.

482
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
To show our sincerity,

483
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,270
I've brought the contract.

484
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,830
You just need to sign it.

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,550
I swear.

486
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,680
We'll pay the deposit immediately.

487
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,510
Everything is under control.

488
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,000
Please,

489
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,110
please help us.

490
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,880
[Contract]

491
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,750
Alright, I'll think about it.

492
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,510
Here is a thing.

493
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll just

494
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,200
do my own job.

495
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,200
All you need to do is pay me on time.

496
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,110
No problem.

497
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,720
I can promise that.

498
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,550
Please think about it.

499
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,480
I'll wait for your response.

500
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,070
OK.

501
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,640
I've got some errands to run,

502
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,350
so I'll catch you later.

503
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,750
Please think about it, Miss Jiang.

504
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,030
Goodbye then.

505
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,440
Bye.

506
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,880
Xiaoyuan,

507
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,720
I couldn't help overhearing.

508
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,590
Is that man reliable?

509
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't know.

510
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,790
But he'll pay me three thousand yuan.

511
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,030
After doing this,

512
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,790
I won't worry about the KPIs.

513
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,790
Three thousand yuan?

514
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,920
That's huge.

515
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,750
I know.

516
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,270
Did he give you a hard time?

517
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,960
He didn't pull any unreasonable moves,
did he?

518
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,030
Come on,

519
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,030
I've been through a lot.

520
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,880
Money's no stranger to me,
you know?

521
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,270
I really don't know that.

522
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,000
Who's the one asking me for salary

523
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,510
in advance every month?

524
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,920
Qi Lian, right?

525
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,960
I bet you must

526
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
be here for her.

527
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,590
I'm here

528
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,920
for another thing.

529
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,270
Are you still

530
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,350
in touch with Huo Boyu?

531
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
Excuse me, do I even know you?

532
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,480
Let Jiang Xiaoyuan come and ask me

533
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,830
herself if she wants to know.

534
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,920
No need to bother her.

535
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,270
Why do you in the middle

536
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,310
of our business?

537
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,200
Who are you?

538
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:53,790
Sorry for disturbing you.

539
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,310
Let me be honest with you.

540
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,720
Huo Boyu disappeared

541
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,960
just like Jiang Xiaoyuan.

542
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,270
I can't find him

543
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,720
anywhere.

544
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,270
So I can't tell you anything.

545
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,110
Huo Boyu is the one who cheated.

546
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,750
You should go after him.

547
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,400
Do you think I don't want to?

548
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,270
If you find him, please let me know.

549
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,030
I'll lay it all on him.

551
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,480
Why are you here?

552
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,550
Still working?

553
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,550
I might have to pull an all-nighter.

554
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,110
Time is so tight.

555
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,310
I need to do some quick sketches

556
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,750
to catch up.

557
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,550
Seems you really like

558
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,480
your work now.

559
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,350
Didn't you used to complain

560
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,030
about how dull it is to go through

561
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,640
the routine every day?

562
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,590
How do you know that?

563
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,590
Chen Fangzhou sold me out,

564
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,310
didn't he?

565
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,110
And you complained that
customers being a hassle

566
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,310
not wanting to serve them.

567
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,720
Stop mocking me.

568
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,920
You see, Feng Ruixue

569
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,160
turned me into that mass,

570
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,310
but I still take her orders.

571
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,550
Come on,

572
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm the one

573
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,240
talked big in the salon.

574
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,640
KPIs are top priority.

575
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,880
I'll endure and bear the load.

576
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,880
Anyway, I can't lose face.

577
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,000
Has it really come to this?

578
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,440
Aren't you from a rich family?

579
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,440
You'll only have to
stay here for one year.

580
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,830
Once you're back,
you'll have everything.

581
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,350
Why do you work so hard?

582
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,270
You don't understand.

583
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,510
What are you chewing?

584
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
Bubble gum.

585
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,310
Back then,

586
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,000
I can easily get everything I want.

587
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,680
So I didn't have

588
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,350
a specific passion.

589
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,640
Now,

590
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,510
I have nothing.

591
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,400
So I cherish

592
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,830
whatever I have.

593
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,480
Since I've been here,

594
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,240
living the less fancy life,

595
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,030
I've realized that
I really love makeup.

596
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
When I go back,

597
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll stick with it,

598
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,310
making it something

599
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,510
I can truly be proud of.

600
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,110
(Xu Jingyang,)

601
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,030
(are you okay)

602
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,030
(in that world?)

603
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,880
(Xu Jingyang,)

604
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,800
(you brought her here.)

605
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,190
(But I'm going to)

606
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,480
(send her back soon.)

607
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,400
Miss Jiang,

608
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,280
I can tell you've worked hard.

609
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,670
The makeup designs

610
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,840
look great...

611
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,480
But...?

612
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,760
Miss Jiang,

613
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,710
I'm afraid you haven't done
stage makeup.

614
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,440
That's true.

615
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,710
Did I get something wrong?

616
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,230
Here,

617
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,030
let me show you

618
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,070
some of our costumes.

619
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,000
You can take them as a reference.

620
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,880
Is that so much?

621
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,590
Exactly.

622
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,480
To make sure the audience in the back

623
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,590
can clearly see the performers

624
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,550
on stage,

625
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,670
our costumes are designed

626
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,880
to be somewhat exaggerated.

627
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,320
Of course, the makeup follows the same.

628
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
If you design the stage makeup

629
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,670
based on everyday looks,

630
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,110
the audience can't see it clearly.

631
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,670
And it won't match our

632
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,320
performance costumes.

633
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,280
Check this out.

634
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,280
If you want to

635
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
add some rhinestones here,

636
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,480
the audience in ten meters away

637
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,510
won't be able to see them clearly.

638
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,800
OK, I'll make some revisions.

639
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,110
Oh, hold on.

640
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
there's one more thing.

641
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,360
Not sure if you've noticed,

642
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,510
but these makeup looks...

643
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,710
I mean.

644
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,710
They're giving off

645
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,840
a bit of a runway-model-vibe.

646
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,670
Actors won't go for

647
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,840
this kind of makeup.

648
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,480
Could you explain it?

649
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,760
Simply,

650
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,880
the makeup designs are nice,

651
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,550
but they look like the same.

652
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,190
It's hard to tell who's who.

653
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,670
May I ask, do you want

654
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,150
a vibrant makeup in the same tone
or something?

655
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
Oh, that's not what I mean.

656
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,030
After all,

657
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm not a makeup professional.

658
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,320
But honestly, it would be better

659
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,480
to make some revisions

660
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,440
to match the makeup

661
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,000
with our performance and costumes.

662
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,710
Alright.

663
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,270
Ruixue,

664
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,160
why are you here?

665
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,080
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

666
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,160
these designs are stupid.

667
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,430
How do you even make a living
doing makeup?

668
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,680
Feng Ruixue,

669
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,310
you are the investor,

670
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,200
so you have the right

671
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,160
to make demands.

672
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,830
As for me,

673
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,960
since I've taken on the job,

674
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,230
I'll put my personal feelings aside

675
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,430
to give it my best shot.

676
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,750
If you have some good ideas,

677
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,750
we can sit down

678
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,680
and talk about it.

679
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,120
Nothing else,

680
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,430
just make it satisfactory for me.

681
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,560
Cool.

682
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,120
Give me two more days.

683
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,560
Let me know when she's coming again.

684
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,080
[Fashion Hairdressing Salon]

685
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,080
(The makeup designs are nice,)

686
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,680
(but they look like the same.)

687
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,160
(It's hard to tell who's who.)

688
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,710
Hi, Mr. Qi. Checking on the work?

689
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,430
Why are you sitting here?

690
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,350
Get some fresh air

691
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,560
and clear my mind.

692
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,430
Is the design not going well?

693
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,520
No...

694
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,640
Why did I take that stage makeup job?

695
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,310
I felt awkward

696
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,350
as soon as I started.

697
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,710
It's basically asking for trouble.

698
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,000
Mr. Cui pointed out
so many mistakes I made.

699
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,430
That's embarrassing.

700
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,790
I thought you majored in

701
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,080
fine art in college.

702
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,480
Is there a big difference

703
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,960
between drawing on papers and faces?

704
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,910
That's not important.

705
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
The client even want me to do

706
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,870
a vibrant makeup in the same tone.

707
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,160
I've met that Mr. Cui before.

708
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,520
Is he so picky?

709
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,270
Yes, he is.

710
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,080
So that's his fault.

711
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,350
You bet.

712
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,270
I bet you haven't had

713
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,310
your dinner. Hungry?

00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,040
