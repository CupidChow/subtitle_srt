00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 10]

4
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,120
You're coughing really hard.

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,640
You'd better go and get some rest.

6
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,750
I want to do more practice.

7
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,920
And enjoy the warmth here.

8
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,640
Our dorm don't have this heater.

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,470
I've noticed

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
you and Li hitting off lately.

11
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,520
You should hang out with her.

12
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,390
Have some fun and relax.

13
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,790
Boss,

14
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,070
that will spend money.

15
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,520
What do you mean?

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,350
Sounds like

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,280
I don't pay you salary.

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
Didn't you get 2,000 yuan?

19
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,640
But I need to save some money.

20
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,200
You know, just in case.

21
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,280
Hey, you finally save money.

22
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,320
Good for you.

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,750
Remember when you first got here,

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,870
treating money like nothing.

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,870
Now you are more practical.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Well, you go on.

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,560
Don't be too late.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello?

29
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,710
Is someone here?

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
Hello?

31
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,480
May I help you?

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,710
Hi, miss.

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you offer makeup service here?

34
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,920
We only do hair here.

35
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,950
But Li told me

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,950
that you can do this.

37
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,430
Li?

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
Anyway, we are closed now.

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,590
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,790
What should I do?

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,710
Today is Christmas Eve.

42
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,560
Where can I get a makeup artist?

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,070
If I can't finish my work,

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,920
I'll miss the date with Li.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,920
She will be upset

46
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,350
if I can't be with her.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,870
Liang Dazhi?

48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,640
Liang Dazhi?

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,680
Liang Dazhi,

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,680
didn't you say that

51
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,560
there's an event in studio?

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,950
Why are you here?

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,230
They said you left the customers

54
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,760
and ran off.

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,870
What's going on?

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,070
Feeling bold, huh?

57
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,310
Skip out on your shift?

58
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,000
No, Li.

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,510
It's not me.

60
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,680
The one skipped work

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,360
is the makeup artist.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,870
We have one makeup artist

63
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,150
of our own studio.

64
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,800
Didn't she promise to come?

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,560
I know.

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,280
But she took a side job

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,150
and used it as an excuse

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
to bail on me.

69
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,430
That's ridiculous.

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Obviously,

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,280
it's her mistake.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,240
You should talk to your boss.

73
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,960
To be honest with you,

74
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,840
our studio

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,750
is not doing well.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,190
The boss isn't really hands-on.

77
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,430
He even asks us photographers

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,280
handle everything on our own.

79
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,280
We need to find clients,

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,080
and sign contracts ourselves.

81
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,630
He just waits to take the cut

82
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,630
at the end of the month.

83
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,710
So, the makeup artists

84
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,310
and costumer stylists

85
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,470
all started taking gigs outside.

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,360
They hardly show up,

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,470
and nobody bothers.

88
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,360
Your studio seems to be

89
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,710
in a mess.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,870
Maybe you should go freelance too.

91
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,520
I'm not that great.

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,280
And

93
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,590
I don't have the money.

94
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,680
I use the equipment at the studio.

95
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,710
Going freelance...

96
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,030
I won't even have a money-maker.

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,120
If this deal fails through today,

98
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm afraid the studio won't make it.

99
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
The thing is, I just do it for fun.

100
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm not very confident.

101
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,030
Xiaoyuan,

102
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,360
you are much better

103
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,590
than the makeup artists here.

104
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
Just consider it

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
as a favor I owe you.

106
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,470
Is that okay?

107
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,710
Well,

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm afraid I can't pay you now.

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
What... what do you say?

110
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,150
How can you do this?

111
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,190
That's alright.

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,310
Let's get inside.

113
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,400
Great.

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's go.

115
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,240
(Is this what you call)

116
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,520
(a Christmas Eve surprise?)

117
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,910
(We came all the way here)

118
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,560
(and waited for several hours.)

119
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,590
Here.

120
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,310
(Look at this place.)

121
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,190
We're here for wedding photos,

122
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,560
not a head shot.

123
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,710
This place is budget-friendly.

124
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,430
Now that's the reason.

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Go away.

126
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,190
Sorry for the wait.

127
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you for your patience.

128
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,150
Why are you so late?

129
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,280
We've been waiting forever.

130
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,680
What about our makeup?

131
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,470
She will do that for you.

132
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,560
Can she really do this?

133
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,030
Sure.

134
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,960
This makeup artist

135
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,520
is a professional.

136
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,360
Looks so young.

137
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,510
How professional could she be?

138
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,270
She may look young,

139
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,800
But I can promise
she is really experienced.

140
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,950
Where are the makeup tools?

141
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,630
Yeah,

142
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,870
I'll go get them for you.

143
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,480
Hurry up!

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
A makeup artist without her tools,

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
how good could she be?

146
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,870
You can take a look at the brochure,

147
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,830
and pick a theme.

148
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll do your makeup later.

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,950
Listen.

150
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,270
When you weren't here,

151
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,040
I went through this one like crazy.

152
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,600
I pick this one.

153
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,950
Can you do that?

154
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,510
You will find out later

155
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,680
whether I can do this.

156
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,630
Well, you even use a knockoff,

157
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,000
and now you are bossing around?

158
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,510
A knockoff?

159
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,920
This is not a knockoff.

160
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,750
Yes. Yes.

161
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,310
Makeup tools, here we are.

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
I bet you, this is genuine.

163
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
Leave me alone.

164
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,870
What does she know?

165
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
No need to get angry, okay?

166
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,070
This is it?

167
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,120
I know,

168
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,240
but we can figure it out.

169
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,510
You are girls.

170
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,920
I bet you must have some makeups.

171
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,720
For your record,

172
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't use too much makeup.

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,270
I don't have many cosmetics.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,950
I do want to help you,

175
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,800
but I can't with this.

176
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,510
Xiaoyuan,

177
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,600
I have some.

178
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,680
Wait a moment.

179
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,510
Here they are.

180
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,390
Your skin is fair,

181
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,310
this doesn't suit her.

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
These are all okay,

183
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,070
but I still need something else.

184
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,190
That's so complicated.

185
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,270
I just don't understand.

186
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,070
Some girls have

187
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,270
a whole box of cosmetics,

188
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,630
while others are fine

189
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,870
with just a few. Why?

190
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,190
Then why do some boys

191
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,160
have a shoe collection

192
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
that won't fit in a closet,

193
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,390
while others are happy
with just one pair?

194
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,390
That's right.

195
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,600
But why?

196
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm happy with this one pair.

197
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,480
There you go.

198
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,750
Xiaoyuan,

199
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,870
where are you going?

200
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,120
Don't worry.
I'm not going somewhere else.

201
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,160
I'll go get some cosmetics.

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,750
Thank you.

203
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,600
Hurry up.

204
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,750
(Got some leads)

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,870
(on the tracker.)

206
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,430
Fangzhou,

207
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,000
did the Salon

208
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,920
close early today?

209
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,070
Yes.

210
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,120
Something wrong?

211
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,750
Nothing.

212
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,720
Is there a landline in the staff dorm?

213
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,160
What do you want?

214
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,720
Still want to see Jiang Xiaoyuan?

215
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,750
I thought you were not talking.

216
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,750
You can just tell me.

217
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,870
Don't ask too much.

218
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,430
Listen up, Qi Lian.

219
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't mess with me here.

220
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Xiaoyuan is already

221
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,270
going through a lot alone.

222
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,560
Don't go and add more trouble

223
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,390
for her.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,630
Alright.

225
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,310
I'll ask her later.

226
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,510
If she says yes,

227
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,630
I'll let her to give you a call.

228
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,510
(Hello?)

229
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:55,830
Yes.

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,870
Xiaoyuan isn't in the dorm now.

231
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,360
Maybe she hasn't gone back yet.

232
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,600
(What do you want with her?)

233
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
(Is it about her grandmother?)

234
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,680
(Didn't you already find someone)

235
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,870
(to take care of her?)

236
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,800
No.

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,070
I got to go.

238
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,070
I'm either at the Salon

239
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,950
or in the dorm.

240
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,430
Don't use the “no phone” excuse

241
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,360
to avoid me.

242
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,430
(But she is not at the Salon,)

243
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,480
(dorm, or on the way)

244
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,040
(between the two right now.)

245
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,190
Since they know

246
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
about my presence.

247
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,310
There's a risk of exposure.

248
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,270
Do you think

249
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,360
they'll cause trouble for me?

250
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,160
(Perhaps I made a wrong assumption.)

251
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,560
(They've already started moving?)

252
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,870
Hello.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,720
This cushion foundation

254
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,960
is new for this season.

255
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
It works really well

256
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
for priming and concealing.

257
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,870
The texture of this foundation

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
is finely hydrated.

259
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,670
It can adhere closely to the skin.

260
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,030
Users with good skin

261
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,960
can use it

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,030
as a foundation directly.

263
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,750
I have all your foundations.

264
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,870
But this one works well

265
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,030
for brightening the skin tone.

266
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,910
I'll go with this.

267
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,840
Okay.

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,720
Anything else

269
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,960
I can help you with?

270
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,750
No, I'll take a look myself.

271
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,360
Sure.

272
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,390
The new lipstick shades

273
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,200
looks amazing.

274
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,630
The one you're holding

275
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,480
doesn't suit you the best.

276
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,120
I'm not really good at this.

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,240
Let's go with this one.

278
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,270
Orange tones make you look brighter

279
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,630
and suit you well.

280
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,790
Blot your lips.

281
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,840
You are right.

282
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,750
I feel that my face

283
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,630
is glowing.

284
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,440
Xiaoyuan, good for you.

285
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,200
Then let's get it.

286
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,120
I just want to...

287
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,320
have a look,

288
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,240
not planning to buy it.

289
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,270
I picked it, so that's my treat.

290
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,390
Let's go.

291
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,600
Thank you, Xiaoyuan.

292
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,390
(There he goes again.)

293
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,510
(Does he really think he's handsome?)

294
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,910
What do you want?

295
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,270
I went to the Salon.

296
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,510
You were not there.

297
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,750
I thought you...

298
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,270
Are you worrying about me?

299
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,320
Please don't.

300
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm a lucky girl.

301
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,550
That's nothing.

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,720
Is it about the tracker?

303
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,910
Anything new?

304
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,480
It's from a company

305
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,390
in Chongqing.

306
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,550
That's all.

307
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,120
And...?

308
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,630
No more details.

309
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,240
I might have to go to Chongqing

310
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,200
and check the sales records.

311
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,080
I'll go with you.

312
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,960
No,

313
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,630
you can't go.

314
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
Why?

315
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,790
That Jiang Xiaoyuan was expelled

316
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,240
from school in Chongqing.

317
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,200
Are you worried that

318
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,510
I'll find out something?

319
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,030
Don't get me wrong.

320
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,390
Your current location

321
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,390
might be exposed.

322
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,870
I'm concerned for your safety.

323
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,670
Who are you concerned about?

324
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,240
Alright. Don't say it.

325
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,870
I got it.

326
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,240
Why are you following me?

327
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,720
Take you home.

328
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,670
No need.

329
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
I have something else to do now.

330
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,390
I won't go home.

331
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,360
Where are you going?

332
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,030
No need to worry.

333
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,150
I'll go wherever I want.

334
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,600
That's not safe.

335
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm worried.

336
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,550
Qi Lian,

337
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,630
can you please

338
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,440
don't talk to me

339
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,120
in this way?

340
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,480
I might

341
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,550
think it wrong.

342
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,120
That's your fault.

343
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,720
Hey, excuse me?

344
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,960
Nothing.

345
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,360
I just feel like hitting you.

346
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,240
Miss Jiang,

347
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,480
you finally come back.

348
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,790
That customer is a tough one.

349
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,120
Did you get the cosmetics?

350
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,840
Yes.

351
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,030
I got everything I need

352
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
from a fair-price shop

353
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,150
for under 200 yuan.

354
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,150
Excellent.

355
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,080
As soon as I get my salary,

356
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,910
I'll pay you back.

357
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:54,720
Let's go inside.

358
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,030
Wait.

359
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,270
Let her go.

360
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,320
Your boyfriend?

361
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,750
No.

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,600
He came out of nowhere.

363
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,320
He wants to drop by,

364
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,120
so here we are.

365
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,720
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

366
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,320
did Chen Fangzhou know

367
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,440
that you are doing side gigs?

368
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
I'm not doing side gigs.

369
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,030
Ask him

370
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,750
if I got paid.

371
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,030
No, she didn't.

372
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,910
Miss Jiang

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,150
just tried to help me out.

374
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,200
Do you know him?

375
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
Do you have a business license?

376
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,120
What are you doing now?

377
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,790
Are you here to stir up trouble?

378
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,390
Before helping him,

379
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,120
you should make sure

380
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,120
to verify his identity.

381
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,870
What if he's the one

382
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,600
who put the tracker

383
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,750
on your phone?

384
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,480
Think about it.

385
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,390
Sir,

386
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,030
you have to be careful with your words.

387
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,870
I have never put something

388
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,080
on someone else's phone.

389
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,200
Don't mind him.

390
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,240
He is kind of a psycho.

391
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,550
You go back to the dorm

392
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,510
or ask him to prove

393
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,000
that his business is legal.

394
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Let me go.

395
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,000
Li!

396
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,910
Li!

397
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,030
Yes.

398
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,790
Here I am.

399
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,240
What's going on?

400
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,630
Mr. Qi...?

401
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,150
Why are you here?

402
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,150
You's better clarify this

403
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,120
with Mr. Qi,

404
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,440
or he might report your boyfriend

405
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,320
for illegal business activities.

406
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,960
Fine, stop that.

407
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,270
Look at what you got,

408
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,000
They just have a few dresses.

409
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,320
This one looks a bit better,

410
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,270
but it's worn-out.

411
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,440
Let me see.

412
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,830
Step back.

413
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,790
What can you do about this?

414
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,880
Could you please calm down?

415
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,200
I'll help you figure it out.

416
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,720
What can be done?

417
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,160
If all the dresses are like this,

418
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,110
I won't shoot.

419
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,070
Do you have scissors?

420
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,350
Scissors...

421
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:32,960
Scissors!

422
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,350
Did you find it?

423
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes.

424
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,310
What... what are you doing?

425
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,160
What are you doing?

426
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,550
Stand still.

427
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,440
The straps didn't suit you.

428
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Now you looks better.

429
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,880
It's quite stylish without them.

430
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,920
Exactly.

431
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,270
Oh, yes.

432
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,110
It looks better than before.

433
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,790
Is it?

434
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Yeah, much better.

435
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,160
Let's go get your makeup.

436
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,510
Hurry up, honey.

437
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,160
There you go.

438
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,510
Take a seat.

439
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,110
Come and lend a hand.

440
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,830
Give me those cosmetics.

441
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,750
Put them there.

442
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,350
These cosmetics

443
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,310
look pretty cheap.

444
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,270
Are they any good?

445
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,640
You might not get it.

446
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,590
Sometimes,

447
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,750
it's not about the price.

448
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,640
A 20 yuan product could be better

449
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,440
than a 200 yuan one.

450
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,550
If I'm not mistaken,

451
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,440
you are using

452
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,640
the latest bestseller, right?

453
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,960
It doesn't suit you.

454
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,440
How do you know about that?

455
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,720
It must be cakey.

456
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,880
That's amazing.

457
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,240
You can even tell that.

458
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,960
Alright,

459
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,880
let's get started.

460
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,270
Look at here.

461
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,920
You two look really good.

462
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,720
These are the best wedding photos

463
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,720
I've ever taken.

464
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,160
OK,

465
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,200
come a little closer.

466
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,640
Great.

467
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,200
Xiaoyuan,

468
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,350
thank you so much!

469
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,550
Dazhi and I want to treat you a meal.

470
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,640
No thanks.

471
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,680
You two enjoy your date.

472
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,830
I don't want to be a third wheel.

473
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,110
Maybe buy me coffee sometimes.

474
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,830
OK.

475
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,350
Honestly,

476
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,590
you are amazing at makeup.

477
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,640
Have you considered about

478
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
turning it into a profession?

479
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,550
No.

480
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,160
Come on.

481
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,400
Don't you have no plans

482
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,680
for your future?

483
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,000
You're good at

484
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,920
hairdressing, makeup,

485
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,480
and even styling.

486
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,240
It's a waste working in a salon.

487
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,830
I don't think those stylists

488
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,790
in fashion styling studios

489
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,880
are better than you.

490
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,000
Hard to say.

491
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,680
I...

492
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,110
might not be here for too long.

493
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,400
I'll go check the photos.

494
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,550
Miss Jiang.

495
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,830
You've dressed me up so well.

496
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,350
I was worried that

497
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,000
you might make me ugly

498
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,110
because of my bad attitude earlier.

499
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,920
Seems that it's my fault.

500
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,790
Thank you so much.

501
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,880
You're welcome.

502
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,880
We're in the service industry.

503
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,920
Customers' satisfaction is crucial.

504
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,160
Don't forget to pay.

505
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,270
That's for sure.

506
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,720
We'll have a wedding banquet.

507
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,310
I'll invite you to it.

508
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,160
I'm sorry I can't attend.

509
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,110
I don't have money for your gift.

510
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,270
I'll take off now.

511
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,070
Goodbye.

512
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,550
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

513
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,200
Bye.

514
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,240
It's done.

515
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,070
Let's change clothes over there.

516
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,640
Okay.

517
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,070
Why are you still here?

518
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,440
Take this.

519
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,400
You have a cold.

520
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,440
Take the medicine.

521
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,160
Let's go.

522
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,510
Thank you.

523
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,400
Wait me here for a moment.

524
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,480
Hello, a hot cocoa, please.

525
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,270
Sure.

526
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,790
That's 20 yuan. You can scan the code.

527
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,480
Okay.

528
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,480
Getting off work so late?

529
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,480
I bet you must

530
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,200
really love what you do.

531
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,510
Still so happy at this hour?

532
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,590
Here you are.

533
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,880
Thank you.

534
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,830
This is for you.

535
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,030
Thanks for your help earlier.

536
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,590
Qi Lian,

537
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,270
Don't waste time on me.

538
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,550
I'm not her.

539
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,350
Even though

540
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,510
we look exactly the same,

541
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,200
we are completely

542
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,510
different people.

543
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,550
Instead of wasting time

544
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,550
on me,

545
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,750
it would be better for you

546
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,880
to focus on the tracker.

547
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,350
Get me out here sooner

548
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,590
and she can also

549
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,480
be here with you earlier,

550
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,000
Right?

551
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,550
Alright,

552
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,480
you don't have to walk me home.

553
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,640
See you.

she is really talented

573
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,270
in makeup and styling,

574
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,000
especially her aesthetics.

575
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,640
She is better than most stylists.

576
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,960
But she can't

577
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,790
settle for anything.

578
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
The photography studio is here.

579
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,030
They want to hire Jiang Xiaoyuan.

580
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,110
They offered a double salary.

581
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,790
What?

582
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,640
Jiang Xiaoyuan won't work here?

583
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,350
Thank you for your kind offer

584
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,110
and your coming.

585
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,350
But,

586
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,030
I'm not considering a job change

587
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,750
at the moment.

588
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,640
Miss Jiang,

589
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,350
you don't have to make a quick decision.

590
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,750
Please take your time and think it over.

591
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,830
I believe

592
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,440
you'll make the best choice.

593
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,750
Sorry for interrupting.

594
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,720
I'll take my leave now.

595
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,240
Okay,

596
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,240
goodbye.

597
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,960
Goodbye, Miss Jiang.

598
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:51,830
Bye.

599
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,000
Double the salary?

600
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,510
Do you want that?

601
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,720
Kind of.

602
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,550
That photo studio is clearly

603
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,640
on the verge of closing down.

604
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,750
Even so, she still wants to work there.

605
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,240
What a foolish girl.

606
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,440
Did she hand in her resignation?

607
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,270
Not yet,

608
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,880
But I'm afraid it's coming soon.

609
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,160
Qi Lian,

610
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,640
you got to help me out.

611
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,640
She's amazing!

612
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,030
I've pushed in so much effort
to train her.

613
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,480
I was also at that studio yesterday.

614
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,550
I can see that

615
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,790
she is really talented

616
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,030
and might prefer makeup

617
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
over hair styling.

618
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,000
I don't care.

619
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,960
You have to persuade her

620
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
to stay .

621
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Qi Lian?

622
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,110
Qi Lian!

623
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,830
Qi Lian...

624
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,720
Don't worry.

625
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,110
She won't go.

626
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,680
How did you know?

627
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,750
There is a pact between us.

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,030
There must be something wrong.

629
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,790
Qi Lian,

630
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,480
lately, I feel you two

631
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,720
are pretty weird,

632
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,110
especially you.

633
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,270
One moment,
you're really nice to her,

634
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,110
then you're harsh.

635
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,110
Now you have been dumped,

636
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,680
you still seem oddly self-assured.

637
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,920
Are you having a split personality
or something?

638
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,750
That's not what it looks like.

639
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,830
Then what is it? Tell me.

640
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,480
Fangzhou,

641
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,790
have you noticed that

642
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,830
the current Jiang Xiaoyuan

643
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,070
is different from before?

644
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,160
Yes, I have.

645
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
She has gained a bit of

646
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,350
spoiled arrogance now,

647
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,550
and a sense of superiority.

648
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,310
But when she lived in the countryside,

649
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
she never bowed down to anyone.

650
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,000
In our class, who dared to

651
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,030
compete with her in academic grades?

652
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,640
She used to top every exam.

653
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,240
If you were in her shoes,
wouldn't you be proud?

654
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,880
In my opinion,

655
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,920
after she went to a big city

656
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,640
Chongqing

657
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,640
and came back

658
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,550
to our small town,

659
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,640
that could be inevitable.

660
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,550
Don't you think so?

661
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,590
What if I tell you

662
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
that she is not Jiang Xiaoyuan,

663
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,110
but someone else

664
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,000
who looks identical to her?

665
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,000
Come on.

666
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,270
What are you talking about?

667
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,550
Does that make sense?

668
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,550
If she is not Jiang Xiaoyuan

669
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,590
then who is she?

670
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,160
Find me someone else

671
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,960
who's a carbon copy

672
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,960
with that bad temper of hers.

673
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,790
And we'll see.

674
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,680
I'm telling you.

675
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,880
You're too caught up in the situation.

676
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,720
You've waited her for so many years,

677
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,350
and she is finally come back.

678
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,750
Can't you stop being stupid
and cherish her?

679
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,400

Why are you here?

684
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,880
Boss,

685
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm here to resign.

686
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Qi Lian, look at her.

687
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,830
How dare she said this to me.

688
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
You're really leaving?

689
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,830
Just kidding, boss.

690
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,160
Of course I won't go.

691
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,070
Boss,

692
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,070
I know you've been good to me.

693
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,160
I want to express my gratitude.

694
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,310
Qi Lian, look at her.

695
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,310
How sweet she said this to me.

696
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,480
She has touched me.

697
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,160
Are you still saying that
she is not Jiang Xiaoyuan?

698
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,000
Who would believe that?

699
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,160
But, boss,

700
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,200
I have a suggestion.

701
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,880
We could consider introducing

702
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,830
a makeup service.

703
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,680
Firstly,

704
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,880
it can boost our earnings.

705
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,640
Secondly,

706
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,110
I can contribute my efforts.

707
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,240
As for the profits,

708
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,440
how about a 50/50 split?

709
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,790
Not really.

710
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm just a store manager.

711
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,270
Do you think I'm a shareholder?

712
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,550
I must follow

the rules of the company.

714
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,350
It's not easy for me

715
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
to make such a decision.

716
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,790
Forget about it.

I really need to use the bathroom.

719
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,240
What? Get me chopsticks.

720
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,750
Or I have to eat with my hand?

00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,400
I'm starving.

please give us some chopsticks.

724
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,400
No problem.

Do you really want to do
the beauty makeup?

728
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,640
Not really.

00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,480
trail operation.

771
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,550
The hair-styling team
is usually quite busy,

772
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,680
so we won't bother them.

773
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,960
Any volunteers

774
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,920
in our shampooing duty?

775
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,750
If you're interested,

776
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,640
please step forward.

777
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,160
Great.

778
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,310
So Jiang Xiaoyuan will go.

779
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,590
It's settled.

780
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,590
Before you head out,

781
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,640
you should sign a contract.

782
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,720
Throughout the trial period,

783
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,750
you're committed to stay on board

784
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,590
without any excuses for resignation.

785
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,790
If HQ makes beauty services

786
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,680
as part of our routine business,

787
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,000
you should stay for another six months

788
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,510
until a suitable replacement is found.

789
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,440
I don't think so.

790
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,440
What?

791
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,110
Do you really want to go?

792
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,830
Our salon is much better than that studio.

793
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,640
I...

794
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,270
I'm not...

795
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,960
Not what?

796
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,270
It's settled.

797
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,590
Well,

798
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,350
this is a rare chance.

799
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,030
Is there anyone else who wants to
give it a shot?

800
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,240
Boss,

801
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,310
I'm not a quick learner.

802
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,270
I'm afraid I can't do that.

803
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,110
Besides,

804
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,070
We've tried this type of service

805
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,830
several times before.

806
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,200
But all of them failed.

807
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:36,880
That's true.

808
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,720
This would mean losing

809
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,830
two weeks' salary.

810
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm not going.

811
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,720
Whatever you say.

812
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,640
Get out.

813
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,760
Xiaoyuan,

814
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,670
consider it as learning

815
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,550
for our team.

816
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,230
When you are back,

817
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,480
you can pass on what you've learned.

818
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,190
It's also a way

819
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
to ease my burden.

820
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,760
Alright.

821
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,110
Where is the training?

822
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,760
Chongqing.

823
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,070
Here, take it.

824
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,920
Chongqing?

825
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,550
Why are you here?

826
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,150
Excuse me.

827
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,800
I'll drop my luggage.

828
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,440
Okay.

829
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm going for the tracker.

830
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,320
I applied for a business leave

831
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,230
with the company.

832
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,920
What about you?

833
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,550
Go for a training?

834
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,510
I...

835
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,510
I just want to give it a try.

836
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,840
Is is convenient for you

837
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,590
to take me with you

838
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,920
when you go to the tracker stuff?

839
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,230
We'll see.

840
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,880
If the time permits.

841
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,960
(Excuse me.)

842
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,440
Alright.

843
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,480
(Thank you.)

844
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,280
Hey kid,

845
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,070
this is my seat.

846
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,320
Sorry.

847
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,280
Okay.

848
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,630
OK.

849
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,630
Miss,

850
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,280
you don't have a partner, right?

851
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,440
Could you please

852
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,630
switch seats with me?

853
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,880
Yes.

854
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,510
Where is your seat?

855
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,960
Over there.

856
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,880
No. 61.

857
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,710
No. 61.

858
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,920
Yes, sure.

859
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,840
Thank you.

860
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,550
Thanks.

861
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,400
You are welcome.

862
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,590
Where is your training place?

863
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,440
I can take you there.

864
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,440
No need.

865
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,510
I can take the subway.

866
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:42,960
Bye.

867
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Hold on.

868
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,920
I still have your phone.

869
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,190
You can use this one.

870
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,190
How much is it?

871
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,960
You don't have to pay me.

872
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Take it as a replacement
for your old one.

873
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,400
Alright.

874
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,480
Goodbye, then.

875
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,510
[Makeup Training]
Did you learn how to do makeup?

876
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,630
No.

877
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,510
Me, neither.

878
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm forced to be here.

879
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,190
I'm totally clueless.

880
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,030
I don't know anything about it.

881
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,960
What a coincidence.

882
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,670
But our boss insists.

883
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
We must participate in.

884
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,190
It's so annoying.

885
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,230
Yes, it is.

886
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,800
What can we learn in just two weeks?

887
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,360
I feel so bored.

888
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,510
I want to go back home.

889
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,440
You know, for a look.

890
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,230
I want to have some food.

891
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,800
I don't want to take this training.

892
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,400
Is this seat taken?

893
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,320
No, you can seat here.

894
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,320
Where are you from?

895
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,440
Luoshan.

896
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,030
Luoshan?

897
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,960
I haven't heard about it.

898
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm from Shuangliu, Chengdu.

899
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,710
You can come to find me there.

900
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,920
Are you from Shuangliu, in Chengdu?

901
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,440
Yes.

902
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,400
I heard that your clients

903
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,150
are very rich.

904
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,510
They initiate a membership card
at 100 thousand yuan.

905
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,630
Is that true?

906
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,630
Of course it's true.

907
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,840
Our clients are

908
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,670
quite generous.

909
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,630
That's awesome.

910
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,150
Are you still hiring?

911
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,640
Sir, do you need some help?

912
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,230
Sir,

913
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,960
can I help you?

914
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,830
If you notice I need help,

915
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,710
just come here.

916
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,160
Do I have to come and ask you?

917
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,910
Why are you still here?

918
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,750
Do I have to say thank you?

919
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,230
No.

920
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,080
My name is Jiang Bo.

921
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,910
You can call me Sam.

922
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,750
As for my personal information,

923
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,270
you can look it up online.

924
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,310
As for my class,

925
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,000
I don't mind whether you are focused,

926
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,750
or you're here just for

927
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,480
the certificate.

928
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,910
As long as we get along,

929
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,790
two weeks

930
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,640
will pass by quickly.

931
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,870
Of course,

932
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,790
if anyone wants to

933
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,430
give me a hard time,

934
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,230
I guarantee nobody

935
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,870
will end up happily.

936
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,480
I heard about him.

937
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,710
He was specifically recruited

938
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,040
by HQ from the renowned

939
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,560
Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy.

940
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,640
He is quite famous in the circle.

941
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,790
I've heard that his makeup skills

942
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,560
have reached the pinnacle.

943
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,520
With that attitude?

944
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,600
