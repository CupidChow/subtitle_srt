[Episode 16]

4
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,230
Xiaoyuan,

5
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,230
does the current Feng Ruixue,

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,350
remind you of the missing Feng Ruixue

7
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,480
in that world?

8
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,470
Who are you?

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,670
How did you know about us?

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
It's you.

11
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,390
Step back.

12
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
It's me,

13
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Huo Boyu,

14
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,670
from Boyu Advertising Company.

15
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
You are the precious Miss Jiang

16
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,840
from Jiang Group.

17
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,480
We were a couple

18
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,310
for three years.

19
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,840
The entire three years.

20
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,560
Are you space traveled, too?

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,790
No,

22
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,950
this is more complex

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,640
than you thought.

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,710
I... I'll

25
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,560
explain it to you later.

26
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
But why are you here?

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,710
Didn't you leave Luoshan?

28
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,310
Seems like he told you everything.

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Leaving Luoshan

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,040
was just a diversion.

31
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,680
You know,

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
I need to distract the virus.

33
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,760
What virus?

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,350
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,280
No time for talking.

36
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,920
Let's go now.

37
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,680
Go.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Space travelers all have a phone.

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,510
Do you have it?

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,840
Here.

41
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,480
Mr. Xu gave it to you?

42
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,950
How did you get here?

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,710
What...

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,480
What does this have to do
with Xu Jingyang?

45
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:42,840
I...

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,030
Xiaoyuan,

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
You got involved because of me.

49
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,840
What do you mean?

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,150
You know how space travel happened,

51
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,400
don't you?

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,750
It's too late.

53
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,590
We really have to go now.

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,190
Why should I go with you?

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,680
Don't you want to go back?

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,360
I do want to go back,

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,960
but I need to know

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
the way back.

59
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,840
I know the way.

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,960
Do you?

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Then tell me.

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,240
I can't tell you now.

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,080
Why?

64
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,000
Unless you come with me, Jiang Xiaoyuan.

65
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't understand.

66
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,800
This can't afford any more accident.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,800
Are you still playing

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,630
that trick with me?

69
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,630
I'm not Feng Ruixue.

70
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,470
You can't fool me around.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,470
[Congratulations! All tasks completed.]

72
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,030
[Space-time Channel is ready.]

73
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,600
[Confirm to return?]

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,800
You watch the gate.

75
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,030
Xiaoyuan?

76
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,710
Jiang Xiaoyuan?

77
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,870
I have to go.

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,080
Where are you going?

79
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,470
You haven't told me anything.

80
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,190
This isn't a good place to talk.

81
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,710
The virus will get me.

82
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,750
What virus?

83
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,680
He is my friend.

84
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,030
I'll come back for you.

85
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,520
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

86
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,840
we're going home.

87
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,960
That's settled, right?

88
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,680
OK.

89
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Don't tell anyone

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,910
that you met me today.

91
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,430
Or neither of us can leave.

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Xiaoyuan,

93
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,190
here you are.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,920
Didn't you hear me knocking?

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,720
No, I didn't.

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,870
Are you alone?

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,720
Why do you come here?

98
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,240
Hello?

99
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,160
Lian,

100
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,430
I'm following Huo Boyu.

101
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,070
Don't worry.

102
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,240
Don't lose him.

103
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,430
Note down the license plate number.

104
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,390
Xiaoyuan,

105
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,680
take care of yourself.

106
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,120
Try to stay with

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,950
the theater group

108
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,600
before I come back.

109
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,510
Here, Xiaoyuan.

110
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,630
Thank you, Xi.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,630
Everyone, raise your glasses!

112
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,430
Cheers!

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

114
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,510
Sit down, please.

115
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,750
Let me say a few words.

116
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,430
First off,

117
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,480
congratulations to everyone.

118
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,920
We've performed together

119
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,480
in a perfect musical.

120
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,000
Great!

121
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,830
And secondly,

122
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
our show earned a thumbs-up

123
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,070
from both the judges

124
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,630
and the audience.

125
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,430
Plus, we've earned

126
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,830
financial support

127
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,830
from the Provincial Musical Association.

128
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,480
Six provincial-level

129
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,750
theater groups

130
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,240
have invited us

131
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,120
for touring performances!

132
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,920
And thirdly,

133
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,630
we must thank

134
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,480
our makeup artist today.

135
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,750
Thank you so much,

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,750
Miss Jiang Xiaoyuan.

137
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,720
- Thank you, Xiaoyuan.
- Thank you, Xiaoyuan.

138
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,510
If it weren't for her

139
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,630
stepping up today,

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,510
we wouldn't be

141
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,430
celebrating this success.

142
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,600
So, I say

143
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,630
we all raise a glass to her.

144
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,120
- Sure.
- Great.

145
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,630
- Thank you, Xiaoyuan.
- Thanks, Xiaoyuan.

146
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
Thank you all.

147
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,160
Xiaoyuan,

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,680
I formally invite you

149
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,800
to be the regular makeup artist

150
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,800
for our theater group.

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
Thanks for the kind offer, Mr. Cui.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,160
But my company has stopped

153
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,390
the makeup services.

154
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,070
So I might not be able

155
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,920
to continue with makeup.

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,830
You're not doing makeup anymore?

157
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,720
But you are amazing.

158
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Couldn't you convince your company

159
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,830
to keep this service?

160
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,360
I'd say, why not consider
a job change?

161
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,920
With Xiaoyuan's skills,

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
finding a job at a styling studio

163
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,830
won't be a problem.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,070
Exactly.

165
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,870
Thank you all.

166
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,120
I'll think carefully

167
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,360
about my work.

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
I used to think

169
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,000
I wasn't a very persistent person.

170
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,270
I never really

171
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,390
sticking to something.

172
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,840
But since

173
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
meeting all of you,

174
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,000
I feel

175
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,320
it's truly great

176
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,390
to be able to persist

177
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,320
and do something well.

178
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,080
I also believe in

179
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,790
hard work paying off.

180
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
You deserve a brighter future.

181
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,480
I sincerely wish

182
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,510
you keep shining on stage.

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,630
I'll support you all.

184
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Cheers, everyone!

185
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,120
Great.

186
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,480
Thanks, Xiaoyuan.

187
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,240
Here, sit down please.

188
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,480
Pace yourself.

189
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,270
Slow down there.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

191
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,150
I want to talk to you.

192
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,440
That's OK.

193
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,270
You go ahead.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,630
Don't wait for me.

195
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,960
- OK.
-OK.

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,750
Let's dig in.

197
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,240
Sit.

198
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,630
Clearly,

199
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,750
you want to join them.

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,080
Why don't you?

201
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,870
You feel embarrassed?

202
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,960
I don't need your pity.

203
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,270
Sure,

204
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,550
I'm not in a position

205
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,750
to pity you.

206
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,910
You are so annoying.

207
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,960
I don't like you, now.

208
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,360
But as an old friend,

209
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,440
I should have a drink with you.

210
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,510
If we can meet when I get back,

211
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,630
let's make up.

212
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,440
What are you talking about?

213
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,150
Why did you leave
without a word back then?

214
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,670
What?

215
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, you are talking about
that Jiang Xiaoyuan.

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,150
She...

217
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,360
My grandma was ill.

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
I need to work

219
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,750
to cover her medical bills.

220
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,120
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

221
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,030
what's wrong with you?

222
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,200
If you need money, just ask me.

223
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,480
Don't you forget our history?

224
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,870
I'll ask anyone

225
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,000
but you.

226
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
What history?

227
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Huo Boyu means nothing to me.

228
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,750
I've known it for a while.

229
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,840
He's a two-timer

230
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,270
and played us.

231
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,790
And he also told me that

232
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,670
you are the one seduced him.

233
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
Aren't you a tough girl?

234
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,360
Why did you just leave

235
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
when you were treated badly?

236
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,910
Well, I see.

237
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,030
We're cool, right?

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,750
If you still have that problem,

239
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,550
go settle it with Huo Boyu?

240
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,720
We are not cool.

241
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,630
Back in the day,

242
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,120
you just vanished.

243
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,790
And now,

244
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,000
you're pretending we're strangers.

245
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,480
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

246
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,670
do you forget

247
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,000
what you told me?

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,630
I gave you a job out of goodwill.

249
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,510
Look at you.

250
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,150
You are on their side.

251
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,440
You embarrassed me

252
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,630
made me lose my face,

253
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,030
and went as far as
joining others to bully me.

254
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,510
Can you talk some sense here?

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,910
I didn't bully you.

256
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,200
You're not professional enough

257
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,150
but want to grab the spotlight.

258
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,840
You held such a key role

259
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,790
but you weren't putting in the effort.

260
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,600
Couldn't you be nice?

261
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Alright.

262
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
It's my fault,

263
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,670
okay?

264
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,120
Quite the tsundere girl, aren't you?

265
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,910
I apologize to you.

266
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,320
For what?

267
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,480
Everything.

268
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,790
So, I truly mean it.

269
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,320
Let's not get into it.

270
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,150
So how can you make it up to me?

271
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,150
I've hit rock bottom now.

272
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,720
What can I do to make it up?

273
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,320
You can owe me for now

274
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,320
and take your time to pay me back.

275
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,630
Alright.

276
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,150
I'll take my time.

277
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,000
Cheers.

278
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,240
Hi, Lian.

279
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,270
Huo got off the car

280
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,960
right here.

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,200
and went into neighborhood.

282
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,150
He's definitely live here.

283
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,870
But I need more time

284
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,150
to look into

285
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,910
which room he lives in.

286
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,320
Did he notice you?

287
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,080
No. That's not possible.

288
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,750
Why don't you

289
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,840
go and find Xiaoyuan now?

290
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,440
She must be freaked out today.

291
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,390
If you were kidnapped by someone,

292
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,200
but he let you go.

293
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,200
Then you feel no fear,

294
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,510
even not hoping he get caught.

295
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,000
What could be the reason?

296
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,150
Kidnapped?

297
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,630
Why did he let me go?

298
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,150
Because I'm poor and have nothing?

299
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,790
Lian,

300
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,200
that's a weird question.

301
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,080
And even

302
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,630
he let me go,

303
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't be relieved.

304
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,030
Then why do you

305
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,150
want me to get him?

306
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,390
Get who?

307
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,630
The bandit.

308
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,910
Sure, I won't stand in your way

309
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,000
to get the bandit

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,510
unless....

311
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,030
Unless you are the bandit.

312
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,390
When you get off the car,

313
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,510
I'll let you run

314
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,910
for the first.

315
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,910
Then I'll stop the people

316
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,870
chasing you from behind.

317
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,440
That's more logical,

318
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,000
isn't it?

319
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,030
Lian,

320
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
do you imply

321
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
something more?

322
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,320
Could it be Huo

323
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,360
find Xiaoyuan

324
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
and asked her to stop you?

325
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,630
No.

326
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,510
I thought Xiaoyuan is on your side.

327
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
Or, did Huo

328
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,030
confuse Xiaoyuan by offering her

329
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,510
some kind of benefits?

330
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,360
That's nonsense.

331
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Don't mind me.

332
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,150
Honestly, Lian,

333
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,750
you'd better go

334
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,600
and find Xiaoyuan.

335
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,120
What if she runs off with someone

336
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,200
and you're left in the dark?

337
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,240
I'll keep an eye on here.

338
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,240
I'll leave it to you.

339
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,720
Sure.

340
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,270
Take care.

341
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,360
(You are the precious Miss Jiang)

342
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,360
(from Jiang Group.)

343
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,910
We were a couple

344
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,790
for three years.

345
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,120
The entire three years.

346
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,390
Don't you want to go back?

347
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,030
I do want to go back,

348
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,630
but I need to know

349
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,550
the way back.

350
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,750
I know the way.

351
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,440
(I'm not Feng Ruixue.)

352
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,320
You can't fool me around.

353
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,860
[Space-time Channel is ready.]

354
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,520
[Confirm to return?]

355
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,960
(Perhaps, this time,)

356
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,150
(I can go back home.)

357
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,960
(Xiaoyuan!)

358
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,360
Go for it!

359
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,000
(Who kissed you?)

360
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,000
(Tell me, now.)

361
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,270
(You two do have)

362
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,030
(a lot in common.)

363
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
(But in my eyes,)

364
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,030
(you are different.)

365
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,830
(What if it's the person)

366
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,240
(you could never forget,)

367
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,200
and after many years,

368
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,920
(you unexpectedly meet again?)

369
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,920
(Won't you have something in your mind?)

370
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
You just ran into me

371
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,310
and mistook me for her.

372
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,720
(Honestly,)

373
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,070
(I'm all alone)

374
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,920
(in this world.)

375
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,510
I do need a friend.

376
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,880
(And your are the one)

377
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,680
(to reach out)

378
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,720
(and lend a hand to me.)

379
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,160
(But I hope that)

380
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,200
(you can see us)

381
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,440
(as friends starting anew,)

382
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,550
(instead of compromising)

383
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,110
with someone you used to love.

Hi, Lian.

576
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,550
Is he at home now?

577
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,680
I've been here all night last night.

578
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,440
I saw him take his takeout food

579
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,160
around midnight.

580
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,070
Then he was back.

581
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,680
He was out again this afternoon.

582
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,270
What now?

583
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,550
Are we going to...

584
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,680
Team one, hold the main entrance.

585
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,920
Team two, secure the perimeter.

586
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,750
The rest, follow me.

587
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,480
Go!

588
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,920
Hello?

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,030
Did you hear about Huo Boyu?

590
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,200
Another company had

591
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,750
its internal files stolen.

592
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,030
(The police have concrete evidence)

593
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
(confirming it was Huo Boyu.)

594
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,200
(Even in the Beichen case,)

595
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,160
(the police have seen)

596
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,750
(the street surveillance footage)

597
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,030
(and identified him.)

598
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,480
Which company filed the other report?

599
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,070
It's a gaming company

600
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,440
called Mammoth Games.

601
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,480
Huo Boyu

602
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,310
worked at this company

603
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,240
for five years.

604
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,070
He signed a confidentiality then,

605
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,590
so he didn't mention it to anyone,

606
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,240
(not even in his school records.)

607
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,350
You're saying

608
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,480
he stole the files of his own company?

609
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,270
I know.

610
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,920
Mammoth Games

611
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,720
specializes in

612
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,790
cutting-edge hardware,

613
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,030
quite expensive stuff.

614
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,310
So,

615
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,790
people in this business see

616
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,920
Huo Boyu as a industrial espionage.

617
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,590
Who is his actual employer?

618
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,640
The police are still investigating it.

619
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,200
But,

620
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,720
I have to warn you, bro.

621
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,550
This is not that simple.

622
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,550
(He's young,)

623
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,000
(and kept a low profile for five years.)

624
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,510
(But now, he is making a stir.)

625
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,350
He's definitely a tough one.

626
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,200
Not found.

627
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,830
Not found.

628
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,640
Not found.

629
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,440
[Fashion Hairdressing Salon]

630
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,240
Here, have a bite.

631
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,830
Sweet?

632
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,480
It's too sour.

633
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,350
I want some dragon fruit.

634
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,270
Too sour.

635
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,400
Hi, there.

636
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,640
Xiaoyuan,

637
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,830
aren't you on a day-off?

638
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,640
Why are you here?

639
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,030
I've got you something.

640
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,000
Fang,

641
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,110
this is your favorite chocolate.

642
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,550
Thank you.

643
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,920
That's amazing.

644
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,440
Here, take some.

645
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,160
Bai,

646
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,160
an eyeshadow palette for you.

647
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,440
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

648
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,440
where did you get the money

649
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,240
to buy these stuff?

650
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,680
We get paid yesterday.

651
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,750
You spent your money.

652
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,030
How are you going to get by?

653
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,160
Fengni,

654
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,680
liquid foundation.

655
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,640
Thank you, Xiaoyuan.

656
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,240
I spent my money, so what?

657
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,400
Here,

658
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
your favorite perfume.

659
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,880
Am I your sweetheart now?

660
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,110
Thanks.

661
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,030
K didn't come to work today?

662
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,830
No, she didn't.

663
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,350
This one is for her.

664
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,550
What's going on?

665
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,640
Everyone is here.

666
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Boss, perfect timing.

667
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,030
This one

668
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,270
is for you.

669
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:52,920
For me?

670
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,590
Open it.

671
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,830
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

672
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,160
are you going somewhere?

673
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,110
No.

674
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,200
Why do you say that?

675
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,510
Then why

676
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,480
do you give us

677
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,070
these stuff?

678
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,750
You know, just for fun.

679
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,110
You all received the gifts.

680
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,400
Please give us some privacy here.

681
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,110
I want to talk to Xiaoyuan.

682
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,200
Thank you, Xiaoyuan.

683
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,880
You're welcome.

684
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,440
Share some of the chocolates
with them, please.

685
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,070
Sure.

686
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,070
What is it?

687
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you changing your job?

688
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,160
No.

689
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,200
I know.

690
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,480
Our makeup service canceled.

691
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,720
That hit you hard.

692
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,200
I should take the blame.

693
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,240
I shouldn't have let you
go to that training.

694
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,710
Fangzhou,

695
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,510
you've been awesome to me.

696
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,440
Since the day I joined the salon,

697
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,590
you've taken good care of me.

698
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,920
I know that myself.

699
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm a bit prickly,

700
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,710
always getting into trouble

701
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,280
and not liking

702
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,230
to follow the rules.

703
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,070
But you've put up with me.

704
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,920
Thank you, Fangzhou.

705
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,760
Stop it.

706
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,760
Are you giving a farewell speech

707
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,710
or something?

708
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,320
No.

709
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,590
If you really want to go,

710
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,880
you don't have to be in this rush.

711
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,760
The Lunar New Year is coming soon.

712
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,230
Why not wait until after the holiday

713
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,480
to make your decision?

714
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,760
I'm so mad at you right now.

715
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
The year-end bonus isn't so much.

716
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,030
This one costs at least 500 yuan.

717
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,320
How do you make ends meet?

718
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,000
Money is earned,

719
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,070
not saved.

720
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,960
This one is pretty popular.

721
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,360
If I don't get it now,

722
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,360
it might sell out.

723
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,510
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

724
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,000
You got a lot of coffee here.

725
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,070
Who's it for?

726
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,920
For everyone.

727
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,400
Let them all take one.

728
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,960
You've really got me mad.

729
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,190
You...

730
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,110
What a black sheep.

731
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,000
The guy marrying you

732
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,030
will be in bad luck.

733
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,670
Just tell me you like it or not.

734
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,150
I don't want to get married.

735
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,760
Alright, it's fine.

736
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
I won't be in bad luck.

737
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,550
Xiaoyuan!

738
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,150
Here,

739
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,880
a phone call for you.

740
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,670
Thank you.

741
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,360
No problem.

742
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,190
Hello?

743
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,360
Xiaoyuan,

744
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,550
it's me.

745
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,800
Yes?

746
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,400
You didn't tell anyone

747
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,670
about us, right?

748
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,630
Yes.

749
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,030
Good.

750
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,550
We'll go back tonight.

751
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,110
(Remember,)

752
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,960
(9 PM tonight)

753
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,630
(at A2 Warehouse
in the northern suburbs.)

754
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,440
I'll wait for you there.

755
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,840
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

756
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,590
come here.

757
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,880
I need to talk to you.

758
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,030
After yesterday,

759
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,480
did Huo Boyu contact you again?

760
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,550
No.

761
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,550
Why?

762
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,320
Remember the stolen files

763
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,480
of Beichen Electronics?

764
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,030
Huo Boyu did it.

765
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,000
That's confirmed.

766
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,800
The police are searching
for him everywhere.

767
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,110
So?

768
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,030
So I hope

769
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,190
you'll cut ties with him,

770
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,630
and tell the police

771
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,400
everything you know.

772
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,280
Tell them what?

773
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm a space traveler?

774
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,510
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

775
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,280
when we saw Mr. Zhong

776
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,280
being carried out of the archive earlier,

777
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,960
what did you say?

778
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,440
You said that someone was behind this,

779
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,440
watching you,

780
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,800
eager to cover his track

781
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,880
and prevent you from finding the truth,

782
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,440
right?

783
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,840
Those are just speculations.

784
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,320
There is no evidence.

785
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,840
Hobart Yu is wanted by the police now.

786
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,710
This is the fact.

787
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,480
Do you think anything good

788
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,480
could come from him
reaching out to you at this time?

789
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,000
He could harm Mr. Zhong

790
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,000
to get away.

791
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,190
Today, he can do anything.

792
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,280
He won't.

793
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,920
Why do you think so?

794
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,230
Don't push me over.

795
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,670
I won't say a word.

796
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,880
If the police

797
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,070
are here today,

798
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,030
asking you about Hobart Yu,

799
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,400
are you planning

800
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,230
to tell them the same thing?

801
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,760
You tole the police about me?

802
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,630
I should hand you over

803
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,440
to the police right now.

804
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,550
Let them detain you for a while.

805
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,800
It's better than you
walking into danger.

806
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,760
Huo Boyu is also a space traveler,

807
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
just like me.

808
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,430
He is a space traveler?

809
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,710
Are you sure?

810
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,350
He showed me his phone.

811
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,600
He knows

812
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,080
everything happened in my world.

813
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm sure that

814
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,480
he is exactly that Huo Boyu.

815
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,430
If he is a space traveler,

816
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
why did he steal files?

817
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
If he is truly innocent,

818
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,310
why does he run away when he sees me?

819
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,080
Also, how did he

820
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,830
get that phone?

821
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,560
Does he have any connection

822
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,270
with Xujing Yang in your world?

823
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,350
I don't know.

824
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,230
I don't need to know.

825
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,640
He can take me home, that's all.

826
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,270
I don't have to look into

827
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,600
anything in your world.

828
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,430
Can you be sure

829
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,750
that he won't harm you?

830
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,600
He still wants to

831
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,390
get me back.

832
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,710
So he can take our money

833
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,350
for his company.

834
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,310
So many benefits

835
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,270
are waiting for him.

836
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,750
He won't harm me.

837
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,120
Are you not going to let it go

838
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,480
no matter what I say?

839
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,270
Actually, you don't care about

840
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,000
whether I can go back,

841
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,430
right?

842
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,350
All your concern

843
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,560
about Huo Boyu

844
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,640
is just to prove

845
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,710
that you are right.

846
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,270
You'll go with him,

847
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:02,960
won't you?

848
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:12,870
Alright,

849
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,680
I'll let you go.

850
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,080
But he'd better not have any issues.

851
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,910
Or, before he takes you away,

852
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,160
I will definitely stop him,

853
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,080
reveal his true colors,

854
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,910
and ensure your safety.

855
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,520
Sorry.

856
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
I need to know the truth.

857
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,830
I want her

858
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,230
to come back.

859
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,790
I also need to meet Xu Jingyang

860
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,270
and find out the answers.
