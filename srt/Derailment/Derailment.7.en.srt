00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,720
How can I know that?

192
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,510
What are you talking about?

193
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,670
This is my phone.

194
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,840
How come you have one too?

195
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,790
I wrote that post.

196
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,840
And I arranged to meet you

197
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,000
at the City Square today.

198
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,910
Are you really a space traveler?

199
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,720
Yes.

200
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,870
There really are

201
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,550
space travelers in this world.

202
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,480
How did you get that phone?

203
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,840
Is it from another space traveler?

204
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,630
Did he make it back?

205
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,550
What about her,

206
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,720
the original Jiang Xiaoyuan?

207
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,000
How would I know?

208
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
Why wouldn't you know?

209
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,360
You are in her body,

210
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,240
using her identity!

211
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,630
I don't want her body and identity!

212
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,270
The real me in the original world

213
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,670
is much better than here.

214
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,960
(If she is a space traveler,)

215
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,360
(does that mean Xu Jingyang is as well?)

216
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,440
(Is it possible that)

217
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,910
(he's in a different world,)

218
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,120
(and that's why I can't find him?)

219
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,870
(But where is)

220
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,630
(original Jiang Xiaoyuan?)

221
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,240
Don't leave my sight

222
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,720
until I figure out the truth.

223
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
Let me go!

224
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,550
You're hurting me.

225
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,150
All your tenderness and warmth,

226
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,270
turns out they were only

227
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,510
for that Jiang Xiaoyuan.

228
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,440
Too bad I'm not her.

229
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,880
Before I find

230
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the original Jiang Xiaoyuan,

231
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,400
you have no right

232
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,750
to control her body.

233
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,110
I have no right?

234
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,160
Then do you have it?

235
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,550
You feel guilty about her, right?

236
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,030
You want to make amends,

237
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
but you don't know how to face her.

238
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,510
Qi Lian,

239
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
ask yourself.

240
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,030
Who are you to her now?

241
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,920
If you hurt me,

242
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,790
she won't come back.

243
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,270
I may not be someone special to her.

244
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,920
But if your presence

245
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,200
keeps her from returning,

246
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,350
I'll make you regret

247
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,830
coming into this world.

248
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,310
Qi Lian! I can't believe

249
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,590
you're treating me like this!

250
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,030
Do you remember this place?

251
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,270
Is it where you woke up

252
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,270
a month ago?

253
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,720
How do you know this place?

254
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,510
On the day you woke up,

255
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,070
someone sent your coordinates

256
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,440
to this phone.

257
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,270
And this phone

258
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,480
used to be Xu Jingyang's.

259
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,310
Xu Jingyang...?

260
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,310
Do you know him?

261
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,440
Xu Jingyang...

262
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,920
Mr. Xu...

263
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,960
You know him!

264
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,680
He gave me that phone.

265
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Take me to find him.

266
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
Is he still alive?

267
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,720
How is his leg?

268
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,350
Is he the friend you talked about?

269
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Did he tell you something

270
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,030
about space traveling?

271
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,640
Did he tell you

272
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,240
why he gave you this phone?

273
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,200
No.

274
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,640
We don't have any connection

275
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,750
except for this phone.

276
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,350
Okay.

277
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,510
As long as he's alive,

278
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,440
I can find him for sure.

279
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,720
Neither of you

280
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,880
is from this world.

281
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,400
If Xu Jingyang can go back,

282
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,830
then you should be able to as well.

283
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,830
Tell me!

284
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,030
How did you

285
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,960
come to this world?

286
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,640
How can you go back?

287
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,510
I warn you.

288
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
Leave this world as soon as possible.

289
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,270
And give this body

290
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,270
back to Jiang Xiaoyuan.

291
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,350
If it's possible,

292
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,790
I'll go back with you.

293
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,960
I want to meet Xu Jingyang in person.

294
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,640
I've tried everything.

295
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,790
If I could go back,

296
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,680
I would have done so already.

297
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,920
No need to bother you.

298
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,550
Think of everything

299
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,270
and every detail

300
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,310
that you encountered

301
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,310
before space traveling

302
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
until you nailed it.

303
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,270
Don't push me so hard.

304
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,440
I've made it clear.

305
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,680
I care more about her

306
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,310
and whether my friend can come back

307
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,270
than your life.

308
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,830
Do you simply not care about

309
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,750
my life or death?

310
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
I hate you.

311
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,000
Jiang Xiaoyuan, where are you going?

312
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,270
That day, I went off the bridge

313
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,550
with both myself and the car.

314
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,160
I'll jump off now.

315
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
Hope I can make it.

316
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,920
You are crazy.

317
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,110
You are worried.

318
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,550
You are worried that after I jump,

319
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,790
her body will die.

320
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
What do you want?

321
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
I'll look into it.

322
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,030
It would be best

323
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,200
if you return safely

324
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,750
and so does

325
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,830
the original Jiang Xiaoyuan.

326
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,030
Otherwise, at least

327
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,920
I'll never let you

328
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
do something to her body.

329
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
So, until I find the way

330
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,000
to send you back,

331
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,480
you can't go anywhere.

332
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,830
Give it to me!

333
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,270
Give me that!

334
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,110
Why?

335
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,310
Why should it

336
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,790
all be your call?

337
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,920
The more you worry about her,

338
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,200
the less I'll play along.

339
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,590
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

340
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,110
don't think too highly about yourself.

341
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,640
If you really had guts,

342
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,510
you could just used this knife

343
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,400
on your neck just now.

344
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,270
If your original life

345
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,790
is as great as you said,

346
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,400
would you be willing to pass up

347
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,440
the opportunity?

348
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,550
Here is the deal.

349
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,070
Go back to the salon.

350
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,510
Get back to work tomorrow.

351
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,240
In this world,

352
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,590
play well the part of Jiang Xiaoyuan.

353
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,030
Don't let anyone spot any flaws.

354
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,480
Aren't you afraid I'll runaway?

355
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,270
Sure, you can run.

356
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,750
But without this phone,

357
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,880
can you really go back?

358
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,550
If you want to go back,

359
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,790
you must do as I say.

360
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,440
[Fashion Hairdressing Salon]

361
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,070
I'll help you

362
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,200
with your return.

363
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,440
Just remember,

364
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,200
keep it discreet and flawless.

365
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,350
Boss.

366
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,960
There you are.

367
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,030
You caused trouble and ran away,

368
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,200
not even answering the phone.

369
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,030
I had to

370
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,200
rush back from the headquarter.

371
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,510
Could you please explain,

372
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,200
Jiang Xiaoyuan?

373
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,440
Why did you run?

374
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,400
Afraid of being blamed?

375
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,110
Whatever you say.

376
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,880
Hey,

377
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,830
what's your problem?

378
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,070
Am I that kind of boss

379
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,160
that don't tell right and wrong?

380
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,350
No, I'm not.

381
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,550

out of line, right?

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,590
Then hide your emotions.

Anyone who sees you now

581
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840

blow-drying, coloring and perming.

As junior stylists,

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,630
we should also
