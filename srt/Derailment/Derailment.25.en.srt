Looks like Fan Xiaoxiao

195
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,480
doesn't trust you that much.

196
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,360
You helped her keep Jiang Xiaoyuan

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
and monitor her every day,

198
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,270
but you don't even know

199
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,630
why she needs Jiang Xiaoyuan.

200
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,390
Save it.

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,440
You won't get anything from me.

202
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,240
Unfortunately,

203
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,480
Jiang Xiaoyuan thought

204
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,870
you hired her as your assistant

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
because you recognized her abilities

206
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,670
and you gave her chances

207
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,270
because you appreciated her talent.

208
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,670
Excuse me.

209
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,480
Mr. Jiang.

210
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,910
It's not easy to bring down Fan Xiaoxiao,

211
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,240
but it's not hard to get to you.

212
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,790
Since I found out that Fan Xiaoxiao

213
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,390
is the owner of Zhuangmeng,

214
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,720
I've had someone investigate you.

215
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,510
When you were 10 years old,

216
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,480
you were sent to

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,750
a mental rehabilitation center

218
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,270
and stayed there for four years.

219
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,390
If that part of your experience

220
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,910
gets exposed,

221
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,670
do you think anyone would hire you?

222
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,510
You got the Intermediate
Makeup Artist Certification.

223
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
Congratulations.

224
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,390
What's wrong?

225
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,960
Are you not happy?

226
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,910
I'm just not sure

227
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,030
(if I'm able)

228
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,840
(to do this job.)

229
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

230
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,550
Are you trying to show off?

231
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,510
Do you know

232
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,240
who you're working for?

233
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,510
(Jiang Bo.)

234
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,510
(He's is a genius in the industry,)

235
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,320
(mean and arrogant.)

236
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,240
(You can even handle him.)

237
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,480
(That should give you confidence.)

238
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,030
But what if he hired me

239
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
for some other reason?

240
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,510
After all, I've just switched
to this profession

241
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,150
don't have any excellent skills.

242
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,840
Don't doubt yourself.

243
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,960
Put yourself together.

244
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,200
(By the way,)

245
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,440
(there's a fashion show in a few days,)

246
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,550
and I'm invited.

247
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,320
Why don't you come along?

248
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,270
Okay.

249
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,670
(See you then.)

250
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,550
Bye.

251
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
Let me take you home.

252
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,270
Do you know

253
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,550
why Jiang Bo hired me?

254
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,910
I want to know the truth.

255
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,840
Sorry.

256
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,840
I promised to stop looking into it,

257
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,080
but I have my reasons.

258
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,240
Jiang Bo

259
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,480
is related to

260
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,390
what I'm investigating.

261
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,510
I found out that Huo Boyu

262
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,480
worked for

263
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,870
Mammoth Games earlier,

264
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,600
and the owner of this company now

265
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,030
is Fan Xiaoxiao.

266
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,790
Fan Xiaoxiao?

267
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Isn't she the editor-in-chief

268
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,320
of Galaxy Magazine?

269
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,870
She's not only the editor-in-chief

270
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,120
of Galaxy Magazine

271
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,670
but also

272
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,030
the owner of Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy.

273
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Now it seems

274
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,270
that there is some personal relationship

275
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,200
between she and Jiang Bo.

276
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,630
Therefore,

277
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,790
being Jiang Bo's assistant

278
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,600
means

279
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,360
working for

280
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,550
Fan Xiaoxiao indirectly.

281
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,840
You're being watched by her.

282
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,550
What do you mean?

283
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,270
Another employee of Fan Xiaoxiao

284
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,150
who participated in
the experiment with you,

285
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,080
Huo Boyu,

286
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,870
is suspicious.

287
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,600
First of all,

288
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,790
as an employee

289
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,870
of Mammoth Games,

290
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,920
[Huo Boyu; Suspicious]
he became

291
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,240
[Huo Boyu; Suspicious]
a tester for the Lighthouse System.

292
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,870
Secondly,

293
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,240
after his memories

294
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
were completely overwritten,

295
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,030
the Light Laboratory induced him

296
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,670
to stop us from finding the truth.

297
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,960
Yet, in the end,

298
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,910
due to Mammoth Games' report,

299
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,150
the police mistakenly thought

300
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,670
he was a corporate espionage.

301
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,750
Thirdly,

302
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,510
the reason why the Light Laboratory

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,750
can continue the research

304
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,000
of the Lighthouse System

305
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,270
is apparently because

306
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,150
they found a new investor.

307
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,360
And the research project

308
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
that Huo Boyu participated in
during his time at Mammoth Games

309
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,550
involved a massive investment,

310
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,200
and the content of the research
was never released to the public.

311
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,600
[Mammoth Games called the police]
Taking advantage of Huo Boyu's situation,

312
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,870
Mammoth Games announced
the cancellation of the project,

313
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,630
putting an end
to the substantial investment.

314
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
Are you saying

315
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,550
that Fan Xiaoxiao is

316
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,960
the Light Laboratory's new investor?

317
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,200
They are continuing

318
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,630
the Lighthouse System research

319
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,320
under the umbrella of Mammoth Games,

320
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,870
is that so?

321
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,000
If Fan Xiaoxiao

322
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,440
is related to the Mingguang Laboratory,

323
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,480
then Jiang Bo getting you
into Zhuangmeng

324
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,150
is probably not a coincidence.

325
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,960
You knew it was dangerous,

326
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,440
why did you have to
keep investigating it?

327
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
Is it because of Xu Jingyang?

328
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,590
I've always had a question.

329
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,960
Why do we both know

330
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,030
Xu Jingyang?

331
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
And why does Xu Jingyang

332
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,070
look exactly

333
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,110
like Noah?

334
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,510
Because just like you,

335
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,070
I also used to be a participant.

336
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,350
in the Lighthouse System experiment.

337
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,960
This joke is not funny at all.

338
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,440
[Lighthouse System

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,070
You...

341
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:55,920
Yes.

342
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,640
I didn't go crazy

343
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
after the experiment.

344
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
After all these years,

345
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,750
I'm still alive and well.

346
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,680
When I found this contract

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,110
in the old house,

348
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,270
[Party B: Qi Lian]
the first thing that came to my mind

349
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,830
was that if I can

350
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,070
live well until today,

351
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,790
you can also do it.

352
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,680
I'm even glad

353
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,550
that I took part in the experiment.

354
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Turns out not all participants

355
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,590
will end up

356
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,480
like Huo Boyu.

357
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,070
My existence

358
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,790
is the best evidence.

359
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,400
But why didn't you tell me

360
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
at that time?

361
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,270
All you could think about was

362
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,750
not to get me involved.

363
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,200
You didn't want to hear anything

364
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,920
about the Light Laboratory.

365
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,640
If you were also a participant,

366
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,110
have your memories also been altered?

367
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,590
From the results,

368
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,350
Xu Jingyang successfully replaced

369
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,720
Chen Tianyang in my memories.

370
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,160
That's why everyone around me

371
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
doesn't remembers Xu Jingyang.

372
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,790
Then

373
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,070
what's the relationship

374
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,110
between Xu Jingyang and Noah?

375
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,030
The Xu Jingyang I know

376
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,960
and the one you know

377
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,510
are probably both characters

378
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,750
created by Noah.

379
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,200
That's why we must find Noah

383
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,070

384
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,270
that Xu Jingyang is your best friend.

385
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,110
Yeah.

386
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

387
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,640
kept looking for him all these years.

388
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,750
Fortunately, the facts prove

389
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,550
that he is at least

390
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,920
a real person,

391
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,350
just not as who I thought he was.

392
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,440
Have you ever thought about

393
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,310
that if the Lighthouse System experiment

394
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,640
is still being conducted

395
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,310
under his direction,

396
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,310
then the person stopping me
from finding the truth

397
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,270
could be him?

398
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,880
The one who had you hit by a car

399
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,750
could also be him.

400
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,400
I know.

401
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,440
But I still want to believe

402
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,960
that he's not that kind of person.

403
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,550
Actually, I don't really remember

404
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,550
under what circumstances

405
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,680
I got involved

406
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,960
in the Lighthouse System experiment.

407
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,030
I only remember

408
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,440
that Chen Fangzhou told me

409
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,200
that I had changed a lot

410
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,440
after I came back.

411
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,960
I forgot

412
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,000
some painful things

413
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,720
and toned down my sharpness.

414
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,640
But I know very well

415
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,350
that all these changes happened

416
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,200
because of Xu Jingyang.

417
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,960
It was he

418
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,750
who healed me

419
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,680
during my most difficult times.

420
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,110
I can handle

421
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,310
my own affairs.

422
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,960
I'm worried about you.

423
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,590
You're in the top ten again

424
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,000
in this mock exam, right?

425
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,750
After this accident,

426
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,110
you missed the opportunity
to take the college entrance exam,

427
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,680
but you can still go abroad

428
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,160
and get into a good university.

429
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,030
You should leave here

430
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
as soon as possible.

431
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,790
It's the same

432
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,790
for both of us.

433
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,640
If we can't go one way,

434
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,640
let's just go another way.

435
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,750
You know what,

436
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,790
I'm ready to start over.

437
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,160
You should

438
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
also restart

439
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,830
your own life.

440
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,750
That's why I believe

441
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,350
when he was building

442
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
the Lighthouse System,

443
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,550
he had good intentions.

444
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,350
I also believe

445
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
he was that kind of person

446
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,070
you described

447
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,240
when you first met him.

448
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,030
But people change.

449
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,790
He might have lost himself in the end.

450
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,240
He may have lost himself in the end.

451
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,880
That could probably explain

452
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,590
why your ending

453
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,400
is different

454
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
from Huo Boyu's.

455
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,590
That's why I must keep investigating it.

456
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,880
I might be able to get some new clues

457
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,270
from Fan Xiaoxiao.

458
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,240
I don't know

459
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,880
what happened

462
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
but I know

463
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,680
that if the experiment continues,

464
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,480
even if he is

465
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,510

466
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,790
I'll still stop him.

Okay.

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,720
I'll find out the truth with you.

about special effects makeup techniques.

482
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,240
Special effects makeup

483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
is often used

484
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,830
in TV shows

485
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,590

486
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,110
which requires certain techniques.

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,920
Keep her around as an extra hand.

575
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,350
Amy is experienced.

576
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,440
She's been doing makeup
for celebrities for 20 years.

577
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,350
Everyone here listens to her.

578
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,200
Listen up,

579
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
don't argue with her

580
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,240
or display your bad attitude
like you do with me.

581
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,480
I know.

582
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,590
And also,

583
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,110
manage the time well.

584
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,720
Create a look

585
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,830
that the client

586
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,920
finds attractive,

587
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,960
not what you think is good.

588
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:34,760
Understand?

589
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:35,920
Yes.

590
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,350
Amy.

591
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,680
Do it for me first.

592
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,480
Sit down first.

593
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,550
Do it for her

594
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,280
according to her request.

595
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,870
Hurry up.

596
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:52,760
Me?

597
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,590
Go ahead.

598
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,590
Hello, I'm your makeup artist.

599
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,920
What's going on here?

600
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,760
I only give you

601
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,960
this chance

602
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
because you begged me.

603
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,310
Now you're not doing it yourself

604
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,830
and using it as a springboard
for your assistant.

605
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,590
Don't you need an assistant?

606
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,000
Just consider

607
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,070
what I told you yesterday.

608
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't need someone with connections.

609
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,150
I need someone who gets things done.

610
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,310
Just take her away.

611
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,150
Xie Yi is troublesome

612
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,790
and has a strong background.

613
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,760
Ordinary people can't handle her.

614
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,630
If she can

615
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,590
handle

616
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,350
the most troublesome client,

617
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,760
the problem will be solved.

618
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Don't give me an ordinary makeup look.

619
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,920
I want something unique,

620
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,480
dazzling, and surpassing others.

621
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,350
It would be the best

622
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,350
if it can make me
the number one hot topic tonight.

623
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,830
Hot topic?

624
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:51,920
Yeah.

625
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,520
I want to be irresistibly beautiful

626
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,790
like a fairy.

627
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,830
The fairy makeup look.

628
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,520
Do you get it?

629
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,440
Can you do it or not?

630
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,390
If you can't,

631
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
get someone else to do it.

632
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,240
- Don't waste my time.
- I can.

633
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,520
I can do it.

634
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,000
What are you laughing at?

635
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,630
Don't think I don't know

636
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,630
what you're thinking.

637
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,720
You think I'm not famous

638
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,070
and easy to fool, right?

639
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,480
I've seen a lot of people like you.

640
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,440
My assistant.

641
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,000
Where's my assistant?

642
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,960
Get me another makeup artist.

643
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,150
Don't yell.

644
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,590
My teacher told me to serve you well.

645
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,720
We have the same goal.

646
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,150
You want to look good on the red carpet,

647
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,590
and I want to make you look good

648
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,070
on the red carpet.

649
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,240
I wasn't laughing at you.

650
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,150
I just thought

651
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,480
your dress

652
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,920
doesn't look like a fairy's dress.

653
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,790
But with your great figure,

654
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,040
a slight change

655
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,960
of the dress

656
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,520
and the right makeup

657
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,550
will definitely make you look better.

658
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:58,960
Trust me.

659
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,240
How do you want to change it?

660
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,590
Let me show you.

661
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,550
Do you like it?

662
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,240
It's okay.

663
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,760
But

664
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,960
can you get it done well?

665
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,390
No problem.

666
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,280
Let's get started.

667
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,480
Hurry up.

668
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,870
Okay.

669
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,280
It's beautiful.

670
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,440
Thank you.

671
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,960
You're welcome.

672
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,480
I wasn't very nice before.

673
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,350
Please don't mind.

674
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,150
It's okay.

675
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,310
She's quite capable.

676
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,440
No wonder you're going to great lengths

677
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,240
to find opportunities for her.

678
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,390
Take some pictures of me.

679
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,630
Did she also always act on her own

680
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,150
when she was working for you?

681
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,920
That's her temperament.

682
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,310
Then she's not suitable

683
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,000
to be a makeup artist
on the assembly line

684
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,520
or anyone's assistant.

685
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,920
You should recommend her

686
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,000
to Ms. Fan.

687
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,280
Galaxy might need

688
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,790
a styling talent.

689
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,070
Amy.

690
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,070
Look who's here.

691
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,790
The Annual Makeup Artist
of Galaxy, Ningchuan.

692
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,830
Amy.

693
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,040
Don't make fun of me.

694
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,960
I'm not making fun of you.

695
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,720
You're a role model to us.

696
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,440
Do I look good?

697
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,070
Yeah.

698
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,240
Aren't you supposed to be
on the second floor?

699
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
What brings you here?

700
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,280
I'm here to take a look.

701
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,150
Go ahead.

702
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,720
Mr. Jiang.

703
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,520
Long time no see.

704
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,110
Men care about their pride.

705
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,720
His assistant is doing so well.

706
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,870
He doesn't feel good about it.

707
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,070
Don't mind it.

708
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,550
I'll go to post the pictures on Weibo.

709
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,110
Okay.

710
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,630
I heard

711
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,150
there's a new makeup artist here

712
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,520
with some ideas.

713
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,870
I'd like to meet her.

714
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,630
Hello.

715
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,350
Hello.

716
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,000
You must be Mr. Jiang's assistant,

717
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,920
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

718
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,390
He has mentioned you

719
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,960
in front of others more than once,

720
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,110
praising your talent.

721
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,720
Even after he resigned from Zhuangmeng,

722
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,360
he kept looking for
job opportunities for you.

723
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,440
He's really good to you.

724
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,190
Let me introduce myself.

725
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,150
I'm Yue Ningchuan,

726
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,040
the Director of the Styling Department
at Galaxy Magazine.

727
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,270
I'd like to invite you

728
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,440
to join my styling team.

729
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,400
Does Galaxy

730
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,590
want to hire me?

731
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,630
This is a rare opportunity.

732
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,880
Aren't you interested?

733
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,960
She's not only the editor-in-chief

734
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,230
of Galaxy Magazine

735
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,550
but also the owner

736
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,110
of Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy,

737
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,320
Fan Xiaoxiao

738
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,960
Thank you for your kindness.

739
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,670
I will consider it carefully.

740
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,110
Usually, newcomers

741
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,550
would immediately accept

742
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,400
such an offer.

743
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,040
You seem to have

744
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,960
a high opinion of yourself.

745
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,520
No.

746
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,960
I'm just afraid I don't deserve

747
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,150
such an offer.

748
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
I'll wait for your reply.

749
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,320
Okay.

750
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Amy.

751
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,800
I'm leaving.

752
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,400
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

753
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,520
Come here.

754
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,230
What's wrong?

755
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,070
Amy said

756
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,190
you can go to her studio.

757
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,040
Give her

758
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,270
your contact information later.

759
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,750
By the way,

760
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,630
Galaxy

761
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,800
is not suitable for you.

762
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,320
Even if you want to work at
a fashion magazine,

763
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,230
try not to choose this one.

764
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,670
I don't owe you anything now.

765
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,070
You're

766
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,590
on your own.

767
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,070
(Isn't Jiang Bo)

768
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,880
(related to Fan Xiaoxiao?)

769
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,520
(Why doesn't he want me)

770
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,710
(to go to Galaxy?)

771
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,110
Jiang Xiaoyuan

772
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,000
didn't fall for it.

773
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,440
Therefore,

774
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
you have to find another way.

775
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,270
How about...

776
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,310
[Kelinoulai Gala]
Our guests today

777
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,080
all come with starlight.

778
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,480
Thanks to

779
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,080
the organizer of this fashion gala,

780
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,400
Galaxy Magazine.

781
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,040
And we should give a warm thanks

782
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,000
to the editor-in-chief,

783
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,710
Ms. Fan Xiaoxiao,

784
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,080
who has practically brought here

785
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,880
the entire pyramid
of the fashion industry.

786
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,840
Including designers

787
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
the Trini couple,

788
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,520
Please look this way.

789
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,840
The Chinese-style craftsman, Mr. Mu.

790
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,230
Yes.

791
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,840
Look at the camera.

792
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,520
All of them came

793
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,080
because they received
an invitation from Ms. Fan,

794
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,630
making

795
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,960
their red carpet debuts.

796
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,920
Come on, let's take pictures.

797
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,590
Yeah.

798
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,400
All right.

799
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,710
Okay.

800
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,750
Qi Lian, you're also here.

801
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,150
Where's Xiaoyuan?

802
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,750
She's busy inside.

803
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,440
I'll go find her.

804
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,920
A new actress with a dance background

805
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,670
and excellent acting skills,

806
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,630
Xie Yi.

807
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,440
Yes, that's right.

808
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,360
Yeah.

809
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,080
Qi Lian.

810
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,190
You look beautiful.

811
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,190
How is the thing

812
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,840
that I asked you to look into?

813
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,310
I've done an initial screening

814
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,630
of Fan Xiaoxiao's

815
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,360
real estate records.

816
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,270
There are approximately three places

817
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,520
suitable for setting up the laboratory

818
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
you mentioned.

819
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,560
Thank you.

820
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,190
No problem.

821
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,750
Her look today

822
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,590
is from the Flying Apsaras in Dunhuang.

823
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,480
Dance in the sky

824
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,920
gracefully and elegantly,

825
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,000
like a flying dragon.

826
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,880
Is there something wrong
with her makeup?

827
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,080
Really?

828
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,000
It's the same here.

829
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,150
Why does it feel like

830
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,310
there's a layer of powder on her face?

831
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,440
What's wrong with you?

832
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,310
Did she use

833
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,040
loose powder containing mica?

834
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
This type of loose powder

835
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,750
will look separated under the flash,

836
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,040
especially noticeable in photos.

837
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,710
Why did you use it if you know that?

838
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,710
I definitely wouldn't use

839
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,840
this kind of loose powder.

840
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,670
This is that kind of loose powder.

841
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,880
It's not ours.

842
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,960
If it's not yours,

843
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,840
why would it be here?

844
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,190
Got it.

845
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,440
Prepare yourself.

846
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,400
The actress saw the feedback online

847
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,440
and wants to hold
the makeup artist accountable.
