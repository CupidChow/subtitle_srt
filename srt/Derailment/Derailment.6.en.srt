[Episode 6]

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,350
It's me.

5
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,800
Well,

6
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,320
I have good news for you.

7
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,190
I passed the assessment.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Pretty impressive, huh?

9
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,800
I'm such a genius.

10
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,440
Congratulations.

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
Are you done with work?

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,390
I'm at your door.

13
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,120
(Did you come to me?)

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,000
No.

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,550
I was just passing by.

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,840
When are you free?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
It's only right and proper

18
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,710
for me to treat you to a meal

19
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,560
to thank you.

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,520
Not today.

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm on a business trip out of town.

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,670
If you don't want to come, just say so.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Don't make such an excuse.

24
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,390
I'm really on a business trip.

25
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,030
We can eat together

26
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,880
when I get back tomorrow night.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,960
All right.

28
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,750
See you tomorrow night.

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
(Dear passengers,)

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,950
(the train is about to arrive
at Baiyang County station.)

31
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,680
(Passengers)

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
(for Baiyang County station,)

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
(please take your luggage)

34
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,280
(and prepare to get off.)

[Baiyang County]

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,710
Mrs. Jiang.

37
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,280
Long time no see.

38
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,430
Lian?

39
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,000
It's me.

40
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,840
I haven't seen you

41
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,800
for a long time.

42
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,750
I can hardly recognize you.

43
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,590
Lian.

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,680
Let me get you some water.

45
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Mrs. Jiang, please sit down.

46
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,910
No need.

47
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,590
Please sit down.

48
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,080
Sit down.

49
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,430
Well...

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Lian.

51
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,310
Do you know where Xiaoyuan is?

52
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
It's been a year,

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
and I haven't heard from her.

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
I can't reach her on the phone.

55
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,190
Someone said

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,030
she's also in trouble.

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,240
Don't worry.

58
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,870
Just tell me.

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,870
Mrs. Jiang.

60
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,800
Xiaoyuan is fine.

61
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,360
I saw her a few days ago.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
That's good.

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,470
Is she in

64
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,280
some kind of trouble?

65
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
It's been so long.

66
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,630
Why hasn't she come back to see me?

67
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,030
When was

68
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,800
the last time

69
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,870
Xiaoyuan came to see you?

70
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,590
Almost a year ago.

71
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,680
At that time,

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,030
I was seriously ill,

73
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,680
almost at death's door.

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
She came back

75
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,920
without telling anyone

76
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,390
and left me 100,000 yuan.

77
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,870
When Xiaoyuan got into college,

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
I was seriously ill,

79
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,310
undergoing surgery and hospitalization.

80
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,240
Money was running out like water.

81
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,680
She suffered a lot during that time.

82
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,870
(She insisted on leaving home
to earn money)

83
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,630
(to pay for my treatment.)

84
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,480
(She was out there)

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,830
(without a college degree.)

86
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,680
(What kind of job could she get?)

87
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,870
(The jobs she found)

88
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,070
(were all about physical work.)

89
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,870
(She was stubborn)

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,430
(and wouldn't listen to me.)

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,310
Why did you come so late?

92
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,070
It's on me today.

93
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,040
What's the matter?

94
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,360
I got a month's pay.

95
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,510
If I remember correctly,

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
you only make 2,000 yuan

97
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,390
a month.

98
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,630
2,000 yuan is enough

99
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
to treat you to dinner.

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Besides, I've been promoted
to intern stylist.

101
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,720
Next month,

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,830
I'll receive the performance bonus.

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
I treat you to dinner

104
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,390
mainly to express

105
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,510
my sincere gratitude.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,600
According to tradition,

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,070
let me drink three toasts to you.

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
Thank you for generously imparting
your knowledge to me.

109
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,390
If you hadn't taught me well,

110
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,310
I wouldn't have

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,600
passed the assessment so smoothly.

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,870
I remember you didn't drink before.

113
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't, but I do now.

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,630
And sometimes,

115
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,920
work requires it.

116
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,920
(She's a girl.)

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
(What good job can she find)

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
(that pays 100,000 in one go?)

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,680
(The last time she came back,)

120
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,240
she seemed different.

121
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,390
She picked up

122
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,070
smoking and drinking.

123
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,630
People in the village even said

124
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,830
that she's gone astray.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,630
Well,

126
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,630
this kid

127
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,920
dropped out of school

128
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,920
just for

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,630
my lowly life.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
(If I had known,)

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
(I would have died.)

132
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,000
The second toast.

133
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,830
Drinking too much is bad for your health.

134
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,160
I appreciate it.

135
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,950
You don't have to

136
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,800
be so formal with me.

137
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,240
By the way,

138
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,720
here's the 713 yuan I owe you.

139
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,360
Take it.

140
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
I said I'd drink three toasts to you.

141
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,000
I never

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,120
take advantage of others,

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,120
and I always

144
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,830
keep my promises.

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,720
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

146
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,270
Let's talk.

147
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,830
There's nothing to talk about.

148
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,950
Do you want to bring up the past again?

149
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,040
I just want to treat you to dinner.

150
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,800
Besides, everyone has secrets.

151
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,040
I won't pry into yours,

152
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,070
and you shouldn't pry into mine.

153
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,830
Can't we do that?

154
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,720
I'm not obligated to tell you everything

155
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,270
about my life, am I?

156
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,560
That's right.

157
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,600
You're not obligated to do that.

158
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,480
What about the past?

159
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,560
Don't you have any questions

160
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,310
to ask me?

161
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
(Was there any conflict)

162
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
(or emotional entanglement)

163
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,190
(between the previous Jiang Xiaoyuan
and him?)

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,920
No.

165
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
But I've been waiting for you to ask me

166
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,630
why I didn't show up

167
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
six years ago,

168
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,040
why I left

169
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,160
without saying goodbye,

170
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
why I never came back
to Baiyang County,

171
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,270
and why I knew

172
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,240
you needed help

173
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,270
but still were gone for four years.

174
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,000
Even when I came back,

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
I didn't

176
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,910
come to you immediately.

177
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,030
(The thing is I don't know)

178
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,360
(what happened.)

179
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,840
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

180
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
you said you always keep your promises,

181
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,600
and I believe I do too.

182
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,480
But I've gone back on my word.

183
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,600
Don't you want to

184
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,320
ask me why?

185
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Let's not talk about it.

186
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
Let's eat.

187
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

188
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,360
If you blame me

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
for not keeping my promise,

190
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,910
you can hit me or scold me.

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You can take it out on me as you want.

192

00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,000
Okay.

384
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,440
(That's right.)

385
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,030
(I can develop)

386
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,030
(my speciality)

387
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,750
(and attract my own regular customers.)

388
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,350
Why are you dragging me here

389
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,590
instead of welcoming customers?

390
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,440
I've figured it out.

391
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,110
It's no use for us to wait around.

392
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,000
Think about it.

393
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,200
The better the performance,

394
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,790
the better the position,

395
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,880
and the more

396
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,480
customers.

397
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,920
It's unfair to newcomers

398
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,550
like us.

399
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,270
We don't have enough customers,

400
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,440
and it's hard for us to get promoted.

401
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,590
But you can't

402
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,750
just stay negative.

403
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,070
I'm not being negative.

404
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,030
I want to break the rules.

405
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,440
We're no worse

406
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,350
than anyone else, right?

407
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,880
We need to find a way
to let the customers know that.

408
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,240
How to do it?

409
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,270
I've figured it out.

410
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,720
Let me tell you.

411
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,310
I think

412
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,640
we can...

413
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,480
Then...

414
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,160
What do you think?

415
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,110
Hello, miss.

416
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,240
Here's some fruit for you.

417
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
Do you serve fruit here?

418
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,350
Yes, we do.

419
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,440
Hello.

420
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,750
Here's some fruit for you.

421
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,880
Do you serve fruit here?

422
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,830
Of course.

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,160
If you're satisfied

424
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,030
with our service,

425
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,000
could you please

426
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,270
leave a good review online?

427
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,960
If you could mention

428
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,310
the names of the new stylists,

429
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,400
we would be even more grateful.

430
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,440
My name is Jiang Xiaoyuan.

431
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,350
You can also call me No. 27.

432
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,640
Okay.

433
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,070
Thank you.

434
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:24,830
Hello.

435
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
[A good review for No. 27]
I'm the new stylist, No. 27.

436
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,310
[A good review for No. 27]
My name is Jiang Xiaoyuan.

437
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,480
[A good review for No. 27]
I hope you can remember me.

438
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,790
Thank you.

439
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,240
It feels good.

440
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,590
What's your number?

441
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm No. 27.

442
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,240
[A good review for No. 27]
My name is Jiang Xiaoyuan.

443
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,790
[A good review for No. 27]
I hope you can remember me.

444
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,750
Inside, please.

445
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,680
Welcome.

446
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm looking for Number 23.

447
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:48,960
It's me.

448
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,640
Let's go.

449
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,310
This way, please.

450
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,350
Ms. Ling.

451
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,590
Look at this review.

452
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,270
"I'm a regular customer of this salon

453
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,350
and have been satisfied

454
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,160
with the service.

455
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,790
There is

456
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,590
a smart girl today

457
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,790
with excellent massage skills

458
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
and acupressure techniques.

459
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,880
I recommend her
to those who work overtime

460
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,550
and need hair washing.

461
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,590
Be sure to go to

462
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
No. 27."

463
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
There's another one.

464
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,030
"I took the advice
and went to No. 27.

465
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,880
She's really good."

466
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,070
That's why the customers

467
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,070
all looked for them today.

468
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
These two little girls

469
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,070
are quite scheming.

470
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,880
Yeah.

471
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,640
No wonder.

472
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,070
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

473
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:25,680
Mr. Wang.

474
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,200
Inside, please.

475
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,510
Ling.

476
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,920
I want No. 27

477
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,270
to serve me today.

478
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,640
No. 27 is not here.

479
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,920
Let me wash your hair.

480
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,030
She's not here.

481
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm here.

482
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm here.

483
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:38,960
Hello.

484
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm No. 27, Jiang Xiaoyuan.

485
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,510
Come with me.
Do you want to wash your hair?

486
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,510
I heard your massage skills are good.

487
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,240
I'd like to have a try.

488
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,720
All right.

489
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,920
You can't imagine

490
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,550
the look on her face today.

491
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,070
It was satisfying.

492
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,440
You know what,

493
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,960
in our salon,

494
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,270
I used to stand there alone

495
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,160
with all of them ahead of me.

496
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,270
Every time a customer came in,

497
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,070
they wouldn't choose me.

498
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,960
I just stood there

499
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,510
by myself.

500
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,200
But it's different now.

501
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,070
Now there are

502
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,550
still many people ahead of me,

503
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,510
and I'm still standing there.

504
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,920
But every customer who comes in says,

505
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,030
"Number 27."

506
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,590
It felt great,

507
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,510
you know.

508
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,310
Why are you looking at me?

509
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,350
Just eat.

510
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,270
Cheers.

511
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,510
Let me see who dares
to look down on me now.

512
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,680
Well done.

513
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,000
In less than a week,

514
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,590
you've ranked third in performance,

515
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,590
and we even have

516
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,830
more customers now.

517
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,070
I heard that many people

518
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,440
came for your scalp massage.

519
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,270
It's so-so.

520
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
But this scalp massage

521
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,590
is indeed highly praised.

522
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,070
Boss.

523
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,350
Would you consider

524
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,720
adding a new service

525
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,110
and giving me a raise?

526
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,830
You wish.

527
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,070
Look,

528
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm going to the head office
in Chongqing

529
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,110
for a meeting in the next few days.

530
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
While I'm away,

531
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,350
take care of yourself

532
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,240
and don't get into

533
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,240
any unnecessary trouble.

534
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,030
Don't you and Qi Lian own this salon?

535
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,440
Why is there a head office?

536
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
This is a chain franchise store.

537
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,640
We have to listen to the head office
for important matters.

538
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll leave the salon

539
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
to Helen for now.

540
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
Don't mess with her.

541
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,790
Be smart.

542
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,400
Be smart.

543
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,920
Smart.

544
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,070
Okay.

545
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,350
And,

546
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,350
before I go,

547
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,790
let me share a piece
of insider information with you.

548
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,110
Next month,

549
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
we'll have two vacancies

550
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,270
for junior stylists.

551
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,640
If you rank first

552
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
in performance this month,

553
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,110
you know what it means.

554
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,310
What's a junior stylist?

555
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,000
It's food

556
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,270
that you eat.

557
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,240
Let me give you a lesson.

558
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,510
Junior stylists

559
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,750
will not only get a raise

560
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,110
but also learn hairdressing.

561
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
They can have people with a lower rank

562
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,720
assist them.

563
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,960
Most importantly,

564
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,590
working your way up

565
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,110
in just one month

566
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,240
through your own efforts

567
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,790
sounds quite an accomplishment.

568
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,270
Who would dare to bully you again?

569
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,680
That's right.

570
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,240
Okay. I'll do it.

571
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,550
Go for it.

572
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,110

765
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,070
Aren't we friends?

766
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,510
I know

767
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,840
you'll pay me back

768
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,440
once you get your salary.

769

[Fashion Hairdressing Salon]

770
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,680
Do you know

771
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,560
that a serious peanut allergy

772
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,350
can lead to shock?

773
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,390
I don't know anything.

774
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,680
Don't slander me.

775
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Am I slandering you?

776
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,710
Don't grab me.

777
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,600
I'm grabbing you.

778
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,040
(The hair-washing attendant, Ling,)

779
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,830
(who knew the customer)

780
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,560
(is allergic to peanuts)

781
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,160
(still prepared a snack
containing peanuts)

782
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,710
(for the customer.)

783
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,600
(The she had)

784
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,910
(her coworker who didn't know this)

785
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,120
(deliver the snack to the customer.)

786
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,040
(Fortunately, the customer
discovered it in time,)

787
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,000
(preventing)

788
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
(potentially severe consequences.)

789
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,830
(Hair-washing attendant like Ling...)

790
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,480
Good morning.

791
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,960
What are you looking at?

792
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,000
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

793
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,270
Don't think I don't know it.

794
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,710
Did you make this video?

795
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,310
Are you trying to get me fired?

796
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,390
What video?

797
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,430
What video?

798
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,390
- Drop the act.
- What are you doing?

799
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,350
Is there an end?

800
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,480
What are you doing?

801
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,480
Do you want to rebel?

802
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,480
Don't you have to work anymore?

803
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,000
Get out of here.

804
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,680
Listen,

805
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,680
from now on, you're suspended.

806
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,040
You don't need to come to work

807
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,910
until the manager comes back.

808
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,120
Hello.

809
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,640
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

810
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,390
Did you post

811
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,430
the video online?

812
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,600
Would I post that kind of video?

813
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,480
Ling made a mistake,

814
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,040
and I'll punish her when I get back.

815
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,910
But now,

816
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
you've turned it into a big deal,

817
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,480
which will not only damage
our reputation

818
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,310
but also

819
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:07,960
alarm the head office.

820
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,430
I won't be able to fix it by then.

821
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,830
I said

822
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,430
I didn't post that video.

823
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,040
Ling is the one who made the mistake.

824
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,200
Now everyone is siding with her,

825
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,710
making me the only villain,

826
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,430
right?

827
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,080
Mr. Chen.

828
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,080
I want to stay

829
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,310
and work in your salon,

830
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,710
but if you wrong me

831
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,750
like this,

832
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,520
I should just quit.
