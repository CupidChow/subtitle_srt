[Episode 28]

4
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,030
Qi Lian?

5
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,240
Why are you doing here?

6
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,070
I heard the studio is finished.

7
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,200
So I drop by.

8
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,670
That's annoying.

9
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,560
I thought to give you

10
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,350
a surprise.

11
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,240
Let me show you around.

12
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:21,960
Look,

13
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,110
it's almost finished.

14
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,070
I figure we won't have

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,920
many early clients,

16
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,160
so I just got

17
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,110
two makeup tables

18
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
for both of us.

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,560
Here is the meeting room.

20
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,200
And over there is the waiting area.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Overall,

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
it's quite spacious.

23
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,560
We also have a coffee machine

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,030
and such.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,030
This is your room.

26
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,360
You can move here soon.

27
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,600
Not bad.

28
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,470
Whether bad or not,

29
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,720
our studio is all set up,

30
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,640
and you'll be starting work tomorrow.

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,960
What kind of work?

32
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,880
Do makeup and styling for the clients.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
Tomorrow at 1 p.m.,

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,310
Miss Sun has an appointment.

35
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,360
She'll be attending a cultural salon.

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,240
So think about

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,190
some specific ideas for her look.

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
At 4 p.m., you'll meet Ms. Tang.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,670
She'll be attending an evening event.

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,600
So make sure

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,550
to leave her satisfied.

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,880
Take your time and think about it.

43
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,720
Why don't you

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,670
do these by yourself?

45
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,310
Remember,

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,520
you get a commission.

47
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,750
Come on,

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,720
I have a date with Rui

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,830
all day long tomorrow.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,270
I'll be busy tomorrow.

51
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,600
Anyway, we'll be quite busy

52
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,550
in these days.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,310
Where did you get these orders?

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,670
Oh, I almost forget.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,600
I recorded

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,640
a bunch of beauty tutorials.

57
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,190
I also made a video

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,160
for the salon.

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
It's gone viral.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,550
I shot a video recently,

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,470
and it's gaining traction.

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,360
So, we'll have

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,830
quite a few customers.

64
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,160
It's going to keep us busy for a while.

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,960
You take some time to think about it.

66
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,160
And please go on the tour.

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,390
I think he's freaked out

68
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,390
because of

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,320
my high efficiency.

70
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,040
He won't be depressed for long.

71
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:54,960
Once he gets back into

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
his comfort zone,

73
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,590
his confidence

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,320
sill be back soon.

75
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,960
It feels like

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,670
your roles

77
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,430
have been switched.

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,360
Now, you seem more like the boss.

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
Perhaps circumstances

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,270
pushed me to grow.

81
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
After all, someone needs to

82
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,830
handle these matters.

83
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,360
When I have time later on,

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,830
I want to keep learning and prepare

85
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,480
for the advanced certificate.

86
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,990
How about the competition?

87
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,670
You just let it go?

88
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,870
Some things can't be rushed.

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,990
Perhaps it's just not the right time.

90
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,990
I'll leave it to time.

91
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
You just drive.

92
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
I want to have a word with you.

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,550
Did you know

94
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,040
a person named Niki?

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,960
She's among the top ten

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
beauty influencers on the Forbes list.

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,110
In 2008,

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,910
she started to gain fame.

99
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
And now,

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,790
she's a top global influencer.

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,640
Many people like

102
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,320
her videos.

103
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,390
In 11 years,

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,520
she's shown everyone

105
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,910
her remarkable career growth.

106
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,150
Her current business value

107
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
and skills

108
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,230
have surpassed many peers

109
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,150
in the makeup industry.

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
What's your point?

111
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,640
The eligibility for

112
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,640
the National Makeup Artist Competition

113
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,710
shouldn't be limited to
professional certificates

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,560
and internal invitations.

115
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,960
Many international

116
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,440
beauty competitions

117
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,520
now open up

118
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,830
to beauty influencers.

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,960
Once domestic short video platforms

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,640
take off,

121
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,680
these influencers

122
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
will have significant influence

123
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,350
and commercial value,

124
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,000
which is also very beneficial for

125
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,640
the entire makeup industry.

126
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,120
You want me to talk to the organizers

127
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,710
about allowing beauty influencers

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,470
to participate in the competition?

129
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,880
This might be

130
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,830
her only opportunity

131
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,910
to join the competition.

132
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,470
Moreover, this group

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,710
brings its own buzz and followers.

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,710
For the organizers, it's kind like

135
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,080
a free promotion.

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,710
Oh, here.

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,200
This is

138
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,350
my research report

139
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,440
on the beauty influencer industry.

140
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,880
You may use it

141
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,080
when you talk to them.

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,120
I looked into

143
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,640
the organizers list.

144
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,710
Qi Group

145
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,710
is one of them.

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,150
I might let you down.

147
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,230
I can't get in with

148
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,230
the Qi Group.

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,000
Why not?

150
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,270
Aren't you Qi Maoqing's son?

151
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,790
You are the son of Fan Xiaoxiao,

152
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,120
but you can't get in with

153
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,000
the Galaxy Magazine, either.

154
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,470
Never mind.

155
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,710
Don't be so harsh.

156
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,200
Pull over up ahead.

157
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,680
It's a pity I got up so early
this morning.

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,150
What?

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,080
Where are you going?

160
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,200
I can't get in with the Qi,

161
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,000
but I found out that

162
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,910
its media partner are planning

163
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,520
to turn it into a variety show.

164
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,880
They might be interested in

165
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
your proposal.

166
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,200
Thank you, Rui.

167
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,000
Launching a studio

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
is tough at the beginning.

169
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,000
Thanks for introducing customers to me.

170
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,230
Don't mention it.

171
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,680
Xiaoyuan,

172
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,440
you seem a bit different

173
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,350
from before.

174
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,760
What is it?

175
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,230
I used to want to help you.

176
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
And it wasn't just me,

177
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,120
other classmates felt the same way.

178
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,350
But you keep turning down

179
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,640
everyone's kindness,

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
insisting on doing everything

181
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,710
by yourself.

182
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
Your pride can be quite annoying.

183
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Really?

184
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,960
I don't remember that.

185
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,590
A strong sense of pride often conceals

186
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,440
underlying inferior.

187
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,960
The fear of being judged

188
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,560
leads to a need for toughness
and exclusivity.

189
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,790
Meeting you this time,

190
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,470
you seem more confident than before.

191
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,910
Even though money is tight,

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,350
there's a newfound sense of

193
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,680
poise and fearlessness about you.

194
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,520
That's great.

195
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,200
Perhaps it's due to

196
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,080
my experience.

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,120

198

206
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,150

207
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,790
Yes.

208
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,390

209
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,680

210
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,350

227

231

Miss Jiang,

232
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,630
I don't have to introduce myself.

233
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,590
Qi Lian came to me the other day.

234
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,200
He wants an invitation to

235
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,630
the National Makeup Artist Competition

236
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,400
for you.

237
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,470
But I didn't agree.

238
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,590

to a competition

240
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,750
goes against fairness.

241
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,160
Miss Jiang,

242
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,960
you are pretty good at this.

243
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,990
I've talked to you so many times,

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
you can still act like nothing happened.

245
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,110
Didn't your parents

246
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,920
ever teach you

247
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
to value and respect yourself,

248
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
and keep your word?

249
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,230
Mr. Qi,

250
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,200
you can share your concerns

251
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,920
with me directly.

252
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,800
Please don't involve my parents.

253
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,800
Alright,

254
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,080
listen up.

255
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,440
When you were in high school,

256
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,630
Qi Lian got into trouble

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,590
with those punks because of you.

258
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,350
His friends got involved.

259
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,830
A kid even

260
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,510
lost his life.

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,870
So don't play dumb with me.

262
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,960
You haven't touched your food.

263
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,920
Look at you now.

264
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,630
The police just called.

265
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,280
Those punks were arrested.

266
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,990
Later, you'll go to

267
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,750

268
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,560

269
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,560
I can't believe that

270
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,750
you'd even be friends with those people.

271
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,230
All for them,

272
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,750
you lost your chance
at the college entrance exam.

273
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,400
Seriously, do you think

274
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,110
it's worth it?

275
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,920
Take your time to reflect on

276
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
what you've done.

277
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,040
Eat your food.

278
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,400

to the police station.

how did you learn to
chase after wealth and status?

Really?

309
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,040

310

You'd better leave him now.

Qi Lian is sentimental.

325
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,600
Back then, he had nightmare every night.

326
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,910
He lost the chance of taking
the college entrance exam.

327

525
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,160

535
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,160
Why not take a few days off

536
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,510
and get some rest?

537
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,440

cook you a simple dinner.

I love your

556
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,510
curry and rice the most?

557
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,310
Why is it?

558
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,440
Because I was starving then.

559
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,550
And,

560
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,880
you brought me

561
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,270
this huge pot of curry rice.

562
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,400
Then I was so full.

563
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,480
So you ate

564
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,750
the food I made

565
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,240
and almost took me

566
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,550
for a serial killer.

567
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,510
How can you blame me?

568
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,480

569
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
those photos at home?

570
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,960
Speaking of this,

571
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,830
I started cooking

572
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,110
because of Xu Jingyang.

573
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,750
When he was in the hospital,

574
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,960
I went there every day
to bring him food.

575
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,640
At that time,

576
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,590
I felt really bad

577
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,310
for causing his leg injury.

578
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,510
For now,

579
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,790
it all happened

580
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,590
in my dreams.

581
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
The supplier must be there.

582
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,590
You go ahead and eat.

583
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,030
And get some rest.

584
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,790
But you didn't finished your meal yet.

585
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,960
Too late.

586
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,240
Hold on.

587
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,960
It's cold outside.

588
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,310
Here, take a coat.

589
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,680
Come home early.

590
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,590
OK.

591
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,960
Have your dinner.

592
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,830
Bye.

593
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,400
[Fashion Hairdressing Salon]

594
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

595
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,680
I miss you so much!

596
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,030
We miss you!

597
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,030
You look so great!

598
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,000
How are you doing?

599
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,880
Pretty well.

600
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,520
Look at me.

601
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,310
I'm a junior stylist now.

602
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,880
Great!

603
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,310
I'm a little chubby now.

604
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,240
Yes, you are.

605
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Me, too.

606
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
Yeah, I can see that.

607
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,640
We all watched your video

608
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
of that makeup competition.

609
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,310
We vote for you every day.

610
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,350
All of us!

611
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,200
Thank you!

612
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,400
You must make it to the finals.

613
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,110
I'll do my best.

614
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,830
Do we need to call you...

615
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,440
Boss Jiang?

616
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,720
- Boss Jiang!
- Boss Jiang!

617
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,240
The majority of our shares

618
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,550
are held by my mentor.

619
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,030
I'm one of the partners,

620
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,920
you know?

621
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,640
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

622
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,590
Hi, boss.

623
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,070
Why don't you tell me

624
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,070
you'd be here?

625
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,440
I wanted to give you a surprise.

626
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,110
Let's go.

627
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,920
Let's go chat in my office for a bit.

628
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,880
You can catch up later.

629
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,480
Hey, don't go.

630
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,390
Are you taking her away now?

631
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,150
Xiaoyuan looks so pretty now.

632
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Much prettier than before.

633
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,870
You come

634
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
without a heads-up,

635
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,960
so unexpected!

636
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,040
Come here. Have a seat.

637
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,350
OK.

638
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,200
I'll get you some water.

639
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,480
You're really something!

640
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,070
Aren't you getting married soon?

641
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,200
Why are you still working?

642
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,150
We work in the service industry.

643
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,310
When customers need us,

644
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,310
we have to be here.

645
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,310
Here, have some water.

646
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,150
Oh, it's warm.

647
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,150
By the way,

648
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,150
how have you been recently?

649
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,390
I'm good.

650
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,070
Oh,

651
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,480
did you have your lunch?

652
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,240
I'll get you some food.

653
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,200
No, Fangzhou.

654
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm not hungry.

655
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,110
Just sit here.

656
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,920
Fangzhou.

657
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,680
I just want to know

658
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,720
what did Qi Lian go through

659
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,960
before he graduated?

660
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,720
Did someone

661
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
talk to you?

662
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,310
Qi Lian's father talked to me.

663
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,920
I see.

664
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,680
Qi Lian has had a strained relationship

665
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,790
with his father for many years.

666
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,550
Do you know that?

667
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,310
I can tell a bit.

668
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,960
He never brings up his father to me,

669
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,280
so I've never asked.

670
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,280
His father has an illegitimate child.

671
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,110
When we were in junior high school,

672
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,070
he came and caused a scene.

673
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,870
Then his parents went through
for divorce,

674
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,480
and neither wanted custody of him.

675
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,110
They both got busy with their own jobs,

676
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,440
leaving Qi Lian in the countryside

677
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,280
with no one

678
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,240
keeping an eye on him.

679
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,630
And then,

680
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,920
after Yang's incident,

681
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,240
Mr. Qi realized that

682
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,590
Qi Lian also needed care.

683
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,110
No wonder he doesn't like going home.

684
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,040
He once told me

685
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,070
that there's no one

686
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,390
waiting for him at home.

687
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,520
You don't need to
take his father seriously.

688
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,720
At least, Qi Lian

689
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,150
met you

690
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,000
at his lowest times.

691
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,590
So he didn't lose

692
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,390
confidence in life.

693
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,870
I still remember

694
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,520
that he persuaded us

695
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,630
to study with him.

696
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,630
He wanted to go to

697
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,960
the same college as you.

698
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,280
Really?

699
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,550
But why he didn't?

700
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,960
Did I have something to do

701
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,550
with Yang?

702
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,310
He got into a fight with others

703
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,200
trying to protect Yang and me.

704
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,200
As a consequence,

705
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
he lost his chance
at the college entrance exam.

706
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,550
That yellow-haired guy, who behind this,

707
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,550
got into a conflict with him

708
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
because of you.

709
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,240
Honestly, it's our fault.

710
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,000
We were just teenagers.

711
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
When things heated up,

712
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,870
fists started flying.

713
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,520
Yang fell down the stairs.

714
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,440
When he was sent to the hospital...

715
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,830
It was too late.

716
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,870
Qi Lian insisted that

717
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,040
we shouldn't tell you about this.

718
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't even know

719
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,000
about such a big incident.

720
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,520
How did Qi Lian hold up?

721
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,350
I bet he must

722
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,550
feel guilty.

723
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,680
Later, he spent a good while

724
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,790
for psychological therapy.

725
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,630
He said that every time
he closed his eyes,

726
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,870
he could see Yang's face.

727
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,870
I really hoped you could

728
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,790
spend more time with him,

729
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,150
and help him get through the shadows.

730
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,070
But somehow,

731
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,390
after you went to Chongqing,

732
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,520
you never returned.

733
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,150
You even changed your phone number,

734
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,110
and you didn't connect anymore.

735
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,520
Thank you.

736
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,830
Chen Fangzhou

737
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,520
told me that

738
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,040
you were crying in his office.

739
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,440
What did you talk about?

740
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,870
I'm not telling you.

741
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,280
But I know what it is.

742
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
My father reach you not, huh?

743
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,480
What did he say?

744
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,390
Make you leave me?

745
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
Not this one.

746
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,000
Since you know everything,

747
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,550
don't you hate me?

748
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,550
Why do I hate you?

749
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,390
For hurting Yang?

750
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,960
That's our fault.

751
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,350
If we had been a bit more mature

752
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,240
back then,

753
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,550
the tragedy wouldn't happen.

754
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,720
Your father also told me

755
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,070
that I left you after I took

756
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,390
some money from him.

757
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,280
The kid named Yang

758
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,790
lost his life

759
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,000
all because of

760
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,870
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

761
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,630
That's nonsense.

762
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,070
Nonsense?

763
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
Then why didn't you pick up her phone?

764
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,040
Do you dare to tell her

765
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,520
what's happening with you now?

766
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Did you tell her?

767
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:20,960
What nonsense

768
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,040
did you tell her?

769
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,720
Stop!

770
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,240
I didn't tell her anything.

771
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,390
She had something to tell you.

772
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,590
She said she got into

773
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,870
her dream school

774
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,280
and doesn't want to see you anymore.

775
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,110
That's not possible!

776
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,000
Not possible?

777
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,070
She even asked me for money.

778
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,760
to help her Grandma.

779
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,720
Can you even

780
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,000
call her now?

781
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,000
This is the note she wrote.

782
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,710
Take a look

783
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,190
and see if it's possible.

784
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,960
This is madness!

785
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,440
[Guarantee]
(I, Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

786
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,360
(borrowed Qi Maoqing)

787
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
(two thousand yuan in cash.)

788
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,630
(I promise to sever ties with Qi Lian.)

789
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,920
(We're done.)

790
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,040
(I was so mad then.)

791
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,190
(I thought you were too cruel.)

792
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,190
(But as I grew older,)

793
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
(I figured out.)

794
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,670
You just wanted to save Grandma.

795
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,670
There was no other choice for you.

796
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,840
I guess my father

797
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,110
said some bad things.

798
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,800
Did that hurt you?

799
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,590
I should have talked to you

800
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,070
about it.

801
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,550
I wasn't there for you when you were

802
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,150
going through a tough time.

803
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,040
And if we hadn't met

804
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,920
in Luoshan,

805
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,070
if we hadn't reunited,

806
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,960
I would have never known

807
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
about everything

808
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,150
you went through before.

809
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,190
I would just felt

810
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,520
you were heartless and cold,

811
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,190
leaving me

812
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,110
without a single word.

813
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,230
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

814
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,670
you said that the original

815
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,520
Jiang Xiaoyuan is dead.

816
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,520
Now you're a completely new person.

817
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,190
You don't have to feel bad

818
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,550
because of her and me.

819
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,550
I know,

820
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,960
but...

821
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,000
OK. Forget it.

822
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,520
Despite a few twists,

823
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,110
aren't we happily

824
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,520
together now?

825
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,960
I do think

826
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,110
we should cherish the present.

827
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,000
It's all in the past,

828
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,960
so forget it.

829
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,630
Let's go.

830
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,230
What?

831
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,750

Do I look sharp?

846
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,590
Your bow tie is crooked.

847
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,550
You do look sharp.

848
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,400

looks nice.

What's the name of this red flower?

853
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,710

to work.

863
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,750
So what's the meaning

864
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,480
of hibiscus flowers?

865
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,440
Gentle persistence,

866
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,840
and eternal beauty.

867
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,590
I remember hibiscus flowers
bloom in the morning

868
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,400
and wither by evening.

869
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
Why do they mean eternal beauty?

870
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,360
Because when one hibiscus flower

871
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,400
blooms and fades,

872
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,880
it continues to

873
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,710
give rise to many more.

874
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,920
Even though it blooms and
fades in a day,

875
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,070
the hibiscus keeps coming back,

876
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,150
like it never stops.

877
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,320
That's why it means

878
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,710
eternal beauty.

879
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,070
You are like them.

880
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,000
No.

881
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,550
You are more like them.

882
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
These days feel like a different world.

883
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,920
If I hadn't met you at the hospital,

884
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,230
I don't know how things would be now.

885
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,360
Perhaps it's just fate.

886
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,710
There is one question

887
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,480
I haven't figured out.

888
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,520
What is it?

889
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,360
Why did you not remember me,

890
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,000
but you still remember my phone number?

891
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,710
That's my father's phone number.

892
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,920
Can you remember

893
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,040
other people's phone number?

894
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,960
No, I can't.

895
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,190
Why should I do that?

896
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Have you ever thought

897
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,590
that everything we see

898
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,840
in the Lighthouse System

899
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,670
reflects some aspect of reality?

900
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,150
How will the people and things

901
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,590
from our memories

902
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,520
appear before us

903
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,750
once again?

904
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,520
Maybe just the way

905
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,710
we wish they would.

906
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,110
Are you saying

907
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,360
there's a reason

908
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,440
I can remember your phone number?

909
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,080
When we were in high school,

910
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,670
you called me up

911
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,790
every time you were in trouble.

912
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,880
I've never changed this phone number.

913
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,080
Even when I went abroad for college,

914
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,150
I kept it,

915
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,230
probably hoping for your call.

916
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,750
But I never called you once,

917
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,840
did I?

918
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,710
Exactly.

919
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,400
You've never called me.

920
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,040
But you remembered it.

921
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:25,920
Even in the world of

922
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,080
the Lighthouse System,

923
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,520
you still haven't forgotten.

924
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,670
What are you bragging about?

925
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,360
You just want to say that

926
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,110
you're important to me.

you've never forgotten me.

930
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,560
I know.

931
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,270
Don't show it off again.
