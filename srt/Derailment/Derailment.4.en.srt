00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,620
Is this your place?

5
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,180
No,

6
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm waiting for someone.

7
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,460
Who are you trying to fool?

8
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,140
Where's Qi Lian?

9
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,180
So you're Qi Lian, huh?

10
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,140
You really gave our boss a hard time.

11
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,620
I can't let you off without a lesson,

12
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,740
or you won't even remember

13
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,460
your own name.

14
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,060
Get lost!

15
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,940
Aren't you here to repay the money?

16
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,660
Here's your 200.

17
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,780
Just let me go.

18
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,220
Are you afraid of me?

19
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,620
Not at all.

20
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,700
Why would I be?

21
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,540
Do you think

22
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm like those thugs?

23
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm just investing in small businesses

24
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,460
and doing some We-Media work.

25
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,140
A contractor owed people wages

26
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,900
got reported by me.

27
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,100
Those guys

28
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,820
were sent by the contractor

29
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,820
just to scare me.

30
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,020
Come with me.

31
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,940
Come inside and sit.

32
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
I didn't...

33
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,900
mean to.

34
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,780
Sit down.

35
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,380
Well,

36
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,580
by the way,

37
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,540
A friend at the hospital told me

38
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,820
that Ms. Zhang's subsequent bills

39
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,860
will be compensated
by the insurance company.

40
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
You don't need to worry about it.

41
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,420
Do you want some water?

42
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,260
I...

43
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,180
I'm not thirsty.

44
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,300
There's water on the table.

45
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,980
(Why did I even come in here?)

46
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,100
(I was just here to repay the money.)

47
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,660
(Right,)

48
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,140
(I've paid back the money,)

49
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,820
(I can't stay here any longer.)

50
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,980
Well,

51
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,540
I just came to repay you.

52
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,380
The money's paid off.

53
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,060
I should be going now.

54
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,260
Do you want some rice with curry?

55
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020

56
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,420
(doesn't seem)

57
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
(as scary as I thought.)

58
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,140
(Maybe it's just a friendly gesture)

59
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,740
(since we come from the same village.)

60
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,140
(Why does he keep so many photos)

61
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,660
(of corpses in his house?)

62
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,020
(I must have been out of my mind)

63
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,220
(to stay here for a meal.)

64

65
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,060

70
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,300

159
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,380
perming, and dyeing.

160
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,060
If you decide to stay,

161
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,780
you'll start as an apprentice.

162
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,700
Of course,

163
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,860
initial salary won't be too high.

164
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
The base is 2,000,

165
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
but there are weekly quizzes

166
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,340
and monthly exams.

167
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,380
As your rank increases,

168
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,860
so will your salary.

169
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,620
Besides base pay,

170
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,700
there's also performance bonus.

171
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,060
Work hard, be diligent

172
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,380
and you might earn over 7,000 a month

173
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,900
in a year.

174
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,460
You have no place to stay.

175
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,060
Anyway,

176
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,300
you need a job.

177
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,940
So why not

178
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,740
consider it?

179
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,660
Are meals included?

180
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,860
Yes.

182
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,300
Wear it

190

or your girlfriend?

191
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Cut it out.

192
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,460
Stop gossiping.

You'll get used to her.

he should look after me

he's a bit dangerous.

I used to love all this stuff,
