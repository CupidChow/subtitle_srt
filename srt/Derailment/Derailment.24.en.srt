for the eye makeup.

253
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,440
Go for bold style,

254
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,320
and keep it natural.

255
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,280

Keep the foundation light.

267
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,280
Eyeliners need to be clean and sharp,

269
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,590
Make sure the audience under the runway

270

Nice try.

272

Remember,

273
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,680
before applying eyeshadow,

274
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,400
make sure it's color

275
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,080
should be coordinate with

276
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,830
the models' clothes.

277
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,600
The last step is lip makeup.

278

Outline the edges

- Yes.

306
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:17,790
check the saturation

307
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,200
of the eyeshadow I applied?

308
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,120
Not enough.

309
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,790
and the layers aren't well-defined.

310
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,360
The blending isn't natural.

311
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,160

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,350
OK.

383
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,070
[Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy]

384
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,400
Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy?

385
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,310
As an in-school student...?

386
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
What about a teacher's assistant
like me?

387
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,160
I've been auditing for a while.

388
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,550
I even made those class slides.

389
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,590
Where is your assistant?

390
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,160
I don't know.

391
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,480
Maybe she forgot that

392
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,480
she's just an assistant.

393
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,480
(When I'm around, you find me annoying.)

394
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,790
(When I'm away, you say I'm lazy.)

395
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
(What kind of boss are you?)

396
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,960
You are not participate in

397
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,880
this year's competition, are you?

398
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,640
No.

399
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm doing fine as it is.

400
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,440
I don't think so.

401
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,270
I remember the champion

402
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,440
of the last competition

403
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,200
was your first assistant.

404
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,400
Look at you.

405
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,480
You've been in this field

406
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,640
since you were 18.

407
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
In less than a year,

408
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,270
your professional skills

409
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,440
have reached the peak.

410
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,480
Look at

411
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,750
your previous assistants.

412
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,400
They were older than you,

413
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,240
but they all

414
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,310
called you a genius.

415
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,270
How did you become a flash in the pan?

416
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:09,830
What a pity.

417
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,480
No need, for real.

418
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,550
If there's work, just give me a call.

419
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,680
These high-profile works

420
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,240
are not suitable

421
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,480
for someone like me

422
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,270
who's approaching 30.

423
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,400
What are you talking about?

424
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,830
I'm 33 now.

425
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,550
Are you joking about my age?

426
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,550
You are, right?

427
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,680
But you should think about it.

428
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,110
Why do you bother

429
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,510
to be a teacher in that training school?

430
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,480
You can start your studio.

431
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,880
You are amazing,

432
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,830
what's holding you back?

433
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,240
By the way,

434
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,510
about your assistant,

435
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,270
you should get someone else.

436
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,720
Find someone who is

437
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,960
cooperative and skilled.

438
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,640
Don't find those pricks.

439
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,720
Once you make these people

440
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,680
your assistants, you will...

441
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,200
Why are you still standing here?

442
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,160
Go inside and pack.

443
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,510
I told you.

444
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,200
She is a prick.

445
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
Are the slides ready for
tomorrow's class?

446
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes.

447
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,200
Do you want to take a look?

448
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,000
Don't you know it's not good for eyes

449
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
to read in the car?

450
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,880
Mr. Jiang,

451
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,550
can I ask for your help

452
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,720
with something?

453
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,110
What is it?

454
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,000
I want to get my
intermediate certificate.

455
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,480
But the registration office said

456
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,550
I don't meet the requirements.

457
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,790
Unless...

458
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,510
You can write me
a recommendation letter.

459
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,440
Then I can take the test.

460
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,350
No, I can't.

461
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,920
You're not doing well as an assistant.

462
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,070
and your trail period isn't over.

463
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,400
Now, you're asking me for
a recommendation letter?

464
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,270
Why not just go directly

465
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,960
to the principal and ask for one?

466
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,510
You could become the makeup field's

467
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,350
door-opener,

468
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,110
specializing in the back door.

469
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,960
If you don't want to, just say no.

470
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,510
No need for being so mean.

471
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,750
I'm your assistant,

472
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,720
not your maid.

473
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,790
If there's something

474
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm not doing well at work,

475
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
you can point it out, and I'll learn.

476
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,720
But you always talk to me

477
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
in that way.

478
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,030
I'm not someone you can push around.

479
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,680
If you've got what it takes,

480
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,750
spare me the talk.

481
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,920
Don't mind my straight words

482
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,270
if you want to take shortcuts.

483
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,920
In this industry, so many people

484
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,590
go for quick gains.

485
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,750
There's no lack of those

486
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,270
with talent and dedication.

487
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,480
Who do you think you are?

488
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,110
If you look down on me so much,

489
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,480
why did you choose me as your assistant?

490
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,960
I was blind then.

491
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,000
You...

492
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,110
Sir.

493
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,270
Pull over, please.

494
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,920
OK.

495
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,200
What are you doing?

496
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,790
Resort to violence now?

497
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,830
I was up front,

498
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,750
neck twisted.

499
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,790
It's not fair.

500
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,400
Listen, Jiang Bo.

501
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,270
In the past,

502
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,590
if you dare to speak

503
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,400
to me like that,

504
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,640
I wouldn't be hold back

505
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,680
and I'll definitely break your neck.

506
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,070
But now, I have no choice.

507
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,480
This job

508
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,550
is my last chance

509
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,790
to stay in the makeup industry.

510
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,000
I have no background

511
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,160
or family influence,

512
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,510
and my time is running out.

513
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,310
So all I can do is work hard every day.

514
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,240
Why did you say you are running out

515
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,790
your time?

516
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,880
That's none of your business.

517
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,350
I'll make you look at me

518
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,160
totally differently.

519
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:57,880
Just remember,

520
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,680
one day,

521
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
I will definitely surpass you.

522
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,920
What now?

523
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,510
Everything is here.

524
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,590
Good night, Mr. Jiang.

525
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,270
Come on in.

526
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,640
No, thanks.

527
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,830
I'm not a door-opener.

528
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't make me

529
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,680
repeat myself.

530
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,750
I'll give you a chance.

531
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,240
You have half an hour

532
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,400
to replicate

533
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,310
today's runway makeup.

534
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,480
If there's one mistake,

535
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,440
pack up and go.

536
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,310
What if there's no mistake?

537
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,350
I'll consider to write
that recommendation letter.

538
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,750
Then let's go.

539
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,750
What? Where?

540
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,310
It's just the two of us here.

541
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,510
I'm the makeup artist,

542
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,550
so you'll have to be the model.

543
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,270
Alright.

544
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,270
Then I'll add one more rule.

545
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,790
The runway makeup

546
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,880
must be perfectly replicated.

547
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,550
If there's any difference,

548
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,160
you'll fail.

549
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,790
Come on.

550
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,270
You're a guy.

551
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,640
Your eye and brow proportions

552
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
are different from a woman's.

553
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,070
How can I make it exactly the same?

554
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,790
You can't?

555
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,830
I'll take it your quitting.

556
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,680
So go pack and leave.

557
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,240
No, I can do that.

558
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,590
It's just about applying
a feminine makeup on a man

559
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,240
and tweaking your facial features.

560
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,920
I can give you changes

561
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,720
that medicine can't.

562
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,480
Follow me.

563
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,880
Is it okay or not?

564
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,510
Just tell me straight.

565
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,920
Did you study facial anatomy?

566
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,160
No.

567
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,960
But I studied it in the syllabus

568
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,830
of intermediate certificate test.

569
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,480
Also,

570
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,200
I borrowed some class slides
from your students.

571
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:47,920
Oh, right,

572
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,480
I studied sculpture

573
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,200
when I learned fine arts before.

574
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,350
It's connected.

575
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,750
Did you learn fine art?

576
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:55,720
How come I didn't see that

577
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,510
in your resume?

578
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,480
Yes, I learned it in my dreams.

579
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,400
In your dreams?

580
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,030
Why don't you say

581
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,920
you learned it in your past life?

582
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,510
Have you finished the materials

583
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,400
for the test for
intermediate certificate?

584
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,480
Yes.

585
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,400
I've been pulling late nights,

586
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,270
sleeping only three to four hours a day.

587
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,880
I thought I could catch up

588
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,510
for the test early next month.

589
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,830
You can go now.

590
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,000
Go back and get some rest.

591
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,640
That's okay.

592
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,350
That's what an assistant should do.

593
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,200
Don't make me repeat myself.

594
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,200
Alright, you are my boss.

595
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,000
Your word is final.

596
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,510
What about my recommendation letter?

597
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,270
Don't be late tomorrow.

598
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Or you'll lose it.

599
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,550
OK.

600
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,270
Lunch is over.

601
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,440
Let's get back to work now.

602
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,000
All departments, hurry up!

603
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,550
Yes.

604
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,070
Get the actors.

605
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,550
Yes.

606
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,960
All departments, hurry!

607
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,480
Put it over there.

608
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
- Here?
-Yes. Be careful.

609
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,070
Sure.

610
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,680
Easy.

611
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,680
Yes.

612
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,160
Did you see my lunch box?

613
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,070
I put it right here.

614
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,880
You've working so hard,

615
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,590
taken over others' works.

616
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,510
No wonder they messed with you.

617
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,400
What a silly boy.

618
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,070
We have instant noodles.

619
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,400
The kettle is over there.

620
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,070
Thank you.

621
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,200
You look quite young.

622
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,720
But your skills are not bad.

623
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,200
Keep it up for a few more years,

624
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,400
and you'll stand out.

625
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,350
I really love doing makeup.

626
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,480
But...

627
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,310
My mother doesn't approve.

628
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,680
So, I sneak out

629
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,680
from home.

630
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,960
I hope

631
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,640
I can become

632
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,070
an amazing makeup artist

633
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,030
before she finds me.

634
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,800
Bo.

635
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,760
Mother.

636
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,190
How...

637
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,920
How did you find here?

638
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,590
I told you not to do makeup.

639
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,480
But that's what you're doing, isn't it?

640
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,110
I just want to do what I love.

641
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,760
I won't go back with you.

642
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,760
Give me your bag.

643
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
Give me your bag!

644
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,760
Aren't you trying to be like your dad,

645
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,760
being as a makeup man?

646
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,800
What does it matter to him

647
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,920
what I do?

648
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,510
You're living in pain,

649
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,150
can't you just let me

650
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,000
find some happiness?

651
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,030
Don't yell at me!

652
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,280
I won't go back with you!

653
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,960
You're happy...

654
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,030
You are happy, so you are doing

655
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,710
something I don't like?

656
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,960
I can promise you anything,

657
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,110
but not this one.

658
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,960
You want to do this?

659
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,320
Fine.

660
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,480
You're forcing me into this.

661
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,760
I'll break your hands.

662
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,320
[Fan Xiaoxiao]

663
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,280
[Fan Xiaoxiao]

664
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,230
I'm telling you,

665
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,190
Jiang Bo is really weird.

666
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,230
I asked him nicely

667
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,550
to write me a recommendation letter.

668
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,110
(At first, he disagreed.)

669
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,630
(Then I scolded him,)

670
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,630
(he agreed.)

671
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,800
Is there something wrong with him?

672
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,630
You called me

673
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,800
half an hour ago.

674
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,550
And you've talked about him

675
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,320
for thirty minutes.

676
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,760
Are you jealous?

677
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,670
Of course.

678
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,880
Alright. Forget about him.

679
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,360
How's your day?

680
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,190
Good.

681
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,280
I have good news.

682
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,400
Chen Fangzhou is getting married.

683
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,360
Chen Fangzhou?

684
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,070
With whom?

685
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,000
During the New Year's vacation,

686
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,590
someone set him up.

687
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,960
He said he's quite satisfied.

688
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,710
That girl doesn't mind that

689
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,880
he works at a salon.

690
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,150
That's not a big deal.

691
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,440
After all, he is a manager.

692
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,550
But it is too fast, huh?

693
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,670
Does he really remember

694
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,110
what the girl looks like?

695
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,440
(His parents are also satisfied.)

696
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,510
(So he made the decision.)

697
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,110
The wedding ceremony
will be in six months.

698
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,960
There should be some time

699
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,190
for them to get to know each other.

700
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,960
Come on.

701
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Humans have fought for

702
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,150
the freedom to love

703
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,030
for thousands of years.

704
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,550
Now, he's rolling back civilization

705
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,040
to the time

706
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,400
when love was hard to come by.

707
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,150
(Isn't he 26 years old?)

708
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,520
Why is he in such a rush?

709
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,360
People have different pursuits.

710
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,110
While you feel sorry for him,

711
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,440
he might feel the same about you.

712
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,960
(Once he told me,)

713
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,800
if you want to settle here,

714
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,320
it could take

715
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,710
decades of hard work.

716
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,750
(Registering residency, buying a house,
dealing with loans.)

717
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,670
(If the income is unstable,)

718
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,190
you can't even support yourself.

719
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,960
Staying in his salon

720
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,670
is more stable.

721
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,670
That's because he doesn't know

722
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,040
I don't have decades

723
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,880
of time in front of me.

724
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,230
Xiaoyuan.

725
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,960
Nobody knows what the future holds.

726
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,800
(Right now,)

727
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,750
we should live in the moment.

728
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,110
It's getting late.

729
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,150
Time to go to bed.

730
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,800
Good night.

731
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,520
Good night.

732
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,800
(Xiaoyuan,)

733
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,190
(I won't let your future)

734
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,920
(be limited to just one year.)

735
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,750
Hello, Shang.

736
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,750
I read the Mammoth's files.

737
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,710
The project

738
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,590
called Noah's Ark,

739
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,520
what's it about?

740
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,440
(That's the classified project)

741
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,750
(that Huo Boyu)

742
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,070
(was involved in before.)

743
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,710
I heard it has a significant investment,

744
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,070
but no one has seen the final product.

745
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,670
(I got some)

746
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,400
(insider info,)

747
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,190
saying

748
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,750
that the data Huo Boyu destroyed earlier

749
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,320
involving core codes.

750
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,150
And now, the whole project

751
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,520
is on hold.

752
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,150
(After the board meeting,)

753
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,590
this project might be doomed.

754
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,150
Is it really that easy

755
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,800
to just destroy the core codes

756
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,110
of such a significant project?

757
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,750
Who knows?

758
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Maybe this company was

759
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
just into money laundering.

760
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,550
What about Noah

761
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,880
I asked you to look into last time?

762
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,960
There is no one

763
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,270
named Noah in their company,

764
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,590
(and there's no one)

765
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,550
(named Xu Jingyang)

766
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,480
(either.)

767
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,800
Are you sure?

768
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,270
(Of course.)

769
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,190
(I treated the HR girl
from their company)

770
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,590
(to lunch last week.)

771
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,800
(She told me that)

772
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,230
the company can't use that name.

773
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,230
It's a taboo.

774
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,320
(Getting back to the point,)

775
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,750
(do you know)

776
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
(who's behind Mammoth Games?)

777
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,230
It's Fan Xiaoxiao.

778
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,550
(She is a hotshot)

779
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,920
(in the business world.)

780
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,590
(She has gone through three divorces,)

781
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,520
and made a fortune through alimony.

782
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,480
Now she owns multiple companies.

783
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,150
(Anything involving)

784
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,960
(this woman)

785
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,960
(is never straightforward.)

786
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,440
Isn't she the chief editor
of the Galaxy Magazine?

787
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,630
Yes,

788
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,230
she's always been

789
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,040
into fashion.

790
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,110
Oh, right,

791
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
the largest makeup training school
in the country

792
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,400
is Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy.

793
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,400
It's hers.

794
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,630
Zhuangmeng?

795
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,400
(But Xiaoyuan works in)

796
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,670
(Zhuangmeng Beauty Academy now.)
