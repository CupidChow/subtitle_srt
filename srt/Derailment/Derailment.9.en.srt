00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,400
Right?

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
This looks great.

7
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
The scarf goes perfectly with it.

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,960
Mr. Chen.

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,870
I want to report someone.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,830
What?

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,830
I want to report Ms. Ling

12
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,000
for helping K cheat.

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

14
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,030
I didn't cheat.

15
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,190
Don't you know

16
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,190
what you've done?

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,800
Don't make baseless accusations.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Ling, shut up.

19
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,240
Bai, go ahead.

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,920
K, come here.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
Ms. Ling, what's wrong?

22
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,240
These are the questions
for the test tomorrow.

23
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,960
Where did you get them?

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
Don't worry about it.

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,560
Do well in the exam.

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,790
Don't mess up.

27
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,350
Ms. Ling.

I...

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,560
Do you want them or not?

30
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,120
I do.

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,510
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,200
This one,

33
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,790

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,480
Haven't you left yet?

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,480
I'll take out the trash and leave.

38
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,400
Who cut the cord of the curling iron?

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,750
Did you do it?

40
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,360
You stole the test questions

41
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,430
and cut the cord.

42
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,750
What are you up to?

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,590
I didn't do anything.

44
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,310
Fine.

45
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,520
You won't admit it, will you?

46
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll come up with some new questions

47
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,910
and have K take the exam again.

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,590
If she fails,

49
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,590
you're both out.

50
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,400
Yes.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,310
That's right.

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,630
I gave the questions to K.

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,590
I cut the cord.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,710

55

56
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,800
I don't want her to win!

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,590

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,190

59
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,800
Last time,

60
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,680
we already gave you

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,520
a chance,

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,430
but you didn't repent,

63
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,750
instead, you've gotten worse.

64
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,590
I officially announce

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,190
that you're fired.

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,150
I quit.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,240
Quit as you want!

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,240
K.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
You are suspected of cheating

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
and disqualified from promotion.

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,280
The winner this time

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,030
is Jiang Xiaoyuan.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,280
Here's what you asked me

74
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,080
to look into.

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,470
Take it back and read it yourself.

76
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,470
Anything on your mind?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,750
Let me hear it.

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,400
If I tell you,

79
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,680
you'll introduce me

80
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,680
a shrink again.

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,590
Just chat with me.

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,560
Let's talk about it.

83
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,310
I recently met an old friend,

84
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,190
but she's not really an old friend.

85
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,560
However, sometimes

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,480
she would say things

87
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,800
only my old friend would say.

88
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,190
What kind of situation
do you think it is?

89
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,160
Was her body taken over by someone?

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Taken over?

91
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,750
Yeah.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,430
Like in novels,

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,310
it called...

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Two souls in one body.

95
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,310
Right, two souls in one body.

96
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,510
Are you saying

97
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,070
her original soul

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,510
might still be in her body?

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Bro.

100
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
I'm just joking with you.

101
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,480
Are you taking it seriously?

102
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,040
What I mean is,

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,240
such things

104
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,680
only happen in novels.

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,040
You have to believe in science.

106
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,720
How can I

107
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,870
bring her back?

108
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,390
Are you serious?

109
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,630
Well,

110
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,630
you can

111
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,720
take her to meet people

112
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,750
she used to know,

113
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,310
or

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,070
take her to places

115
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,190
she used to go.

116
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,720
This is more suitable for you.

117
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,680

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,720

121
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,480
It's me.

122
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,720
It's Mr. Qi.

123
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,120
Mr. Qi.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,750

There's a school reunion today.

127

You're coming with me.

128
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,070
No.

129
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,630
If you're free,

130
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,160
you'd better show up.

137

Is it Mr. Qi?

138
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,750
I recognized his voice.

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,870
I heard you two knew each other

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,830
when you were kids.

141
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,630
Is he pursuing you?

142
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,950
No.

143
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,750
You saw it yourself.

144
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,070
We're not that close.

145

Besides,

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
who would like

147
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,830
that kind of people?

148
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,560
Don't be like that.

149
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,390
Did you two have a fight?

150
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,360
No.

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,310
- No.
- Since he asked you out for dinner,

152
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,680
I'm sure he wants to apologize to you.

153
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,870
Come on.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,830
Let me dress you up.

155
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,680
Look,

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,870
you have to dress up
for such an occasion.

157
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,040

160
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,190
Now I don't owe you money anymore.

161
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,830
Take it.

162
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,240
And one more thing,

163
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,120
don't conspicuously call

164
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,830
the front desk again.

165
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,000

166

we're having an affair.

Got it.

168
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,560
Give them to me.

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,240
What?

170
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,750
There will be so many people
at the reunion.

171
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,950
If I don't see the photos first,

172
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,310
how would I be able to recognize them?

173
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,040
It happened suddenly,

174
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,390
and I didn't have time to prepare.

175
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,000
How could you ask me to go
if you didn't prepare?

176
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,920
Aren't you afraid I'll give myself away?

177

am I supposed to have?

She's like you,

not sociable.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
When you meet them,

184
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,480
just show your usual attitude

185
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,040
of ignoring people.

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,480

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,270
I'll drink water instead of wine.

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Qi Lian.

197
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,510
Long time no see.

198
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,000
Come on, sit down.

199
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,840
Xiaoyuan, sit over here.

200
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,670
Don't call him Qi Lian. He's Mr. Qi now.

201
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,750
He held the reunion today.

202
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,270
Right, Mr. Qi?

203
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,550
Just call me whatever you want.

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,120
Cut it out, you two.

205
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,080
He's doing We Media now.

206
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,320
It's tacky to call him that.

207
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,000
It's tacky indeed.

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,510
Xiaoyuan.

209
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,750
Where did you work

210
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,720
after graduating from college?

211
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
We haven't heard from you.

212
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,200
He's Zhang Siyuan

213
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,320
in the next class in our primary school.

214
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,390
Don't you remember him?

215
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,910
You two even fought over

216
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,080
a ham sausage once,

217
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,630
and you punched him in the front teeth

218
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,480
and made him bleed.

219
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
Really?

220
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
Yeah.

221
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,150
We learned to fight

222
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,000
at such a young age.

223
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
I was little

224
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,120
and didn't know anything.

225
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,240
Sorry about it.

226
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Sorry about it.

227
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,750
Zhang Sidao,

228
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,120
Zhang Siyuan's cousin.

229
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,480
He used to be fatter than Chen Fangzhou.

230
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,870
Now he's much thinner.

231
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm sure you don't recognize him.

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm thinner now. Look.

233
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,150
Right?

234
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,750
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,390
Do you remember me?

236
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,670
Qi Lian.

237
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,670
You can't always help her.

238
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,200
I don't believe

239
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,510
Jiang Xiaoyuan has forgotten me.

240
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,630
Right?

241
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,960
Ding...

242
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,000
Ding...?

243
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Well, have you really forgotten me,

244
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,150
Ding Xiangling?

245
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,270
Then you must have

246
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,910
forgotten about

247
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
stealing 500 yuan from me.

248
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,870
Guys, you know...

249
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,150
(I think I understand.)

250
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
(Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,790
(you're here to be a target.)

252
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,200
Ding Xiangling.

253
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,720
The money you lost
wasn't stolen by Xiaoyuan.

254
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,480
If you blame her

255
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,480
for not remembering you,

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,720
I'll drink a toast to you

257
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
on her behalf.

258
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,510
You said I stole 500 yuan from you.

259
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,030
Do you have any evidence?

260
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,080
If I had evidence,

261
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
you would have been
in juvenile detention.

262
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,390
Is that so?

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
You lost your money
and blamed it on your poor classmate.

264
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,550
I'm familiar with such a scenario.

265
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,200
I guess you have a few reasons.

266
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,910
Either

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
you like Qi Lian

268
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,150
and try to discredit me in front of him,

269
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,000
or

270
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,360
you're not as good as me in studies,

271
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,720
so you just slander me

272
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
to get the outstanding student title.

273
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,320
If it's neither of the above,

274
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
then you must have
a theatrical personality,

275
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
enjoying creating trouble for no reason.

276
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,550
Say that again.

277
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
- Xiangling!
- Xiangling!

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,840
- Pull her away! Xiangling!
- Xiangling.

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,720
Sit down.

280
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,440
Let it pass.

281
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,840
That's right.

282
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Just for Qi Lian's sake.

283
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
Sit down.

284
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,480
Sit down.

285
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,200
Calm down.

286
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,030
If anyone else has anything to say,

287
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,270
just spit it out.

288
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,550
There is no need to pretend to be nice

289
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,480
for anyone's sake.

290
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,270
If I did wrong to you in the past,

291
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,840
I accept the punishment.

292
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,720
But if not,

293
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,790
don't pretend to be drunk
and take it out on me.

294
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,790
Xiangling.

295
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,510
Are you crazy?

296
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,150
Ding Xiangling.

297
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,320
You owe me this.

298
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,840
In the second year of high school,

299
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,870
you stole 500 dollars from me

300
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,510
and played the victim

301
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
in front of Qi Lian.

302
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,670
In order

303
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,320
to help you solve it,

304
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
Qi Lian invited me to dinner.

305
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,550
You rushed into the restaurant

306
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,120
and poured a beer on my head,

307
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,390
saying I wronged you.

308
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't you know

309
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,030
if you stole that 500 yuan?

310
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,750
Fine.

311
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,030
Consider it as that I've paid you back.

312
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
Is there anything else?

313
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,200
Stop pretending to be a good guy.

314
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,750
Didn't you

315
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,390
bring me here

316
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,480
to embarrass me?

317
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,670
Xiaoyuan.

318
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,480
Xiaoyuan, don't go.

319
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,790
I want to go home,

320
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
and you want her back.

321
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
Only when I safely return

322
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,600
can she come back.

323
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,750
So, our goals

324
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,360
are the same.

325
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,030
Yes.

326
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,270
Before I find a way

327
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,720
to send you back,

328
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,600
you'll be living

329
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,510
in her body.

330
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,030
There are two terms

331
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,320
you must adhere to.

332
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,790
What?

333
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,840
First,

334
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,720
you can't harm her body

335
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,670
for any reason.

336
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:13,960
Second,

337
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,270
play her role well

338
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,870
and don't cause her any trouble.

339
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,440
Okay.

340
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,870
I also have my conditions.

341
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,150
When I'm playing her role,

342
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,240
I don't have much time

343
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,390
to look into the time travel thing.

344
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,030
So, it's your job

345
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,150
to help me find

346
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
a way back home.

347
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,120
I can do that.

348
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,030
What's more,

349
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,600
if you can't provide me

350
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,630
with enough information,

351
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,840
I'll refuse

352
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,840
to participate in any activities

353
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,200
in the name of Jiang Xiaoyuan

354
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,750
like today

355
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,510
No problem.

356
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,790
If anyone breaks the contract...

357
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,510
The other party has the right
to terminate the contract.

358
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,390
The breaching party

359
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,600
cannot force the other party

360
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,790
to submit by any means.

361
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,150
Anything else to add?

362
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,150
No.

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,030
The upstream of the source

386
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,000
is a signal base station,

387
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
but tracing further,

388
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
it's just a bunch of garbled code.

389
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,670
What does it mean?

390
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
Tell me in plain terms.

391
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,240
The way the message was sent

392
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
seems like the work of a hacker.

393
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,480
Someone intentionally erased

394
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
the sender's information

395
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,960
to make it difficult for me to find him.

396
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,120
Wait a minute.

397
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
We're talking about mystical issues.

398
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,320
Do you understand?

399
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,120
There's a mysterious force

400
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,440
that brought me to this world,

401
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,910
not a hacker you're talking about.

402
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,390
I know,

403
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,440
and that's what puzzles me the most.

404
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,200
Why does the mysterious force

405
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,080
act like a person?

406
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,750
At first, I thought it was Xu Jingyang

407
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,360
who used some method

408
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,720
to send me

409
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,910
your landing coordinates,

410
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,670
hoping I'd arrive at the scene

411
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,720
to provide you

412
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,000
with some experience and help.

413
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,390
But if this message

414
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,630
came across time and space,

415
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,790
it shouldn't have left a trace

416
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,670
at any signal base station.

417
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,720
Why are you making it

418
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,080
sound scarier?

419
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,240
Are you saying

420
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,030
that my time travel

421
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,550
was orchestrated by someone?

422
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,550
I don't know.

423
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,630
When I woke up,

424
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,200
my phone was off.

425
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,480
When the phone was dead,

426
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,030
it couldn't be located.

427
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,680
Where did the coordinates come from?

428
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,750
The coordinates

429
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,240
could only come from here.

430
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,270
Do you mean there's something wrong
with the phone?

431
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,590
It occurred to me

432
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
that someone might be able

433
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,270
to get us closer to the truth.

434
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,440
Qiangzi, can you do it or not?

435
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,160
Can you be quicker?

436
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,720
What's this?

437
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,640
Is it a locator?

438
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,240
It's a locator,

439
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,880
and it's still

440
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,790
sending out coordinates.

441
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,790
Can we trace who this locator is

442
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,550
sending coordinates to?

443
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,030
Hold on.

444
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,000
Qi.

445
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,790
Is your girlfriend being tracked?

446
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,160
Who is his girlfriend?

447
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,790
Hurry up.

448
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't rush me.

449
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,590
Qiangzi.

450
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,720
What is this thing?

451
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,000
Are you trying to bluff us
with a video console?

452
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,200
Come on.

453
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,880
Can you stop talking
if you don't understand?

454
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,960
This is

455
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,640
the most advanced device right now,

456
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,960
specifically designed to handle

457
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,750
this kind of situation.

458
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,550
I just

459
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,240
put the locator

460
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,960
on it.

461
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,110
Once I power it up,

462
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,830
the locator will send out information,

463
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,830
and we can immediately attach it

464
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,160
our special marker.

465
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,480
Can you reversely locate

466
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
the signal receiver?

467
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,030
Of course.

468
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,200
Then hurry up.

469
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,550
There's nothing.

470
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,640
Does it

471
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,590
work or not?

472
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,960
Don't rush.

473
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,440
The current search range

474
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,550
is a radius of one kilometer,

475
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,310
which means the person

476
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,400
who installed the locator

477
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,350
is not nearby.

478
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,550
I'll now expand the search range.

479
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,350
How long will it take to get results?

480
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,920
It depends on the distance.

481
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,030
Qi.

482
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,440
Why don't you guys go back first?

483
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,200
I'll wait here.

484
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,400
Got it.

485
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,350
Northwest direction, 17 kilometers away.

486
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,680
It's near you.

487
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,550
Let me borrow it for a while.

488
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,750
Qi!

489
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,000
The target

490
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,240
is moving northwest.

491
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
There's a commercial area

492
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,350
17 kilometers northwest.

493
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,270
If all goes well,

494
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
we can get there in ten minutes.

495
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,270
Qi Lian.

496
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,920
Who do you think

497
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,310
is locating me and Mr. Xu?

498
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,110
I don't know.

499
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,880
Are they monitoring us?

500
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,400
Why?

501
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,510
Is it because Mr. Xu and I

502
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,400
are time travelers?

503
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,880
Or did they already know about

504
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,110
the existence of time travelers?

505
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,160
Was our time travel

506
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,790
related to them?

507
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,200
Calm down first.

508
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,750
If your phone has been with you

509
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,790
the whole time,

510
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,350
they probably installed

511
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,200
the locator

512
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,310
from the beginning.

513
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,480
What do you mean?

514
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,400
Are you saying

515
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
there was already a locator inside

516
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
when Mr. Xu gave me the phone?

517
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,200
Don't jump to conclusions.

518
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
If that's the case,

519
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,440
Mr. Xu must have known

520
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,920
that I would time travel here.

521
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,030
Qi Lian.

522
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,200
Did he bring me here

523
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,440
on purpose?

524
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,240
Is he the mastermind behind all this?

525
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,790
Jiang Xiaoyuan, calm down.

526
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,640
Six years ago,

527
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,270
Xu Jingyang was also

528
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,160
under surveillance.

529
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,550
If there's someone

530
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,790
behind this,

531
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,110
Xu Jingyang must only be a victim.

532
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,200
He gave me the phone,

533
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,110
even if he was a victim before,

534
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,160
he must be

535
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
one of them now.

536
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,680
He must have
deliberately disguised himself

537
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,550
as my father's assistant

538
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,550
and approached me intentionally.

539
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,200
Then he left me here

540
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,160
on purpose.

541
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,680
Xu Jingyang is not that kind of person.

542
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
I was set up.

543
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,070
and time traveled here,

544
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,790
and you were convinced

545
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,110
that I hurt the original Jiang Xiaoyuan.

546
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Now all the evidence

547
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,510
points to Mr. Xu.

548
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,240
Even if he's not the mastermind,

549
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,200
he's definitely involved.

550
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,790
Yet, you choose to trust him.

551
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,310
Fine.

552
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,880
That sounds like something you would do.

553
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,590
We don't know anything for sure yet.

554
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,000
If we're going to make speculations,

555
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,880
we should wait

556
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
until we trace the signal

557
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,160
and see who is it.

558
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,790
Since I promised

559
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,310
to send you back,

560
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,750
I won't go back on my word.

561
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,880
I know.

562
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,070
I'm just reminding myself

563
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,680
that though we have the same goal,

564
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,880
and you promised to send me home,

565
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,550
we're still from two different worlds.

566
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,110
I know you're not doing this

567
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,640
for me.

568
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,070
The target is in the mall.

569
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,110
He could be on any floor.

570
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,880
Wait for me at the entrance,
and I'll go find him.

571
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,920
Why?

572
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm not sure

573
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,110
if they've spotted us yet,

574
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,960
but they definitely know

575
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,680
of your existence.
