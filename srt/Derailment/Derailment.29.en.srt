Why are you here so early today?

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,790
Come over here.
I have something to tell you.

[Top 20 List]
The top 20 list is out.

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,830
I saw it,

10
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,080
and I'm not on it.

11
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,110
I know

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,110
that some people may question

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
the results of the competition

14
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,750
for certain contestants,

15
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,160

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,880

were 30%

based on the voting online,

23
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,880

about the popular contestant
Jiang Xiaoyuan

30

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,360
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

32
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,240
I think she came in 21st place,

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,670
right?

34
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,160
Yes.

35
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,750
It's a pity. She was close.

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,110
Indeed.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,270
She's smart

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,600
and knows

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
how to make use of
the rules of the game.

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,640
She knows how to capture attention.

41
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,600
But this is after all

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,880
a professional competition,

43

and there are industry standards.

44

Just being clever

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,270
is certainly not enough.

46
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,550
The situation is not good now.

50

I'm sorry

53
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,110
that all your work has been in vain.

54
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,870
Why are you apologizing?

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,080
Without you, she would still target me.

56

59
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,870
I thought it would be worth it

60
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,200
if you could go on at least one episode.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,990
I didn't expect it to end so soon.

62
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,990
That's because she's afraid

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,150
that once we get exposure,

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,110
we'll turn things around.

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,320
If I could participate,

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,640
I might even win the championship.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,710
why shouldn't I be confident?

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,480

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,590
They were afraid to be upstaged.

83
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,550
Is it possible to have a repechage?

84
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,760
Even if you don't say it,

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,870
we've already suggested it
to the higher-ups,

86
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,550
and they said

87
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,830
a repechage would only happen

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,390
when someone can provide resources

89
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,110
for exchange

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,710
or the contestants have popularity.

91
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,240
Otherwise, why would the platform

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,150
negotiate with Ms. Fan?

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,270
It's a thankless task.

94
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,520
Is Xiaoyuan's popularity

95
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,150
not enough?

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,520
Not even close.

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240

the public opinion

101

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,590
that if I become famous,

107
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,320

108

the harder it is for her to get to you,

111
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,960

122
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,230
Now you're willingly serving her.

how she spoke to me?

135

If you want to earn respect from others,

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,960

Will you take me in?

172
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,640
You should think it over.
It'll be a big loss for you.

Have you had any surgery before?

No.

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
What do you mean by "no"?

200
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,840
You're such a muddlehead,

any brain implant surgery

219

before?

There's a chip

to this surgery.

228
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,150
I suggest

229
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
you go back to the hospital

230
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,630
where you had the surgery

231
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,390
and ask about it.

232
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,390
Can you tell

233
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,030
when this surgery

234
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,150
was done?

235
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,030
Judging from the incision,

236
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
it should be done almost a year ago.

237
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,030
Can you

238
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,080
help me remove it?

239
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,870
This kind of surgery is risky,

240
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120

241
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
of damaging

your nerves.

But if you don't

244
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,840
remove it,

245
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,670
it could still

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,320
cause damage

to your nervous system.

I suggest

249
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,000
you go back to the hospital

250
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,030
where you had the surgery

251
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,720

for observation for a few days.

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,390
Was it because of this chip?

261
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,670
You promised me

262
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,200
you wouldn't hide anything from me.

Why didn't you tell me?

of the Light Laboratory

328
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
Why does Fan Xiaoxiao remember?

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
There's only one possibility.

that there were certain flaws

to cure Fan Xiaoxiao.

342
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,160
Yeah.

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,880
Unexpectedly, the Light Laboratory

suddenly closed down.

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,550
to acquire the Light Laboratory

347
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,950
and had several arguments

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,120
with Noah.

349
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,670
I'm afraid that Noah's death

350
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,240
has something to do with Fan Xiaoxiao.

351
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,280
Could it be

352
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,590
that she stole the Lighthouse System

353
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,360
because she was afraid

354
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,550
that her residual effects

355
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,910
couldn't be treated?

356
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Noah certainly wouldn't

357
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,590
give up on her.

358
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,830
Besides, the contract

359
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
clearly stated

360
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,280
that the Light Laboratory
was the responsible party.

361
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,590
They just had

362
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,360
a financial problem

363
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
and needed some time to solve it.

364
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,160
Fan Xiaoxiao

365
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,400
probably lost faith in Noah.

366
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,480
Seeing the Light Laboratory

367
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,550
packing up all the equipment

368
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,430
and preparing to move away,

369
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
she thought she was abandoned.

370
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,760
I don't know exactly

371
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,550
how she did it,

372
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,950
but the result is

373
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,040
that she killed Noah,

374
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,640
switched the sleeping pods

375
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,910
on the transport vehicle,

376
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,280
and used a staged accident
to cover her tracks.

377
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
Finally, she hid somewhere

378
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,000
with the Lighthouse System.

379
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,190
This woman is crazy.

380
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
But even if she got
the Lighthouse System,

381
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,520
what could she do with it?

382
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,400
At first, she couldn't do anything.

383
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,430
But as she moved up

384
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,240
the ladder,

385
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,830
gaining money and resources,

386
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,390
she used the gaming company

387
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,350
her husband gave her

388
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,680
and restarted the Lighthouse System

389
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,920
in the name of Noah's Ark.

390
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,920
She even copied

391
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,960
what Noah did,

392
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
recruiting two test subjects

393
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,000
and implanting chips

394
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,000
in their brains.

395
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,280
At this point,

396
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,920
the only option
is to report to the police.

397
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,310
All this

398
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,440
is just speculation.

399
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,150
We don't have enough evidence yet.

400
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,870
By the way,

401
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,390
the chip in Ms. Jiang's body

402
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,150
is a strong piece of evidence.

403
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,390
Each chip

404
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,760
has a unique code on it

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
when it leaves the factory,

406
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,760
and there is a record

407
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,550
of the purchase channel

408
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,870
and buyer.

409
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,590
So, we have to wait.

410
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,590
When the chip in Ms. Jiang's body

411
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
can be removed,

412
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,760
we can avenge Noah's death

413
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,150
and bring Fan Xiaoxiao to justice.

414
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,350
I'm afraid that Fan Xiaoxiao

415
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,830
is also waiting to get the chip.

416
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,200
Come in.

417
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,280
Jiang Xiaoyuan has collaborated

418
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,310
with our brand partner

419
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,310
based on her previous works.

420
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,630
Our brand partner has agreed

421
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,920
to have a repechage for Jiang Xiaoyuan.

422
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,310
She's really something.

423
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,000
Since it's their decision,

424
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,310
should we...?

425
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,870
Do I need you to remind me?

426
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,630
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,040
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,550
I don't know why

429
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,350
I can't control

430
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
my emotions lately.

431
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,830
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,960
It's okay, Ms. Fan.

433
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,680
- Ms. Fan.
- I'm fine.

434
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,520
I'm fine.

435
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,280
Do you have a headache again?

436
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,520
You should go out first.

437
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,480
I need some time alone.

438
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,590
Ms. Fan.

439
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,720
Every time you enter
the Lighthouse System

440
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,630
to rewrite your memories,

441
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
you'll hit a tipping point

442
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,040
and can't pass it,

443
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,590
and then you will enter
the Lighthouse System again

444
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
and rewrite your memories once more.

445
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
This cycle

446
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,630
has occurred seven times,

447
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,070
and your body

448
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,350
has reached its limit.

449
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,520
If it continues like this,

450
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,550
your entire nervous system

451
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,390
will collapse.

452
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,760
I've given you so many years

453
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,040
and so much money

454
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,590
to upgrade the system.

455
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,590
Do you think this is the answer
I've been waiting for?

456
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,680
I want a solution.

457
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,630
If we can

458
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,280
get the date

459
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,390
of a successful test subject

460
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,350
as soon as possible,

461
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,760
(which is the chip)

462
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,830
(behind Jiang Xiaoyuan's head,)

463
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,920
(I think)

464
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,790
(we should be able
to complete the upgrade.)

465
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,240
(I can't wait any longer.)

466
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,870
(I have to take out)

467
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,070
(Jiang Xiaoyuan's chip
as soon as possible.)

468
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,240
(After she enters the finals)

469
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,550
(and gets more attention)

470
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,550
(and exposure,)

471
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,390
(it'll be hard to do it.)

472
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,480
The recording of the Top 20 Finals

473
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,040
will officially start in seven days.

474
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,480
Participants

475
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,680
can bring a makeup assistant

476
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,760
to complete the task together.

477
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,150
It will cost a lot of money
to hire an assistant.

478
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,040
I can go alone.

479
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,390
They're all going in pairs.

480
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,920
If you're going alone,

481
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,280
aren't you afraid of starting off
at a disadvantage?

482
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,310
I can do what he can do.

483
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,550
We should save money as much as we can.

484
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,550
You're so stingy.

485
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,790
That's right.

486
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,830
Hello, Qi Lian.

488
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,390
Hello.

489
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
(Ms. Fan wants to see you.)

490
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Tell her to give up.

491
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,870
Mr. Jiang.

492
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,550
Ms. Fan has cut her wrist.

[Understanding Cosmetics]

495
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,480
Why did you leave me?

496
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,480
Why did you come to her world?

497
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,350
Ms. Jiang.

498
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,630
If you don't come back,

499
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,680
the president should be worried.

500
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,440
Mr. Xu.

501
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,200
You've become a princess

502
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,150
in our world,

503
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,110
and you can do anything you want.

504
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,480
But in this world,

505
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,310
you're even struggling with survival.

506
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,680
What makes you want to stay here?

507
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Ms. Jiang.

508
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,070
You should come back.

509
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,070
You must come back.

510
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,310
Come back!

511
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,960
How is she?

512
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,310
The doctor said it's just low blood sugar,

513
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,110
but we both know

514
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,110
there's more to it.

515
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,350
Mr. Bai.

516
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,720
Didn't you say

517
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,760
the chip is absolutely safe?

518
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,280
Why is her condition

519
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,240
getting worse?

520
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,310
Even her normal life

521
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,520
is starting to be affected.

522
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,550
The chip itself is definitely safe.

523
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,520
I can guarantee

524
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,870
its function is only to record data.

525
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,390
Has Ms. Jiang

526
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,310
started seeing hallucinations lately

527
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,790
and experiencing

528
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,200
occasional headaches,
ringing in the ears,

529
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
and uncontrolled limbs?

530
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,630
Yes.

531
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,720
I dare not ask her

532
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,790
how many times it has happened.

533
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,350
I'm afraid that if I ask,

534
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,000
she'll get more scared.

535
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,390
I told her

536
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,550
that once the chip is removed,

537
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,870
everything will be okay.

538
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,920
But now

539
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,870
I don't even know

540
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,480
what's going to happen in the end.

541
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,350
From what I know,

542
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,280
this could be normal

543
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,680
for the Lighthouse System's

544
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,720
test subjects.

545
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,590
Normal?

546
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,150
The last test subject

547
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,040
I know

548
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,870
is dead.

549
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,070
Calm down.

550
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:42,870
Take it easy.

551
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,720
The Lighthouse System

552
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,350
can create dreams

553
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,310
and rewrite the most painful memories,

554
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,200
but the test subjects

555
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,000
must return to reality eventually.

556
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,870
The human brain

557
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,790
instinctively resists

558
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,870
external forces,

559
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,310
and when these two forces

560
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,920
reach a tipping point,

561
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,150
the symptoms I mentioned

562
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,040
will occur.

563
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,240
Both you and Fan Xiaoxiao

564
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,350
have gone through this stage.

565
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,520
How did Noah

566
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,960
help me

567
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,870
get through this stage?

568
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,830
Didn't you make a contingency plan

569
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,310
when you designed the experiment?

570
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,040
I'm sorry.

571
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,040
Noah

572
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,440
observed this phenomenon

573
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,040
through experiments.

574
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,480
He couldn't provide

575
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,000
any technical support
to you at that time.

576
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,000
You probably overcame it

577
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,520
on your own.

578
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,070
What about Fan Xiaoxiao?

579
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,310
Did her experiment fail

580
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,720
also because of

581
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,590
the tipping point?

582
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,870
I'm afraid so.

583
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,590
So, the experimental results

584
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,790
of Xiaoyuan

585
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,110
are still unknown, right?

586
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,720
Is there nothing

587
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,440
I can do

588
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,350
for her now?

589
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm really sorry.

590
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,550
I remember

591
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,280
Noah once said,

592
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,200
"God helps those who help themselves."

593
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,480
Qi Lian.

594
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,550
You're awake.

595
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,590
Does your head still hurt?

596
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,280
The doctor said you've been too busy

597
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,720
and had low blood sugar.

598
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,630
Now that you mention it,

599
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,310
I feel hungry all of a sudden.

600
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,350
Wait a minute.

601
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,550
I bought you

602
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,590
some dishes you like.

603
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,590
But when I came back,

604
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,480
you were fainted on the ground.

605
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
I'll post a moment to commemorate it.

606
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,000
Well,

607
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,920
how about we go on a date tomorrow?

608
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,680
We've known each other for so long,

609
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,280
but we've never had a formal date.

610
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,350
Okay.

611
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
why does the shrimp taste a bit spicy?

612
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,110
I want to
