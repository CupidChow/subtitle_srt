[Episode 15]

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,720
Did you catch a cold?

5
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

6
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,070
I'm just coughing for fun.

7
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,800
Does it look like a runway show to you?

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,280
It does.

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,550
Why?

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,830
After all, musicals

11
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,870
are about the art of storytelling.

12
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,030
Each character

13
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,710
has its own personality and destiny.

14
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,790
I think Mr. Cui

15
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,840
wants you

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,110
to show each character's traits

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,150
through makeup.

18
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,070
I know the traits of the characters.

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,280
This musical is adapted from

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,560
Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio,

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,600
and the female lead is a fox demon.

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,840
I've tried my best

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,430
to make her look like a fox.

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Why does everyone say

25
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,790
it looks like
it's for a model runway show?

26
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,790
Well...

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,070
Why is your cola here?

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
It stained my clothes.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,390
How much

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,960
will you pay me?

31
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,110
It's not my fault.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,110
Not your fault?

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,640
Is it my fault?

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,840
My coat is expensive.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,430
Just pay for it.

36
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,400
It got on my phone too.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,680
It got on your phone,

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,710
but does it have anything to do with me?

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,710
Does it?

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,040
Buddy, listen,

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,310
my coat is dirty now.

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,950
Either you buy me a new one

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,200
or pay for the dry cleaning.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,350
But I...

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,000
Fat guy.

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
It's clearly your fault.

47
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,680
Well,

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,120
why do you complain first?

49
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,310
Why do you care?

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,070
Does it have anything to do with you?

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Why do you care?

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,480
Does it have anything to do with you?

53
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,640
Ouch!

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,350
Let go.

55
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,840
You know

56
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,950
what happened.

57
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,870
Be smart and get out of here.

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,950
You're a psycho.

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,590
That guy

60
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,070
is unreasonable.

61
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
He acted angry on purpose.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,510
Even if he wasn't angry,

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,150
he acted like everyone owes him money.

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,870
Can you do

65
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,870
this kind of fierce look?

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,030
Of course.

67
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,360
Low eyebrows

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
and protruding cheekbones

69
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,400
could do it.

70
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,120
That would look fierce.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,240
What about the other guy?

72
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,470
Can you do that?

73
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,680
He has a gentle look with low eyebrows.

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
Each person's appearance

75
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,750
more or less reflects

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,080
his character,

77
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
habits, and image.

78
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,360
If I show these things

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,190
through makeup,

80
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,430
the actors on stage

81
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560
will stand out vividly.

82
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,590
I've got inspiration.

83
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,030
Go back to sleep

84
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,590
I don't need you to accompany me.

85
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,680
Are you going to stay up
all night again?

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,870
Have you slept at all

87
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,710
since yesterday?

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,910
I took a nap this afternoon.

89
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,190
What?

90
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,560
Go back to rest.

91
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,240
I can't.

92
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,360
Why not?

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,190
When it's daylight,

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,710
you can go to the theater

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,560
and see those actors

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
understand their roles.

97
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,470
It's better than

98
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,120
trying to figure it out yourself.

99
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,360
That's right.

100
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,520
Actors must know better than me.

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,190
Your phone.

102
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,910
Mr. Qi.

103
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,470
You have

104
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,710
a lot of tricks.

105
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,630
The people in your company

106
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,240
must like you a lot.

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,280
Kind of.

The villagers

115
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,190
must have

the savage feeling.

Okay, get ready.

121
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,750
Ms. Xi, I'll have some water.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Go ahead.

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,630
Hello.

124
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,560
I'm your makeup artist,

Jiang Xiaoyuan.

126
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you have time
to tell me about the characters?

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,910
The characters?
Aren't they all in the script?

128
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,040
Yeah, but the script...

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,830
Stop chatting.

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
Come back for rehearsal.

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,430
I have to go to work later.

132
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,920
Coming.

133
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,070
Everyone, get ready.

134
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,510
You should wait outside.

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,270
Don't disturb us here.

136
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,560
Get ready.

137
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,750

Do you have time

147
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,430
to tell me about the characters?

148
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,070
Are you the makeup artist?

149
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,720
You can't be like this tomorrow.

150
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,680
When we were rehearsing,

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
you just called them away.

152
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,390
You were delaying

153
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,070
our rehearsal.

154
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,310
I just want

156
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,160
the makeup

157
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,750
to fit the characters better.

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,070
Please take a look at this.

159
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,830
Did you just draw it?

160
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,720
It's not quite accurate.

161
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,480
I suggest you

162
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,120
go back and study the script.

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,750
We don't have breaks

164
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,510
during the rehearsal,

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,040
and we won't leave any time for you.

166
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,800
Do you get it?

167
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,750
You only rehearsed

168
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,600
for four hours today,

169
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,560
and everyone

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,270
is in a hurry to leave.

171
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,510
Mr. Cui said this show

172
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,750
is very important to you.

173
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,000
If it's that important,

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,950
why not spend more time on it

175
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,630
on it?

176
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
Spend more time on what?

177
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,190
Chatting with you?

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,240
Does the whole world
have to revolve around you?

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
That's not what I meant.

180
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,070
Xiaoyuan.

181
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,270
What are you doing here?

182
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,920
Mr. Cui.

183
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Didn't you say your troupe

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,680
is on the verge of being disbanded?

185
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,270
Since everyone is counting on

186
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,750
winning the gold prize
in this competition,

187
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,630
why not go all out

188
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,560
and try their best?

189
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,510
Are you talking about

190
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,750
their part-time jobs?

191
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah.

192
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Once the time was up, everyone

193
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
was rushing to do part-time work.

194
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,390
The lead actress didn't even show up
for rehearsals,

195
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,680
and you have to

196
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,750
prepare the props yourself.

197
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,560
Even the make-up artist
was hired at the last minute.

198
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,190
Your troupe

199
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,120
is too loose.

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,870
Do you know that?

201
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
I didn't tell you before

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,720
that we were all laid off

203
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,120
by a major theater troupe.

204
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,040
A year ago,

205
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,160
the most famous theater troupe
in the city

206
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,120
laid off all the members

207
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,560
of its musical department,

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,870
leaving many people unemployed.

209
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,040
Some were fortunate enough

210
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,000
to find new opportunities,

211
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,360
but the majority,

212
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
especially the tail-end actors,

213
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,630
found it hard
to get another chance to perform.

214
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,190
Some couldn't find a chance

215
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,430
to perform for six months

216
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,430
and even couldn't afford food.

217
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
I was one of them.

218
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,870
Are you also an actor?

219
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,390
I was thinking,

220
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,160
why not start

221
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,040
our own theater troupe?

222
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,830
We can take on gigs on our own.

223
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,720
So, I came to Feng Ruixue

224
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,480
and asked her to invest in us.

225
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,310
This lady was straightforward

226
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,680
and agreed right away,

227
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,430
but the only condition was

228
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,750
that she wanted to
play the female lead once.

229
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
No wonder you treat her so well.

230
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,360
Since you've got

231
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,310
the investment,

232
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
why do you still look like

233
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,480
you're in dire straits financially?

234
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,390
It's actually my fault.

235
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,070
I didn't have much experience

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
in running a theater troupe.

237
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
In the middle of it,

238
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,630
I wasted a lot of money

239
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,950
and struggled for half a year.

240
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,070
In the end,

241
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I couldn't even pay the salaries.

242
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,720
Although they didn't mind,

243
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,480
they had to make a living.

244
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,040
So, they went out
to find part-time jobs.

245
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,270
In fact, I'm grateful to them.

246
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,360
Even in such difficult times,

247
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,040
they never missed

248
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,830
any performances and rehearsals.

249
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,510
I'm sorry

250
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,550
for what I said earlier.

251
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,480
It's okay.

252
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,600
You didn't know.

253
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,480
Well, do you know

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
where they are working part-time?

255
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,720
What do you want to do?

256
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,750
If they have no time for me,

257
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,630
I'll create time for them.

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,910
Welcome.

259
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,790
Are you two together?

260
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,360
Yes.

261
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,080
Okay.

262
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,150
Thank you.

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
Welcome back again.

264
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,120
Okay.

265
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,630
Welcome.

266
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,870
Just one, right?

267
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,910
Okay, that will be six yuan.

268
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,910
Okay, thank you.

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,750
It's just right.

270
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,550
Just a minute.

271
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,390
I'll give you a bag.

272
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,150
Thank you. Welcome back again.

273
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,000
You're welcome.

274
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,080
Aren't you leaving?

275
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you still busy?

276
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,320
Do you have time now?

277
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,790
Have you waited for me for so long

278
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,840
just to talk about the characters?

279
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,960
Yes.

280
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,510
My understanding of the characters

281
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,240
is unprofessional,

282
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
so I want to talk to you about it.

283
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,440
All right.

284
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,390
By the way,

285
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,360
here is some food.

286
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,030
I notice that you've been working
for a long time.

287
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,720
You haven't eaten, have you?

288
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm good.

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,840
I bought this for you.

290
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Please take it.

291
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,630
Thank you.

292
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,150
Sit here and eat.

293
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,910
Here.

294
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay, I'll help myself.

295
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,390
I heard from Mr. Cui

296
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,480
that your troupe

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,360
has been going through a tough time,

298
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,080
but everyone persists in doing it.

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,120
I really admire that.

300
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,120
It must be tiring
to work part-time like this.

301
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,600
It's all right.

302
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
I've had a harder time before,

303
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,670
and I've made it.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,750
At that time,

305
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,510
I couldn't afford rent

306
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,150
and had no place to stay.

307
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,670
At the lowest point,

308
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,960
I even spent nights

309
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,870
at KFC and McDonald's.

310
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,840
I think

311
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,200
we should love what we do

312
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Life doesn't always go smoothly,

313
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,150
right?

314
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Yeah.

315
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,240
Besides,

316
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,550
in our troupe,

317
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,790
my situation is probably not the worst.

318
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,790
Whether life

319
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,200
is good or bad,

320
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,910
I see it

321
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,000
as an experience

322
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
and material for accumulation.

323
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,720
Don't you want to talk to me?

324
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,390
Yeah.

325
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,960
Let me see.

326
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,550
I've been working on it
for the past few days.

327
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,000
Please take a look.

328
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,630
This one looks good.

329
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,840
It suits my role as the rabbit spirit.

330
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,510
However,

331
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,030
my character

332
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,240
looks kind of

333
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,550
pitiful and vulnerable.

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
You can show it

335
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,200
through makeup.

336
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,440
Okay.

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
I'll improve it later.

338
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,910
Don't tell me you're going to
talk to every actor

339
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,320
like you're doing with me.

340
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,240
That's my plan.

341
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,600
Do you have enough time?

342
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,510
We only have five days before the show.

343
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,320
How about this,

344
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,080
we should have some time

345
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,960
before the rehearsal tomorrow.

346
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
You can come early.

347
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,870
As for who you can get,

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,030
it's up to you.

349
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,510
Okay.

350
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,240
I'll be there an hour early.

351
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,480
I didn't expect you
to be quite resilient.

352
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,750
When I first saw you,

353
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
you looked pretty,

354
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,030
and I thought you were

355
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,200
a delicate young girl.

356
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,480
Let me tell you more
about the rabbit spirit.

357
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,550
My character

358
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,670
looks fragile,

359
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,960
but

360
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,270
she knows

361
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,840
how to protect herself.

362
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,630
Hello.

363
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,390
I bought you coffee.

364
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,510

to see

381
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
how to design the makeup

to make it more suitable.

You know what,

454
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,070
I just found out today

455
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,070
that Mr. Wang from the theater troupe

456
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,400
is working six part-time jobs

457
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,200
and only rests one day a month.

458
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,830
Earlier,

459
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,790
his child got sick,

460
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,960
and he was really worried.

461
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,550
He slept only six hours a day

462
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,200
and spent the rest of the time

463
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,160
working or rehearsing.

464
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,310
If it were me,

465
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,550
I wouldn't be able to make it.

466
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,440
There's also a girl named Acai

467
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,070
who plays the guitar really well.

468
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,350
On weekends,

469
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,830
she goes to the city square,

470
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
doing outdoor performances
with her friends

471
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,000
whom she formed a band with.

472
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,790

474
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,550

475
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,640
No.

476
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,350
I mean, they seem to

477
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,070

481
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,160
he doesn't give up.

482
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,830
They're determined

483
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,270
to be actors,

484
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,750

489
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,790

490
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,400

in the competition

495

576
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,750
and let her take a look.

577
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,510
Okay.

578
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,030
Let's go.

579
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,000
Ruixue.

580
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
Your first position is here.

581
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,720
I remember it's here.

582
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,070
Are you mistaken?

583
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,160
No.

584
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,030
You should be here
looking at Ning Caichen.

585
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,000
When I turn around,

586
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,270
I can talk to you.

587
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,960
I'm looking at him here

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
the same way,

589
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,480
and I can also

590
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,640
talk to you.

591
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,550
Is there a difference

592
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,400
between standing here and there?

593
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,830
Ruixue, don't be mad.

594
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,720
Here is the thing,

595
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,110
you missed the first two rehearsals,

596
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:23,920
and we've made

597
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,750
some changes.

598
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,750
Just remember

599
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,830
to stand there when you enter the stage.

600
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,270
And

601
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,270
Xiaoyuan has arrived.

602
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
I've seen her revised design,

603
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,790
and I like it a lot.

604
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
I'll arrange

605
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,960
a formal makeup session today.

606
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,750
You can take a look.

607
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,000
Xi, you go first.

608
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,790
Xiaoyuan.

609
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,510
They've all attended the rehearsals.

610
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,240
If there are any changes,

611
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,750
you should inform me in advance.

612
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,680
How am I supposed to act now?

613
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,830
It's my fault.

614
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,880
Ruixue.

615
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,720
Take a break

616
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,880
and wait to do makeup.

617
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,960
You.

618
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,000
Come over and do makeup for me first.

619
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,110
I can't stop right now.

620
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,160
Wait a moment.

621
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,400
You...

622
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,310
It's fine.

623
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,720
You can do it for her first.

624
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,030
I'll go check their rehearsal.

625
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,070
We're not done yet.

626
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,270
If I don't come to you,

627
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,590
are you never going to come to me?

628
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,480
It's work time now.

629
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,790
Let's not talk about personal matters.

630
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm the one who pays you.

631
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,550
Anything I want to talk about is work.

632
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,550
Do you want to talk about work?

633
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,000
Fine.

634
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,110
Let's talk about

635
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,750
you standing in the wrong place.

636
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,200
They've rehearsed so many times.

637
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,160
How many times have you showed up?

638
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,310
With your acting skills,

639
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,350
how can you be the female lead?

640
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,880
What does it have to do with you?

641
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,160
How can you be the female lead
if you don't attend the rehearsals?

642
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,310
You have many opportunities, but does it
justify you not cherishing them?

643
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
You get on stage just to show off,

644
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,400
but do you know

645
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,110
you're dragging everyone down?

646
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,480
If you want to make yourself
look elegant by investing in art,

647
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,160
you have to respect art first.

648
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,030
Do you understand?

649
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,480
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

650
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,070
Are you lecturing me for them?

651
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,960
Don't forget

652
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,070
that I'm the one who gave you the job.

653
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,200
I appreciate the opportunity
you gave me,

654
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,240
and I've done my job well.

655
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,240
I deserve

656
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,200
every penny I made.

657
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,830
If you just play your role
as an investor

658
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,920
and don't cause trouble,

659
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,030
I can bow to you

660
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,070
and say thank you

661
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,030
when I see you.

662
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,550
But if you disrespect people's work

663
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,790
just because you spent money,

664
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,590
then sorry

665
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,550
that I won't tolerate it.

666
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,310
You're just a rural girl

667
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,200
who didn't even graduate from college.

668
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,350
Who are you to talk to me
about professionalism?

669
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,830
To put it nicely,

670
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,830
you're a makeup artist,

671
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,110
but in reality,

672
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,960
you just wash hair for others.

673
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,160
If you look down on me,

674
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,720
then don't take my money.

677

without a sense of superiority?

678
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,720
Get out of here!

679
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,000
Why should I?

Xiaoyuan?

685

How many days have you known her?

686
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,240
Why are you defending her?

what she's done?

691
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,110
She's the one

692
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,550
who stole my boyfriend!

693
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,440

be in this business anymore?

Ruixue said she would withdraw
the investment if we don't replace you.

of the past two weeks,
