5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,910
Did you have a fight with Mr. Qi?

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,030
Or is someone in your family sick

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,270
and there is a financial need?
Just tell me.

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,440
Nothing.

9
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,960
I just being

10
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,350
fooled around.

11
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,350
Someone told me he could help me.

12
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,030
I was all in. Not even realizing

13
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,760
if I'm being taken for a ride.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,550
Who did that?

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,870
Tell me. I'll help you out.

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,470
Li,

17
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,520
have we gotten

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
so close already?

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,960
Who do you think you are?

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,070
Don't mind my business.

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,200
The last one swore

22

they wouldn't betray me

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,880
After all,

Li?

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,880
Jiang Xiaoyuan,

30
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,840
you can't speak to me like this.

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,640
I really want to help you.

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,310
I don't know who betrayed you.

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,070
But...

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
But blaming his mistake on me?

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,790
That's not fair.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,510
I just know that

37
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm your friend and

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,480
should be here with you now.

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,350
I'm being unreasonable.

40
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,560
If you don't like it,
just stay away from me.

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,430
You are not!

Li,

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,510
do you know I'm annoyed with you?

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,350
You are just all dressed up

Getting along with
everyone at the salon,

47
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,200
you can say to anyone,

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,640
“I'm your friend.”

49
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,040
In your eyes,

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,350
is friendship as trivial as
buying groceries?

51
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,680
Jiang Xiaoyuan, don't be so rude.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,150
Are you trying to push me away?

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,200
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,120
So I have to scold you to leave?

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,950
Everything you said today,

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,920
I'll take it down.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,590
We'll deal with it later.

58
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,070
But for now, I'm not leaving.

Why are you

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,470
so clingy?

66
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,120
I lay into you,

67
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,190
and you don't even get angry.

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Who said I'm not angry?

69
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,590
Anyway, you are not the first one

70
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,430

I won't cut someone off

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,910
just because

73
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,240
she said something stupid.

74
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,240

You know, fortune favors fools.

78
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,800
You should be in hustle

79
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,710
for the gains.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,630
It's not always a win,

You were betrayed once,

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800

a moment ago?

Why?

173
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,600
I'll stay in my hometown
and get married.

174
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,870
You can't let go of

the rich man's fortune,

176
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,310
so you've decided to
devote yourself to the family?

177
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,630
My parents fell ill.

178
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,950
They are ill.

there's even less income.

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,800
Only...

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,190
Only if I get back and settle down,

186
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,480
can I take care of them

187
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,430
and earn money.

188
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,190

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,310
Sure.

190
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,560
I really like it.

191
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
I've put in so much effort

192
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
learning hairdressing,

193
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,560
how could I not like it?

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,830
But I won't be able to do it

195
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,430
after I go back.

196
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,720
Xiaoyuan,

197
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,870
Please don't be like me.

198
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,000
You must

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,720
stick to your dreams.

200
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,160
Honestly,

201
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,310
I always remember

202
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,510
that day

203
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,120
when you stood up for me.

204
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,630
I deeply regret

205
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,390
what I've done to you

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,550
because of my fear and weakness.

207
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,360
Xiaoyuan,

208
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,670
you're so cool

209
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,080
and brave.

210
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,240
Unlike me,

211
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,670
always hesitating,

212
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,870
and unable to accomplish anything.

213
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,120
You should hold onto that

214
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,000
and move forward.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,670
Fulfill your dreams

216
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,750
without regrets.

217
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,680
[Fashion Hairdressing Salon]

218
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,630
Xiaoyuan?

219
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,000
You are still here.

220
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,550
I'll go home tomorrow,

221
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,720
what about you?

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,550
I...

223
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,510
When?

224
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,270
Don't you go home for Spring Festival?

225
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,870
Perhaps I can stay
and take care of the salon.

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,910
Forget about it.

227
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,960
Let you stay?

228
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,840
I don't think so.

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,120
Go get your train ticket.

230
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,150
Your Grandma is waiting for you.

231
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
I don't go.

232
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,240
Hey,

233
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,790
it's the Lunar New Year.

234
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,750
You're not going home?

235
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
What about your family reunion dinner?

236
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
I spent the New Year alone these years.

237
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,120
Buy a ticket,

238
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,480
head to the beach for some sun,

239
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,360
chill for a week,

240
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,550
and then return.

241
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,000
I guess your year-end bonus

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,320
is running out.

243
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,200
How can you afford that?

244
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Unless you won the lottery.

245
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,270
By the way,

246
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,390
haven't you stopped talking

247
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,120
to Qi Lian?

248
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,320
He'll stay here

249
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,600
during the vacation.

250
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
If you insist on staying,

251
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,720
I can ask him to drop off

252
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
some New Year's Eve dinner

253
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,600
and dumplings for you.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,910
You want me to do that for you?

255
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,960
I'm not avoiding him.

256
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,320
I just don't want to see him.

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,120
Please, listen to me.

258
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,720
The conflict between two people

259
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,840
often arises because

260
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,150
they feel each other's actions

261
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,960
don't meet their expectations.

262
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,960
So they'll misunderstand each other,

263
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,390
each believing they are in the right.

264
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,080
Am I right?

265
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,790
So, right from the start,

266
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,320
I shouldn't have

267
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,600
too many expectations.

268
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,750
In the end,

269
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,670
we can only help ourselves.

270
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,360
But if that's the case,

271
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,270
does it mean

272
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,630
there are no emotional bonds
between people?

273
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,320
That's fine.

274
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,390
Then we don't need to help each other?

275
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,320
No one is meant to help anyone else.

276
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,840
Can you do it?

277
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,910
Don't let Qi Lian help you?

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,630
For one thing,

279
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,840
you can work here

280
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,550
is also thanks to

281
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,790
Qi Lian helping you

282
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
take care of

283
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,360
your grandma, right?

284
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,120
He is not helping me.

285
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,480
You know,

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
he's been busy

287
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,200
assisting the police

288
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,630
with the case.

289
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
Isn't that helping you?

290
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,120
You don't need his help.

291
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,670
Can you do this all by your own?

292
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,080
For people,

293
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
not everything is clear-cut.

294
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,670
You like him,

295
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,200
it's normal to have expectations,

296
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,080
hoping for a bit more favor.

297
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,000
If you feel it's not enough,

298
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
just talk to him

299
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
and ask for a bit more.

300
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,440
Simple as that.

301
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,120
Who said I like him?

302
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,600
I meant it in a general sense,

303
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,510
not specifically about

304
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
romantic feelings.

305
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,320
Are you buying something?

306
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,840
Haggling on prices,

307
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,150
going on and on.

308
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,910
Well, it's better than you

309
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,240
making a mess here.

310
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,630
Just quietly drawing lines

311
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,630
with him.

312
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,600
Weren't you a strong

313
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,030
and fearless person?

314
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,870
Why do you hesitate

315
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,550
when it comes to Qi Lian?

316
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,870
Anyway,

317
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
I hope there is no

318
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
general sense of liking

319
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,440
between him and me.

320
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,200
Alright.

321
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,510
Whether you like him or not

322
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,360
is your own business.

323
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,240
Get up.

324
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,720
It's Lunar New Year.

325
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,870
I'll treat you a big meal.

326
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,550
Come on.

327
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,270
What do you feel like having?

328
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,960
How about steak?

329
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,030
Or lobster?

330
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,670
Huo Boyu,

331
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,320
do you think keeping quiet

332
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,480
will be in your favor?

333
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,720
Let me ask you again.

334
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,510
You gave the files

335
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,440
to whom?

336
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,960
What benefits

337
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,910
did you get?

338
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,670
Still won't tell me, huh?

339
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,360
We've given you a chance.

340
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,600
Let's go.

341
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,390
Zhang,

342
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,510
keep an eye on him tonight.

343
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,390
He'll check out tomorrow morning.

344
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,630
Chongqing police

345
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
will send someone for the handover.

346
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,750
Remember,

347
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
keep a close watch

348
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,550
no matter what happens.

349
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,550
Yes, sir.

350
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Officer Zhang,

351
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,840
someone at the front desk
on the first floor is looking for you.

352
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,030
OK, coming.

353
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,790
You are here to kill me,

354
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,390
You want my administrator privileges.

355
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't you?

356
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,550
Do you still believe that

357
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,270
you are trapped in a virtual world

358
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,080
through a gaming capsule?

359
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,150
But you know what?

360
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,870
Jiang Xiaoyuan remembered

361
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,320
she came to this world

362
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,200
through a car accident.

363
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,390
She's wrong.

364
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,790
The gaming capsule malfunctioned.

365
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,630
Normal to have memory errors.

366
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,600
Get me out of here.

367
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,270
I can give you
the administrator privileges.

368
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,390
No.

369
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,080
I can give you my gaming capsule,

370
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,910
And the entire system.

371
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
You really don't have to

372
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,150
lock me here.

373
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,880
Why is it that

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,160
she made a mistake,

375
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,350
not you?

376
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,440
Huo Boyu,

377
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,270
if your memory

378
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,000
has never had any issues,

379
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,790
do you remember

380
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,750
Jiang Xiaoyuan

381
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,480
experiencing a car accident

382
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,400
before the gaming capsule malfunctioned?

383
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,790
Did she fall off

384
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,350
the cross-river bridge in her car?

385
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,550
No.

386
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,070
No.

387
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,510
You don't remember?

388
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,030
Then you must remember

389
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,400
that you two broke up?

390
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,720
Broke up...

391
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:32,830
Yes.

392
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,400
If she broke up with you,

393
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,920
why did she still go with you

394
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,000
to experience the gaming capsule?

395
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,720
I bet you know her.

396
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,480
If you cheated on her,

397
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,240
she would definitely

398
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,350
make you pay for it.

399
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,830
Burning down your studio

400
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,000
would be

401
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,830
lenient for her.

402
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,720
Why would she join you

403
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,790
for the closed beta test?

404
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,750
No, no...

405
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,030
The closed beta test?

406
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
The closed beta test...

407
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,440
The closed beta test...

408
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,110
The closed beta test...

409
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
Join the closed beta test...

410
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,790
No...

411
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,030
We went to the closed beta test...

412
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,310
Huo Boyu,

413
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,400
think carefully.

414
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,750
Who made you

415
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,310
believe that this world

416
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,160
is a virtual one?

417
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
A visual world...?

418
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,270
This world is virtual.

419
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,310
It is!

420
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,310
I'm right!

421
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,400
This is a visual world.

422
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,030
Why can't Jiang Xiaoyuan

423
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,960
be wrong?

424
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,310
Why can't Jiang Xiaoyuan

425
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,640
be wrong!

426
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,440
Why?

427
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,440
Why!

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,590
Doctor!

429
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,000
Doctor!

430
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,160
Doctor!

431
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,030
You should be thankful

432
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,110
that nothing serious

433
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,790
happened to Huo Boyu.

434
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,110
Why do you...

435
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,400
Keep meddling

436
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,880
all these days?

437
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,640
What did you talk to him,

438
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,240
driven him crazy like that?

439
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,960
I have a recording.

440
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,400
You can find it out.

441
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,750
You stay here.

442
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,310
You can't leave tonight,

443
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,480
and think about what you did.

444
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,000
Do you still believe that

445
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,830
you are trapped in a virtual world

446
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,550
through a gaming capsule?

447
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,480
But Jiang Xiaoyuan remembered

448
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,590
she came to this world

449
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,830
through a car accident.

450
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,070
She's wrong.

451
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,480
The gaming capsule malfunctioned.

452
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,350
Normal to have memory errors.

453
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,750
I fell off the cross-river bridge

454
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,200
in my car that day.

455
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,750
I'm going to jump down now

456
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,550
and see if I can go back.

457
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,880
(If Huo Boyu)

458
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,640
(didn't come here)

459
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,350
(through the game,)

460
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,640
(and Jiang Xiaoyuan didn't)

461
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,000
(experience space traveling,)

462
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,480
(is there any chance that)

463
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,680
(both of their memories
has been tampered with,)

464
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
(and they believe that they are not)

465
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,160
(from this world?)

466
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,480
(This laboratory mainly focuses on)

467
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,110
(the study of brain science.)

468
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,640
[Lighthouse System]

469
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,480
Lighthouse System

470
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
is my hopeful vision

471
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,550
for life.

472
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
I hope it can help everyone

473
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,590
overcome regrets

474
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,480
and find a reason to keep going.

475
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
(Is the Lighthouse System)

476
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,270
(tampered with their memories?)

477
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,590
(But what if the space traveling)

478
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,510
(never happened?)

479
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,680
(What about Xu Jingyang?)

480
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,000
(Where is he now?)

481
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,960
Fengni,

482
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,270
what do you say?

483
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,270
Can I wear this to go home?

484
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,960
You looks great.

485
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Thank you.

486
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,310
Look at you,

487
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,830
with all those nice clothes.

488
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,480
I can't even afford them.

489
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,160
Where is your money?

490
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,350
I gave it to my Mom.

491
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,310
Oh, you're really filial.

492
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,510
Li, be quick.

493
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,310
The car is downstairs.

494
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,400
Coming!

495
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,750
Don't rush me.

496
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,240
The car is here?

497
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,000
We should go.

498
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,350
That is a good one.

499
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,160
Hurry up.

500
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,160
Is everyone going?

501
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,510
Xiaoyuan,

502
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,790
did we wake you up?

503
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,750
No.

504
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,110
We'll share a ride.

505
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,750
Are you really not going home?

506
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,240
Perhaps, I guess.

507
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,200
Then take good care of yourself.

508
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,270
We should go now.

509
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,510
Happy new year!

510
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Happy new year!

511
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,790
Goodbye.

512
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,550
Happy new year!

513
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Bye.

514
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,480
Goodbye.

515
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,510
Have regular meals, okay?

516
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,790
(Xiaoyuan,)

517
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,880
(happy new year!)

518
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,000
(Take care of yourself.)

519
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,960
(Love you,)

520
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,720
(Fengni.)

521
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,590
(To Xiaoyuan:)

522
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,200
(Happy new year!)

523
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,550
(Take care of yourself.)

524
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,510
(If you're bored,)

525
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,480
(you can give me a call.)

526
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,350
(I'll be there for you.)

527
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,720
(The earrings are for you.)

528
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,440
(From Fang.)

529
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,680
(Xiaoyuan,)

530
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,110
(I can feel your warmth
when we are together.)

531
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,680
(Hope this small gift)

532
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,440
(brings you a bit of warmth)

533
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
(while you continue to warm others.)

534
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,270
(Go for it, Xiaoyuan.)

535
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,200
(Bai.)

536
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,750
(Happy new year!)

537
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,790
(Take care of yourself.)

538
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,720
(I wish you happy everyday.)

539
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,830
(Don't miss me too much.)

540
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,640
(Love you,)

541
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,550
(Li.)

542
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,640
Grandma.

543
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,750
(Xiaoyuan,)

544
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,640
(Lian told me you won't come back.)

545
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,400
(Grandma has prepared)

546
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,960
(a lot of your favorite dishes.)

547
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,480
(Come back for the New Year.)

548
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,000
Why the sudden decision to go back?

549
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
Well, I'm free now.

550
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,110
Go back to visit my Grandma

551
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,240
and check on something.

552
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,440
Did you watch this movie, Inception?

553
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
[Inception]

554
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,830
No.

555
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,920
I used to

556
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,920
love this kind of movie,

557
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,350
and The Matrix.

558
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,240
I also wondered

559
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,200
if this world

560
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,920
is a virtual world.

561
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,480
We are all in

562
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,510
a sleeping capsule.

563
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,350
So, how...

564
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
Then how do you prove

565
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,270
that this world is not virtual?

566
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,110
Then,

567
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,790
I got a work.

568
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,920
The society has taught me a lot

569
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,030
and provided valuable lessons.

570
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,880
Gradually, all in my mind

571
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,720
is the real world.

572
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,550
I was worn out everyday,

573
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,640
cutting hair for clients.

574
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,270
All I could think about

575
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,720
was how much money I could earn,

576
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,110
and if I work harder,

577
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,160
can I be the manager

578
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
