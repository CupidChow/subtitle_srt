Why do I feel like

6
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,800

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,670
Where?

8
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,350
I guess I made a mistake.

14
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,710

will you buy it?

15
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,240

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,000

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,510
to the regular ward,

381
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,920
I found a bug

382
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,030
under his bed.

383
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,270
The police later checked
the surveillance

384
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,350
found that besides the medical staff,

385
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,000
there were only a few graduate students

386
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,880
who entered the ward to visit Mr. Zhong.

387
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,550
Among them,

388
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,590
he was the only one
who acted most suspiciously.

389
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,270
It's all too strange.

390
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,160
That's why I've been
looking for him everywhere.

391
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,030
Why didn't you tell me this

392
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,960
when you came back to Luoshan?

393
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,030
Because these are just speculations

394
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,480
without evidence.

395
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,400
That's not the reason.

396
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,550
You would tell me

397
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,400
all your speculations before.

399
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,550
Do you think I'm stupid?

400
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,830
Whether it's the bug

401
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,070
or the ex-boyfriend,

402
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,200
although I don't know

403
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,310
why they showed up

404
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,680
in Mr. Zhong's ward,

405
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,920
I know

406
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,350
that you think all of this

407
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,400
is not a coincidence.

408
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,350
You think all of this

409
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,720
is related to time travel.

410
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,920
Now just tell me,

411
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,920
who brought me

412
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,110
into this world?

413
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,550
Do you want me
to be more straightforward?

414
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,550
Jiang Xiaoyuan's ex-boyfriend

415
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,350
might be her accomplice.

416
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,480

419

No wonder you won't tell me.

420
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,790
Deep down, you believe

421
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,200
that everything she does is right,

422
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,030
and everything I do is wrong.

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,030
I was the one who took over her body,

00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,790

505
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920

no matter how hard you work.

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,030
I don't want to do it.

for the rehearsal

569
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,190
and for the official performance

570
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
next week.

571
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,190
That's all.

572
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,880
The thing is

573
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,280
the makeup this time

574
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,670
may be a little complicated.

575
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,400
Please go ahead.

576
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,800
Take a look.

577
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,200
[Art Festival Luoshan City Musical]

578
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,440
Can you handle

579
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,150
such high-level makeup?

580
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,550
Isn't this the gold-winning work

581
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,320
from the previous competition?

582
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,230
That's right.

583
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,400
We also want to

584
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,280
go for the gold this time.

585
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,590
Let me see

586
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,480
your makeup design

587
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,230
so that I can confirm

588
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,360
how technically difficult it is.

589
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,150
Makeup design.

590
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,800
Shouldn't the makeup artist
design the makeup?

591
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,070
Don't you even have

592
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,030
a makeup design yet?

593
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,630
No.

594
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,360
I thought that since Mr. Jiang Bo

595
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,030
recommended you,

596
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,440
you should be able to handle it.

597
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,150
(I have to do makeup)

598
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,550
(and finish the design)

599
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,000
(only in one week.)

600
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,550
(It's too hard)

601
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,590
(Jiang Xiaoyuan.)

602
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,400
(Think about the KPI.)

603
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,960
Okay, I'll take it.

604
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,800
Ms. Jiang, thank you so much.

605
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,480
Thank you so much.

606
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,440
Here's the thing,

607
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,510
before you start designing,

608
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,590
you may need to meet

609
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,510
with our investor,

610
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,320
because she's the leading actress

611
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,880
in our play.

612
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,840
She has some ideas
and wants to talk to you.

613
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,590
Okay, no problem.

614
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,400
Okay.

615
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Hello, Mr. Cui.

616
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,230
I've arrived.

617
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,550
Where are you?

618
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,840
Okay.

619
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,710
(Feng Ruixue?)

620
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,350
(Why is she here?)

621
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,520
(Did she also time travel?)

622
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,430
I'm sorry

623
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,200
that I'm late.

624
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,040
What took you so long

625
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,680
to buy a pack of cigarettes?

626
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,830
I'm so sorry.

627
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,710
I got delayed on the way.

628
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,350
You know what,

629
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,160
the service is terrible.

630
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,430
Do you know how long you're over time?

631
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,750
You'll get a bad review.

632
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,790
You fell while delivering coffee

633
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,200
and got yelled at by the customer.

634
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,790
If it were me,
I would have thrown the coffee

635
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,040
in that person's face.

636
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,910
But you still

637
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,080
acted humbly.

638
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,120
It's okay.

639
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,750
I'm in the service industry.

640
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I should be nice

641
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,790
to my customers.

642
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,160
Besides, I've been delivering coffee
for a whole year

643
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,430
to build up my reputation.

644
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,350
If I get a bad review,

645
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,870
my year of hard work will be in vain.

646
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,960
How about

647
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,120
I'll refund you half of the money?

648
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Please don't give me a bad review.

649
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,230
No.

650
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,750
Do you think I care about
this little money?

651
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,200
I'm giving you a bad review today.

652
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,870
Please, miss, don't...

653
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,200
(She can't be)

654
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,120
(the Feng Ruixue I know.)

655
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,960
Why are you making it difficult for him?

656
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,230
Just be easy on him.

657
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,710
Why do you have to
give him a bad review?

658
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:52,790
Besides,

659
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,750
smoking is prohibited in public places.

660
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,750
Don't you know it?

661
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,310
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

662
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,270
How dare you hit me?

663
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,960
I want to hit you.

664
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,480
(How does she know
my name is Jiang Xiaoyuan?)

665
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Traffic jam. I'm late.

666
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,870
Sorry.

667
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,830
You've met.

668
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,560
Who is she?

669
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,600
She's our boss,

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,430
