Are you two new here?

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,150
Where's Ling?

7
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
She went shopping.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,030
Just a quick rundown.

9
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,880
It's been a week,

10
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,630
and I've received feedback

11
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,470
from the senior stylists

12
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,720
regarding your performance
as apprentices.

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,720
First of all, congratulations to K.

14
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,830
In just one week,

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,830
you've earned unanimous praise

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,030
from everyone in the salon.

17
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,030
I now announce

18
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,480
that your rank

19
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,600
is upgraded
from apprentice to intern stylist.

20
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,670
In other words,

21
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,030
starting tomorrow,

22
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,280
you can start attending to clients

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,840
and providing hair washing services.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,070
Thank you, boss.

25
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,600
Here you go.

26
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,920
And of course, Fengni,

27
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,670
you've also received unanimous approval.

28
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,280

for improvement,

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,160

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
have high expectations for you.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,070
Keep up the good work.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,880
Yes.

What about me?

40
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,230
How unexpected.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,480
You didn't pass.

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,400
How is that possible?

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Why not?

44
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,400
Let me read it to you.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,990
Jiang didn't apply even pressure,

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,350
and she scratched me twice
with her nails.

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,230
I've trimmed my nails.

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,270
She's not skillful enough.

49
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,510
After washing my hair,

50
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,430
my neck feels stiffer.

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,070
This is hair washing, not a massage.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,990
Should I care about whether their necks

53
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,840
are stiff or not?

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,230
The hair washing was really bad,

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,400
and the water was a little cold.

56
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,760
Are you sure you didn't forget

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,630
to say those two sentences?

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm not stupid.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
How could I forget?

60
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
Then what do you think

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
is the problem?

62
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,680
It is, of course,

63
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,710
their problem.

64
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,790
When I washed their hair,

65
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,790
they didn't say anything.

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,070
Well,

67
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,230
they just stabbed me in the back.

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,070
What kind of people are they?

69
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,960
Miss Jiang.

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,990
Don't blame me

71
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,120
for being fair.

72
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,760
I've seen at least three times

73
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,150
that you broke someone's hair.

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,560
If someone washed your hair in that way,

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
you'd have dismantled the salon.

76
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,920
Don't look down on

77
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,960
the job of hair washing.

78
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,760
I didn't take it seriously last week.

79
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,160
Either I don't do it,

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,950
or if I do it,

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll do it well.

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,230
Just wait and see.

83
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,110
She actually asked me to wait.

84
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,440
She's not good at what she does,

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,550
yet she's still that confident.

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,550
She should practice more.

90

you mentioned?)

109

getting promoted?

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,790
Not really.

111
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,040

112
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,920
that you haven't been promoted
to intern stylist yet.

113

(promoted blood circulation.)

382
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,110
(You're here today to learn from him.)

383
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,040
(As long as I learn his skills,)

384
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,870
(Chen Fangzhou
will definitely let me pass.)

385
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,070
Have a seat.

386
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,680
Qi Lian.

387
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,590
I have something...

388
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,150
Have you passed the assessment?

389
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,830
(If I did,)

390
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,040
(why would I come to you?)

391
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,830
Oh, right,

392
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,280
if you have passed,
you wouldn't have come here.

393
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,630
(Is he a mind reader?)

394
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm not a mind reader.

395
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,070
You wear your thoughts on your face.

396
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,960
(Then without me telling you,)

397
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,830
(you should be able to)

398
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,280
(know why I'm here.)

399
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,520
(Without me asking you,)

400
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,280
(you'll teach me)

401
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,830
(the scalp massage techniques.)

402
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,200
You're not here

403
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,200
to secure advantages
through my influence, are you?

404
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,440
Of course not.

405
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,240
I just need some advice

406
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,000
on how to pass the assessment.

407
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,790
I think my skills

408
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,960
are pretty good.

409
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,590
I don't know what the problem is.

410
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,680
Can you teach me

411
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
some massage techniques?

412
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,000
This is the Fengchi Acupoint.

413
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,310
It helps with headaches and insomnia.

414
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,760
Lie down.

415
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,000
This is the temple.

416
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,550
What are you nervous about?

417
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,240
Relax.

418
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,200
I...

419
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,590
I'm not nervous.

420
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,520
Well,

421
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,110
where is the Baihui Acupoint?

422
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
It's about here.

423
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,680
Actually, I can rub it gently first.

424
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,720
After finding the acupoint,

425
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,480
I'll gradually increase the pressure.

426
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,680
Have you learned it?

427
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,200
I think so.

428
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,440
Give it a try.

429
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,110
This is the Baihui Acupoint.

430
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,520
No.

431
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,590
Don't look at me. I'm nervous.

432
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,110

For what?

461
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,920
This time, I'll definitely pass
the assessment.

462
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,550
Looks like you're not stupid.

463
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,150
Say it again.

464
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,590
Say it again.

465
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,150
(Jiang Xiaoyuan.)

466
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,350
(Why do you pretend you don't know me?)

467
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,760
You...

468
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,070
What are you doing?

469
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,310
Listen,

470
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,790
considering that I've helped you,

471
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,440
no,

472
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,590
you've helped me,

473
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,550
I'll let it go,

474
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,070
and I can even treat you to a meal.

475
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,590
Curry beef brisket,

476
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,630
boiled fish slices,

477
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,200
braised meatballs,

478
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,200
spare ribs with garlic.

479
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,590
That's enough.

480
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,720
We can't finish all that.

481
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,240
Never mind. I want none of those.

482
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,870
I'd like a plateful of shrimp dumplings.

483
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,150
(He's been taking care of me
during this time.)

484
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,150
(If he finds out)

485
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,070
(I'm not that Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

486
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,070
(I can't imagine what will happen.)

487
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,440
(But if I don't tell him)

488
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,790
(the truth,)

489
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,760
(I'll be cheating him)

490
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,720
(and taking advantage of him.)

491
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,920
(Never mind.)

492
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,000
(I'll just leave the salon
in the worst case.)

493
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,310
Well,

494
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,440
I think

495
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
you've helped me a lot,

496
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,350
and I'm quite grateful.

497
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,870
There's one thing

498
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,960
I need to confess to you

499
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
you don't feel like

500
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,110
I'm taking advantage of you.

501
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,040
This is

502
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,110
kind of absurd.

503
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,960
Please don't call the police
after hearing it.

504
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,590
I'll try. Go ahead.

505
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,870
Actually,

506
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,590
I'm a time traveler.

507
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,390
It's hard to explain,

508
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,070
but in short, I'm not the Jiang Xiaoyuan

509
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,960
you know.

510
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,790
Then who are you?

511
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,390
I...

512
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,590
Excuse me.

513
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,630
Here are your dumplings.

514
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,240
I'm the other Jiang Xiaoyuan

515
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,150
from a parallel universe.

516
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,720
I accidentally fell into

517
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,310
this Jiang Xiaoyuan's body.

518
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,150
Although we share the same name

519
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,000
and appearance,

520
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,520
our backgrounds,

521
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,280
ages,

522
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,720
and life paths

523
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,110
are completely different.

524
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,680
Do you understand?

525
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,720
You have different habits.

526
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,040
Of course.

527
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,350
So?

528
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,200
So,

529
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,870
I hope you see me

530
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,070
as a completely new person.

531
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,480
All the relationship issues

532
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,310
and grievances from before

533
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,150
have nothing to do with me.

534
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,550
I don't want you

535
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,310
to care for me

536
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,310
or teach me

537
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,200
for the old time's sake,

538
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,440
and I especially don't want

539
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,550
to give you

540
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,310
any unnecessary hints

541
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,390
by accepting your help.

542
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,830
Do you know what I mean?

543
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,760
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

544
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,720
Do you think I'm stupid?

545
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,870
You eat dumplings with vinegar,

546
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
chili oil, and fermented soybeans.

547
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,440
Two drops of chili oil,

548
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,280
not more, not less,

549
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,920
and five fermented soybeans.

550
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,310
Who else

551
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,440
could be so petty?

552
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
If you had changed

553
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
your childhood habit today,

554
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,150
I might have

555
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,070
believed your nonsense for once.

556
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,920
But...

557
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,440
If you really want to pretend

558
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,200
not to know me,

559
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,480
no problem.

560
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,480
After we finish this meal

561
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,440
and leave this restaurant,

562
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,920
we can pretend we've never met before.

563
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,070
That's not what I mean.

564
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,960
I'll go to the restroom.

565
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,200
(Jiang Xiaoyuan.)

566
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,760
(What have you been through)

567
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,920
(in these years?)

568
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,630
(To avoid me,)

569
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,720
(you even came up with an excuse)

570

(of time travel)

571
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,310
I don't want to use

572
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,310

573
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,200
as the girl you thought I am.

574
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,920
That's why I confessed to you.

575
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,870
Why don't you know what's good for you?

576
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,790
[Women]

577
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,070
You drank so much.

578
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,920
Are you okay?

579
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm fine.

580
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:50,960
Bro,

581
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,960
are you really going to marry

582
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,590
that hair-washing girl?

583
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,550
Are you crazy?

584
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,480
My relative set her up with me.

585
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,520
It's just for fun.

586
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,390
It's good, just don't take it seriously.

Get lost.

588
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,350
When you're tired of her,
give her to me.

589
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,480
What?

590
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,590
Where are you

591
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,480
taking my girlfriend to?

592
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,960
Who are you?

593
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,960
I'm your ancestor.

594
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:27,920
Bro.

595
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,960
Who are you?

596
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
What are you doing? Let go!

597
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,000
Jiang Xiaoyuan, what are you doing?

598
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
Let go of me!

599
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,920
Let go!

00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,440
What's wrong with you?

601
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
I heard what they said.

602
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,590
He only wants to have fun with you.

603
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
He'll never marry you.

604
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,070
What do you know?

605
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,110
My family

606
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,830
set me up

607
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,520
with that man.

608
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,440
His family is running a business.

609
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,960
They're doing great.

610
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,550
If this works out,

611
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,760
my younger brother
will have money for his wedding.

612
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,790
Jiang Xiaoyuan, you're ruining my plan.

613
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,280
Wake up.

614
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,960
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

615
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,280
Who are you to judge me?

616
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,590
Do you know me?

617
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,760
You get involved with Mr. Qi

618
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,070
just because you're pretty,

619
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,190
but we're both hair-washing girls.

620
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,190
Why?

621
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,070
Why do you think
you can look down on me?

622
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,960
Mr. Qi.

623
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,270
Can you go back by yourself?

624
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:22,920
Yes.

625
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,070
Go ahead.

626
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,480
(Turns out
he's considerate to everyone.)

627
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,110
I don't get it.

628
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,000
K's date

629
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,230
is obviously not a good person.

630
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,230
Who would get a girl drunk

631
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,520
on the first date?

632
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,710
Obviously, he wanted
to take advantage of her.

633
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,550
What is her family thinking?

634
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,710
Why didn't they ask about

635
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,550
what kind of person he is

636
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,440
before setting her up with him?

637
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,670
Are you still angry?

638
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,590
Are you going to act like
you don't know me?

639
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,710
Not everyone

640
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,880
has a lot of choices.

641
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,440
Why not?

642
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,320
When looking for a marriage partner,

643
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,960
character, family background,

644
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,110
and appearance are all essential.

645
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,960
Do you think

646
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,110
there is someone like that

647
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,190
around K?

648
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,190
What do you mean?

649
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,550
Does she not deserve

650
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,800
a good marriage partner?

651
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,400
Everyone deserves

652
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,750
a perfect marriage partner,

653
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,590
but in reality,

654
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:38,920
her family

655
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,440
needs the dowry

656
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,360
for their son to get married.

657
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,840
Even if

658
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,150
this is the reality,

659
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,190
she still has to

660
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,550
do something to change it.

661
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,440
If you were K,

662
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,070
what would you choose?

663
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,190
Me?

664
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
I would do everything I could

665
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,190
to get what I want.

666
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,360
That's why you're Jiang Xiaoyuan,

667
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,920
not K.

668
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,070
Not everyone has the courage

669
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,270
to change their lives.

672
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,750
Just right.

673

674
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,150
It's just right.

00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,670
Okay.

This is the Baihui Acupoint.

Pressing it

678
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,440
brings a refreshing
and invigorating effect.

has been stiff lately.

the Fengchi Acupoint for you

Well done, Jiang Xiaoyuan.

talk to me normally?

691
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,520
It sounds a bit strange.

Go go. Come on.

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,440

Only three yuan?

Don't think it's too little.

732
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,920
We have 30 to 40 customers

However,

745
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,590
you need to pay attention

00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,800
to interpersonal relationships.

00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,550
