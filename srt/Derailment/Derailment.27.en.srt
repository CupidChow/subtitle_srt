You should leave this place.

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,560
Go with us.

After you leave this place,

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,440
you can do whatever you want.

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
You can do what you like

that you've always wanted to escape

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,320

Look.

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,390
This is your work

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,920
from the International Makeup Competition
when you were 17.

41
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,110
You won the regional championship

Look at

44
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,640
this smoky-eye makeup.

45
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,640
The techniques are excellent,
and the look is aggressive.

46
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,640
And this one.

47
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
You sewed the mouth shut

48
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,960
because you want to tell everyone

49
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,390
that your life is hard,

50
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,430
but you can't say anything about it.

51
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,550
That's why you can only

52
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,040
put your hope in makeup.

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,040
Right?

54
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,800
I also heard

55
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,360
that when you first got out of

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,040

57

you wanted to end it all.

58

It was only
when you started doing makeup

59
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,110
that life became enjoyable.

60
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,150
It was so hard that at that time,

61
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,040

give up now?

taking on some private jobs

167
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,720

I can improve my skills.

Secondly,

172
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,150
I'll be able to build up my network.

194
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
It's not like you.

195
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,870
Do I?

196
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Yeah.

197
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,360
Tomorrow's worries are for tomorrow.

198
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,480
There's always a way out.

199
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,360
Look at me.

200
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,440
I'm carefree now.

201
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,870
I used to think

202
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,550
my life would come to an end

203
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,840
after one year.

204
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,240
But

205
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,960
after I found that you seem to have

206
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,510
no after-effects of the experiment,

207
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,840
I felt

208
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,510
relieved.

209
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,360
Now I think

210
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,910
the future is bright.

211
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,480
I suddenly realized
that the night view of the city

212
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,630
is quite beautiful.

213
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,030
(Jiang Xiaoyuan.)

214
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,240
(I'll find a way)

215
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,550
(to remove the chip from your body.)

216
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,360
It's beautiful.

217
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,120
Isn't it?

218
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,700
♪I can hear you breath♪

219
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,520
Yeah.

220
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,370
♪Despite owning nothing♪

221
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,720
♪I want to find myself♪

222
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,150
(Are you really not gonna tell her?)

223
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,630
(If the chip keeps staying in her body,)

224
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,790
(she'll be in danger.)

225
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,000
No.

226
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,390
I don't want to

227
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,600
ruin her mood now.

228
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,910
It won't be too late to tell her

229
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,720
when I find the least risky

230
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
to remove it.

231
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,670
You're up early.

232
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,390
I brought you breakfast.

233
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,790
You eat first.

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,720
I have something to talk to him.

235
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,960
Jiang Bo.

236
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,670
I have something to talk to you.

237
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,200
I hope you can enter

238
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,910
the National Makeup Artist Competition

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,910
with me.

240
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,630
What do you think?

241
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not doing it.

242
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,870
Why not?

243
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,030
If you win an award,

244
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
you can prove to everyone

245
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,600
that you're capable.

246
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,750
That way,

247
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,480
the criticism online

248
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,320
will dissipate,

249
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,840
and business will follow.

250
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,150
There's no reason not to do it.

251
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,270
Don't you know

252
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,840
who the organizer

253
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,790
of the National
Makeup Artist Competition is?

254
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,960
Of course I know.

255
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,200
It's Galaxy.

256
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,240
But we'll enter the competition

257
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,550
through the official channel.

258
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,320
Even Fan Xiaoxiao can't deprive us

259
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,080
of the right to enter the competition.

260
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,910
Even if you can enter the competition,

261
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Fan Xiaoxiao

262
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
is still one of the judges.

263
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,000
It's easy for her

264
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,120
to eliminate anyone she wants.

265
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,630
There's no hope for us.

266
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,320
Give up.

267
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,510
I've checked.

268
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,550
There's a new rule

269
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,000
in this year's competition.

270
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,960
All contestants

271
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,750
must upload their work

272
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,670
in each round

273
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,030
to the official website

274
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,750
to avoid shady practices.

275
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,630
Do you know what I mean?

276
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,670
If our work

277
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,480
is good enough,

278
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,200
Fan Xiaoxiao

279
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,510
can't eliminate us on her own.

280
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,630
Have you read

281
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,510
the application requirement carefully?

282
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,510
Any makeup artist
with an intermediate license

283
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,320
can participate, right?

284
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,480
Independent makeup artists

285
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,840
need to have an advanced certificate.

286
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,440
Only those who sign up

287
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,790
as a studio

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
can enter the competition

289
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,000
with a certain number of

290
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,910
intermediate-level makeup artists.

291
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,320
That's perfect.

292
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,910
Let's set up a studio.

293
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
When you work as a makeup artist again,

294
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,790
you'll also need a studio.

295
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,550
What do you think?

296
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,790
I don't want to bother myself with that.

297
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,160
Sit down.

298
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,350
I'll get that for you.

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,030
Sit down.

300
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,030
Here.

301
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,030
It's hot.

302
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,550
I want water.

303
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,480
I'll get it for you.

304
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,720
I want water too.

305
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,240
Get it yourself.

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,510
Wait,

307
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,440
what's wrong with you?

308
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,920
Are you addicted to serving me?

309
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,350
When I paid you before,

310
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,480
you weren't

311
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,160
this attentive.

312
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,480
Are you pitying me now?

313
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,200
What are you talking about?

314
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,400
Haven't I

315
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,590
always been good to you?

316
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,070
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

317
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,680
You don't need to please me anymore.

318
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,310
Okay?

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm not going to enter the competition,

320
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,270
and I don't plan to open a studio.

321
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,750
I sincerely thank you

322
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
for pulling me out of my family,

323
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,830
but that doesn't mean

324
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,440
I'll do everything

325
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,400
you want.

326
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,590
With your ability,

327
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,920
you should find another job.

328
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,920
And by the way,

329
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,070
I don't want you to slow me down.

330
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,270
That's too much.

331
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,000
If it weren't for Xiaoyuan,

332
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
you would still be locked up

333
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,790
by Fan Xiaoxiao.

334
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,440
Does it mean I have to be grateful?

335
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,750
You guys,

336
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,790
can you talk calmly?

337
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,720
Xiaoyuan.

338
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,270
Go inside for a while.

339
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,070
Let me talk to him alone.

340
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,160
When Xiaoyuan saved you yesterday,

341
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,790
she mentioned

342
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,590
that she's willing to keep working
as your assistant

343
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,480
and open a studio with you.

344
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,070
If you don't want to do this,

345
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,270
why didn't you reject her at that time?

346
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,550
Opening a studio

347
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,880
is not that simple,

348
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,270
especially given my current situation.

349
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,350
If she works for me,

350
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,350
what future can she have?

351
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,070
She'd be better off

352
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
with a better team.

353
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,680
Looks like you know

354
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,880
what kind of situation you're in.

355
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,270
Xiaoyuan has been helping you.

356
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,510
Even knowing that you were ordered
by Fan Xiaoxiao

357
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,880
to monitor her,

358
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,270
she doesn't hold it against you.

359
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,790
Yet, this is how you treat her.

360
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,310
I hired Jiang Xiaoyuan

361
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,510
not at Fan Xiaoxiao's request.

362
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,790
Then at whose request?

363
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,310
You're in no position to ask me that.

364
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,790
Are you still playing dumb with me?

365
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,480
If we hadn't protected you,

366
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:27,790
how long do you think

367
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,790
your hard-earned freedom

368
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,510
would last?

369
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,480
Are you threatening me?

370
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,590
Yes.

371
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,830
I'm threatening you.

372
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm not Jiang Xiaoyuan.

373
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,440
I don't care about you.

374
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,110
If you have no value to me,

375
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,640
why should I get involved
in this mess to save you?

376
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,960
I saw Jiang Xiaoyuan's information

377
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,640
in the study

378
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,640
and guessed that Galaxy
might want to hire her.

379
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,030
So, I hired her

380
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,720
in advance,

381
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,400
thinking I could use her

382
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,590
to negotiate with my mom.

383
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,920
Was there anything else

384
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,000
in Fan Xiaoxiao's study?

385
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,920
I don't remember.

386
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,000
I just took it and left.

387
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,640
Do you really not know

388
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,510
why she's interested in Jiang Xiaoyuan?

389
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,480
I said I don't know.

390
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,310
I really don't know.

391
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Why are you so annoying?

392
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,590
Fine.

393
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,160
If you don't want to say it,
I won't force you.

394
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,310
But in this case,

395
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,720
you're of no value

396
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,640
to me.

397
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,200
I'll call

398
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,110
Fan Xiaoxiao now

399
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,270
and tell her to come over...

400
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,790
If you send me away,

401
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,480
how are you going to

402
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,400
tell Jiang Xiaoyuan?

403
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,550
Now you're talking about Jiang Xiaoyuan.

404
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,240
Aren't you unwilling

405
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,480
to open a studio with her?

406
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,590
I'm doing it for her good.

407
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,720
But it's up to her to decide

408
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,750
what's good for her.

409
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,270
Jiang Bo.

410
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,160
I agreed to get you out

411
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
only because you're still valuable

412
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,830
to her.

413
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,200
So, if she wants to

414
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
open a studio with you,

415
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,480
don't worry about anything else.

416
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,960
Just do it with her.

417
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,200
Really?

418
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,960
Aren't you afraid

419
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,550
that she will become
more attentive to me,

420
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,350
and I'll take your place?

421
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,550
If you're able to make that happen,

422
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,200
try it.

423
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,720
Have you finished talking?

424
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,510
Yes.

425
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,590
He agreed

426
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,480
to enter the competition

427
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,310
and open a studio with you.

428
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,510
Really?

429
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,400
That's great.

430
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,440
How did you convince him?

431
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,400
He's a masochist.

432
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,160
He's not used to
people being nice to him.

433
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,350
Being mean

434
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,590
instead works on him.

435
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,680
Then we need

436
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,510
to act quickly.

437
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,110
The deadline for the registration

438
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,030
is less than a month away.

439
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,790
Let me tell you what I think.

440
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,310
Sit down.

441
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,590
Qi Lian.

442
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,510
You can go to work.

443
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,550
I need to talk to him

444
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,350
about the studio.

445
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,720
Here is what I think.

446
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,270
There's no hurry.

447
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,790
We can...

448
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,790
We can talk together.

449
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,550
Let's consider it as the first meeting

450
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,000
of the partners.

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,880
Are you going to join us?

452
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
I guess someone
is getting ahead of himself.

453
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,830
Why don't you count me in?

454
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,200
You don't know about makeup.

455
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,350
Besides,

456
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,400
you're so busy with work.

457
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,350
You don't have time for that.

458
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,310
Do you have startup capital?

459
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,350
I do.

460
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,110
Xiaoyuan.

461
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,400
I have 500,000 yuan in it

462
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,200
and can invest it all.

463
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,350
I'll give you 20% of the shares
as technology stocks

464
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,720
and a salary of 5,000 yuan,

465
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,480
not including commissions.

466
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:08,920
What do you think?

467
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,310
Sounds good.

468
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,030
Should we come up with a name

469
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,440
for the studio?

470
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,350
Like

471
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,310
Qianhuan.

472
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,200
No, Wanfeng.

473
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,790
- How about Wanfeng?
- That sounds corny.

474
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,790
What do you think we should call it?

475
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Boyuan.

476
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,310
How about Bo Yuan?

477
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,830
I'm going to work.

478
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,480
What?

479
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,480
What's wrong with him?

480
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,720
Are you really not going to

481
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,590
let him join us?

482
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,270
No.

483
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,680
When a relationship

484
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,070
is mixed with interests,

485
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,310
it'll become impure.

486
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,350
Your emotions

487
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,510
will also be affected.

488
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,720
If two people

489
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,110
are in unequal positions,

490
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,110
their relationship will end
sooner or later.

491
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,750
What should we call

492
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,720
the studio?

493
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,000
It's just a name.

494
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,000
Any name will do.

495
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,920
It's not that easy to open a studio.

496
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,790
There are many things to consider.

497
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,400
But we got you.

498
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,830
You know what,

499
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,480
two people can work efficiently.

500
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm a genius.

501
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,550
Have you ever seen a genius

502
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,750
take care of such mundane matters?

503
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,070
I'm going to sleep.

504
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,960
You're on your own.

505
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Is all this my job?

506
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,270
This way.

507
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,920
30...

508
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,200
Hello?

509
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,310
Half a million yuan?

510
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,550
That's too expensive.

511
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,830
We have to think about it.

512
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,480
Thank you.

513
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,030
Okay.

514
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,160
Hurry up.

515
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,070
Why are you still standing here?

516
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,160
There are many shops

517
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,880
for us to check.

518
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,680
Hurry up.

519
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,160
We only have half a million yuan now.

520
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
After renting and decorating the shop,

521
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,070
and purchasing cosmetics,

522
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
there won't be much left.

523
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,200
If the studio doesn't get enough orders

524
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,790
after opening,

525
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,790
you'll soon

526
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,590
be unable

527
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,480
to afford my salary.

528
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,550
Although this studio

529
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,350
was set up

530
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,440
for the competition,

531
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,680
Mr. Jiang,

532
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,590
can you stop

533
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,110
doing nothing?

534
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,590
You have to think about the future.

535
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,550
I almost forgot something important.

536
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,400
To enter the competition as a studio,

537
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,240
we must have an invitation

538
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,440
from the organizer.

539
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,640
Do we still need an invitation?

540
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,510
Of course.

541
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,030
Do you think

542
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,880
any studio

543
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,550
can enter

544
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,440
such a prestigious competition?

545
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,590
Not to mention

546
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,750
that we haven't even completed
the paperwork yet.

547
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Do you think

548
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,310
they'll make an exception for us?

549
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,030
That means even though
we've set up a studio,

550
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,790
we're still not qualified

551
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,750
to enter the competition, right?

552
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,400
Yes.

553
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,750
That's why I want to remind you

554
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,200
about this.

555
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,000
There's a good chance

556
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,070
we'll be wasting our time.

557
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,400
It doesn't matter.

558
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,590
I'll take care of the paperwork

559
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,750
and find a way

560
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,920
to promote the studio.

561
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,240
Are you still in contact with
your old clients?

562
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,720
As for the invitation,

563
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,750
just do something about it.

564
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,240
My reputation isn't great right now.

565
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,830
Let's take it slow.

566
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,550
I'll try my best.

567
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,070
All right?

568
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
Don't just try your best.

569
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,400
You must get it.

570
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,110
Bro.

571
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
We have no money,

572
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
no resources,

573
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,790
and no reputation.

574
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,030
And we've made

575
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,160
such a powerful enemy as Fan Xiaoxiao.

576
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,110
Don't you know

577
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,550
how tough the road ahead is?

578
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,200
Let me treat you to something good

579
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,750
Waiter.

580
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,920

581
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,590

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,440
Okay, thank you.

583
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,000

[Menu]

585
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,590
It's too expensive.

586
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,720
Bro.

587
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,960
We're poor now.

588
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,880
How can we afford this?

589
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,310
Let's go.

590
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,590
Really?

591
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,880
[Accident Report]

592
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
This is the accident report

593
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,480
six years ago provided by the police.

594
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,880
Can you tell me

595
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,880
why you think that Fan Xiaoxiao

596
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,510
has something to do with Noah's death?

597
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,750
Because the sleeping pod

598
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,000
for the Lighthouse System

599
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,960
is in Fan Xiaoxiao's hands now.

600
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,000
It was the game pod of Noah's Ark

601
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,680
exposed a while ago.

602
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,110
She is still continuing

603
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,270
the experiment secretly.

604
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,830
How is it possible?

605
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,830
If she has the sleeping pod,

606
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,160
then what was it

607
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,000
that fell off the cliff back then?

608
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,070
The sleeping pod

609
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
was escorted by Noah in person.

610
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,030
If it had been switched,

611
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,270
he would have known.

612
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,510
There are so many possibilities.

613
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,400
Maybe the person in the car

614
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,440
wasn't Noah at all,

615
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,400
or perhaps

616
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,110
Noah was already murdered

617
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,270
before the accident.

618
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,240
Since Fan Xiaoxiao was able to

619
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,270
steal the sleeping pod

620
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,310
without being noticed

621
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,200
and leave no evidence behind,

622
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,550
she must have planned it in advance.

623
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,720
If Noah was killed by her,

624
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,440
it's terrifying.

625
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,160
I've been thinking about

626
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,110
how Fan Xiaoxiao became interested in

627
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,200
the Lighthouse System.

628
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,590
Could it be an insider

629
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,310
from the lab

630
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,550
colluding with her

631
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,640
to kill Noah?

632
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,880
That's impossible.

633
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,830
The people Noah hired

634
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,510
are always with professional integrity.

635
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,480
As for Fan Xiaoxiao,

636
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,550
she was just

637
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,070
an unknown editor at that time.

638
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,110
No one would think she had the ability

639
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,400
to acquire the Light Laboratory,

640
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,110
let alone collude with her.

641
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,720
(If it was not an insider,)

642
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,750
(could Fan Xiaoxiao also be a tester)

643
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
(and approached Noah)

644
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,920
(as a tester?)

645
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,440
Mr. Bai.

646
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,830
How many testers were recruited

647
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,960
for the Lighthouse system?

648
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,480
I'll try to find out.

649
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,590
You're back so late.

650
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,200
Why are you still up?

651
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,440
Are you still busy with the studio?

652
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,240
I just finished organizing the documents

653
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,000
and thought there was some time left,

654
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,720
so I looked into

655
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,790
how other studios operate.

656
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,350
Have you seen this type of chip before?

657
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,590
Yes.

658
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,830
This is a medical chip

659
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,960
produced by my former company.

660
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,200
The usage is just as

661
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,630
what's described here.

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,870
When implanted in the brain

663
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,390
and connected to
the central nervous system,

664
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,480
it can be used

665
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,960
to record neural signals.

666
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,790
Speaking of which,

667
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,630
Noah once applied a batch of such chips

668
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,280
from the head office,

669
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,240
intending to

670
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,310
implant them into future testers

671
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,680
for an upgrade

672
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,630
to the Lighthouse System.

673
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,310
Unfortunately,

674
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,960
he didn't get a chance to do anything

675
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,110
before the incident.

676
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,070
Where did you get this?

677
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,920
Do you know

678
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,070
how to remove it?

679
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,680
It's not hard.

680
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,590
You just have to wait for a year.

681
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,240
After a year,

682
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,590
the chip will automatically detach

683
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,150
from the nervous system.

684
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,520
With a minimally invasive procedure,

685
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,550
it can be taken out.

686
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,630
Is it that simple?

687
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,520
Won't it cause any harm

688
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,760
to the human body?

689
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,350
As long as it's done properly,

690
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,440
it's safe.

691
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
However, forcibly removing it

692
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,070
before detachment

693
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,200
might cause irreversible damage

694
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,790
to the nervous system.

695
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,630
The implanted person

696
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,920
must be careful

697
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,870
to avoid violent impacts,

698
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,680
preventing the chip
from being dislocated.

699
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,310
What's wrong?

700
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,790
Wait for me.

701
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,680
(I,)

702
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,680
(Jiang Xiaoyuan,)

703
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,830
(write down this pledge.)

704
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,440
(I owe Qi Lian a favor.)

705
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,070
(I'll do one thing)

706
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,760
(for him at any cost.)

707
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:31,870
(If I fail to do so,)

708
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,550
(I'll never be able to return home.)

709
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,390
I want you to fulfill my wish.

710
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,920
Can I join

711
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,830
your studio?

712
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,880
Now that you've taken it out,

713
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,520
do I have the option to reject you?

714
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,150
Why do you have to join us?

715
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,520
I don't want our relationship

716
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,800
to be tainted by interests.

717
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,920
I also invested in

718
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,190
Chen Fangzhou's hair salon.

719
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,270
I see your strength

720
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,920
and believe that your studio

721
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,960
will thrive in the future.

722
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,070
I'd like to take this chance
to be a major shareholder.

723
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,920
How great is it?

724
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,000
You're scheming.

725
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,150
Xiaoyuan.

726
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,880
I just don't want you to work too hard.

727
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,440
After some time,

728
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,800
everything will get better.

729
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,800

Please let me sleep, okay?

We woke him up.

Hurry up. Time to eat.

767
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,360
Hello.

768
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,190
(Jiang Xiaoyuan.)

769
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,550
(Mr. Jiang is drunk.)

770
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,710
Come and check him out.

771
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,110
Mr. Gao,

772
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,790
I can't drink anymore today.

773
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,310
Next time,
I'll drink to your heart's content.

774
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,080
Well,

775
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,360
what do you think about

776
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,520
the makeup I designed

777
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,630
for the ceremony last time?

778
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,750
It's quite good.

779
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,440
I've always recognized

780
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,840
your skills.

781
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,560
Mr. Gao.

782
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,710
Can you give me

783
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,520
an invitation of

784
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,400
the National Makeup Artist Competition?

785
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,270
Jiang.

786
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,440
Sorry about it.

787
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,480
I want to give you this opportunity,

788
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,040
but you also know

789
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,310
that I can't just

790
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,080
give out invitations

791
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,040
as I want.

792
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,000
Mr. Gao.

793
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,560
Didn't we agree last time

794
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,590
that you would consider it

795
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,400
as long as you're satisfied?

796
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,480
This invitation

797
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,710
is very important to me.

798
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,040
If you give me this opportunity,

799
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,480
I'll do all the work for you this year.

800
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,230
Jiang.

801
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,840
You're making me

802
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,630
to spell it out.

803
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,150
Ms. Fan has made it clear in the industry

804
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,920
that whoever gives you a chance

805
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,000
is going against Galaxy.

806
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,520
I'm happy to have you

807
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,480
design for me,

808
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,880
but it's not worth

809
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,360
getting involved in this mess for you.

810
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,110
Jiang Bo.

811
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,840
Don't touch me!

812
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,040
Who are you getting angry with?

813
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,920
Listen up, Jiang Bo,

814
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,150
if it weren't for your mom's sake,

815
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,630
I wouldn't even give you a chance

816
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,440
to drink with me!

817
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,040
Mr. Gao, right?

818
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,080
I remember you used to

819
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,310
fawn upon Jiang Bo a lot.

820
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,750
What's wrong?

821
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,110
You're so eager to hit a person
when he is down.

822
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,520
You indeed lack integrity.

823
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,040
Don't pull me.

824
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,440
What's wrong with you?

825
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,270
Why did you

826
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,590
beg him like that?

827
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Do you think I want to do that?

828
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm doing it

829
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,040
for us.

830
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,360
But I've reached out

831
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,630
to everyone I know,

832
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,230
and no one

833
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,110
is willing to give us an invitation.

834
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,670
Even if we need a chance,

835
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,790
we can't let others

836
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,520
treat you like this.

837
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:20,920
Fan Xiaoxiao

838
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,920
has backed me into a corner.

839
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,040
If you still want to
enter the competition,

840
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,270
you should stay away from me,

841
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,560
and there will be a slim chance.

842
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,960
How can you say that?

843
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,000
Do you still consider me as a friend?

844
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,110
Even if we can't enter the competition,

845
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,150
isn't it still your dream

846
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,400
