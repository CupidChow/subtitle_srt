[Game Tasks]
in all this time,

197
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,390
with so many tasks

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,320
assigned to me every day,

199
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,000
I've completed them all.

200
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,240
I've earned the final reward.

201
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,750
I can rebuild the logout channel.

202
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,360
Did the system tell you
to steal the data?

203
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,320
That's right.

204
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,120
Have you thought about

205
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,390
that there's something wrong
with the system and it's using you?

206
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,870
This is a virtual world,

207
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,720
Xiaoyuan.

208
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Virtual.

209
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,870
I designed this game.

210
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,360
All the details

211
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,510
and system tasks

212
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,720
were designed by me.

213
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,480
Do you understand?

214
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm the creator of this world.

215
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
Are you crazy?

216
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,600
If it asks you to kill people,

217
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,510
are you gonna do that?

218
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,750
Why don't you believe me?

219
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,630
Calm down.

220
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,790
Let's calm down.

221
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:28,910
Xiaoyuan.

222
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,720
Think about it.

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,630
Can you remember

224
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,630
the name of this game?

225
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Have you ever heard

226
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,360
the voice of the system?

227
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,750
How could I have heard it?

228
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
(Welcome to the Lighthouse System.)

229
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,320
(Creating a Channel for You.)

230
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,270
Do you remember now?

231
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,240
Xiaoyuan.

232
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,360
Do you remember it?

233
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,360
I knew it.

234
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,600
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

235
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,150
Listen,

236
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,390
in this world,

237
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,120
you're the only one

238
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,750
who can understand me.

239
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,750
Let me think about it.

240
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
Let me think about it.

241
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,200
Go ahead.

242
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,200
We're...

243
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,200
We're

244
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,960
in your sleeping capsules.

245
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,790
There is a malfunction.

246
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,960
If there's a malfunction,
there should be people to save me.

247
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,150
Even if to shut it down and reboot it,

248
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,630
there should be people to save me.

249
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,030
It can't be shut down.

250
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,000
The system's been cut off

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,840
by a virus.

252
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,030
Shutting it down
will only make it more dangerous.

253
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,510
Cut off

254
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,510
by whom?

255
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,550
The system virus.

256
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,150
I've been racing against it every day.

257
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,790
We need to get out of here

258
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,750
before he catches up with me.

259
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,150
Do you know

260
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,360
how to do it?

261
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,720
Of course.

262
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,270
What is it?

263
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,200
Suicide.

264
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,910
What are you talking about?

265
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,440
Right here.

266
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,870
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

267
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,630
Right here.

268
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,670
I know I made a mistake.

269
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,440
When...

270
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,120
When I was coding,

271
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
I missed a suicide function,

272
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,790
but I've fixed it

273
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,750
these days.

274
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,440
As long as we jump

275
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:49,870
in a certain place,

276
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,390
right here.

277
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,630
Right here.

278
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,720
If we jump down

279
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,240
to that place...

280
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,150
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

281
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,360
It won't hurt.

282
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,960
Let go of me.

283
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,000
Let go of me!

284
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,240
Let's jump down and it will be over.

285
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,550
[Qi Lian]

286
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,790
Xiaoyuan, hold on.

287
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,790
I'll be right there.

288
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,910
(I'll give you)

289
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,390
(the truth you want.)

290
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,400
[Qi Lian]

291
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,920
I can't believe you told our secret

292
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,830
to the virus.

293
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,920
How could you...?

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,830
How could you

295
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
tell our secret to the virus?

296
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,110
Qi Lian is not the virus.

297
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:16,920
He's not.

298
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,240
We don't have much time, Jiang Xiaoyuan.

299
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
It will be too late when he comes.

300
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,070
Let's go!

301
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,030
Qi Lian?

302
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,160
Why are you here?

303
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,440
Huo Boyu.

304
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,200
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

305
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,200
Xiaoyuan, run!

306
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm only giving you one chance.

307
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,310
Tell me

308
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,070
where Xu Jingyang is.

309
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,200
I...

310
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

311
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,720
All I know is

312
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,270
if I don't...

313
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
If I don't kill you,

314
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,270
both of us will die.

315
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,350
Fine.

316
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,070
Let me rephrase my question.

317
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,590
What's your relationship

318
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,750
with Guangming Laboratory?

319
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,920
Do you know about the Lighthouse System?

320
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,350
Exposed.

321
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,550
You're exposed.

322
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,790
How do you know about
the lighthouse system?

323
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,000
Lighthouse System

324
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,160
is the name of Huo Boyu's game.

325
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,480
How did you know that?

326
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,790
Xu Jingyang

327
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,030
told me that name.

328
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,480
Liar.

329
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,880
You're lying.

330
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,160
There's no non-player character

331
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,830
named Xu Jingyang.

332
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,750
Don't you get it?

333
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,880
He's just using you

334
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,680
to lure me out.

335
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,830
Let go of him.

336
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,720
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

337
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,350
I don't know

338
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,590
which one of you is telling the truth,

339
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,790
but if I have to choose,

340
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,590
I choose to believe Huo Boyu.

341
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
What we want

342
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,920
has never been the same.

343
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,550
I won't trust you anymore.

344
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,160
Jiang Xiaoyuan, calm down.

345
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,680
Don't come any closer.

346
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,160
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

347
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,640
If it's about the Lighthouse System,

348
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,350
I can explain.

349
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,480
I want to go home.

350
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
He wants to go home too.

351
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,550
We belong to the same world.

352
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,350
Xiaoyuan.

353
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,920
Jump now, or it will be too late.

354
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,790
Qi Lian.

355
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Thank you.

356
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,310
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

357
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,840
[Bo Yu Advertising]

358
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,750
Miss.

359
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,070
You're awake.

360
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,110
Mr. Xu.

361
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,510
It's great.

362
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,110
I'm glad you're awake.

363
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,400
It's great. Have some water.

364
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
Your father knows about

365
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,880
what happened to you two.

366
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,440
He's rushed back from abroad.

367
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,240
Me two?

368
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,590
Me and who?

369
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,510
Mr. Huo.

370
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,960
Have you forgotten?

371
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,110
You and Mr. Huo

372
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,000
were trapped in the game capsules

373
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,920
for a whole week

374
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,960
before waking up.

375
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,680
Huo Boyu?

376
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Is he awake?

377
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,480
I have to go check on him.

378
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,510
Miss.

379
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,920
No, Miss.

380
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,270
Mr. Huo hasn't woken up yet.

381
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,070
Besides,

382
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
we should listen to the doctor.

383
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,640
You need to rest for a while.

384
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,400
No matter how urgent it is,

385
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,440
you can do it later.

386
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,160
All right?

387
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,750
Listen to me.

388
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,480
Come on.

389
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,750
Slowly.

390
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,440
You should

391
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,510
get some sleep first.

392
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,200
I'll prepare lunch for you.

393
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,590
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

394
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,270
You can't escape.

395
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,110
Jiang Xiaoyuan.

396
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,960
I told you

397
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,070
you can't escape.

398
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,800
[Luoshan Hospital]

399
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,720
[Luoshan Hospital]

400
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,480
Other than

401
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,200
a few soft tissue bruises,

402
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,480
there's nothing serious

403
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,110
She's quite lucky.

404
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,310
From what I see,

405
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,000
the patient's mental state is not good.

406
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,270
I suggest a psychological intervention.

407
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,270
After that,

408
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,880
don't let the patient be alone.

409
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,400
Okay.

410
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,480
I'll keep that in mind.

411
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Huo Boyu has been arrested

412
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,590
by the police.

413
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,830
If you have any questions,

414
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,240
you can ask me.

415
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,070
What are you going to do with me?

416
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,550
You got what you wanted.

417
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,440
I'm of no use to you anymore, am I?

418
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,350
How would viruses

419
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,480
deal with us?

420
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm not a virus.

421
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,310
How can I

422
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
trust you now?

423
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,590
Xiaoyuan.

424
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,790
You jumped down.

425
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Haven't you realized

426
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,880
that everything Huo Boyu said
is not true?

427
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,440
There's no such channel

428
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,440
that can take you home.

429
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,160
If the police hadn't prepared it
in advance,

430
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,350
you'd probably be dead by now.

431
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,550
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

432
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
The channel didn't work because of you!

433
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,590
I shouldn't have come to you!

434
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,160
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

435
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,400
I should've left you here!

436
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,590
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

437
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,400
Take him into the car.

438
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,160
I hate you, Jiang Xiaoyuan!

439
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,070
You should rot here

440
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,680
and die here!

441
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,720
If it weren't for you,

442
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,160
how would the channel not work?

443
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,790
Why do you

444
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,920
still believe Huo Boyu?

445
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,550
If I don't believe him,
should I believe you?

446
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,350
I don't even know

447
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,070
what you said is true

448
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,590
and what you said is false.

449
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,960
If you want to set me up,

450
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,830
I can't even fight back.

451
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,720
When have I ever set you up?

452
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,310
You haven't?

453
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,830
Then how did you find me?

454
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,750
Do you dare to say

455
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,750
you didn't bring the police there?

456
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,480
Maybe when you came to the salon

457
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,160
to see me,

458
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,750
they were already

459
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,880
listening in.

460
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,680
And Mr. Xu.

461
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,920
It's just your word.

462
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,790
No one can prove

463
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,960
that he existed.

464
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,070
How do I know

465
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,550
that you didn't make it up
to deceive me?

466
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,000
I admit.

467
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,680
I admit

468
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,790
that I had been following you

469
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,550
since you got in the taxi,

470
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,000
but it was because

471
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,240
I was worried about your safety.

472
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,880
Xiaoyuan.

473
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
Give me some more time.

474
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,240
I'll find out the truth

475
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,310
about Guangming Laboratory,

476
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Lighthouse System,

477
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,590
and Xu Jingyang.

478
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,270
I'll find out everything.

479
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,790
Xiaoyuan.

480
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,160
Xiaoyuan.

481
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,880
Xiaoyuan.

482
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,510
Jiang Xiaoyuan!

483
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,440
Doctor!

484
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,160
Doctor!

485
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,400
(The channel didn't work
because of you!)

486
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,400
(I shouldn't have come to you!)

487
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,880
Boyu is useless now.

488
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,550
Make him disappear.

489
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,310
You're awake.

490
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,310
How do you feel?

491
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,550
There's porridge in it.

492
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,830
Have some if you're hungry.

493
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,160
When can I go back?

494
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,400
How can I go back?

495
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,630
Do you want to

496
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,920
keep me here forever?

497
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,960
I know you want to go back.

498
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,150
Everything I promised you

499
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,000
still counts.

500
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,710
Give me a month.

501
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,070
One month later,

502
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,710
I'll give you an answer

503
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,000
no matter what.

504
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,670
I don't want to see you this month.

505
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,840
[Contract]
From now on,

506
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,150
we have a partnership.

507
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,400
The equal partnership you want.

508
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,800
Since I promised you

509
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,320
to send you back,

510
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,840
I won't go back on my word.

511
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,190
I think

512
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,360
you should stop

513
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,230
getting involved in the investigation.

514
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,230
You're their target.

515
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,190
With you,

516
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,480
we may

517
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,480
never find the truth.

518
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,630
You felt upset

519
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,760
and had that guy keep an eye on me.

520
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,480
I put up with it.

521
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm not interested

522
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,230
in your emotional entanglements

523
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,400
with that Jiang Xiaoyuan.

524
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,550
But Qi Lian,

525
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,590
if you're going to

526
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,550
waste my time

527
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,590
dealing with her ex-boyfriend,

528
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,280
I don't have to

529
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,550
keep my word with you.

530
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,190
I've been trying to find

531
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,360
Xiaoyuan's ex-boyfriend,

532
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,710
and I've waited for him for days.

533
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,760
But this matter

534
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,150
is not as simple as you think.

535
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,710
I suspect he has something to do

536
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,920
with we're investigating.

537
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,280
Maybe

538
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,000
that Jiang Xiaoyuan's ex-boyfriend

539
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,280
is her accomplice.

540
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,920
They went out of their way

541
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,230
to steal my life,

542
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,960
and Xu Jingyang

543
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,840
who you've been looking for

544
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,320
is the mastermind behind all this.

545
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,840
In fact,

546
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,480
you don't care about

547
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,280
if I can go back or not,

548
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,760
right?

549
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,840
You've been so concerned

550
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,280
about Huo Boyu

551
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,190
only because you want to prove

552
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,230
that you're right.

553
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,230
Exposed.

554
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,400
You're exposed.

555
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,480
How do you know about
the lighthouse system?

556
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,670
Lighthouse System

557
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,960
is the name of Huo Boyu's game.

558
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,190
How did you know that?

559
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,670
Don't you get it?

560
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,480
He's just using you

561
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,510
to lure me out.

562
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,510
What we want

563
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,710
has never been the same.

564
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,360
I won't trust you anymore.

565
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,400
Though we have the same goal,

566
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,280
and you promised to send me home,

567
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,920
we're still from two different worlds.

568
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,400
You're not really doing this

569
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,550
for me.

570
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,230
Xiaoyuan.

571
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,280
It's okay.

572
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,150
It's okay.

573
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
What happened?

574
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,480
Qi Lian didn't tell me

575
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,710
why you're in the hospital.

576
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,840
He just told me

577
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,030
