00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,940
- Alright
- Alright!

195
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,620
Fifteen, twenty.

196
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,780
Come on, once more.

197
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,500
What do you mean?

198
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,340
You'll find out soon enough.

199
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,580
It's up to you two now.

200
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,660
Come on.

201
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,140
Hello.

202
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,180
Why are you here?

203
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,780
What now?

204
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,100
You don't recognize me?

205
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,980
Why didn't you contact me?

206
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,340
Didn't we agree?

207
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,140
You were supposed to call me.

208
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,100
Don't blame me for checking up

209
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,060
on your new boyfriend.

210
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,860
He's not as innocent as he seems.

211
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,940
Let go of me.

212
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,260
He had a scandal with this girl

213
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,940
a couple of years ago.

214
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,540
They were even caught on camera at a bar.

215
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,620
We just found out.

216
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,700
So his alcohol allergy

217
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,700
and the innocent act are all fake.

218
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,740
You made me call him over

219
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,220
on purpose, didn't you?

220
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,820
Why?

221
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,540
Even if I told you in advance,

222
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,340
you wouldn't believe it anyway.

223
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,100
You've seen what you needed to see.

224
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,580
It's up to you

225
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,420
how to handle it.

226
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,220
Just call me.

227
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,220
Tell me.

228
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,060
You call me and I'll certainly be there.

229
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,460
Are you even listening to me?

230
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Don't push me.

231
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:02,940
You...

232
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,740
You made the mess.

233
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,300
Clean it up by yourself.

234
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,420
Xiaoyuan.

235
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,020
This isn't what you think it is.

236
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,260
What do you mean?

237
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,260
It's exactly what you think it is.

238
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,580
You slept with me.

239
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,340
How can you deny it?

240
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,620
Stop acting.

241
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,900
I've seen your tricks a million times.

242
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,940
You know his family

243
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,980
runs an advertising agency.

244
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,420
Do you think

245
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,380
having scandalous photos

246
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,020
with him

247
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,180
would help you climb the ladder?

248
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,060
Get lost!

249
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,940
Xiaoyuan.

250
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,340
Xiaoyuan.

251
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,740
It's not what you think.

252
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,060
Really.

253
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,100
Xiaoyuan.

254
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,580
I've sorted everything out.

255
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,140
But she and I…

256
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,700
Bring my car over.

257
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,700
Why do you think

258
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,180
they were just making fake news?

259
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,220
You actually trust Huo Boyu?

260
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,700
For people like us,

261
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,220
the last thing we trust is people.

262
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,420
His advertising agency

263
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,380
got 70 percent of its orders

264
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,580
all because of my referrals.

265
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,980
I'm sure

266
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
he wouldn't dare betray me.

267
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,020
Xiaoyuan.

268
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,300
Are you hungry?

269
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,420
Let's grab something to eat

270
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,620
before we go back.

271
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,660
Do you really like me?

272
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,020
Of course, I do.

273
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,620
Xiaoyuan.

274
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,700
I really have nothing to do with her.

275
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,860
[Lighthouse System Activation
in 02d 12h 23m]

276
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,100
Go ahead.

277
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,940
Mr. Xu,

278
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,460
even my dad won't interfere with me

279
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,420
so much like you.

280
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,460
Ms. Jiang.

281
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm just conveying Mr. Jiang's words.

282
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,740
He hopes that you can be in charge

283
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,260
of the project that Jiang Group

284
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,740
gave Boyu Advertising Company.

285
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:04,940
You need something?

286
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,540
No, just go ahead.

287
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,460
[Mr. Xu]

288
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,060
Have a seat.

289
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,300
It's not like I have a job to do.

290
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,100
You are the busy one, not me.

291
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,220
How's the café been doing lately?

292
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,060
It's improved a lot.

293
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,980
Xiaoyuan.

294
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,180
That strategy you taught me

295
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,060
works wonders.

296
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,580
Really?

297
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,340
Ever since those influencers came,

298
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,380
my place has been bustling.

299
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
I even launched a few

300
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,820
trendy coffees.

301
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,020
Thanks to you,

302
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,500
sales have skyrocketed.

303
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,220
That's just a small favor.

304
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,820
Don't mention it.

305
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,100
Xiaoyuan.

306
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,620
I want to discuss something with you.

307
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm thinking of opening a branch

308
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,420
to expand the business.

309
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,340
What do you think?

310
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,380
Great idea.

311
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,500
If you want, just do it.

312
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,420
I'll help you

313
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,060
with the financial aspect.

314
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,780
It's not about that.

315
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,700
I've been negotiating

316
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,380
with the business district recently.

317
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,300
If I can secure

318
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,140
a few afternoon tea orders
for business events,

319
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
the funds will be sufficient.

320
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,020
Enjoy yourself.

321
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,980
I'll go get busy.

322
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:04,980
Rui.

323
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,780
Since your café is profitable,

324
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,780
don't wear these fakes anymore.

325
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,420
It's easy to tell

326
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,620
whether it's genuine or fake

327
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,460
just by looking at it.

328
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,300
If I'm in charge of the ad campaign,

329
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,420
does that mean

330
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,060
I have the final say

331
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,460
on the afternoon tea supplier?

332
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,340
Why does today's cake

333
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,420
taste so sour?

334
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,060
Yeah.

335
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Why did they change

336
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,580
the afternoon tea supplier again?

337
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,820
The last one

338
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,580
was pretty good.

339
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,580
It was Ms. Jiang's recommendation.

340
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,340
No wonder.

341
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,340
But how can a private tea supplier

342
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,540
compare

343
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,340
to major brand suppliers?

344
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,460
Exactly.

345
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,020
The presentation and taste

346
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,420
are just so-so.

347
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,220
What have you been up to lately?

348
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,580
Maybe we should switch it up.

349
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,500
Ms. Jiang,

350
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,700
Ms. Jiang.

351
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,580
This color scheme is too bland.

352
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,740
We need contrasting colors.

353
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,740
Okay, I'll take care of it.

354
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,660
Rui,

355
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,620
you're here.

356
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,700
Here's a new scarf for you.

357
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,700
No need for that.

358
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Just take it.

359
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,700
In a bit,

360
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,220
I'll ask people from the other projects

361
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,540
to take down your contact.

362
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,420
They'll order from you
when they want afternoon teas.

363
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,500
Actually, all I needed

364
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,820
was a chance to compete in a taste test.

365
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Silly girl.

366
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,780
It's my family company.

367
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
I call the shots.

368
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,460
You look tired.

369
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,380
I'll have Boyu

370
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,660
take you home in a while.

371
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,380
No need to trouble Boyu.

372
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,140
I can take a taxi myself.

373
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,060
Happy to oblige.

374
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,540
Ms. Jiang.

375
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,580
Wait a minute.

376
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,220
That settles it.

377
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,340
Boyu,

378
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,460
when can we end

379
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,860
being sneaky?

380
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,580
Soon.

381
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,220
I promise.

382
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Once your branch opens,

383
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,540
you'll be your own boss.

384
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,540

why are you here at this hour?

You left your scarf at the event.

391

I forgot it.

399
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,940

401

402
