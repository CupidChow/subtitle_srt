1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,180
Young Master, I've packed your luggage for you.

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,960
Brother, why are you leaving so early?

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,880
Isn't your flight in the afternoon?

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,340
I want to go out for a while,

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,560
there are some places I'd like to visit.

6
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,479
Don't tell me you even know about postpartum care.

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,250
What does it feel like to lose your memory?

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,760
Mr. Tong, it's almost time.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,130
We should get going.

10
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,200
Dahuan,

11
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,450
goodbye.

12
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,880
Daxi.

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,440
Daxi.

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Daxi, stop right there.

15
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,000
Daxi.

16
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
Daxi.

17
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
Here's the shipping manifest for this quarter.

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
Take a careful look at it.

19
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,530
And this one too.

20
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,960
I'll go answer the phone.

21
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,760
Hello.

22
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
Hello, are you a family member of Tong Sheng?

23
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,800
Who?

24
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,380
Do you know Tong Sheng?

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,490
May I ask who you are?

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,840
This is the City Hospital.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,800
A gentleman has had an accident

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
and was brought to the emergency room.

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,840
He can't remember anything,

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,200
except for your phone number.

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,730
Could you please come over?

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,000
Who are you?

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,220
You remember my phone number,

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,170
but don't know who I am, Tongsheng?

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,120
Tongsheng?

36
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,280
Are you saying

37
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
my name is Tongsheng?

38
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,660
You don't remember me,

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm Dahuan.

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,200
Dahuan?

41
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,100
You really don't remember me?

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I don't remember.

43
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,160
But for some reason,

44
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,360
when I hear that name,

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,440
I feel sad.

46
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,240
Did anything bad

47
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
happen between us?

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,560
No.

49
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Everything that happened between us

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,080
was beautiful.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,900
Things I'll never forget for the rest of my life.

52
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Hey, Tong'an.

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
Tongsheng had an accident,

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,240
he's at the city hospital now.

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,770
What? We've been looking everywhere for him.

56
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,840
It seems he's lost his memory again.

57
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,100
Lost his memory again.

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,320
Take him somewhere safe first.

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Take him home first,

60
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,440
I'll come pick him up right away.

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,900
Don't make a fuss about it.

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,200
Okay.

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,250
You really don't have any impression,

64
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,160
don't remember anything at all?

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,680
I only remember

66
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,140
someone named Jin Dahuan seems to live here.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Why do you only remember her?

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,000
She must be

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,659
someone very important to me.

70
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,600
Brother.

71
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,690
Brother.

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,320
Your family is here to pick you up,

73
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
go with them now.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,520
No,

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
they're bad people,

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,570
I don't want to go with them.

77
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,360
Tongshen.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
Don't worry, I'll go find him.

79
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Hey.

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
Sister, good news,

81
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
they've found Daxi.

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,080
What?

83
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,800
Who?

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,640
Daxi?

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,700
Where is he?

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,530
He's already gone home.

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560
Daxi!

88
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,440
You're alive!

89
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,320
It's good you're back.

90
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,800
May I ask who you are?

91
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,800
You've lost your memory?

92
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm your sister, don't you remember?

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,290
I don't know who I am either.

94
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,120
However,

95
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,540
someone asked me to bring you something.

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,380
Dahuan, I hope I didn't scare you.

97
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
I don't know how

98
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
to tell you this.

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,200
But everyone wanted to give you a surprise.

100
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,560
Why are you being so hesitant?

101
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,640
Get to the point already.

102
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,280
Be quiet.

103
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,740
He's the main character here, let him speak.

104
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
Yes, that's right.

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,960
The person standing before you is Jin Daxi.

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,200
But it seems he's lost his memory.

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,730
But that's okay.

108
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
He'll definitely remember eventually.

109
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,520
After all, we've had some experience with this sort of thing.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
What on earth is going on?

111
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Daxi!

112
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,280
Don't run away, don't you recognize me?

113
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,680
We've been trying to contact his family,

114
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,320
but he was found on the shore

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,860
with no identification whatsoever.

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,400
And he developed amnesia after the drowning incident.

117
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,130
Fortunately, the brain damage isn't too severe.

118
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,920
With proper rest for a while,

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,560
he should gradually recover.

120
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,420
That's basically the situation.

121
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,690
But why are you here?

122
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
Of course I had to come.

123
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,559
And I want to know,

124
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
all those things that should and shouldn't be said,

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,260
how do you plan to tell Dahuan?

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
I actually have a good idea,

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,559
would you like to hear it?

128
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,200
I think we should

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,050
give Sister Dahuan a surprise.

130
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,120
Surprise? What surprise?

131
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,180
We're going to put on a show together,

132
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
and I'm the director.

133
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm not just directing,

134
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm acting in it too.

135
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
I want in too!

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,840
Big brother,

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
give me a role, please.

138
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,840
What does this have to do with you?

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,600
Mind your own business. You do your part, I'll do mine.

140
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,520
Come on,

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,560
please.

142
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,880
That's it.

143
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Fine.

144
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,290
I'll take it.

145
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
You're cheating.

146
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
How am I cheating?

147
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,320
I have something too.

148
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Though I'm not sure

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,440
if this will end up being a surprise or a shock.

150
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,040
But

151
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
everyone is looking forward to it.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
You're getting this information,

153
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,340
especially...

154
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,200
Da Huan,

155
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,320
I thought

156
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,370
we'd never have a chance to be together again,

157
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,810
but I never expected

158
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,540
heaven would give me another chance,

159
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,040
so would you be willing to start over with me?
