1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,520
I still can't defeat the Tong family.

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,440
Chang Ming.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,920
I treated you like my own brother.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,960
Just like Dong'an.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,240
We're family.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,820
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,960
Family.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,760
In the company,

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,300
I don't even dare to call you brother.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,200
You call this family?

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,840
And when we were young,

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,440
When we were little, the three of us went out to play.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,570
and caused trouble.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,960
You always scold me first.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,000
You call this family.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,400
And the name Changming.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,840
It was found by the orphanage

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
after they picked me up.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,289
I hate the person who abandoned me.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
I hate this name so much.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,380
I begged you many times to change my surname to Tong.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,289
You always use various excuses to stop me.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,440
You said, "Don't forget your notebook."

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,810
I don't want others to misunderstand.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,160
This is called family.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
And this house.

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,720
are everywhere.

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,120
all over the place.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Is there one of me?

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,960
Do you have a photo of me?

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,640
I don't have any.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
You call this a family?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll serve you tea.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
Open the door.

35
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,320
You call this a family?

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,520
Do you know what people say about me?

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,079
They said I'm a dog of your Tong family.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
I'll serve

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,960
whoever you ask me to.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,160
I'll bite whoever you want me to bite.

41
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,079
Tell me.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,400
We're a family.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,000
Chang Ming.

44
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,760
It seems that

45
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,520
you've suppressed too much resentment.

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,040
Yes, why?

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
Why am I always wrong?

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,600
Why should I be inferior?

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,240
Why do I only want to prove myself

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
but you never acknowledge me?

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
And you, a child.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,900
In terms of education and experience, Iâ€™m better than you.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,240
Wanqi Group has such a good opportunity.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
to save Wanqi Group.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
Do you think I don't know

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,640
You think I don't know?

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
You secretly transferred all my people away.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
You just want to kick me away?

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,410
In terms of cruelty,

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,400
you're no better.

61
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,280
When I was in the company,

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
I told you countless times

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,260
Don't call me Mr. Tong.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,930
You want to prove yourself.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,570
You said I transferred people around you.

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Have you ever thought about why?

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,570
They are all in our new company.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,410
Do you know who's in charge of the new company?

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,200
I made a will long ago.

70
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,600
All my assets

71
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,640
to my four sons.

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,940
But what about you?

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,800
After I found out that you wanted to harm the child,

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,360
I gave you chances again and again.

75
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,840
But you chose the cruelest way

76
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
the cruelest way.

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Chang Ming.

78
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,600
Do you remember when I went to the orphanage ten years ago,

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,400
I saw a little boy being bullied.

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,480
He was holding something tightly.

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
I chased away the people who bullied him.

82
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
I found that he was protecting

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,760
in his arms.

84
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,940
You told me you didn't want to stay in the orphanage.

85
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,760
If you want to go with me,

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,760
you can do anything.

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,280
I've treated you like my own child all these years.

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
Why?

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,040
Back then, a loving child

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
has become so cruel.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Go.

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm no longer your family.

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Chang Ming, I've called the police.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,640
They are on their way.

95
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,600
living in a big house and driving a luxury car.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,120
This has been your dream since you were young.

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm just talking.

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,560
You really don't want to be rich?

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,400
Of course.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,920
I can't leave you alone.

101
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,920
I promised them when our parents left.

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,380
to take care of each other.

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
You mean that boy?

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,159
That's strange.

105
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,080
After I regained my memory,

106
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,740
he's like a different person.

107
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,360
He doesn't even come out to talk to you.

108
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,680
Is this brain formatted again?

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Not even you.

110
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,240
Who knows?

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,240
Maybe

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,300
he remembers he has 800 girlfriends.

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,120
We might never meet again.

114
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,600
You're right.

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,660
I don't want to see him.

116
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,360
Sister, wait for me at the door.

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
I left something at their house.

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,240
I'll go get it. I'll be back soon.

119
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,159
Sister.

120
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,409
I'm not blaming you.

121
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,159
I lived with him a few days ago.

122
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,159
Didn't you notice that he wasn't me?

123
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,140
The doctor said you...

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,159
No.

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
The doctor said he lost his memory.

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,200
How can I tell?

127
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,260
Did anything happen between you two?

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
I heard about it.

130
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
He went to your company

131
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,080
in front of your colleagues.

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,800
Don't mention it.

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,850
He even rode a tricycle to pick me up from work.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,880
My colleagues thought he was my boyfriend.

135
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,760
I explained it for a long time.

136
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,090
What if he doesn't want to explain?

137
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
What did you say?

138
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,220
I said I don't want you to explain.

139
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,760
Don't you understand?

140
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,200
We might never meet again.

141
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,200
You're right.

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,840
I don't care.

143
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
Do me a favor. Let's change our identities.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
I need to talk to your sister.

145
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
No wonder you look weird today.

146
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,920
Kim Dae-hwan.

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
I like you.

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,080
I don't like you

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
It's not like a friend likes you.

150
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,400
You have the same face as Daxi.

151
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
I grew up with Daxi.

152
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,080
I never thought

153
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,799
treat you like a normal man.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,159
Think of it that way.

155
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,290
Let's start dating this month.

156
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,680
Let's see

157
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,410
not treat me like your brother.

158
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,340
If it doesn't work, return it.

159
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,520
Return?

160
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,480
So you just rejected me?

161
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,540
I'll take that as a yes.

162
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,720
Itâ€™s a deal.

163
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,320
Let's go. Daxi is waiting for us at home.
