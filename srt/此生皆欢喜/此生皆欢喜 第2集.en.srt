1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,560
Stop drinking. Your face is all red,

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
you must be drunk.

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,040
Must be.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,360
Should I even be here this late at night?

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,720
If it weren't for you,

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,920
I'd be in bed sleeping right now.

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
I'll pay you back.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,760
With what?

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,400
Making money should be pretty easy for me.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,320
Easy?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,240
I think you've hit your head too hard.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,900
Have you paid your electricity bill?

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,600
No.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,980
My name is Jin Daxi.

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
Why am I here?

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
And those photos.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,120
Did I have a dream,

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,800
or did I hit my head?

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
No, I need to go out and see.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,170
Bro, what are you doing?

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,280
I...

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,780
You want to get some fresh air?

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,039
Yes.

24
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,000
You should've said so earlier. I'll take you.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,460
Isn't the door over there?

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
I disappeared for three days

27
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,520
and Jin Dahuan didn't even bother to call me.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,760
Bro, which car do you want to drive today?

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Which car?

30
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,610
These...

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,180
All these are mine?

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,810
Yes, they all belong to you.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,490
Here, use any card you want.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,320
Never mind.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,160
You just had an accident, I'd better drive you.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,360
Bro, why are you standing there? Get in.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,760
Whatever, might as well enjoy this nice dream.

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,290
Let's go.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
This doesn't look very nutritious.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,280
I haven't even started on you yet,

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
spending money recklessly.

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,880
You studied law.

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
When exactly are you

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,100
going to get your memory back?

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,420
I graduated with a law degree.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Then why are you working as a receptionist?

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
Because I want to.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,320
You don't seem to enjoy this job.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,260
Would you mind your own business?

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,850
It's because you didn't pass the bar exam, right?

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm discriminated against for having a vocational degree,

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,880
even with a license, no firm would hire me,

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,480
so I can only work as a receptionist. Happy now?

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,760
Why just a vocational degree?

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,890
Is it because you're not smart enough?

56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,290
Food isn't enough to shut you up, is it?

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Let me tell you, I've tried my best.

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,690
I'm going to cram school after dinner.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,579
I don't think that will help much.

60
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
Where are you going?

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,200
Go to hell.

62
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,040
Don't worry, I'll pay you back.

63
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, thanks for nothing.

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,680
Coming!

65
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Why the long face?

66
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,460
Things didn't go well.

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,300
My brother didn't die.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
He's in the hospital now.

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,600
You're just an adopted son and you still call him brother?

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,160
Mr. Qi,

71
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,060
if you're not helping, keep your mouth shut.

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,120
Fine, Mr. Chang,

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
do whatever you want.

74
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,250
Are you off work?

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,159
I ordered food

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
for when you get home.

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay, I'll be home soon.

78
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Hey beautiful, all alone?

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
We've been watching you for a while.

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,600
How about giving us your number?

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,530
Who are you guys?

82
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,360
My brother here likes you

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,760
and wants you to join us for drinks.

84
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,720
So what do you say? Come have a drink with us?

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,650
What do you want?

86
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
Isn't it obvious what we want?

87
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,800
I'll call the police if you don't stop.

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Call the police?

89
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,040
How will you do that without your phone?

90
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,640
Trying to pick up girls, huh?

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
That requires some investment.

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,850
Look at how you're all dressed,

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,520
and you're trying to act like thugs.

94
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,920
Playing the hero, are we?

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,240
Bro, I think that's Young Master Qi.

96
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,800
Let's

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,320
go.

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,250
Let's go, hurry!

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Everyone's gone.

100
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,320
Are you okay?

101
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,840
Mr. Qi.

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,120
You know me?

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,300
I remember now,

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,760
you're the receptionist at my company, right?

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,960
Why aren't you going home yet?

106
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,760
Who are you?

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,860
Where's my sister?

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,140
I'm looking for my sister.

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,800
Your sister is taking a shower.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,980
Don't come out this late anymore,

111
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,000
there are too many bad people out there,

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
you're lucky you ran into me today.

113
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,090
Thank you so much for today, Mr. Qi.

114
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,760
It's the first time someone has thanked me.

115
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Alright, you go inside and rest,

116
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I'll head out now.

117
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,520
Hello?

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
Daxi?

119
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,640
Why is Daxi's phone

120
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,280
in the same location as mine?

121
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,760
Why are you out again?

122
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,690
Mr. Qi, something might have happened to my brother.

123
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,900
Let's go, I'll come with you to check.

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
No one will ever bully you again.

125
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,240
You're saying the scholar has a brother

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,920
who's been lost for many years?

127
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,800
This is getting complicated.

128
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
Another person has shown up.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
Originally, if you eliminated the scholar,

130
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
you'd only have the simple-minded Tong An left,

131
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
but now there's another one,

132
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,620
so the difficulty has increased.

133
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,220
Well, what are you planning to do now?

134
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
Fine, figure it out yourself.

135
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm going out for some fresh air.

136
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,760
Leave Jin Daxi to me.

137
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,570
Alright, please wait a moment.

138
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,120
Mr. Qi,

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
you forgot your clothes last night.

140
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
How's your brother doing?

141
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,880
He's fine now.

142
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
140,000 for Sheng Department Store.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,960
Wait for me after work, I'll drive you home.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,020
It's settled then.

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,850
Your place has a nice environment.

146
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,080
I didn't notice much last night,

147
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
it's almost like a botanical garden.

148
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,540
This is my parents' house.

149
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,020
Are your parents living with you now?

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
They've passed away.

151
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,080
Daxi.

153
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,680
Mr. Qi, this is my brother Daxi.

154
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,130
Brother?

155
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,620
Who says I'm your brother?

156
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,770
Watch your tone.

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,290
They really do look identical.

158
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,970
What do you mean identical?

159
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,600
Nothing.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Weirdo.

161
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
Mr. Qi.

162
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Mr. Qi.

163
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
I'm so sorry.

164
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,860
My brother lacks manners.

165
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,720
It's fine.

166
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,410
Is he your biological brother?

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Why do you ask?

168
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,970
No reason. He's quite cute.

169
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,680
I'll treat you both to dinner sometime.

170
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,540
I need to go now.

171
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,120
Bye.
