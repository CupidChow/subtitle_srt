1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,640
Bitch!

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,450
Who gave you the courage to seduce my husband?

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,440
All right, we're done.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,280
This woman seduced my husband.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,240
Yes, she seduced me first.

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,040
Don't do this.

7
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Why?

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,730
Because you're my brother.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,840
What if

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
I’m not your brother?

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,130
Kim Dahee, go deliver the fish.

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,560
Got it.

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,890
Mr. Tong.

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,970
The car is ready.

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,450
Mr. Tong is here.

16
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,080
Copy that.

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,600
Did he go gambling?

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,960
Did you go gambling?

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,600
I told you to gamble.

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,760
Daxi, you came at the right time.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,720
Did you play games last night?

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
All the fish we bought today stinks.

23
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,000
No, Mrs. Su.

24
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,440
I didn't buy the goods.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,320
I went into the meat with the boss yesterday.

26
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,360
Ask the boss if you don't believe me.

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Yes.

28
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Honey, did you hear that?

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
Are you sure you went into the meat?

30
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
If you lie,

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
I'll rip off all your hair.

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Believe it or not.

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
Brother, why are you leaving?

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
Mr. Qi will come to you later.

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
and send him away.

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,840
But do I have to repeat

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Do you want me to repeat it again?

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,800
Is it him?

39
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,970
Brother.

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,960
Dean, it's Mr. Tong.

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,420
Please arrange it.

42
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Brother.

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,690
Are you okay?

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Hello, which room is the patient

45
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,400
in?

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,290
Room 303.

47
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,320
Thank you.

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
What are you doing?

49
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,220
Who are you?

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,700
Why did you hurt me?

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Where am I?

52
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Are you crazy, Kim Dahee?

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,890
I’m your sister.

54
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Kim Dahee.

55
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,159
You said my name is Kim Dahee?

56
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,420
What happened just now

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
It's his stress reaction.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
Your brother's head was hit.

59
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,520
He might lose his memory temporarily.

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,600
Doctor, when will he recover?

61
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,280
It's hard to say.

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,210
But I suggest

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,440
we can take him to a place he is familiar with.

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,840
It will help him recover.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,640
Let's go home.

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,100
I still can't remember anything.

67
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,920
Daxi.

68
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,960
Look around.

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,400
and see if you remember anything.

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,640
I’ll cook for you.

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
Daxi, come and eat.

72
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Come on.

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm exhausted.

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,280
Eat.

75
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
I'll do it myself.

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
So handsome.

77
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,480
What's wrong?

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,340
It's noisy.

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,240
Is it noisy?

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,160
Your voice was much louder than mine.

81
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,040
This is really beautiful.

82
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
Kim Dahee, what are you doing?

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,560
So my name is Kim Daxi.

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
What's your name?

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm Kim Dahuan.

86
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm your sister.

87
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,840
We grew up together.

88
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,770
You really don't remember?

89
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
I grew up with someone like you.

90
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,200
That's right. What do you mean by that?

91
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,920
I don't want to eat anymore.

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Whatever.

93
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,080
I want to take a shower.

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,340
Where's the bathroom?

95
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,480
Upstairs.

96
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Why are you looking at me?

97
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,420
I'm not interested in you.

98
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,240
Then why are you looking at me?

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
What do you want?

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,240
Take a shower.

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,200
Then why did you take off your clothes in front of me?

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
Aren't you my sister?

104
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,200
The doctor said it will help you

105
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
will help you recover your memory.

106
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,330
I took your previous one to repair.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,250
I borrowed a new one for you.

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm the driver.

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
A fish delivery.

110
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,580
How could I be a fish delivery?

111
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Why can't you be a fish delivery?

112
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
My hands don't look like people who do this.

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
You used to

114
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,160
to buy from the fish market every day

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,180
and then deliver it to this hotel.

116
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,770
Don't you remember?

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
Your phone is broken.

118
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Use mine first.

119
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,120
If you want to spend money,

120
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
and your previous addresses.

121
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,130
your previous address.

122
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm going to work.

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,080
Where am I?

124
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,960
You're finally awake.

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Who are you?

126
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,880
I'm your brother.

127
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Dong'an.

128
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,130
Mr. Tong.

129
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Your brother is recovering well.

130
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
He should be fine.

131
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,080
Maybe he's been in a coma for too long.

132
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,810
and affected the brain memory.

133
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,440
Mr. Tong.

134
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,300
Are you the president of Snow Leopard Group?

135
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Yes.

136
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,920
Brother, look.

137
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
This is our childhood photo.

138
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,600
I...

139
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,650
Brother.

140
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
You don't even know me.

141
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,210
Maybe you really lost your memory.

142
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
I might be dreaming.

143
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,770
Hello, Daxi.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,600
I ordered a cake for you to celebrate your discharge.

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,520
Buy some food for tonight.

146
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,130
I'll send you the order.

147
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
If you see anything you need,

148
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,540
you can also buy it.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,720
Hello.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Kim Dae-hwan, right?

151
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,920
It's me.

152
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,280
It's me.

153
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,640
This is the cake you ordered.

154
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,240
Thank you.

155
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
Kim Dahee.

156
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Kim Dahee.

157
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,130
You’re back.

158
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,170
What is this?

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
I've been wearing clothes in the closet for five years.

160
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,780
I got some new clothes.

161
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,650
What is this?

162
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
You already have it.

163
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,560
That's not my favorite brand.

164
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,960
I’m afraid my boss will deduct my salary if I’m late for delivering fish.

165
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Kim Daxi.

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
You want to quit, right?

167
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
You told me to buy something I like.

168
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,280
You don't care about the price.

169
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,210
Are you out of your mind?

170
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,440
Don't you know our family's condition?

171
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
I don't think it's expensive.

172
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Not expensive.

173
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,840
You told me it's not expensive.

174
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,600
Do you know it's easy for me to save money every day?

175
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,930
