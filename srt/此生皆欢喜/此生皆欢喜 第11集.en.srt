1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,890
Let's go, hurry!

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,840
Get me out of here right now.

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,880
What's wrong? What happened?

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,720
No time to explain.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,480
I don't even know myself.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,720
Someone's controlling me.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,960
No, wait. I was hit by a car.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,720
Then I woke up

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,120
and became someone else.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,290
And then there's

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,040
someone who looks exactly like me,

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,120
like a clone.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
No, that's not it.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,250
I think I might be the clone.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,120
I can't explain it clearly,

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,360
it's just completely insane,

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
like something out of a sci-fi movie.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,940
Do you understand?

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,960
I understand.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,600
You do?

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
I don't even know what I'm saying.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Jin Daxi, I've figured it out, I...

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,140
How do you know my name is Jin Daxi?

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,440
There's someone you should meet.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
And this time,

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,920
we must make this happen.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,039
And you,

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,240
you need to be confident, you know?

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,930
Let me take you back.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,940
No need, don't trouble yourself.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,340
I'll take her home.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400
And you are?

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
This is my younger brother, Daxi.

34
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,360
Your brother.

35
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,240
I've heard about you.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
All grown up now and quite handsome.

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,090
Let's go.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,520
Let me take you both home.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,979
No need.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,130
Where's the senior?

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
You need to be more careful.

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
You can't tell good people from bad ones.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,579
Stay away from him from now on.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Senior,

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,120
how could he possibly be a bad person?

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,360
Shut up.

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,579
I don't want to hear it.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,200
Who

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
are you really?

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
I'll tell you later.

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
Why are you back again?

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,370
The situation has changed.

53
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,080
That's basically the situation.

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,760
I swear,

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,640
at first I was just curious and my sister...

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,900
Anyway, I didn't mean to do it,

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,880
and later I was forced into it.

58
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,160
So it was that guy Chang Ming

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,400
who's been scheming behind the scenes.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,120
Of course he doesn't look like a good person at all.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,250
Why do you believe everything he says?

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Huh?

63
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,600
How could someone

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
just do whatever they're told to do?

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,650
The biggest problem now is,

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,290
although I know who I am,

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
I still haven't recovered my memory.

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,570
So I can't be certain

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,440
what Chang Ming really wants to do,

70
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,720
or what the company's situation is really like.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
These are all things I need to figure out

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,440
to prevent them from destroying Snow Leopard Group.

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,170
We're supposed to be brothers,

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
but why does it feel like there's such a big gap between us?

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm like a budget version.

76
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
So what do you plan to do next?

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm going back to pretend to be myself.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,410
What do you mean?

79
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
You've got me completely confused.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
You mean

81
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,680
you're going back as Jin Daxi

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,940
to continue pretending to be Tongsheng?

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
This way I can gather information myself,

84
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,240
and I might remember more things.

85
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,959
I feel like all my missing intelligence

86
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,360
has grown on you instead.

87
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,920
This is indeed a good approach.

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,130
There's one more thing I need to ask of you:

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
please take good care of her.

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,250
There's a senior named Bai Yuchen.

91
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't let them get too close.

92
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,480
How could I possibly control my sister?

93
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Wait,

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,360
from what you're saying...

95
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
you mean...

96
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,800
You're really slow on the uptake.

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
Holy crap!

98
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,960
Keep it down.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,240
Mr. Qi

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,480
let's settle all these matters today.

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
We're all ready on our end.

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Is this why you asked me to come?

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,840
I believe I've already told you

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,900
that I'm not getting involved in your affairs anymore.

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,330
You've been pursuing Jin Dahuan recently, haven't you?

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
I suppose

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,410
you wouldn't want Tongsheng to come back either.

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,200
This matter benefits you as well,

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,860
doesn't it, Mr. Qi?

110
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,180
That's fair competition between Tongsheng and me,

111
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,360
it has nothing to do with you.

112
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Fine then.

113
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,320
By the way,

114
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,720
I've told your mother about this.

115
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,770
Your mother fully supports it.

116
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,440
I think with her personal involvement,

117
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
you won't have a choice anymore.

118
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,340
You're truly despicable.

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
I've already hired a new legal team

120
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
to handle this matter.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
When the time comes, I hope you,

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,620
Mr. Qi, will fully cooperate.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,659
Brother, you're back so soon?

124
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,320
You've been gone for days. What's your explanation?

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,159
Those people have all left.

126
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,520
I've already pleaded with Father for you.

127
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,320
He's not angry with you anymore.

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,520
You really know what you're doing.

129
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,180
You bet I do.

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
Can you get me

131
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
a brief on the company's recent projects?

132
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
The more detailed, the better.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Sure,

134
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,970
I'll take care of it right away.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Sis, you're awake.

136
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm sorry,

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
I drank too much last night.

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,280
I don't think I said anything

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,159
or did anything inappropriate.

140
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,210
What are you talking about?

141
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I mean,

142
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,980
nothing happened between us last night, right?

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,090
What happened between you two?

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,159
You two?

145
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,760
Yes, you and him.

146
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
Me and who?

147
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,140
Never mind, it's nothing.

148
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
Don't get the wrong idea,

149
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,640
my senior and I are just classmates,

150
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
there's nothing between us,

151
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,250
don't overthink it.

152
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm not overthinking anything, but

153
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,880
where did this senior suddenly come from?

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,400
What's going on with this senior?

155
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
Anyway,

156
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,220
I don't want you to misunderstand anything.

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,450
Misunderstand?

158
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
Sis, stop talking, just stop,

159
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,280
you're making it more confusing.

160
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,480
If you keep going, I really will misunderstand.

161
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,410
I'm leaving now.

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,360
Where are you going?

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
Delivering fish.

164
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Delivering fish?

165
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,970
I thought you quit that job?

166
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,159
What else can I do?

167
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm off.

168
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,160
Who the hell is this Bai whatever Chen guy?

169
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,680
What's his relationship with her?

170
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,810
What a coincidence that you saw it too.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Bro, you're really calm about this,

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
but I can tell

173
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
this guy is no ordinary person.

174
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't be confused now,

175
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,640
we're on the same side.

176
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
You're pretty smart,

so you can be the lookout.

178
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,250
That's all. Don't call me unless it's important.

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
You know everything now,

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,720
so why are you still looking for me?

183
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,380
You lied to me and you're still so unapologetic.

184
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,520
I didn't mean to.

185
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,280
As you can see,

186
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,540
this is the real me,

187
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,770
smells pretty bad, doesn't it?

189
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,610
What do you mean?

190
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,100
I'll work for you and pay you 5,000 on top.

191
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,040
Are you crazy?

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,880
10,000.

193
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,620
Don't regret it later.
