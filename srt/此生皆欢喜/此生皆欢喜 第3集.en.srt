1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,720
Dahuan.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,440
Mr. Qi asked you to get us some coffee.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,920
Okay.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,720
Can you guys do it?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,800
I don't know what the problem is.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,000
All right.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,760
We worked hard for three years

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,320
for three years.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,440
Right?

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,160
I don't care.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,530
Give me an answer tomorrow.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,600
Or get lost.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,240
Hurry up and find that.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,770
Hurry up.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,680
Look at this.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,610
What's going on?

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,480
Maybe

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,880
with the patent technology.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,200
Don't talk.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Dahuan, what did you say?

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,080
Go on. Say it boldly.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,160
Mr. Qi,

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,800
if we can

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,160
patent parts

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,040
and analyze it

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
and analyze them.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,280
Wouldn't it be more efficient?

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,080
You know that?

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
I studied law.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,720
My thesis used to study

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,200
about technical intellectual property.

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,440
How about

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,800
take the information

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,600
to study it.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
Mr. Qi, it’s inappropriate.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,800
Why not?

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,600
It's perfect.

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,640
Mr. Ko.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
Find all the files

40
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,759
and sort them out.

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,690
Give Dahuan one.

42
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,280
Okay.

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,960
Dahuan.

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,600
Tomorrow,

45
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,880
tomorrow.

46
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,039
Why are you back so early?

47
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,080
I have a temporary job today.

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,900
I want to work at Ju Residence.

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,720
I have something to discuss with you.

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,360
Talk tomorrow.

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,240
I'm busy. Don't disturb me.

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,240
We can't finish it tomorrow.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,940
What are you doing?

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,880
I boasted to the company

55
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,480
to find the loopholes in the two documents.

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
Who knew the original documents

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
are all in French.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
It'll take me a week to translate.

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,560
Aren't you a receptionist?

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,720
Why did you do this?

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
This is the most important opportunity for me these years.

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Don't bother me now.

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,200
Technical patent transfer.

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
This is French.

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
How do you understand it?

66
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Look at this.

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,360
It means it has applied for a patent.

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,680
But he translated it

69
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,940
technical patent.

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,160
No way.

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,160
You have a language talent in a crash?

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,040
Let me see.

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm sure there's a copy in this file.

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,130
Give me that.

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,960
I found it.

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
Between these two documents,

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,480
about the patent procedure

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,400
and the order

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
in the description.

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,720
We need to see the details.

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
The patent agreement in France.

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,880
Why are you looking at me?

83
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,079
Why do you know these?

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,640
I don't know.

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,440
Great!

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,400
You're the savior God sent me.

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm counting on you tonight.

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,960
It's all French.

89
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,020
Too professional.

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Translation software can't be translated accurately.

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,970
Let me help you with your research.

92
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Awesome.

93
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,640
Of course.

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
You played well.

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,090
Mr. Tong.

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
I think you’ve almost recovered.

97
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,900
You should go on a blind date with Miss Yan tomorrow.

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Are you going on a blind date?

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,480
It's not me. It's you.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,159
Brother, don't call him Mr. Tong.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,680
After all, we're at home.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,320
It's been more than ten years.

103
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
Why are you still so restrained?

104
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,040
No.

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,880
What did you just say?

106
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,200
I was on a blind date.

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,440
Brother, explain it.

108
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
He forgot about it.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Brother, dad arranged this marriage.

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,220
Dad has been urging me abroad.

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
You've been delaying it for months.

112
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,700
and had a car accident.

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
The Yans will be unhappy if we don’t go.

114
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,320
After all, Miss Yan

115
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,860
is Master Yan’s daughter?

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes, you can go.

117
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,960
Otherwise, I'm afraid that when the old man comes back from abroad,

118
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
if he comes back from abroad.

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,720
This is too sudden.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You guys go ahead.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll get back to work.

122
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,409
Adjust it for me.

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
on the day Mr. Tong got into the accident.

124
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Sister.

125
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,880
Is this how you meet the young master of the Tong family?

126
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,480
It's really ugly.

127
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,120
What do you know?

128
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,280
I don't want to go on blind dates.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
Blind date?

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
How tacky.

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,760
Is this really

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
the fate of a family like us?

133
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
Can you stop acting like an adult?

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,940
You're not cute at all.

135
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Besides, it's true love

136
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,400
That's true love.

137
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,000
I think he's here.

138
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,160
I’m leaving.

139
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,800
Miss Yan.

140
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,940
It’s me.

141
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,040
Have a seat.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
What would you like?

143
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,960
I want this set.

144
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,760
Okay.

145
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,890
What about you, sir?

146
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,560
Steak.

147
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,520
How cooked?

148
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Eight points.

149
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,880
Hold on.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,040
I've never seen anyone order steak.

151
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,400
Is it weird?

152
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,920
Shouldn't it be a single number?

153
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,960
Five points and seven points.

154
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,600
I like

155
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,040
more familiar than 70%.

156
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,970
Are you different from the rumors?

157
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,740
What rumor?

158
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Rumor has it that you're a cold-faced monster.

159
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,120
I didn't expect you to be so easy-going.

160
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,450
Did I mistake you for someone else?

161
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,240
No.

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,040
What?

163
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,420
Wipe your lipstick before you drink.

164
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,520
You think I'm ugly since we first met?

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,360
I won't do it.

166
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,900
The lipstick was made of a bug's body.

167
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,560
Just now...

169
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,690
I don't remember anything.

170
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,290
I don’t remember anything.

171
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,360
Miss Yan, I’m leaving.

172
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,080
What’s wrong?

173
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,680
What is it?

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,160
Shouldn't you give me a ride?

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,960
I don't even know where you live.

176
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,400
Okay.

177

179
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,000
What's so hard about it?

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,640

Don't worry. It's on me.

195
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
I didn’t expect

196
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,120
Mr. Qi would

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,840
in front of everyone

198
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,560

199

200
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm the only person

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,440

It feels so good.

204
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,120
You don't know.

205
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
The legal department

206
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
used to tell me what to do.

207
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,120
Every time I read books about law at the reception,

208
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
they always laugh at me.

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,280
You have no idea.

210
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,840
when Mr. Qi announced this,

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000

212

But thank you.

213
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,760
If it weren't for you,

214
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,560
it wouldn't have been so smooth.

215
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,970
As long as you're happy.

216
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
I don't want to see you

217
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,360
get up early and do what you don't like.

Sit here.

222
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
Why?

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,050
I think you're different from before.

224
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,600
What?

225
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,400
I blush when I see you.

226
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,960
