1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,100
I didn't expect you'd come looking for me again.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,200
Cut it out. Stop pretending.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,280
I already know what kind of person you are.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,340
No way. I've been exposed so quickly?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
How did you figure it out?

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
Acting like a proper young master every day,

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,800
isn't that exhausting?

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
I... I...

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,820
Caught by me, weren't you?

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,930
Alright,

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,080
why don't you properly introduce yourself again?

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,400
I never thought you'd find out.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,860
I didn't want this either,

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,920
I just woke up one day

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
in this mansion,

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,810
with all these luxury cars.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,760
So you lost yourself in all of this.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,040
Right, who wouldn't be confused?

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,340
Alright, alright.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,080
Actually, I was...

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,680
You've always been a fun-loving person,

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,410
haven't you?

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
You're just constrained by your position,

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,980
pretending to be this way.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,640
So you've figured me out.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,960
Damn, I almost slipped up.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,160
Yeah,

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,200
it's true,

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,100
you've discovered my secret.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
Alright, I get it.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,840
So today,

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,039
let's stop pretending,

33
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,500
and go out to have some fun.

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,840
Where do you usually hang out?

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,770
Take me with you.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,120
Fine.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,650
I'll show you a good time today.

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,560
Let's go.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,080
After all that,

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,479
you bring me to a place like this?

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,640
Isn't this childish?

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,170
I knew you wouldn't like it.

43
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,400
Where did you think I'd take you?

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,360
I thought it would be something like motorcycles,

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,220
rock climbing or bungee jumping.

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,039
Then you've got the wrong person.

47
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,680
It's not too late to back out.

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,720
You guys,

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,320
couldn't you just play video games at home?

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,759
See, that's where you don't get it.

51
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,490
It's all about the atmosphere.

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,120
So, care to play a round with me?

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
Game on. I'm not afraid.

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,730
Let me show you what I'm capable of.

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,079
Let's go to point A first.

56
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,120
You go to A, I'll go to B.

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,720
Alright.

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,020
Now let's go to point B.

59
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Don't worry, leave it to me.

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,079
I didn't expect your shooting skills to be so good.

61
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,940
Maybe you're just too bad at this.

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
Not bad.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,240
What kind of shooting style and rhythm is that?

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,900
How are you so good at this?

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
You're just too bad at it.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,050
Want to play another round?

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
So you two were the ones

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,080
chasing us around

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,880
in the game?

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
Bro, it's just a game,

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,530
getting excited is normal.

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,880
What's wrong? Can't handle losing?

73
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,640
This girl is pretty good.

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,920
We play games every day.

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,800
Why don't you hang with us

76
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
and play something else,

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,040
what do you say?

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,770
Brother,

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
please

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,280
be the bigger person

81
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
and let this go, okay?

82
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Get lost!

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Run! Hurry!

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
After them! Quick!

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,320
Move it!

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,380
Where are they?

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where did they go?

88
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,640
Split up!

89
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,200
Search!

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,760
Got it.

91
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,570
You think they're gone?

92
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,660
They should be gone by now.

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,800
A bunch of useless fools.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,130
Let's go.

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Okay.

96
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,440
Let's go.

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,200
You...

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,050
you go first.

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,850
You go ahead.

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,080
I'll go first then.

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,720
Good.

102
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,080
Let's move.

103
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
Dahuan, let's go home.

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,880
Dahuan.

105
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,560
Even if I'm poor,

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,570
would you still love me?

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,530
Once I got on your tricycle,

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,040
I became yours.

109
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,880
Actually,

110
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
my true identity is

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,530
the heir to the Snow Leopard Group.

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
Tongsheng.

113
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,280
Dahuan.

114
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,880
Mr. Qi.

115
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,690
Are you alright?

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,320
Um...

117
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,159
Get out!

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Mr. Qi.

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,440
I'd like to remind you that

120
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,000
you'll be meeting with the French clients next month.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Here are some

122
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,200
profiles of French tutors I've selected for you.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,800
Would you like to take a look?

124
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,040
I really am a genius.

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,760
So that's the situation.

126
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,400
Are you interested in

127
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
becoming my French teacher?

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,290
How did you know I speak French?

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,810
Your sister told me.

130
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,760
But I have one condition.

131
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,760
What?

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,180
Move into my house.

133
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,780
That's my only condition. Do you accept?

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,080
I refuse.

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,920
Wait.

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,560
I've already discussed this with your sister

137
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,280
and she agreed.

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,920
She's her, and I'm me.

139
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,810
Alright.

140
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,000
You can name your price for this month's salary,

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
and include any other demands you have.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,490
Are you sure?

143
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,130
Go ahead.

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,210
Then I'll fill it in.

145
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,770
Go ahead, fill it in!

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,240
If there are other regulations allowing for delayed retirement,

147
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,880
the employment contract may be renewed when Party B reaches the statutory retirement age.

148
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,360
How much? 500,000.

149
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
Forget it if you don't agree.

150
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,640
You have one month.

151
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,020
Watch me win your sister over.

152
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,000
Deal.

153
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
Hey, you've got way too much luggage.

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
Are you moving in

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,450
or running from something?

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,130
This strange feeling of familiarity.

157
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,400
As if I was always meant to live in a place like this.

158
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,640
Hey, are you just going to sit there watching?

159
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,800
Come give me a hand.

160
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,930
What kind of person is this?

161
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
Don't touch my stuff!

162
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,760
Is this the kind of wine you usually drink?

163
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
There's nothing here I like.

164
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,200
What's wrong with this wine?

165
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,460
I'm not even willing to share it with you.

166
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
What terrible taste you have,

167
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
wasting money like this.

168
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,760
When are you going to clean up this room?

169
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
I want to stay in this big room.

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,880
No, your room is in the guest room across the hall,

171
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,740
this is my room.

172
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm not used to staying in small rooms,

173
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
I prefer larger ones.

174
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,840
Don't you think you're being a bit too much?

175
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,200
Is that a problem?

176
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,600
You...

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,040
No.

179
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080

I'll leave.

182
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,120
Wait.

183
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
What now?

184
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,720
Change the sheets for me.

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,040
Okay, I'll change them.

186
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,560
Why do I feel like something's not right here?

187
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Mr. Qi.

188
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
Mr. Qi.

189
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,760

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,800

What is it now?

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,480
We're almost out of wine.

195
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,900
I'll get you some more.

196
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,300
The AC seems a bit warm.

197
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,660
It's not hot at all.

198
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
Get me some Hami melon,

199
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
cut into smaller pieces.

200
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,720

By the way,

202
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,370
I want to take a bath.

203
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,610
Could you prepare it for me?

204
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,490
Water temperature around 36 degrees is fine,

205
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,780
I don't like it too hot.

206
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,240
Sure.

207
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,130
Are you messing with me?

208
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,860
The bath is ready, you can go wash now.

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,920
Wait.

210
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,240
Scrub my back.

211
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
