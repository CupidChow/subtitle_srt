1
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,290
Why are you here?

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
I know who you are.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,659
I got caught again.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,840
Okay.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,880
Actually, I’m a playful person.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,880
You’re not a child boy. You’re Kim Daxi.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
This is the money you spent

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,080
in our house.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,000
It's 363,500 yuan.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,120
How are you going to pay it back?

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,080
If you can't pay me back,

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,880
I can call the police now.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,440
and sue you for fraud.

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,600
But I can give you another way.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,920
What?

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,520
Work with me.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,400
and continue to act as a child

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,160
and enjoy wealth.

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,280
I can give you some money when it's done.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,240
You can take your sister away.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,080
You can go wherever you want.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,450
I'll choose the second one.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,320
Good.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,039
I hope you can stay at home from now on.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,960
and don't cause any trouble.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,360
Also,

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,000
don't let anyone know about our conversation.

28
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,880
It's a secret between us.

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,320
I see.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,600
One more thing.

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,520
Miss Yan...

32
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,120
Stay away from her.

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,370
You like her too?

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,440
Are you acting dumb?

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,240
Who do you think you are?

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,760
Do you deserve to date Miss Yan Yan?

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,440
I’ll call her now.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
You want to break up with her?

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,240
Hello?

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,680
Yan Yan?

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,079
I’m Tong Sheng.

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Why did you call me with this number?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,560
Let's not meet again.

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,760
Let's pretend we don't know each other.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,480
What?

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,520
Very good, very obedient.

47
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
Aren't you going to deliver the fish?

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,770
What are you doing here?

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,160
I resigned.

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,440
Resigned?

51
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,960
I resigned from the owner of the fish market.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm not going to deliver the fish.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,760
That's fine.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,520
I think so too.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,600
you should find a proper job.

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,780
You can't work like this anymore.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
I want to know what else I can do.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
except language.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
ability.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,480
Did you break your head?

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
Do you think you're Iron Man?

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Maybe you are.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,760
Okay.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
Tell me.

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,610
How are you going to restore your superpower?

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,840
I know. Maybe there is a place

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,880
that can help me regain my lost memories.

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,560
Where?

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,040
Have you found Iron Man?

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,560
Don't tell me you can do postpartum care.

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,960
No.

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,530
Why are you looking so serious?

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,400
How do you know if you don't look carefully?

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,659
Maybe they're all hidden in the details.

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,920
How does it feel to lose memory?

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,360
It's like when I open my eyes and wake up,

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
I came to a place I don't know.

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,650
I don't understand.

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,880
Do you want to experience it?

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,400
How?

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,880
Boss, can I borrow your bike?

82
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,159
Get in.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
Come on.

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,960
Sit here.

85
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,960
Here.

86
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,610
Close your eyes.

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,360
What?

88
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Close it.

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,680
Hold tight.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
Slow down. It's really scary.

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,160
I'm going to find out who she is.

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Open your eyes.

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,560
Where is this?

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,730
Have we been riding for so long?

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,730
That's how it feels.

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,380
When I open my eyes,

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,060
I don't know where I am.

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
I don't know how I got here.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,210
Come to think of it, it's really scary.

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
I won't go to work in Shanghai.

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
That's not right.

102
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,360
Impossible.

103
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,520
Am I not good enough?

104
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,760
Not bad.

105
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,760
How could anyone refuse this condition?

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
She will accept me.

107
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,600
What's the problem?

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,040
It'll be fine.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,520
Are you talking to me?

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,360
What did you say?

111
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,420
What are you doing?

112
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,820
Why do you keep looking at your phone?

113
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,320
I've decided.

114
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,800
I won't play with you anymore.

115
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,560
I want to turn over a new leaf.

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,200
What's wrong with you today?

117
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,260
Did you forget to take your medicine?

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,680
What am I thinking?

119
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,039
No.

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
I have to ask him today.

121
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,080
You have to make it clear.

122
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,640
Explain what?

123
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,210
We're siblings.

124
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,560
Isn't that my line?

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
But I will promise you my true identity.

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,860
It’s not Kim Dahee.

127
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,960
What are you talking about?

128
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Maybe you won’t be too troubled.

129
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,280
I don’t care if you’re Kim Dae-hee or not.

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,440
Anyway, I won’t like you.

131
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,720
What am I talking about?

132
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,020
Why didn't you answer my call?

133
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Sign it.

134
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,730
Do you want me to take a look?

135
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,320
What are you looking at? Do you understand?

136
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,000
Sign it.
