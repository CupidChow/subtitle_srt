1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,760
I have something to tell you.

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,240
Sister.

3
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
So,

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,160
you are my brother Daxi.

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,760
You are a child of Snow Leopard Group.

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,200
After the accident,

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,360
you were the one who lived with me.

8
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,640
Later,

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,800
it became Daxi.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
And

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,080
I became you again.

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,680
I came here

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,530
to find out about my family.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,060
But I didn't expect

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,090
you're much braver than I thought.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,400
No wonder.

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
Not only do you know French, you also know everything.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,840
Besides,

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
a series of

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,759
beyond description.

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,199
You're awake.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,680
Daxi.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,880
It's me, sister. Are you okay?

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,410
Where's Tong Sheng?

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,760
He left.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
Gone?

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
Why did he leave?

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,280
He doesn't live here.

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,079
Why is he here?

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,460
Do you want him to take care of you?

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
No.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
You miss him?

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
Why didn't you tell me directly?

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,640
I want you to talk to me alone.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,320
You're still teasing me when I'm sick.

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,360
You don't look like me at all.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,160
You knew

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
Daxi is not your brother.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Daxi

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,240
My mother brought it back

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,040
from the orphanage.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
But I always treat him

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,079
as my brother.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,940
But he is actually my brother.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,720
I didn’t expect Daxi

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
is the lost child of the Tong family.

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
I only found out recently.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,760
My father has been secretly looking for him.

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,720
He kept this from me and Dong'an.

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,800
Can you

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
stop

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,280
between Wanqi and Snow Leopard?

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,520
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of the rest.

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,640
Although my memory hasn't fully recovered,

57
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,800
I promise

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
I won't let what happened yesterday happen again.

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,960
or let anyone bully you again.

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
But you have to promise me

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,880
no matter what happens in the future,

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
don't rush out first.

63
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,800
Remember,

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
You still have me.

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Bai Yuchen.

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,840
I've sent someone to handle it.

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,040
Handle it? How?

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,960
Don't worry. I'm just giving him a lesson.

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,800
and make it public.

70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,920
He should be ruined by now.

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
Have a good rest.

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Don't worry about the rest.

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,480
Daxi.

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
Child.

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,520
What's wrong?

76
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
Nothing.

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,640
Have a good rest.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,920
I'll be back soon.

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,640
Dad.

80
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,810
Why did you suspend the merger?

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,480
What happened at the press conference

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
at the press conference.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,560
I need to think about it.

84
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
Also,

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,330
the new legal department you hired

86
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
made a mess.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,480
It's such a shame

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
What is this?

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
I need to review it.

90
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,880
So the project is suspended.

91
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Dad, it's not like that.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,840
By the way,

93
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,820
how is Tong Sheng's recovery?

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,480
I plan to let him take over.

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,680
He's fine.

96
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,880
Is there any conflict between you two?

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
Of course not.

98
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,360
There are many things between brothers

99
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,159
we should care about each other.

100
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,360
You need to know that.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
Of course.

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Okay, that's it.

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,440
Dong Dong.

104
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,720
You forced me.

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
Are you back?

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,720
I bought some medicine.

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,840
I'm almost home.

108
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
I want canned fruit.

109
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,160
I'll go buy it now.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Forget it. I'll buy it next time.

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
Come back soon.

112
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Tong Sheng, how are you?

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,080
Tong Sheng.

114
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I think

115
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,740
remember everything.

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Let's go home.

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,640
Everything is clear.

118
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,360
Dad came back from abroad.

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
Chang Ming.

120
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
Tell me.

121
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,760
Dad, I don't know what to say.

122
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Brother.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,300
Shall I start with you?

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's start with how

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
in his car.

126
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,840
No, Dad.

127
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,240
My men did this.

128
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
I just found out.

129
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
He has fled abroad.

130
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,440
I plan to go abroad and catch him myself.

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,370
and face to face.

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,320
I really didn't know about this.

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,450
I really don't know.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
You have to trust me.

135
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,880
Be quick.

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't want to see Tong Sheng after tomorrow.

137
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,440
Understand?

138
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,120
Yes.

139
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Keep an eye on Tong Sheng.

140
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,480
If he has any signs of regaining his memory,

141
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
let me know immediately.

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Yes.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,970
Brother.

144
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Stop pretending.

145
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,100
Be more decent.

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,919
Chang Ming.

147
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,520
After Tong Sheng had a car accident,

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,179
I asked Dong’an to investigate the whole thing.

149
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Then you met Kim Daxi in the company.

150
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
you controlled him

151
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,920
and signed a contract that affects the company's interests.

152
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,960
and asked me to fire him.

153
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,400
so that you can take over the company.

154
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,840
You colluded with Wanqi Group.

155
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,120
Did I miss anything?

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Tong Sheng.

157
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,300
You have to understand me.

158
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,520
The moment Kim Dae-hee entered our house,

159
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Dong’an found that

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,480
we got the wrong person.

161
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,080
But he advised me not to expose Kim Daxi.

162
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,120
and don’t rush to meet him.

163
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,280
We did this

164
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,200
to give you another chance.

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
I've been waiting for you to stop.

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,160
to admit your mistake.

167
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
Dong An.

168
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,640
You're hiding so well.

169
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,600
I still can't defeat the Tong family.

170
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
Chang Ming.

171
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,200
I treated you like my own brother.

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,880
Just like Dong'an.

173
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
We're family.

174
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,740
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.
