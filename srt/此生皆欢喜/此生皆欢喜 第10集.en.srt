1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,720
Brother, I finally found you.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,380
Are you doing well?

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,080
I've been searching for you everywhere.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,540
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,600
Brother, I've missed you so much.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,080
I always felt something was off about that person at home.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,680
It definitely wasn't you, brother.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,280
So I checked the hospital surveillance footage.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,680
Only then did I discover we claimed the wrong person that day.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,120
So,

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
that Jin Daxi and I are twins.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
Actually, we're both from the Tong family.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,920
It's a long story.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Although you both have the Tong surname,

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
you're both adopted, just like me.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,480
Adopted?

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,920
Yes.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,240
When Dad was just starting his business,

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,640
everything was chaotic.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,880
One of you twin brothers got lost

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,080
and was taken in by a kind person.

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,240
That's Jin Daxi.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,460
But that's not important.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,780
What matters is

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,880
the real heir to the Tong family is now Tong An.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
Tong An.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,680
Brother, you might have amnesia

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,200
and don't remember these things clearly.

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,680
After Dad had Tong An,

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,400
his attitude toward us changed.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,800
Later, we became mere pawns.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,800
Everything we did

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,220
was to pave the way for Tong An.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,960
So when I saw you again this time,

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,280
I wasn't in a hurry to bring you home.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,860
Because I was worried,

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,890
worried that Dad would use you.

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
So I came up with a plan

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,410
to offer you a high salary to leave this place.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,840
But what I didn't expect was

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,300
that you're not Jin Daxi, you're my brother.

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,759
Come home with me.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,690
Actually, brother,

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,280
it's probably for the best that you were switched.

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,139
At least you escaped that misery.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,690
Is it my decision whether to go back or not?

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Yes.

48
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,920
But brother, as you know,

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,960
we're all just stepchildren.

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,820
Over the years,

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,100
Dad has been involved in many shady business dealings.

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,920
In the end, Dad will definitely set a trap

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,900
to make us all scapegoats.

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,980
Someone as cunning as Dad,

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,650
it wouldn't be the first time he's done something like this.

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,180
I won't go back for now.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,329
Since Jin Daxi is also from our Tong family

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,970
and has worked hard outside for so many years,

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,300
let him experience the life of a rich person.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm still suffering from amnesia,

61
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,200
so I wouldn't be much help if I went back.

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Let me recover my memories and figure out the truth first.

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Brother, you're always so thoughtful.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Do you have Miss Yan's phone number?

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,480
Yan Yan? This is Tong Sheng.

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
I need your help with something.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,210
Don't be angry anymore.

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,400
Even if he's your brother,

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,200
doesn't he have the right to date whoever he wants?

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,040
If you're not okay with it, just go back and scold him.

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
How could your brother not tell his sister about his relationship,

72
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,160
right?

73
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,560
I'm leaving now, Dahuan.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Get some rest. See you tomorrow.

75
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,520
What's wrong with you?

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Sis, you're back!

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,960
Come here!

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,040
Daxi and I have prepared dinner.

79
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,420
What are you two doing?

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
Yan Yan wants to apologize to you.

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,080
She hadn't met you before,

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,400
didn't know you were my sister,

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,930
so she wasn't being polite.

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,800
Today she insisted on making dinner for you

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,930
to show her apology.

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,060
That's not necessary.

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,400
Don't be like that. Just have a little.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,920
Come on.

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Yes, sis. She's being sincere.

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,620
Why are you suddenly calling me 'sis' today?

91
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,810
You are my sister after all.

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,760
Come on.

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,409
Let's eat together.

94
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,159
These chicken wings are delicious.

95
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:43,620
Really?

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,850
No, wait.

97
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,250
Let's get sis...

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Sis, try this spicy chicken. It's really good.

99
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,420
You're so thoughtful.

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,760
I'm full.

101
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,220
Sis, you haven't eaten a single bite.

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,130
Thanks for your help today.

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,600
I've done everything I could to help.

104
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,400
You promised me

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,330
to tell me about your twin brother.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
The Tongsheng you met

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,530
was indeed fake.

108
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,400
He's Dahuan's brother, Jin Daxi.

109
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,440
I guess he's afraid to see you

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,900
because he can't face you.

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
Everyone has vanity.

112
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
But there might be other reasons.

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,200
But you still need to think clearly

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,120
whether you can accept that Daxi lied to you

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,850
and his real family situation.

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
Of course I'm angry that he lied to me,

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
but I don't care about his identity.

118
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,920
Think about it carefully,

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,180
don't be too stubborn.

120
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,100
Once you're clear about what you want, I can figure out how to help you.

121
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,650
Your sister doesn't dislike me, does she?

122
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840
Silly, of course not.

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,600
What am I even angry about?

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,420
Come in, the door's unlocked.

125
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,800
What's wrong? Are you upset?

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,159
Tell me,

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,920
why did you hide your relationship

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,380
with that Miss Yan from me?

129
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,120
We're just regular friends.

130
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,840
Regular friends?

131
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,720
What kind of regular friends act like that?

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,690
I think you're just playing everyone.

133
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
Are you jealous?

134
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,960
Jealous? What would I be jealous of?

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,000
How could I possibly be jealous?

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
You're so angry,

137
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,840
I don't believe you don't have feelings for me.

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,040
Dahuan.

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
I want to explain everything to you.

140
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,340
Hello, senior.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Why are you suddenly calling me?

142
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm downstairs at your place,

143
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,050
could you come down?

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Okay, I'll be right down.

145
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,210
Long time no see.

146
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,540
It's rare for you to come back to the country,

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,840
are you here for some big case?

148
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,780
It's not really a big case,

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,260
but for the next while,

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,530
it won't be so difficult for us to meet.

151
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,940
Why is that?

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,840
CEO Chang from Snow Leopard Group invited me back

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,560
to mainly handle

154
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
your Wanqi company's investment in Snow Leopard.

155
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,520
What a coincidence.

156
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,120
Yes,

157
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
so as I said,

158
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,400
it won't be so difficult for us to meet anymore, right?

159
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,930
And technically speaking,

160
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,810
you're actually my client now.

161
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Here,

162
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,160
let's drink to our beautiful Dahuan

163
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,200
who will take good care of me from now on.

164
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
No, no, no, senior,

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,640
I've just started working

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
in our company's legal department,

167
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm far from ready to handle core issues.

168
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,159
Based on what I've learned recently,

169
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,799
the other legal staff at your company aren't up to par,
