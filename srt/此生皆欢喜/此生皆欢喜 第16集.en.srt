1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,239
Here.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,560
What is this?

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,760
You're so slow-witted.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,200
My sister's dating list.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,920
Dating list?

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,560
My sister wrote everything she wanted to do.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,960
Do you understand my sister's secret book?

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,840
If you are in love,

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,730
you have to do ten things with your boyfriend.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,080
First,

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,960
Let's go grocery shopping and cook at home.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,680
Come back early tonight.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,140
I bought some groceries. Let's cook at home.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm home.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,760
What are you doing?

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,960
Cooking.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,240
How can you cut the dishes like this?

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,000
Cooking. I didn't know you could do this.

19
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,480
Second, watch horror movies together.

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
Horror movie?

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
My sister didn't scare you to death.

22
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,600
And we made cake together.

23
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,680
We hang hands together and go to the park.

24
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
and wear matching shirts together.

25
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,240
Today is the last day.

26
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,600
Are you sure?

27
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,480
My sister is in a good mood recently.

28
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,440
With me as her advisor,

29
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,079
Don't worry.

30
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,140
I hope everything goes well tonight.

31
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,959
I did everything I could.

32
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,120
The rest is up to you.

33
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,780
I believe you can do it.

34
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,640
All right, I'm hanging up.

35
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Today is my last day at the fish market.

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
I have to go back and finish up.

37
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,520
I'll go with you.

38
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,650
Where are you going?

39
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,280
I promised to work for you.

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Stay on guard on your last day.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
Let's go.

42
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
I'll pick you up after you get off work.

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,330
See you tonight.

44
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
What date is it today?

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,900
A month has passed.

46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I feel sad

47
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,680
I feel sad.

48
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,720
How do you know that?

49
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,940
I thought about it.

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,520
I think you don't like me.

51
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,900
But I have to force you.

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you for your tolerance

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,570
for taking care of my emotions.

54
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,540
Pretending to be happy

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,440
No I'm really happy

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
I found that

57
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,920
I really like the feeling of being with you.

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,180
I decided not to return it.

59
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,360
I lied to you.

60
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,120
I thought so too.

61
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,500
I never thought of stopping here.

62
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,210
There's one more thing I haven't done.

63
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
What is it?

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
Don't think I don't know you stole my notes.

65
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,900
How do you know I didn't finish it?

66
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,490
Close your eyes.

67
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,810
Close your eyes.

68
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Three.

69
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,920
The last rule of the love list.

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
There must be a romantic fireworks

71
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,360
and kiss under the fireworks.

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Can you return the notebook to me now?

73
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,650
It's done. Why do you still want it?

74
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,040
Maybe I can do something else in the future.

75
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
I want to put it up.

76
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,159
No.

77
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,640
From now on,

78
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,320
we'll finish them one by one.

79
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
You said it.

80
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,760
I said it.

81
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,580
Hello, Yan Yan.

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,720
Sister.

83
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,360
Daxi! Daxi is in trouble!

84
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
Look at the news.

85
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,200
What?

86
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,920
What happened?

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,930
He's Chang-myung's subordinate.

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,640
What?

89
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,080
They thought Daxi was you.

90
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
They asked Daxi out.

91
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
This is the last time.

92
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
Don't come here with me anymore.

93
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,090
What do you mean?

94
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
I'll follow you.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I mean don't come here.

96
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,900
Where are we going?

97
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,640
Like a park.

98
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,880
Snack stalls, internet cafes and amusement park.

99
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,280
But just in case, you have to take a photo.

100
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,240
You...

101
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm just kidding.

102
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,880
Hello, Mr. Tong?

103
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,140
I have an important document for you.

104
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,680
Are you free tonight?

105
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,380
Okay. Where are you going?

106
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,960
I think I got the wrong phone.

107
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,880
Who is it?

108
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,840
I don't know.

109
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
But something really important came up.

110
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
To see my brother.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Tonight is an important moment for your brother.

112
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
He must be busy.

113
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,980
Why don't we get it for him?

114
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,440
Sure.

115
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,200
When we got there, we were surrounded by a group of people.

116
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,120
Daxi let me escape to protect me.

117
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
They drove to chase Daxi.

118
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,280
Daxi drove the car to the bridge.

119
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
Suddenly a truck

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
into the water.

121
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Where is he?

122
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,930
He's still fishing.

123
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,720
But the river is very urgent.

124
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,960
I guess

125
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,500
we might not be able to find it.

126
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
Dahuan.

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,160
Dahuan.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Daxi.

129
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,840
Look at this! Look at this! Look at this!

130
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,200
Dahuan.

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
Are you okay?

132
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Did you find Daxi?

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,920
No.

134
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,480
No.

135
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,680
Daxi may

136
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
has gone home.

137
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,040
Yes.

138
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,570
He didn't bring his phone, so he couldn't contact us.

139
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,170
It must be like this.

140
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,280
Daxi.

141
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,640
I'll go with you.

142
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,400
No, don't follow me.
