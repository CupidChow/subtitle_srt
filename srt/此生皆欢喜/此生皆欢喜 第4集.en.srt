1
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,040
When I see you, I blush

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,159
and my heart races.

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,080
Do you want to try it?

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,080
Oh my God, what was I dreaming about!

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,690
That's terrifying.

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,160
Wait.

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,560
This can't be real, can it?

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,760
Dahuan, from now on, he's going to be your brother.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,800
But he's not my brother. I don't have a brother.

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,920
Although he wasn't your brother before,

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,200
he will be from now on.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,160
From now on, we're all family.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,480
You need to treat him like family

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,160
and take good care of him,

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
understand?

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,289
Want breakfast?

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,009
Let's eat together.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,200
Last night,

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,420
nothing happened between us, right?

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,780
Everything happened.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
What?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,360
Everything you can imagine,

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,880
everything you can't imagine,

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
it all happened.

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,010
Impossible.

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,440
No way, no way.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
It must be my imagination.

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,160
What on earth is going on?

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,079
Could it be

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,900
that I made the first move?

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
Want to give it a try?

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,720
No way, I'm your brother.

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,520
Impossible.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
I would never make the first move.

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,770
I would absolutely never initiate anything.

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Could it be?

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,650
So do you want to try?

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
No, no.

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,820
What are you doing?

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,800
Mr. Qi, what brings you here?

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
I'm here to pick you up.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,810
Dahuan, this is for you.

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Take it.

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
This is your brother, right?

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,490
You forgot your bag.

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Thanks.

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,920
Mr. Qi, let's go.

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,820
Bye-bye, little brother.

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,320
Mr. Chang, something's happened.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,050
Mr. Qi came looking for Tongshen for some reason.

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
Qi Wenhan, what are you up to?

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Sneaking off to meet Tongsheng,

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,940
planning to double-cross us?

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,180
Look, would you just back off?

55
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,890
Fine,

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,180
I'm just going to be straight with you today,

57
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm out.

58
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,760
What do you mean?

59
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,240
What do I mean?

60
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,880
It's just a partnership, right?

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
Can't I just pull out?

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,760
I have zero interest in all your family's mess

63
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,920
and don't want any part of it.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Don't you forget,

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
you were involved in that car accident too,

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,040
you can't just walk away whenever you want.

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,170
You were the one behind that accident,

68
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
I was just aware of it at most.

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,760
And what's this supposed to be?

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,090
Are you threatening me?

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,610
Who do you think you are?

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,960
Claiming I was involved,

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,800
do you have any proof?

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,760
What a joke.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,200
Damn it.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,330
What's wrong with you, newbie?

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,280
How could you mess up even the printed version?

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,440
It's correct.

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
This is exactly what you gave me yesterday.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,130
What are you saying?

81
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,480
Are you suggesting I sent the wrong one?

82
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,320
Let me check again.

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,680
Come here.

84
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,620
What are you doing? Don't you know who she is?

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,240
Who?

86
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,360
Director Qi personally dropped her off this morning.

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,760
So who do you think she is?

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,540
I'll just print a new copy myself.

90
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,600
Don't bother.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,240
I...

92
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,850
Dahuan, this is for you.

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Take it.

94
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,570
Brother.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,400
Brother!

96
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,280
Brother!

97
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,090
What are you doing? Making fish cakes?

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,450
I don't know how.

99
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
Looks like you really hit your head hard.

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
Alright, I'll make them later.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,520
But you need to agree to something.

102
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,480
What?

103
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,360
You remember my big silly son,

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
the one about your sister's age?

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,760
The wife and I have been thinking,

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,720
would you consider letting your sister...

107
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,100
Think about it seriously.

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,680
My son may look a bit slow,

109
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
but he's a first-class good man.

110
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,760
Your sister wouldn't regret being with him.

111
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,320
I've mentioned this several times,

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,450
so what do you think?

113
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,880
Daxi.

114
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you doing?

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,400
No way.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,220
My sister has a boyfriend.

117
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,280
No,

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,290
she doesn't.

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
I asked her a few days ago and she didn't.

120
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,880
She does. Starting now, she does.

121
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,800
Fine.

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,930
I won't ask anymore.

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,240
I think he's not just become stupid from that hit,

124
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
he's gone completely crazy.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,880
Dahuan, you're off work!

126
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,409
Get in, I'll drive you home.

127
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Look, look!

128
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,280
This girl is really something,

129
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,640
hooking up with CEO Qi.

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
Dahuan, let's go home.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,200
You actually drove this junky car here?

132
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,490
Dahuan, let me drive you home in my car.

133
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,880
Look.

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
He really is something.

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Right?

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Let's go home.

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,440
What's going on here?

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,650
Try it on.

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,570
What's this?

140
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,850
People at headquarters dress so well.

141
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
You're part of the legal department now,

142
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,690
you can't dress like a receptionist anymore.

143
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,020
I feel like something's missing.

144
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,410
How is it? Does it look good?

145
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,580
How much was it?

146
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,580
Over 30,000. It suits you perfectly.

147
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,160
Over 30,000?

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
Dahui, are you crazy?

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,700
Go return it right now!

150
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
It's just money.

151
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
I can earn it back.

152
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,200
I have a plan.

153
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,730
What plan could you possibly have?

154
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,090
If I say I have a plan, then I have a plan.

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,370
I'm looking for Tongsheng.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,860
Please come in.

157
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,170
I didn't expect you would come looking for me.

158
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
Enough. Stop pretending.

159
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,100
I already know who you really are.
