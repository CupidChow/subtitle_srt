1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,160
What era are we living in?

2
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,020
Dahuan should have the right to choose for herself.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,840
Senior.

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,640
How could you possibly be a bad person?

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,520
Dahuan,

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,440
are you happy being with me?

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,240
What if she's been hoping to marry me all along?

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,420
Brother, you haven't been yourself lately.

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,800
Brother, have you heard about

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
our company's recent acquisition?

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,480
I really don't understand what Second Brother is thinking,

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,810
giving away our pricing rights like that.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,480
What?

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
I remember your original business philosophy, brother:

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,560
to provide the public with

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,820
affordable yet high-quality products,

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720
winning through value for money.

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
But from the looks of it,

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
our company is changing direction.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,640
Do you also think there's something wrong with this contract?

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,039
I can't quite put my finger on it,

22
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,440
but something feels off,

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,080
though I can't explain why.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,610
Have you seen the contract?

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,479
No, I haven't,

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,610
and Second Brother wouldn't show it to me anyway.

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,240
I understand.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,520
I'll figure something out.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,400
Alright, brother. I'll be going then.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,729
I just wanted to check on you before I left.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Jin Daxi, we're switching shifts tonight.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,660
What are you doing?

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,260
Working overtime.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
That looks complicated.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,970
Snow Leopard Group?

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,200
Yes, the acquisition deal.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
I don't even know why I'm stressing myself out,

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,240
when the contract has already been finalized,

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,040
yet here I am still analyzing it.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,860
The contract has been finalized?

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
It's going to be signed at tomorrow's press conference.

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,280
All the legal procedures have been completed.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Then what are you worried about?

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,250
I've discovered a problem.

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
What?

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,640
Look at these contracts.

47
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,370
This subcontracting company.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,860
Is there something wrong with this company?

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,580
I specifically investigated this company,

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,320
and I found that

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,180
it actually doesn't exist at all,

52
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,520
yet it's receiving

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,520
investments from both Snow Leopard and Wanqi Groups.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,570
You investigated this?

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,660
You went yourself?

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes, of course.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
I see.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,079
Chang Ming,

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,120
I didn't expect you to pull something this big.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,520
What?

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,880
So,

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,920
this company is probably just a shell company.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,520
They only exist to raise money through going public.

64
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,440
They're taking advantage of the merger

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,300
to cash in when stock prices rise,

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,490
and then they'll declare bankruptcy.

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,680
Stop.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,760
What's wrong?

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,020
Have you forgotten what happened to our family?

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,290
Have you forgotten that our father...

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,040
No,

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
I must stop this from happening.

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,810
Once you do this,

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
you can never return to Wanqi Group.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
I know,

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,640
but I have to do it.

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,490
I've made up my mind.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,600
But

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,570
the press conference is tomorrow.

80
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I have a plan.

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,040
Distinguished leaders and guests,

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,760
the Snow Leopard Group signing ceremony

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
is now officially beginning.

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Thank you all for attending our signing ceremony.

85
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,520
Now, please welcome the Acting President

86
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,650
of Snow Leopard Group, Mr. Chang Ming.

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,080
First of all, thank you everyone for coming today.

88
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,140
The partnership with Wanqi Group

89
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,080
represents a significant upgrade for our Snow Leopard Group.

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,400
Moving forward, our group will enter a transformation period.

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,080
We pledge

92
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
to put consumer interests first

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,900
and deliver higher quality products to our customers.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Now we'll move on to the interview segment.

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,960
We've just received a whistleblower document

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,640
which claims

97
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,720
that the purpose of this merger

98
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,440
is merely to create market hype,

99
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,960
while the actual profits don't go to either company

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
but to a third-party company called Morning Star.

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,290
Could you explain what's going on?

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
The document also includes

103
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,000
evidence of related contracts.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,760
Is this true?

105
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,600
Does this Morning Star company

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
actually exist?

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,080
Is it true as the document states

108
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,600
that it's just a shell company created

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,260
to raise money through an IPO?

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,100
These are dual contracts.

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,450
Let me go in with you.

112
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,760
No need,

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,580
I'm sure I can handle this.

114
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,080
Please don't be influenced by these

115
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,760
irrelevant pieces of information.

116
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,680
Please carefully evaluate rumors that lack evidence.

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,640
I have evidence.

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm a lawyer from

119
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
the legal department of Wanqi Group.

120
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,560
The contract in my hand can prove everything.

121
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,320
Everyone can see

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,650
page 24 of the contract.

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,640
This is my investigation result on Qimingxing Company.

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,520
Qimingxing Company is nothing but

125
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,040
a shell company with no actual

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,440
production whatsoever.

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
The contract everyone has seen

128
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,100
is just an external contract.

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,530
While this one in my hand

130
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,370
is the real internal contract.

131
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,810
Give me a moment.

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
I've checked,

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,480
you've been in charge of the contracts all along.

134
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,440
I also know that day

135
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
you were going to submit the final contract.

136
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,760
So I pretended to run into you

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,220
and have dinner together.

138
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,320
I've already sent the content to everyone's phones.

139
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,780
Everyone can check it now.

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,840
These are dual contracts.

141
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
That's right,

142
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,960
how did she get this internal contract?

143
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,080
I apologize everyone,

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,520
this is our internal issue.

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,850
I will resolve it later.

146
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,680
Miss,

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
are you certain that the contract

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
in your hand is authentic and valid?

149
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,360
This is clearly a fake contract

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,840
fabricated to defame our group.

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,840
Everyone, please examine the signatures and stamps carefully,

152
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
they're all fake.

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,800
Fortunately, I noticed this early on,

154
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
and I know your working style.

155
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Miss.

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
If I remember correctly,

157
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,640
you're just a receptionist, aren't you?

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,280
She's not a regular employee,

159
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,080
just a receptionist,

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,410
nothing more than that.

161
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,720
It's only because she seduced

162
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
the young Mr. Qi from Wanqi Group

163
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,120
that she got the opportunity to join the legal department.

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
You're talking nonsense!

165
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,890
Everything you've done

166
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,960
was to sabotage the company.

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,200
I never thought

168
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,680
our company would have such a black sheep like you.

169
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,140
Go to HR and collect your final paycheck now.

170
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,960
Come on.

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
It's all been recorded clearly,

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
this woman seduced my husband.
