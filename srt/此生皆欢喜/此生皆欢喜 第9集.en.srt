1
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,160
Tong Sheng, what have you been doing recently?

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,120
Such an important contract

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
such an important contract

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,080
such a big loophole.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,720
Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,440
Dad, don't be angry.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,160
He's still recovering.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Don't blame him.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,680
Don't go anywhere if you haven't recovered.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,010
Take a good rest at home.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,420
I'll leave the company to Chang Ming for now.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,120
Okay, that's it.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,760
So this is what you want to do.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,640
What does it have to do with you?

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,410
You've gone too far.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,250
You're taking advantage of me.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,420
Morning, Huan.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,610
Have you had breakfast?

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,360
Mr. Qi.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,440
I’ve been so busy recently.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,970
You don't have to come here.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
Is it on your way?

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,320
Let’s go. I’ll take you to dinner.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,160
Mr. Qi, it’s inappropriate.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,800
The company has been saying that

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,200
we...

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,560
Why not?

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Get in the car. Let's go.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,720
No need.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,930
I'll give you a ride.

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,160
What can you give me?

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Your small three rounds.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
It's not like you haven't given it to me.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,330
It's none of your business.

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,160
How can you compare to my car?

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,200
Why are you here?

37
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,560
Why are you here?

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
Me?

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,880
I see.

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,160
This is the other side of you, right?

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,890
Pretend to be poor and date her.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
Who are you? What do you mean?

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,380
You're really heartless.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,970
You said you didn't know me.

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,600
Why did you break up with me?

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,280
Tell me if you don't have feelings for me.

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,160
I'll quit.

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Wait, wait, wait.

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you mean?

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Who are you?

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
I didn't ask you.

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,930
Who are you calling big sister?

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,100
Is there anyone else here?

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,920
Who is she?

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,170
I don't know her.

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Do you hear me?

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
I don't know you.

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,640
I don't care about your business.

59
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,170
I don't want to know either.

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,880
But he must make it clear to me today.

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,040
Don't make things clear.

62
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
What's your relationship with him?

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,130
Who are you to question my brother?

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Your brother?

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,400
He likes someone older like you.

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Watch your mouth.

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,960
What's wrong with you?

68
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,640
Look at your eye bags.

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,680
Isn't it obvious?

70
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,680
Look at you.

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Your wrinkles are deeper than mine.

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,300
How dare you talk about me?

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,860
I really don't know what I like about you.

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
Are you crazy?

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
You know her?

76
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,720
No.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,880
Go up and pull.

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,140
How can you fight if you don't know me?

79
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,080
Enough, Huan.

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,960
It's getting late.

81
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,280
We're going to be late for work.

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Let's go.

83
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,600
Well, we're leaving.

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,480
But you two have a good chat.

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,000
It's better to make things clear.

86
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,560
It's better to make it clear.

87
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,560
Cut the crap. Get in the car.

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,800
Okay.

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Tong Sheng, can we talk?

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,130
What did you call me?

91
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,440
Mr. Chang.

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,090
Yan Yan met Mr. Tong.

93
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

94
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,399
Okay.

95
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,420
You're really heartless.

96
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,920
You said you didn't know me.

97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,450
Why did you break up with me?

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,120
Tell me if you don't have feelings for me.

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
I will quit.

100
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,560
Kim Dahee

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
told me he had no girlfriend.

102
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,600
Who is that girl?

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,450
You're dating in secret. How dare you not tell me?

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
Don't be angry.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,820
Eat something delicious.

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,370
The cake here is delicious.

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
Actually,

108
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,480
I know who that girl is.

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,080
Who?

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Miss Yan.

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,800
She is a daughter of a rich family.

112
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,440
would fall in love with your brother.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
You're really blind.

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,370
But don't worry.

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,360
She's a nice person.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
She's kind-hearted.

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,000
and knowledgeable.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
Not bad?

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
You have no manners.

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,000
It's normal that you can't control your child.

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't want to tell you

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,120
I don't want to tell you.

123
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,250
Maybe he wanted to give you a surprise.

124
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Maybe they've been dating for a long time.

125
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,960
Maybe

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,640
the rice is cooked.

127
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Tong Sheng, what's going on?

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,370
You have to make it clear today.

129
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,600
The person you saw

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
called Tong Sheng.

131
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,400
He's the son of a group.

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,760
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,880
In other words,

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,760
in this world,

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
there is someone who looks exactly like me.

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,920
Maybe we changed our identities unintentionally.

137
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
I’m the son of that group,

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,130
not Kim Daehwa's brother, Kim Daehee.

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,000
No wonder.

140
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
Now,

141
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,160
everything makes sense.

142
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,280
Hello?

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,410
Do you have time to talk?

144
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,780
About your real identity.
