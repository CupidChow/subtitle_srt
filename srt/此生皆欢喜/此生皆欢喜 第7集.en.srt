1
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,400
Your joining tomorrow

2
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm going to cram school.

3
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
What time is it?

4
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,440
Hello, I'm Jack.

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,960
I used to work in a private bank in Singapore.

6
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,600
Welcome to my class.

7
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,920
What we're going to talk about today

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
please turn to page 10.

9
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,740
Please pay attention.

10
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,280
So if you want to catch the trend, you need to move the energy.

11
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,800
The king of mobility is the line.

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
This is very important.

13
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,090
Please note it down.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,540
Who told you to eavesdrop?

15
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,320
Can you understand me?

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,759
Do cleaning.

17
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,640
Can you act like a cleaner?

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,100
How many times has it been?

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Get back to work.

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
You don't work hard

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
And you always come to class.

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,320
Why did you make yourself so miserable?

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,530
Why are you here?

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,450
I'm just passing by.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,960
and pick you up from work.

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,570
What a coincidence.

27
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,880
Let's go.

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,060
Is the tuition expensive?

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,400
Why do you ask?

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,800
Just asking.

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,360
Eight classes cost 10,000 won.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
Hello?

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
This is Snow Leopard Group.

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,480
The plan you designed

35
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,740
won this competition.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,280
Please come to the company tomorrow to get your bonus.

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Okay.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,160
Who is it?

39
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,960
Snow Leopard Group.

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,200
Snow Leopard Group.

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,400
Why did I call you at this hour?

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
He said I won an award.

43
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,680
and asked me to get the award.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Award? How much?

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,210
100,000.

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,200
100,000?

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,400
The things you study every day.

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,960
Just leave it.

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,450
I said I'll take care of you.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Wait.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,680
100,000.

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,650
Not happy at all.

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,090
Is 100,000 a lot?

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,960
Isn’t it much?

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,900
If it were Daxi in the past,

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,560
he would have flew happily.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,740
I don't think 100,000 is much.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,720
When will you

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,200
get your memory back?

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
I don't like your stinky face.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
I want to

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,400
step on you.

63
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,120
I'll kill you!

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,720
Childish.

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
I'll step on you.

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,920
Didn't you say you won't?

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,780
Brother, this is our company.

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Do you remember?

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,340
Let's go. I'll show you again.

70
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,680
I'll show you around.

71
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,200
Hello, I'm here to receive the award.

72
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Where are you going?

73
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,300
Have you found the person I asked you to find?

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
I've sent someone to look for him.

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
But please understand.

76
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
This area is too wide.

77
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Thank you.

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,320
It's my fault.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
I was busy with work

80
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,800
so I lost

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
his twin brother.

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,480
Dad, it's not your fault.

83
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
The situation was complicated.

84
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,920
Plus, Madam was careless.

85
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,740
Chang Ming.

86
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,800
I always thought you knew your place.

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,720
That's why I let you do this.

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,610
I shouldn't have said that.

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
Keep looking.

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Remember, don't let Tong An and Tong Sheng know.

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,200
What did you say your name was?

93
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,280
Kim Dahee.

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,640
Daxi.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,880
Good name.

96
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
What's wrong?

97
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,360
Nothing.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Did anyone recognize you

99
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,780
when you were downstairs?

100
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,170
What do you mean?

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,080
I mean

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,520
a few employees in our company

103
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,280
That's not good.

104
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,120
As you know,

105
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
The most famous thing in our company

106
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,080
is charity.

107
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll let them do some simple work.

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,360
But some people

109
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,040
call everyone Mr. Tong.

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,360
I couldn't stop him.

111
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm going crazy.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,560
Please understand if you meet her.

113
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,440
Not really.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,240
But a few people suddenly bow to me.

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
That's normal.

116
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
You know

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,360
our company is famous for being polite.

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,400
Especially people like you.

119
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,260
Please forgive me.

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,820
Which one is the most famous in your company?

121
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Everyone is famous.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,040
Anyway,

123
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,480
thank you for your contribution.

124
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
If you need anything,

125
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,760
we'll contact you again.

126
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,720
You should go.

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,280
Wait.

128
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,000
Let me give you a ride.

129
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,940
Our company is quite strict with employees.

130
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,560
Look, that's our new factory.

131
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,940
What are you doing?

132
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
I just want to show you around.

133
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,080
You can go now.

134
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,800
Ridiculous.

135
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,680
It's you.

136
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,120
The proposal you made last time

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,520
your proposal last time.

138
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I have a better job now.

139
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,280
Would you consider it?

140
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,160
What?

141
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Our company

142
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
a branch company in Shanghai

143
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,560
needs talents like you.

144
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,640
About the salary?

145
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,160
Very good.

146
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
And it's full of food and accommodation.

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,720
After a year,

148
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
I'll give you a house in the city.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,760
Do you want to consider it?

150
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,780
Mr. Chang, I've found out.

151
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Kim Daxi was hospitalized that day.

152
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,580
