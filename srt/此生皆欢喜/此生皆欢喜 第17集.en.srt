1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,280
Daxi.

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,560
Daxi.

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,280
Daxi.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,760
Daxi.

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,160
Daxi, is that you?

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,280
Dahuan.

7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,600
Dahuan.

8
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,340
Daxi's accident happened because of me.

9
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,760
I've let him down.

10
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,280
But please stop torturing yourself like this.

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,780
Tongsheng.

12
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
Let's break up.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Changming has been arrested by the police.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,730
He confessed and surrendered.

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,540
But Daxi is still missing.

16
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,010
We're doing everything we can to find him.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,040
I understand.

18
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,120
Tongsheng, I don't blame you.

19
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
But you look exactly like Daxi.

20
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
Seeing you reminds me of him.

21
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,200
So it's better if we don't see each other anymore.

22
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,680
Mr. Qi.

23
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
Why are you here?

24
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Don't tell me

25
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
that since you came back from the hospital,

26
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
you haven't had a proper meal?

27
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,560
I have.

28
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,280
Come on, eat this while it's hot.

29
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,490
Hurry, before it gets cold.

30
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,340
I'm not hungry, thank you, Mr. Qi.

31
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,000
Your former boss personally brought you food.

32
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,280
You wouldn't refuse me this small courtesy, would you?

33
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
Eat up.

34
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

35
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
Look at your place.

36
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
It hardly looks like a home anymore.

37
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,120
This won't do.

38
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,080
I can't stand it anymore.

39
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
What a burden I've taken on.

40
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,159
The great young master of the Qi family,

41
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,040
now acting like a male servant.

42
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,120
Mr. Qi, thank you.

43
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,360
Dahuan, I know you must be feeling terrible right now.

44
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,520
But you need to pull yourself together.

45
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,050
Look at the state you're in,

46
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,170
Daxi would be heartbroken if he saw you like this.

47
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,330
Have you been in touch with him lately?

48
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,120
What's really going on between you two?

49
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,760
Actually,

50
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
I miss him a lot.

51
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,440
But whenever I think of him, I think of Daxi.

52
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,760
I...

53
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
I simply can't face him.

54
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,840
We probably can't be together anymore.

55
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,160
But right now,

56
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
you still want his comfort more than anything,

57
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,480
don't you?

58
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,640
Why am I, an outsider, worrying about all this?

59
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,440
Alright, I'll be going now.

60
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Hey,

61
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,940
make sure you finish all of this food.

62
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,940
Did you hear me?

63
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,330
That's an order from your former boss.

64
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,159
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

65
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,500
I'll be going then.

66
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
Tongsheng, get out here now!

67
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
Move!

68
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,280
Mr. Tong.

69
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm sorry.

70
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Mr. Tong.

71
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,320
Looks like you're doing well for yourself.

72
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,360
If I remember correctly,

73
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,330
between our two companies,

74
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,600
there have been quite a few rumors circulating.

75
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
It's not really appropriate for you to come see me now, is it?

76
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,400
Cut the formal talk.

77
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240
I just want to know if you still care about Dahuan.

78
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,880
Do you have any idea how she's been doing lately?

79
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,440
If you care about her so much,

80
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
then I'll step aside for you.

81
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,680
What did you say?

82
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,040
I want some canned fruit.

83
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,160
Then I'll go buy some now.

84
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Dahuan, I'm going abroad.

85
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,220
Take care of yourself.
