1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,200
Mr. Qi, are you alright?

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,600
Why do you look listless?

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,860
Like you didn't sleep.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,920
I didn't sleep.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,480
Why didn't you sleep?

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,360
Just do it.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,320
The president is here.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,840
What?

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Mom.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,170
Why are you here?

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,050
Don't you have anything to tell me?

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,080
What is it? Nothing.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,680
Everything is fine.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,940
I heard you've been here early recently.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,680
Look at your dark circles.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,000
I've been working hard

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,200
That's why I'm here.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,240
Do I have to set an example?

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,280
It's great that you're so concerned about the blind date.

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,160
I introduced so many girlfriends to you.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
but you didn't like them.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,320
For so many years,

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,780
I don't know if you've ever had a girlfriend.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,960
You should at least bring her back to show me.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,039
Mom.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,039
Look at

27
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,440
What kind of people did you introduce to me?

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Watch your mouth.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,280
Last time, she was Mr Wu's daughter.

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,320
Last time, she was Mr. Zhao's daughter.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,380
These two uncles watched you grow up.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,840
Their daughter is great.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,180
You still dislike her?

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,240
Mom, don't worry.

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,480
I will find someone you like.

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,720
So you have someone you like?

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,210
Whose daughter?

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,250
you don't need to worry.

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Think carefully.

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,560
This is not just your own business.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,320
All right.

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,759
Don't worry.

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,930
I'm sure you'll like it.

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,440
You always have surprises.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,240
What's wrong?

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
I didn't expect you

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,240
to a place like this.

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,170
Isn't this good?

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,760
Their barbecue is amazing.

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Try this.

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,800
Will you have diarrhea if you eat this?

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,160
It feels a little dirty

53
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,840
It's because the table is shabby

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
and the decoration is relatively casual.

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,560
It's on the roadside of the city.

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,680
So...

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,930
Do you think it's not clean?

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,880
No.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,700
Do you want to hear a story?

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Sure.

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,900
There was a sister and brother

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
My parents passed away when my brother was very young.

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
She's the only one who earns money to support her family.

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,640
In order to let her brother go to college,

65
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,440
she tried her best to make money.

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,560
The more anxious she is to make money, the easier she gets cheated.

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,600
In the end, she lost all her money.

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,460
and owed a debt.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,760
and fell sick from overwork.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,760
The younger brother had to drop out.

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,220
wandering around to find a way to make money.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,960
Every night

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,960
at the market every night.

74
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,640
Later he met a kind boss

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,760
The one

76
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,360
He knew about his siblings

77
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,720
he provided them food every day.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,530
He also told his brother

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
he doesn't care about other places,

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,720
he doesn't need to worry about food.

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,579
is what you eat in front of you.

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,560
So

83
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,400
you can't judge it by its appearance.

84
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,940
Just like a person.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I find you are quite philosophical.

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,800
What happened to the siblings?

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,220
They were fine after that.

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
I kind of miss home.

89
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,960
Homesick?

90
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,660
I thought you just came out from home.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
Nothing.

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,360
I find that I don't understand you anymore.

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,209
What kind of person are you?

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm definitely different from you.

95
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
Really?

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,890
How is it different?

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,100
You won't understand.

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm sure you don't want to know my other side.

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,000
Not necessarily.

100
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,800
Then show me today.

101
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,560
Forget it. You won't want to experience it.

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
Then you know I don't want to experience it.

103
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,530
Then eat the skewers the boss baked for me.

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,450
Isn't it delicious?

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
It's surprisingly delicious.

106
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
I made you not believe me.

107
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,520
Am I wrong?

108
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,760
As punishment,

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,660
can you continue playing with me?

110
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
Is this a punishment?

111
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Are you paying me or am I paying you?

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,580
Do you take it with you?

113
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,840
Yes.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I'll make sure you enjoy it today.

115
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,320
Here.

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
It’s settled if there’s no problem.

117
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,720
OK, Mr. Qi.

118
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,520
I’ll go back now.

119
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,820
Dahuan, are you free tonight?

120
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
What’s wrong, Mr. Qi?

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,400
Do you have any work to do?

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,360
No, no.

123
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,240
I know a very delicious restaurant.

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,659
Let's go together.

125
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,960
I have a lot of things to do tonight.

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Maybe I shouldn't go.

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,860
I'll be busy tomorrow.

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,450
No hurry.

129
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
Who is he? He's so handsome.

130
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,650
Who are you looking for?

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Mr. Qi.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,740
Give me another cup of coffee.

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,890
What are you doing here?

134
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm bored at home.

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,600
So handsome.

136
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
Your coffee.

137
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Daxi.

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,440
You look familiar. Who are you?

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,900
The one riding a tricycle.

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,320
Yes, that's me.

141
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,940
So you're Kim Dae-hwan's boyfriend, right?

142
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
No, no.

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,080
He's my brother.

145
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,240
Younger brother.

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Kim Dahee.

147
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,409
Brother.

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,560
But why is he wearing Mr. Qi’s clothes?

149
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,460
I live in his house now.

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,560
My house?

151
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,240
No.

152
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
What is this?

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,480
He is the French tutor I hired.

154
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,810
He's teaching me private lessons at my house.

155
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,130
Understand?

156
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,080
I see.

157
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,720
Are you all too idle?

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
You don't have enough work, do you?

159
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
Do you still want to get off work?

160
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,280
Let's go.

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
You're so fierce.

162
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm fierce?

163
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,520
By the way, what were you talking about?

164
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,560
Mr. Qi asked me if I want to have dinner with him.

165
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,360
Sure, let’s go together.

166
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,640
No.

167
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,240
It's none of your business.

168
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm your personal tutor 24 hours a day.

169
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,130
Of course I have to do my job.

170
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,520
How is it?

171
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,250
How are you doing at Mr. Qi’s house?

172
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,159
I feel familiar.

173
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,409
I think I used to live in this kind of house.

174
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,040
You think too much.

175
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Work hard.

176
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,400
Maybe

177
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
you can live in a big house like this.

178
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,960
Get in.

179
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,740
Come on.

180
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,400
Get in.

181
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,890
What do you want?

182
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,100
Nothing. Let's go.

183
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,260
That's enough.

184
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Don't push your luck.

185
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
They are together.

186
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,520
What are you looking at?

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,960
Let's go. Aren't you hungry?

188
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,520
What do you think? Do I look good?

189
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,610
Kim Dahuan, what are you thinking?

190
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,760
Why aren't you dressed?

191
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,690
I'm your brother. Don't be afraid.

192
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,440
No, I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

193
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
This dress suits you. It's pretty.

194
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,440
I have some confusing memories

195
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
in my mind these days.

196
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,800
Maybe my memory will come back in a few days.

197
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Maybe I'm not your brother.

198
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,480
but a rich man.

199
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,760
That's enough.

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,820
You've been acting weird lately.

201
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
Don't think too much.

202
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,090
If I'm really a rich man,

203
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,780
I'll marry you.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
What are you talking about? I'm hanging up.

205
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,720
I haven't seen him for a long time.

206
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,520
This kid

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,530
I don’t know what he’s doing at home every day.

208
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,360
Mr. Qi.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
Mr. Qi, are you home?

210
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,200
Wenhan.

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,760
Wenhan.

212
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Wenhan.

213
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Wenhan.

214
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,010
What did you tell my mom?

215
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
Just tell the truth.

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,440
You...

217
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,280
How long have you been like this?

218
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,040
At first,

219
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
But Mr. Qi seems to like me very much.

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,040
He asked me to move to his house immediately.

221
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,000
So

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,040
Qi Wenhan called you?

223
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,360
Yes.

224
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,640
I rejected him at first.

225
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,200
I don't think it's a good idea.

226
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
But he's too enthusiastic.

227
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,240
and persistent.

228
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,170
It's like I can't wait for a moment.

229
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,560
You call that truth?

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
Something like that.

231
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,520
But your mom doesn't seem to like me.

232
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,180
She wants me to move out today.

233
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,640
I'll tell you in advance.

234
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,680
you have to pay your salary.

235
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,080
No.

236
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
Why should I pay?

237
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,600
The additional terms you asked me to write.

238
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,480
So I added this.

239
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,690
If any uncontrollable factors

240
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
the service will be terminated.

241
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,280
Party A pays Party B.

242
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
When the legal age of retirement is approved, and renew the contract.

243
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,320
4, after the contract expires, Anyone who thinks that It should be.

244
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,380
All 2 investments.

245
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,120
You win.

246
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,200

251

Let me finish.

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,640
Mom, calm down.

253
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
I have my reasons.

254
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,080
Calm down, Mom.

255
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
That man and I...

256
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,240
