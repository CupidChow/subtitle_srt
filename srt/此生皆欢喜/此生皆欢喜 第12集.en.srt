1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,680
You were brave that day.

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,140
You fought back so easily.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,480
This is different.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Look how cruel it is.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Hurry up.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,610
Are you going to kill me?

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,400
Can't I?

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,530
Let me teach you.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,240
You have to pay for this.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,520
You're afraid of something too.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,880
What are you doing?

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,140
Are you flirting here?

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,519
Hurry up, crazy.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,840
Let me do it.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
You're really weird.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,320
Logically, you're a member of the Tong family now.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,080
Why are you still delivering fish?

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Haven't you ever thought of becoming your eldest son?

20
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,880
It must be a lie if I didn't think about it.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,140
But I'm used to being free.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,400
People there

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,490
It's too scary. It doesn't suit me.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Right.

25
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,080
If I were you, I would have made the same choice.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
I would be carefree and free.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,080
You don't know how lucky you are.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,960
What if you follow your dog?

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
I guess you can't follow him.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,320
What?

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,490
You want me to take the initiative?

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,480
Why did you ask me out today?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Did something happen at work?

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
Do we only get to know each other

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,560
at work?

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Dahuan.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,740
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,280
I’m here for the merger.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,490
I'll make you stand firm in the legal department.

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Thank you.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,560
There are many things I don't understand.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,160
Don't be too nervous.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,860
Do you remember

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,680
our club blind date?

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,620
You were kicked out and sang three songs.

46
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,680
You know?

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,450
At that time, the boys were in trouble.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,920
They were talking about you behind your back.

49
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,579
That's when I noticed you too.

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Don't mention that.

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,960
It was so awkward.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,880
I remember I lost a necklace

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,210
after the performance.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I know about it.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,460
You searched backstage and asked me.

56
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,640
Yes.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,560
You helped me look for it for a long time.

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,440
But you still lost it.

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,760
You don't want the old but the new

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,620
Speaking of which,

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I haven't been back to school for a long time.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
Me too.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's go there today.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,880
Okay, I'll go to the bathroom.

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
We'll leave when we get back.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,839
Okay.

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,159
This necklace is expensive, right?

68
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:50,920
Dahuan doesn't accept it.

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
It's so precious.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,360
It's you, brother.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
What's wrong?

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
Can't I give you a gift?

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Sure, but I'll take it for my sister.

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,210
After all, Dahuan and I are family.

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,160
You're so nosy.

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,320
You're welcome.

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,600
Just one thing.

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,760
Stay away from Kim Dahuan.

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,080
What era is this?

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,960
Dahuan should have the right to choose.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
If you really love her,

82
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,600
you should respect

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
what she really thinks.

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,360
What if she's been waiting to marry me?

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
I don't care what she thinks.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
I hope you don't be too dirty.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,420
You should show some respect.

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,320
Let's go.

89
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,640
What's wrong?

90
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,200
You don't look well.

91
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,360
It's okay. Your brother came just now.

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,460
How is it? You must be tired today.

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,720
What is this?

94
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Okay, I'll transfer it to you later.

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,440
Let's continue tomorrow.

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,360
Again?

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Are you crazy?

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,120
I do.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,160
Kim Dahee.

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
Give it to me.

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,080
What is it?

102
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,240
Keep pretending.

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,450
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,159
Why did you take away

105
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,290
that Senpai gave me?

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,760
That's right. You can't do this.

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Where did you put it? Take it out.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,159
Did you leave it in the shop?

109
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,020
Let's go get it.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Sister, the situation is a bit special.

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,960
I apologize to you first.

112
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,620
I'll explain to you next time.

113
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,210
Let's go.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,860
Sister, we'll get it back for you.

115
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
What era is it now?

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Dahuan should have the right to choose.

117
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,240
What are you looking at?

118
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,320
Nothing.

119
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,400
Are you dating someone?

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,930
Am I going to have a sister-in-law?

121
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,000
It’s up to him now.

122
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
Is it Miss Yan?

123
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
I can come and go freely now.

124
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,840
You don't have to visit me every day.

125
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
It's okay, brother. I just like to bring you food.

126
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,240
Thanks.

127
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,650
I'll leave it here. See you.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
Your department store has been busy

129
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,760
the acquisition of Snow Leopard Group recently?

130
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,400
Yes.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,080
And I have to work overtime every night recently.

132
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,010
But luckily, it's the final stage.

133
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,480
We'll be family after the merger.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,820
Wait for me.

135
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,280
The coffee here

136
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,540
is exactly the same as our old school.

137
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,760
I remember you love their coffee.

138
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
You still remember this?

139
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,960
Dahuan.

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,770
Are you happy being with me?

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,360
Yes.

142
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Well,

143
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,700
can you accept my gift?
