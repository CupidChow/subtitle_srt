00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,440
A new wish challenge begins again.

5
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,520
We need to buy ingredients

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,320
in groups.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,840
They bought a lot.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,960
They bought so many things.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,680
We'd better follow our principle

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,280
we'll try our best.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,360
Which group do you want to eat?

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
Pick your own food, please.

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,800
OK. Come on.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,760
Our fourth wish challenge

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,120
It's a badminton game.

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,680
to get the tool to play badminton.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,840
Don't run.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,240
What are you doing?

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
You are mine.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,720
How can I call this?

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
Get in.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Let's go.

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,479
One.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,640
Yes.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,840
A: &

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,280
Ywa7ij

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,160
What is this

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,400
What is this?

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,080
What?

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Don't talk.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm not filming today. I'm leaving.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Good morning.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,320
Today is the second day of team building.

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,840
A new day

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,080
A new wish challenge begins again

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,720
Before the challenge begins,

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,919
let's divide them into three, three, two

38
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,920
into three, three, two.

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
Three groups.

40
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,800
Same.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,360
It should be the same group.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,079
The tallest person in our team is together.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,120
Today's wish challenge

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,320
is still related to your profession.

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,760
rich life experience

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,320
It makes actors

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,720
to increase gradually.

49
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,560
He transforms into old men and women

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,840
Kind cotton iron

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,000
and complete the challenge of the dragon catching.

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
The Dragon King is here.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,720
Three groups of players draw a word respectively.

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,560
as the opening phrase for shopping catching a dragon.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,120
South American white and shrimp.

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Pineapple.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,880
Peanuts.

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Start counting when you get off.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,480
60 minutes.

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,080
Members of each group are shopping in the market.

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,120
Ginger.

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,000
Ginger sugar.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Lastly, the food bought by the dragon

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
for other teams.

65
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,120
The longest team

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
can choose one group

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
and enjoy the food.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,320
The last one will be punished.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,720
The amount for each group is 200 won.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
Sir, may I ask

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
Can we repeat our words?

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,960
We can't buy things that repeat.

73
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,440
No matter what you choose for others,

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,640
you have to catch the dragon to the longest.

75
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
The longest way to choose. Right.

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,680
I'll definitely take care of Jacky.

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
He lost all day yesterday.

78
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,960
Let's make him work hard today.

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,200
What's in your bag?

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Take a bottle.

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
So many Chunzhen yogurt.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,920
Of course.

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,040
It's hot.

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
It's really good for thirst

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,760
Try it.

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,120
The fruit fragrance is so strong.

87
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,000
And the ingredients are very simple.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,360
It has strong blueberry fragrance.

89
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,680
Do you feel fresh?

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,200
Cheers.

91
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,920
Here we go.

92
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
Where are you going?

93
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,760
Fishery.

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,680
Find a fish.

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
Let's go to the fruit first.

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
You three are here, right?

97
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,320
The whole one, right?

98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,400
What about us?

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,600
Seafood.

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
I saw

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
I saw it.

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,200
Let's go.

103
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
Shrimp.

104
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,480
Do you have shrimp?

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,960
Is this right?

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,640
Look at this.

107
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,920
How much is one?

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,960
How much is one?

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,920
We'll buy one.

110
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
We'll just buy one.

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Buy more.

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,200
Thank you.

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,280
Shrimp.

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
Let's find a good one.

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
Shrimp.

116
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,640
Shrimp pancake.

117
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,680
Biscuits.

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Biscuits

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Where do you buy shrimp pancakes?

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,800
That restaurant

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
Shrimp pancakes need to go to the restaurant

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
Do you have shrimp pancakes?

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,240
Yes.

124
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,680
Buy a bag

125
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,040
After buying this

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,080
Biscuits

127
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,760
What are you doing?

128
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,080
It's okay to dry chili.

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,760
Chili

130
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,159
Beef white.

131
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,800
Biscuits first.

132
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,560
Then dry and spicy.

133
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
And white.

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,760
Do you have cookies?

135
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Yes, here.

136
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,960
I don't want a box. I only want one, okay?

137
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,520
Sure.

138
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Dried chili.

139
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,040
Give me one.

140
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Geng Bai.

141
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,960
Right?

142
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,640
This one.

143
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,120
One.

144
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
Just one.

145
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,560
One.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
We're still following our principle.

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
we should buy as much as we can.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Try the cheapest.

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,760
Sure.

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
Pineapple first.

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Hello.

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,920
How much is the pineapple?

153
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
If you want one,

154
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
7 yuan per catty.

155
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,520
I want one for 7 yuan per catty.

156
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
OK.

157
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,200
Let's count the money.

158
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
18 yuan.

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Can you give me a discount?

160
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,760
We're all northerners.

161
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,760
OK.

162
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,840
OK.

163
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,960
How about this?

164
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
and raise ten yuan.

165
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Is it too much?

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Okay.

167
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,400
Let me.

168
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,520
I'll carry it for you.

169
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
You'll bargain.

170
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
Okay, I'll bargain.

171
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
Pineapple, radish.

172
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,560
Then buy the radish first.

173
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,760
It's okay, auntie.

174
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
We'll take all three radish.

175
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,840
Nine yuan in total?

176
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,760
9 yuan.

177
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,840
Can you give me a discount?

178
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,880
I'll say a price.

179
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
For auspicious six yuan.

180
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Eight yuan.

181
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Eight, okay?

182
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,280
15 yuan for three catties.

183
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,000
Give me another discount.

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
12 yuan.

185
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
You're good at bargaining.

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
Thank you.

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,600
Wish you a good business.

188
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Thank you.

189
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
Have a good business.

190
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,880
The tofu is over there.

191
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
This tofu

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
How much is this?

193
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
Six yuan a catty.

194
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
Let's take a bag first.

195
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
Are you from Sichuan?

196
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,960
We're all northerners.

197
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,680
Northerners?

198
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,360
Are you from Sichuan?

199
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,360
Fellow.

200
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm from Chongqing.

201
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm from Chongqing.

202
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,440
Right?

203
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,520
I went to a university in Sichuan.

204
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,080
Well...

205
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,120
The next step is to bargain.

206
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,040
How much is this bag?

207
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,480
Two kilos and ten taels?

208
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,000
How much?

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
Give me 14 yuan.

210
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
14 yuan.

211
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,360
It's already cheap.

212
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,520
People from the same hometown are useful.

213
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,960
There are no peanuts.

214
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
We're fine. Let's take a look and think.

215
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
There must be.

216
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,240
Hello, auntie.

217
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
Where are the peanuts?

218
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,760
It's where we sell peanuts.

219
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,039
Do you want peanuts or...

220
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
Do you have peanuts?

221
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,760
Yes. Then...

222
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,799
Let me see which one.

223
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,320
Where?

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,880
Sure.

225
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,120
I like all of them.

226
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
How much is this?

227
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,240
This is 7 yuan per catty.

228
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
I can buy more from you.

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Can you give me a discount?

230
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,880
This is the lowest price.

231
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,480
I can't buy a cheaper one.

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Can it be cheaper?

233
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Are you picking vegetables?

234
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,280
Help us chop it.

235
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,760
How much is this?

236
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,720
His is 26.

237
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
26. Make it thirty.

238
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's make it thirty.

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,680
Liu Liu Da Shun, 16.

240
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,880
Liu Liu Da Shun is 26.

241
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm determined not to take advantage of you.

242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
Are you going to whip me?

243
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,680
Let's go.

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,920
And I'll buy ginger from you.

245
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,440
Ginger. Ginger.

246
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Wait, think about it.

247
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
What's behind the Kang?

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,080
Kang

249
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,440
What?

250
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Jiang Xuening.

251
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,720
Ginger tea.

252
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,200
Ginger sugar.

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
This is good.

254
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,320
Boss, do you have ginger sugar?

255
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,840
I have ginger and sugar.

256
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,960
There's no ginger sugar.

257
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,120
What should we do? Let's go.

258
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,200
Kang

259
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,120
I have a headache now.

260
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
We want to win.

261
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,560
Jiang Xuening.

262
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm very anxious now.

263
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,240
Ask for help.

264
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,680
I don't know.

265
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,520
Please help me.

266
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,920
I don't know.

267
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,320
Are you okay?

268
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't know.

269
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,720
Do me a favor.

270
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
Just wait to lose.

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,840
What is it?

272
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,080
What's your name?

273
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,000
White coconut.

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,400
Gimbap

275
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,080
White coconut seaweed

276
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
Buy a white coconut.

277
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,520
Purple sugar blue.

278
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,360
Blueberry.

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
Plum pork.

280
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,480
Meat.

281
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,240
This is squid.

282
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,480
Five minutes left.

283
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,440
Five minutes countdown.

284
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,280
We don't care.

285
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,960
It doesn't matter.

286
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
We already won.

287
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
Let's see what they're buying.

288
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,040
Let me see.

289
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,960
Wang Xingyue.

290
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,040
Welcome eight guests.

291
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,440
I heard you are very good at the market.

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,520
Some people have received a lot.

293
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,120
Who is it?

294
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
Our team.

295
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
Absolutely our team.

296
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,520
No.

297
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,000
They have a lot.

298
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,040
We have a lot too, right?

299
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,640
We have a lot too.

300
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,760
We have different advantages.

301
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
Let's announce

302
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
the third place of food relay.

303
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm nervous.

304
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,280
The third place of catching the dragon is

305
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,040
Liu Xiening and Jacky Qin.

306
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,720
always lose.

307
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,320
Now I'll announce the first place

308
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,840
The first place is...

309
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Who is it?

310
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,200
Tell me.

311
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,880
White deer, Wang Xingyue, Ye Xiyue.

312
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Congratulations.

313
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,760
Congratulations on getting the right to choose.

314
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,640
Which group

315
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,000
which group will you choose?

316
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
We choose our own.

317
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Choose ourselves.

318
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,000
I followed the rules.

319
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,480
No.

320
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
No violation.

321
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
We can't break the rules.

322
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
The ingredients we bought

323
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,440
for the other team members.

324
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
You can't choose your own.

325
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,120
No.

326
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,600
Yes.

327
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,520
Fair and just.

328
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,280
Why?

329
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
Choose your own.

330
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
Please.

331
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
Pick your own one.

332
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,120
Please.

333
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,120
No.

334
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,720
No.

335
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,320
No, I don't agree.

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
No.

337
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,120
No.

338
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
What is this meat?

339
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,520
Pig skin.

340
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,200
No.

341
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,360
Why did you buy a pot of ginger?

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
I don't know.

343
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,720
for something.

344
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,520
How about we

345
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,280
ally?

346
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,160
Just connect it.

347
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,720
Buy them

348
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,000
some bad food

349
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,120
so they can't eat.

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Yes.

351
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,520
Okay.

352
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,040
Ginger.

353
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,920
And ginger.

354
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,880
This one

355
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,640
This is not good

356
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,880
Then the dishes may taste bad.

357
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,400
Buy more

358
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
Buy more

359
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,040
What is the cheapest pork for pig

360
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,680
Five pieces of pork skin

361
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
Buy something bad.

362
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
and make them unable to eat.

363
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,760
Unfair.

364
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
I don't eat pork skin.

365
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,920
So we choose this.

366
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Bai Lu, stop thinking about it.

367
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,120
Let's choose this one.

368
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,000
We can only choose this one.

369
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,560
We're really wolf whiskers in the market.

370
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,640
To win this game,

371
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,440
to win this game?

372
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
The white deer group chose

373
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,920
of Liu Xiening's group.

374
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,160
Because we can't choose our own food.

375
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
Liu Xiening's team got

376
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,280
Zhang Linghe's group.

377
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,920
Zhang Linghe's team got the food from White Deer Group.

378
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,680
Yes, we're yours anyway.

379
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,440
They can't choose their own.

380
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,720
I made a mistake.

381
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,280
Seriously.

382
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,080
Come on.

383
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,520
Come on.

384
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Come on, let's exchange.

385
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,200
I don't want yours.

386
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,520
What is this?

387
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,400
Pig skin.

388
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,080
How to eat this?

389
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,760
Come on.

390
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,720
The collagen.

391
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
Thank you, Zhang Linghe.

392
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Zhou Dawei and Cui Shaoyang.

393
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
Thank you.

394
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,280
Why are you still holding a grudge against us?

395
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,840
No.

396
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Thank you.

397
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,040
I mean thank you.

398
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,720
I mean

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,200
I mean thank you.

400
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:00,960
Thank you.

401
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Let's enjoy

402
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,520
The fire is on.

403
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,400
You can eat now.

404
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,240
I don't need to cook.

405
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,160
It's raw.

406
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
This will cause diarrhea, right?

407
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
You didn't even buy any meat.

408
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,560
I really...

409
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,720
It's not us.

410
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,640
Ask them.

411
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
Why don't you buy some meat?

412
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,920
There's no meat.

413
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Isn't it delicious?

414
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
You even put ginger in it.

415
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,560
Ginger is for detoxification.

416
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,120
It's okay

417
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,560
The fish is sliced

418
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Good choice

419
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Who bought this squid

420
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,920
Delicious

421
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,120
Squid is really delicious.

422
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,840
They're... They're...

423
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,400
Plum dried vegetables.

424
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,240
Cabbage.

425
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,520
I don't want to eat olive anymore.

426
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,119
I'm really good at making this.

427
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,400
Try it.

428
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,640
Is it okay?

429
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,079
Not bad.

430
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's enjoy life.

431
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,720
We can only enjoy delicious food.

432
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,040
You need to apply the side of the noodles like this.

433
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Like this

434
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,599
Then what? Like this.

435
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,800
Right in the middle first

436
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,960
You have to get the stuffing first.

437
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,680
Hold on.

438
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,240
Look.

439
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
First school is good. Not bad.

440
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,720
Let me show you.

441
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,640
It's good.

442
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,400
It's so delicious.

443
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,840
Babies.

444
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,200
Welcome to our lunch today.

445
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,920
Have a look.

446
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,040
This is provided by our White Deer Group.

447
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,960
super delicious dumplings.

448
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,880
The dumplings are too thin

449
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,760
I cooked it lightly.

450
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,280
I believe it melts in the mouth.

451
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
Have a dumpling.

452
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
Let me eat north in Sanya.

453
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,240
Let's go home, guys.

454
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,160
The dumplings are too thin.

455
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Give me a dumpling.

456
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
Let me eat north in Sanya.

457
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,240
Let's go home, guys.

458
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,840
Mom, I'm home.

459
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,640
Very good.

460
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
I think their food

461
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,400
are better than ours.

462
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,440
Do you want a dumpling?

463
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
Do you want a dumpling

464
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,480
I made them.

465
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,520
I made dumplings for her

466
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,840
This is fried egg dumplings.

467
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,200
It's made. Look.

468
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
It's delicious.

469
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,560
Heart dumplings.

470
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
You two don't have meat.

471
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,080
I'll give you some meat.

472
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
We can give you some.

473
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,480
Okay?

474
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,520
We can share some with you.

475
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,360
It's okay.

476
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,640
Sure.

477
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
I’m happy.

478
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Wang Xingyue, have some shrimp.

479
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,880
Don’t you like shrimp?

480
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,520
Give me some meat.

481
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I can't take it anymore.

482
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
Eat.

483
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,040
I think it's good that we enjoy it.

484
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,480
It's about unity and friendship.

485
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,840
This is delicious.

486
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,080
Take more.

487
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I want one.

488
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Smells good.

489
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm full.

490
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,520
You just enjoyed the delicious food.

491
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,280
Now,

492
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,640
we'll announce the punishment of the third place.

493
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,600
I heard you worked very hard

494
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,800
during filming.

495
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
With high temperature

496
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,440
wearing thick and thick clothes.

497
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,440
Our punishment is

498
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,320
in the high temperature of Sanya,

499
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,920
in Sanya.

500
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,680
Put on the coat.

501
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,400
Take a photo.

502
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,800
Now Liu Xiening and Jacky

503
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,520
put on your clothes.

504
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,280
Put it on.

505
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,000
Take care.

506
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
Remember to team up with me.

507
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
We may lose.

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
I've memorized it.

509
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,440
This is your

510
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
in your drama?

511
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,120
This is mine.

512
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,160
It's yours.

513
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,320
Okay.

514
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,080
It's cool.

515
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,040
What are you doing?

516
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
Nothing.

517
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
We just want to show it.

518
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,400
Good.

519
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,600
You should look at the camera.

520
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,760
Y-7

521
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,200
YXATj

522
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,400
YXAZZ.

523
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,840
Please take your seats.

524
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Next is our favorite

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
our favorite official box.

526
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,680
Please send your representatives

527
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,720
to draw three wishes.

528
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,560
Let them smoke.

529
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,080
They wear leather clothes to smoke.

530
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,600
Okay, I'll draw one first.

531
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,400
Then you do it.

532
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,520
He stabbed Wang Xingyue’s face.

533
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,720
Let me see.

534
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,560
I want to see Wang Xingyue’s abs.

535
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,920
I have a question.

536
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,920
Who was

537
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,360
our main player?

538
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Am I always there

539
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,680
I've been eating.

540
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,720
Hurry up.

541
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,640
Here's your fan's wish.

542
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,920
Dawei, come and be my substitute.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Substitution.

544
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,520
Come, Dawei.

545
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
Let's show

546
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,360
of "Peace Like a Dream".

547
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,080
Wow, he's hard when he's not nervous.

548
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,880
Really.

549
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
Come on. Come on.

550
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
Dawei can do it.

551
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
One, two.

552
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,560
Substitution.

553
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,000
What about yours?

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,080
Just make Dawei's face into mine.

555
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
Dawei's body is really good.

556
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Come on.

557
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,920
Princess.

558
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
It's your turn.

559
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,640
You've got the vibe.

560
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,080
Look.

561
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
Zhen.

562
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,880
Take a look.

563
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,920
Why are you blushing?

564
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,200
What's this sound?

565
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,400
What is this?

566
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,160
No, read it out.

567
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,720
I can't.

568
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,080
What's wrong?

569
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,160
Let me show you.

570
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,960
I can't read it.

571
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,680
Wow this

572
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,160
I want to see all boys show their abs.

573
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Everyone, show your abs.

574
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,080
The crew has gone too far.

575
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,920
They arranged us to have this meal for lunch.

576
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
I want it.

577
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,040
This has to be high and low.

578
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,080
Sorry. Come on.

579
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,880
Come on.

580
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,200
I want to see.

581
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,280
I want to know

582
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,480
is this the only one?

583
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,640
Qing.

584
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,280
Actors' body and physical fitness

585
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,600
needs to match the character.

586
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,520
So let's test

587
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,480
the actors' results.

588
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,520
Open it.

589
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,720
Just try and see what's inside.

590
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,080
Wait.

591
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,160
Let's take a look.

592
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,600
I haven't called yet.

593
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,360
Let me do it.

594
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,520
Let me see.

595
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,440
Let me see this.

596
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,280
Dawei, this one.

597
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,960
This is mine.

598
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,800
This is good.

599
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Right?

600
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
What are you doing?

601
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,000
You...

602
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,040
Girls look at you.

603
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,680
Gentlemen.

604
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,920
Hurry up, you five.

605
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,800
Hurry up.

606
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't have it.

607
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't have any.

608
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,520
Let me see.

609
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,560
You do this first.

610
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,000
Give me a light here.

611
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
Can I hit it from top to down?

612
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,840
I need a corridor lamp.

613
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,960
Round lamp.

614
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,600
Let me do it.

615
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,080
Who's the first?

616
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,720
I'll light it up for you.

617
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
I'm old.

618
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,360
The first one.

619
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,280
Come on, the first one.

620
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,320
Is low light OK?

621
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,400
Dawei.

622
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
Let Dawei show the last one.

623
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,280
Let him show us first.

624
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,960
It's okay.

625
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
The sooner you die, the sooner you come back to life.

626
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,240
Let me block it first.

627
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,800
Open it.

628
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,320
Okay, okay.

629
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,680
OK. OK.

630
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,560
I'll do the next one.

631
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,320
Three, two, one. Start.

632
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
Wow.

633
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,240
You first.

634
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,080
Cover it.

635
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
Me too.

636
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,800
It's okay. Come on.

637
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,400
Twist it.

638
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,080
Fold it.

639
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
Two pieces.

640
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,800
I want these two pieces.

641
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,560
Let's support him.

642
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
No matter what we do later, we'll be wow.

643
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,280
OK.

644
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
One, two, three.

645
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,760
Wow.

646
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,840
Wow.

647
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,400
Okay, next.

648
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
I'm crazy.

649
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,520
Next.

650
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,880
Is it my turn?

651
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Your turn.

652
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,800
Wrap it up.

653
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,520
Make a dent.

654
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,240
Show your clothes.

655
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,640
Lower line.

656
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,080
OK. Come on.

657
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,040
Squeeze like this.

658
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,000
Three, two, one. Come on.

659
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
I'm suffocating.

660
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,880
I can't.

661
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,200
Let me see the light first.

662
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,520
Okay. One, two, three.

663
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,720
Just hit it.

664
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,280
Is that your stomach?

665
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,160
It comes out.

666
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,520
Okay, thank you.

667
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
It was amazing.

668
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
It's amazing.

669
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
So

670
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,000
who will draw the third wish?

671
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,280
Didn't I just smoke?

672
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,200
Doesn't that count?

673
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
He wants the one in his hand.

674
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,480
Let me see this.

675
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,840
Let me see one.

676
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,760
Let me see this.

677
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,400
Dawei, this one.

678
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,160
This is mine.

679
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,120
This is good.

680
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,080
I'll pretend to draw one.

681
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
I pretend to draw one.

682
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
I want to see Jiang Xuening choose to cover it once.

683
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,720
Please.

684
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,080
Look.

685
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,760
How can I...

686
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,000
What choice?

687
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
Let me help you.

688
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,840
Let me help you.

689
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,600
Who are you playing?

690
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,160
He has to choose me.

691
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,440
Come on.

692
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,760
It shouldn't be like this.

693
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,200
Go over there.

694
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
Stand over there.

695
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:03,920
Come here.

696
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,080
Me?

697
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,040
This is not a choice yet.

698
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,000
This is abandoned, right?

699
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,560
Yes.

700
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,080
I'm leaving.

701
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Bye.

702
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:19,960
Let's go.

703
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,200
Let's go. Cover.

704
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,120
I haven't acted yet.

705
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
What are you going to do?

706
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,040
I have to stop you.

707
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,400
Okay, come on.

708
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,440
Sorry, sir.

709
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,760
This time I have to choose

710
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,080
Lord Zhang.

711
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,560
Xue Ning.

712
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
I can't stop her.

713
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,200
Xue Ning.

714
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,440
Zhang Bao.

715
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,280
Take care.

716
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,200
Take care.

717
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,640
What do you mean?

718
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
It's handover.

719
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,920
What do you mean?

720
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Okay?

721
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,080
Thank you for your wonderful performance.

722
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,360
Next I'll announce

723
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,720
the fourth wish challenge

724
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,080
in the show.

725
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
We know that badminton is

726
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,840
your favorite sports when filming.

727
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Without a scene,

728
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,560
we'll play badminton.

729
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,880
What do we usually do tomorrow morning?

730
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,720
Tomorrow morning?

731
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,200
Let's play. Let's play.

732
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,000
Question mark.

733
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Then go.

734
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,440
The point is we were too addicted.

735
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,240
As long as we don't work, we're done.

736
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,880
I have to take off my makeup for two hours.

737
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:54,920
So?

738
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,200
The sports challenge we're going to complete together

739
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,640
is the badminton game.

740
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,160
The two teams will compete for

741
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,680
the throne of Peace and Feather Ball.

742
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,680
I can finally make a splash.

743
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,960
This time our badminton game

744
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,600
are different props.

745
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,440
I knew it.

746
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,800
You won't refuse to give us the Internet cafe.

747
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Just give us a beat.

748
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,760
It's scarier if he doesn't give us the ball.

749
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
How can we get props?

750
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,600
We will take the props

751
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,920
through an exercise.

752
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,560
See you at the beach later.

753
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,600
Let's change the scene.

754
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Chunzhen Zhenzhen yogurt "Ten million Promises"

755
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,600
Shark breath.

756
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,320
What did you see in front?

757
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,880
Shark

758
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,720
I saw what scared us yesterday.

759
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,240
Our shark is very honest.

760
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,280
Next,

761
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,080
I'll announce the rules of Shark Breath.

762
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,920
On the beach, every shark

763
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240
has badminton props.

764
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
The game is divided into four rounds.

765
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,400
Each team sends a member

766
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,280
to grab the props.

767
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,600
Take the chosen shark back to its starting point.

768
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,440
as a tool.

769
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,960
Three minutes per round.

770
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,120
Now we need to discuss

771
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,920
how to arrange the formation.

772
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,400
The first player not only needs to run fast,

773
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,160
He's going there.

774
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,840
I'll tell you after I've seen as much as I can.

775
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,960
Which one are you going next?

776
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,280
Yes.

777
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,760
The best.

778
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,240
Brother.

779
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
She has tied her shoelaces.

780
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,240
White Lu is good at running.

781
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Is the first one OK?

782
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,040
Send our white deer first.

783
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,000
Xingyue.

784
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,720
Trust me.

785
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,960
Trust me.

786
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,120
Who is the first?

787
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,840
The two of us.

788
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,000
The first group.

789
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,960
Three minutes.

790
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,240
Start counting.

791
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,360
Come on.

792
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,400
Go!

793
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
L.

794
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Go! Hurry!

795
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,160
Start.

796
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,960
Wang Xingyue, what are you doing?

797
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,320
Come on, Wang Xingyue.

798
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,560
You can’t be tempted by beauty.

799
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,920
Run!

800
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,320
Look, they've run away.

801
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,240
So annoying.

802
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,840
You are annoying.

803
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
Wang Xingyue is immersed in

804
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,880
being bewitched.

805
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,520
So we chose a good one.

806
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,719
Oh, no. Thank you.

807
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,400
Thank you. Dangerous.

808
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,520
You don't look right.

809
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
It's stiff.

810
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,239
This one.

811
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,000
It's not a big deal.

812
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,760
It's nothing.

813
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,360
Why is she still in the water?

814
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,320
The white deer asked her to go to the sea.

815
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,239
That's probably hard.

816
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,080
It's a badminton racket.

817
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,040
Maybe it's a badminton racket.

818
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,960
To the sea.

819
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,760
To the sea.

820
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,920
Wang Xingyue in the sea.

821
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,320
The one in the sea.

822
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,480
Wang Xingyue.

823
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,679
Let me show you this.

824
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,800
No.

825
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,719
Wang Xingyue, can you hear me?

826
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,080
Wait.

827
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,639
Let me see the note.

828
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,600
Do you have a note?

829
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,000
Let go of me!

830
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,040
The one in the sea.

831
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,240
Brother.

832
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,640
The one in the sea.

833
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,160
Do you have a note?

834
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,440
No.

835
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,920
What's the use of this?

836
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,600
Let's go.

837
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,800
The one in the sea.

838
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,520
The one in the sea.

839
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,560
In the sea.

840
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,880
Wang Xingyue.

841
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,480
There’s a racket in the sea.

842
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,400
This?

843
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,680
Let it out.

844
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,040
No.

845
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,120
It's okay.

846
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,720
Leave the next one to me.

847
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,440
I have slippers.

848
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,000
Bucket.

849
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,000
Your basket.

850
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,920
Wait.

851
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,720
Don't move.

852
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,120
Don't run!

853
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,160
Thanks for the bucket made by Danger.

854
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,280
Radio.

855
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,560
Xue Dingfei is a fan for heatstroke.

856
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,680
This won't do.

857
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,120
Jiang Xuening's pillow.

858
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,720
Let's go.

859
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,800
What is this?

860
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,760
Wang Xingyue, be a man.

861
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,000
What are you doing?

862
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,680
Wang Xingyue, don’t grab it.

863
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,320
What are we?

864
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,720
Feather racket.

865
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,040
Wow.

866
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,280
Oh my god.

867
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,440
What?

868
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
The badminton racket.

869
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,280
Is it a badminton racket?

870
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,040
The crew's old badminton racket.

871
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,320
The crew is old.

872
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,400
The broken badminton racket.

873
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,960
Wang Xingyue is off work.

874
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,200
Go back to the hotel.

875
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,320
I'll just grab one randomly.

876
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,000
What are you?

877
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,840
I caught the most useless one.

878
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
I'm a brush.

879
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,240
A brush.

880
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
What are you doing?

881
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,560
What did he bring back?

882
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,480
A brush.

883
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,920
And handkerchief.

884
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,240
Clothes.

885
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What are you?

886
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,840
The brush to wipe her throat.

887
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,680
You really can't.

888
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
I was the first to take a basket.

889
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,760
What are you holding?

890
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,080
My badminton racket.

891
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,520
There's a badminton racket.

892
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,920
We are the old badminton paddles of the crew.

893
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,960
Okay, ready.

894
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
Take it easy.

895
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,320
Why are you still in the water?

896
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,080
The one in the sea.

897
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,520
That's probably hard.

898
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,840
The one in the sea.

899
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,600
Wang Xing, the one in the sea.

900
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,600
Come on!

901
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,280
Zhang Linghe, come on!

902
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,120
Zhang Linghe.

903
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,160
He's afraid of water.

904
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,680
Don't move.

905
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,360
Let me see.

906
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,600
Hold a fan.

907
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,200
Finished clapper.

908
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,760
It's you. Let's go.

909
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
You're awesome.

910
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,320
Come with me.

911
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,960
This way.

912
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,880
Let me have a look.

913
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
The ruler. Come on.

914
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,000
The script.

915
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,760
What about that one?

916
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,960
The ruler is not yours.

917
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,760
I just...

918
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
What about the one I just saw?

919
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,480
Is it your brother?

920
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,240
A fan.

921
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,720
Where's the wrap board?

922
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,680
Where's the wrap board?

923
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,400
The wrap board.

924
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,680
The wrap board.

925
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,760
The wrap board.

926
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,840
Tell me.

927
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,000
Where's the wrap board?

928
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,400
You guys are so bad.

929
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,160
Where's the wrap board?

930
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,880
Why did you run away?

931
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:48,960
Let's go.

932
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,160
You guys are so bad.

933
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,240
A ruler is fine too.

934
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,120
Let's go.

935
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,080
Thank you.

936
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,160
Don't go.

937
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,360
Thank you.

938
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
A basket?

939
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Jiang Xuening's pillow.

940
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,120
What are you?

941
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,920
A ruler.

942
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,080
Ring.

943
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,160
The ruler is good.

944
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,240
It's hard for your team to win.

945
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,480
Your team's brush and ruler.

946
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,760
It doesn't matter. We win by technology.

947
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,400
Look how good I am.

948
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Low.

949
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,280
I was the first to take a basket.

950
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,640
I'll do the next one.

951
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,120
Okay.

952
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,680
Basket.

953
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,560
Let's go.

954
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,200
Come on.

955
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,480
Dawei.

956
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,400
This is the fight between the royal family.

957
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,160
Dawei.

958
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,480
You want your sister to be successful.

959
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,840
He doesn't want to do that.

960
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,920
Brother.

961
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,880
Don't abandon me.

962
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,320
Run!

963
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,720
Are you okay?

964
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,160
Who is it?

965
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,080
He subdued him.

966
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,160
You don't have to.

967
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,440
Just bring it here.

968
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,600
It's a uniform.

969
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,120
Get up.

970
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,520
Get up.

971
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,560
I'll carry you up.

972
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,760
I'm sorry.

973
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,560
What?

974
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,800
The sunscreen.

975
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,400
Stop!

976
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,360
Dawei.

977
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Zhou Dawei.

978
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,240
It's wrong to call you here.

979
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,920
Wrong.

980
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,600
Basket.

981
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,400
You're smart.

982
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,200
This is...

983
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,440
Xue's comb. No.

984
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,160
Basket.

985
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,200
A fan to relieve heat.

986
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,520
No.

987
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,680
It's a wrap.

988
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,000
Clap.

989
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,360
This is good.

990
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,720
Let's go.

991
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,640
Okay?

992
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,640
Come with me.

993
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,480
Come here.

994
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,080
Come here.

995
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,000
Let me see what it is.

996
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,760
Come here.

997
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,080
Come here.

998
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,360
Let me see.

999
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,080
What is it?

1000
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,400
What?

1001
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,760
What is a replica?

1002
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,960
Which one is bigger?

1003
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,960
What?

1004
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,440
Go away.

1005
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,080
Don't take mine.

1006
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,760
What are you looking for?

1007
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,160
Dawei can't bully girls.

1008
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,800
Dawei.

1009
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,880
It's okay.

1010
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,880
What is this?

1011
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,840
Don't take mine.

1012
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,120
Countdown 30 seconds.

1013
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,360
The plaque.

1014
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,280
A plaque?

1015
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,560
Do you still want me?

1016
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,200
Let's go.

1017
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,920
What are you?

1018
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,200
Why did this shark come by itself?

1019
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,920
The shark ran away.

1020
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,360
Don't run!

1021
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,400
What are you doing?

1022
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,440
You're mine.

1023
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,400
What is this?

1024
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,760
The replica of Palace of Peace.

1025
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
The plaque will kill you.

1026
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,480
The cards of my Palace of Peace...

1027
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,560
The plaque.

1028
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,520
Like this.

1029
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:01,880
Okay, plaque.

1030
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,720
There's another planner.

1031
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,800
Basket.

1032
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,080
A basket full of chicken rice.

1033
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,920
Okay.

1034
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,520
I'm going to the sea to cool down.

1035
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,480
I want to go too.

1036
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,760
You have to take off your shoes.

1037
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,320
Be careful.

1038
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,560
I can't do this anymore.

1039
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,480
I'm going crazy.

1040
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,160
I'll fan you.

1041
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,840
Don't go too deep.

1042
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:33,960
What else?

1043
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,920
What's better?

1044
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,680
There's a script.

1045
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,160
A script?

1046
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,800
I'll look for it.

1047
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,720
I want that planner.

1048
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,960
Okay.

1049
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,960
The last group, get ready.

1050
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,440
Let's go.

1051
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,520
What is this?

1052
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,600
Paper.

1053
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,280
Good.

1054
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,760
Awesome.

1055
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,400
You can do it.

1056
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,000
We won.

1057
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,240
Who is this?

1058
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,920
Family bucket. Let's go.

1059
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,480
Are you tired?

1060
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,880
It's too hot.

1061
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,680
I saved you, right?

1062
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,640
I'll wait for you.

1063
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,760
Just wait for me.

1064
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,320
What?

1065
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,120
The script?

1066
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,920
I'm holding Xie Wei's family bucket.

1067
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,960
This is awesome.

1068
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,840
I wonder what this family bucket is.

1069
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,080
I got a family bucket

1070
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Game over.

1071
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Gather around.

1072
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
I don't want to go up.

1073
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,000
Soon.

1074
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,960
We'll take it off after this part.

1075
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,240
Thank Jacky and Xiening.

1076
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,640
You can take off your thick costumes.

1077
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,480
Thank you.

1078
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,920
You can pick up

1079
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,720
your own badminton tools.

1080
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,640
Your pillow is so small.

1081
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,880
I thought it was this big.

1082
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,720
This brush

1083
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,680
It's strong.

1084
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,280
This ball

1085
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,000
will never break.

1086
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,720
You don't know how heavy the badminton is.

1087
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,960
You can't even swing this.

1088
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,880
It's fine.

1089
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,640
Definitely.

1090
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,520
Thank you, my favorite family bucket.

1091
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,800
You can hit me like this?

1092
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:48,760
Add a point.

1093
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,720
Xingyue, do you want to change this?

1094
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Take the corn with a brush.

1095
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,920
Our crew's badminton racket

1096
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,600
Even if it's shabby,

1097
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,280
the thread should be complete.

1098
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,560
Just make it up.

1099
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,600
How to play this?

1100
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,720
How to hit it?

1101
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,800
You're not flexible.

1102
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,240
What's the use of this?

1103
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,960
This brush

1104
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,240
I can't hit any of them.

1105
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,320
They demolished the Palace of Peace.

1106
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,560
Who allowed you

1107
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,880
tear down my Palace of Peace?

1108
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,800
Stop.

1109
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,480
Where did he go?

1110
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,560
He dropped his badminton racket.

1111
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,240
I'm...

1112
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,000
Are you proud?

1113
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,560
That's too much.

1114
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,800
Touch the net, touch the net.

1115
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,040
Does this count?

1116
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,720
Why not?

1117
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,600
Okay, give them one.

1118
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,560
Give them one!

1119
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,600
Excuse me.

1120
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,600
Don't play like this.

1121
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,240
It's no fun.
