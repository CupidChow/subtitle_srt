1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,880
Master in badminton.

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,840
Swift as the wind and fast as lightning.

4
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,280
Have you beaten me even once?

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,360
I definitely did.

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,880
The battle between heroes

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,160
divided the world into two.

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,519
Go away!

9
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,800
Don't take mine!

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
An intense battle

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,039
in order to get props.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,520
This pillow is too small.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,039
It'll be hard for your team to win.

14
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,920
A powerful smash.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,440
Try to let them at least catch the first serve.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,680
She's not smiling now, see?

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,039
You want to smash me?

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,880
Smash!

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,520
Don't worry, we won't lose.

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,039
Do you have anything

21
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,720
like needles or pens?

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,360
Let me study it.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,120
Can you do it?

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,320
What?

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,320
What?

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,080
It's done?

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,080
Hit it hard.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,760
It works.

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,160
It's not bad.

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,720
Good.

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,240
I would like to call you The Weaver.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
This pillow is actually not bad.

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,520
Hey, it's comfortable.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,840
What is this? Let me see.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Your pillow.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,160
Right.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Enough.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,720
Stop holding this.

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
Where else can I put it?

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,960
Just Yoghurt,  "As You Wish".

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
We're almost there.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,640
You can start thinking of a team name.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
Team name.

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,760
I have two ideas.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,800
One is "Well-matched" team,

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,680
and the other is  "Everything we do is right" team.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
"Everything we do is right."

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
"Everything we do is right?"

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Then we'll be  "Everything we do is right."

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,079
Team  "Everything we do is right."

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,120
What about us?

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
"We're right too" team.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,280
Sure.

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,800
We're team "We're right too."

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,320
Let's get off.

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go.

57
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,520
Wow.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,520
Let's start modifying it?

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,320
Let's start.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,800
Alright.

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Slow down.

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,960
This can be used by two people.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Let me see.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,040
Not bad.

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,480
But I think,

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,200
I think it'd be better if we fold it.

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,040
Don't hurry.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,400
Try it.

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,320
See, it'll be better if you fold it.

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,520
It's too…

71
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,440
It took half an hour to do my hair.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,240
Sorry.

73
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know what to do.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,720
Half an hour.

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,440
What should you do?

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,320
It's back to normal.

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
Should I remove a couple more?

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
It's been a long time since you did any DIY, right?

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
You like DIY?

80
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,000
I like to watch you DIY.

81
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,480
The badminton battle of "Story of Kunning Palace"

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
officially starts now.

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,280
First, let's welcome team "Everything we do is right."

84
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,280
Team "Everything we do is right."

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
We are team "Everything we do is right."

86
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
Next, let's welcome team "We're right too."

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,400
We are...

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,080
team "We're right too."

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
They've torn down Ning'an Palace.

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
Who allowed you to tear down my Ning'an Palace?

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
You patched your props.

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,200
Why can't we tear apart ours?

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,800
Next,

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,280
our competition is about to begin.

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,480
We all know that

96
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,320
badminton is the favorite sport

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,400
of the leading actors outside of acting.

98
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,840
It can effectively increase

99
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,560
everyone's cooperation while working.

100
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Our competition will be best of three games,

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,800
while playing doubles.

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,360
Each game you will have to send two players to compete.

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,800
As long as the shuttlecock doesn't touch the ground,

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
you can serve.

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,600
The team who gets ten points first

106
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,800
will win one game.

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,240
Please send out the players of the first game.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,040
Hello, everyone.

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,320
I'm the commentator for this badminton competition,

110
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
Cui Shaoyang, who may or may be biased,

111
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
depending on my mood.

112
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,640
I welcome everyone to witness

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,440
the showdown of this badminton competition with me.

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,640
Let's witness the moment of history together!

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,040
The first round is about to begin.

116
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,080
Let's see how both teams

117
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
deploy their troops.

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,080
Come on.

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,480
Team  "Everything we do is right" showed

120
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,040
their secret weapon "Weining" right off the bat.

121
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
The secret weapon that Jiang Xuening brought

122
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,480
is her own pillow she uses when she sleeps

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,880
that is soft and limp.

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,040
Could it be she's implying that she can win even in her sleep?

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,360
The Grand Tutor's trump card

126
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
is a torn badminton racket,

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,040
bracket,

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,640
upgraded by our modern Weaver.

129
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,600
You two go first.

130
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,000
Team "We're right too" sent out

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
the black hole siblings who always lose.

132
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright,

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
since your props are quite good,

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,400
I'll admit reluctantly that you're quite advantageous.

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,960
The black hole siblings have room to counterattack,

136
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,840
team Weining should look out!

137
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,640
Good luck.

138
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,920
You guys start first.

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
Try to let them at least catch the first serve.

140
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,040
Got it.

141
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,080
Team "We're right too" is quite arrogant,

142
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,320
starting the game with such a

143
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,760
"heartwarming" provocation.

144
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
On the contrary, team Weining

145
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,320
is turning a deaf ear, and responding calmly.

146
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,520
So, ultimately

147
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,600
who will take the first point?

148
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,000
Here it comes!

149
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Nice shot!

150
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Nice shot!

151
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Her prop is not easy to use.

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,920
The point of contact is no good.

153
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,280
It's hard for her to play with that.

154
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
Here we come.

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,760
Why are you hitting it to the corner?

156
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,280
Can you…

157
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
This angle is a little challenging.

158
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,440
Coming.

159
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,320
Didn't pass.

160
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,200
It's okay.

161
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,440
Let them have 3 points first.

162
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,400
You can catch up afterwards.

163
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,400
Wang Xingyue, whose side are you on?

164
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,520
Her prop is not easy to use.

165
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,600
The point of contact is no good.

166
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,799
It's hard for her to play with that.

167
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,120
Her prop isn't hard enough.

168
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,600
Yeah.

169
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,440
This member of "We're right too" team,

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,760
please correct your identity and position.

171
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,440
Nice shot!

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,960
Your aura!

173
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
Almost.

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,000
Almost.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,720
Good!

176
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,600
She's giving a smash.

177
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,400
A powerful smash!

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sure the next one will pass the net.

179
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,880
Yes!

180
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
The current score is 4:0.

181
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
Team Weining has been losing points continuously.

182
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,080
The princess is ready to attack and press the advantage.

183
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,360
Hold on.

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,960
Okay.

185
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
I just,

186
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
let me hide my prop.

187
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Now she's competitive.

188
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,200
Look at her expression.

189
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,280
Done?

190
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Nice shot!

191
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,840
Nice!

192
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,000
Team  "Everything we do is right"

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,400
finally made a breakthrough with a smash from Jiang Xuening.

194
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,400
It's okay.

195
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,040
Bai Lu has started to smash.

196
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
She has improved rapidly.

197
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,680
She's serious now.

198
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,080
She's not smiling now, see?

199
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,800
Nice shot!

200
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,120
Great shot!

201
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,880
Nice shot!

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,760
Nice shot!

203
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,240
One more time.

204
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,440
Great shot!

205
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Nice shot!

206
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,440
Nice!

207
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,880
Almost.

208
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,720
It's okay. Give them a chance.

209
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,880
It's okay. It's not a big problem.

210
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
Besides, it's a foul for you to touch the net.

211
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
One warning.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,280
Okay.

213
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Be careful.

214
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
Yes, coach.

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
I'll serve.

216
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
Nice shot!

217
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
The net shot was good!

218
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,720
They're hitting quite a few net shots.

219
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,520
Awesome.

220
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,840
His racket is quite good.

221
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,080
I made it.

222
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,360
You did great.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
You did a good job.

224
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,880
Sure enough, Weining makes a dream team.

225
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,320
One more point to tie the score.

226
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,080
Watch out, black hole siblings!

227
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,000
Nice shot!

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,560
Catch!

229
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Nice shot!

230
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,480
It's out!

231
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,160
Nice shot!

232
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
They're back on the same starting line now!

233
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,080
Nice shot!

234
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,520
That's right.

235
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,560
I knew it.

236
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,160
Team  "Everything we do is right" can surely overtake them.

237
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,400
The soft and limp pillow that was once looked down on

238
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,280
showed us its strong smashing ability.

239
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,720
Of course it's all thanks to Ning.

240
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,080
Awesome.

241
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,760
Overtake them!

242
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,280
Keep it up.

243
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Good.

244
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,320
She's getting better at using it.

245
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,360
After being smashed repeatedly,

246
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,760
team "We're right too" is starting to get nervous too.

247
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,520
You look so cool like this.

248
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,280
One, two, three.

249
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,480
Catch.

250
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,600
Give them a chance.

251
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,680
Adjust your rhythm.

252
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,480
It'll be okay.

253
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,800
We scored so many points in a row.

254
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,680
Nice shot!

255
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,840
Nice!

256
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,560
Great shot!

257
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,800
Nice!

258
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
You smashed yourself.

259
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,000
Brother,

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
you want to hit a smash?

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,680
This is just a prop.

262
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,640
I can’t.

263
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,840
The racket will break if I hit a smash.

264
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
This smash…

265
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,600
is too cruel.

266
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,760
You want to smash me?

267
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
The princess is showing her authority.

268
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,560
What a pity.

269
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,480
Are you passing it to me?

270
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,400
Why did it go there?

271
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,240
I can't even get involved.

272
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,240
You didn't need to play.

273
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,520
Yes, I'll lie down.

274
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,800
It's the game point, guys.

275
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,440
The princess's fast and decisive actions

276
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,280
drew the score to the game point.

277
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,440
It’s the game point.

278
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,600
Once team "We're right too" gets one more point,

279
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,520
they can win this game.

280
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,720
Can team Weining still stay calm

281
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
and get a tie back?

282
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,640
Coming.

283
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,480
A higher one this time.

284
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,440
Nice shot!

285
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,120
Wait!

286
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,760
What's that?

287
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,400
Nice shot!

288
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Where did it go?

289
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
His badminton racket flew out.

290
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's congratulate team "We're right too"

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,080
for winning the first game and winning a score.

292
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,840
We won!

293
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,200
Great.

294
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,280
Indeed.

295
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,080
There was a wave of climax in the middle.

296
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,400
We tried my best.

297
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,880
Not bad.

298
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,400
You played really well at one point.

299
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
I can't use this anymore for sure.

300
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,840
I'll work on it for you.

301
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,520
Can you do it?

302
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,680
Come on.

303
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,160
The second game starts.

304
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,760
Let me introduce the players of both teams.

305
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,240
Go for it!

306
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,640
Team  "Everything we do is right" sends

307
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,760
the "Go for it!" brothers.

308
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,840
Shen Jie who ranked himself first in his mind,

309
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,240
and ranked fifth out of the badminton playing cast by Lyu Xian.

310
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,800
This player's badminton skills

311
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
are full of mysteries.

312
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,040
And the self-claimed-

313
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
What do you mean self-claimed?

314
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,080
Those are my real results!

315
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,440
And the genuine first ranked

316
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,640
of the badminton playing cast,

317
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,360
Xue Dingfei.

318
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Team "We're right too" sent out

319
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,080
the twin moon team.

320
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,520
The charming villain, Xue Shu,

321
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
and the also self-claimed first ranked

322
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,760
of the badminton playing cast, Zhang Zhe.

323
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,080
Judging from both parties' props,

324
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,000
the twin moon team's plaque of Ning'an Palace

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
has a bigger surface for contact,

326
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,600
providing them a slight advantage.

327
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Where's your brush?

328
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,640
Where's the brush?

329
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
In my palm.

330
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,920
You guys separated one prop into three.

331
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,440
It's really too much.

332
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
They've gone too far.

333
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,680
Here we go.

334
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,360
Good luck.

335
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,520
Come on.

336
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
The game starts now.

337
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,599
Xue Dingfei's perfect smash

338
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,800
was easily defended by Mr. Zhang.

339
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,200
Shen Jie's light net shot.

340
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,119
Nice!

341
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,200
Go for it!

342
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,560
Hold on.

343
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,640
We need to fix our props.

344
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,400
You played hard.

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
Let's break his prop.

346
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,160
It's okay.

347
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,720
It's okay. Again.

348
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,000
Go for it!

349
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,760
You can't smash using this basket.

350
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,560
You can't.

351
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,560
Is Shen Jie going to smash again?

352
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,440
Can we do this?

353
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,000
Is it okay?

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,080
They said yes!

355
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,200
Yes.

356
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,640
How can you do this?

357
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,240
It's within the rules.

358
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,160
Yes.

359
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes it counts.

360
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,120
This is called making full use of your props.

361
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,640
Then I'll flip mine over too.

362
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,320
Yeah, you can do it too.

363
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
This one is easier to catch with.

364
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Come on, serve.

365
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,000
Is it our turn?

366
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Wait.

367
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,960
This is already a bug.

368
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
This…

369
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Yes, Tai Chi ball.

370
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Like the old man in the park.

371
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,360
Catch.

372
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,920
Don't come over here!

373
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,000
No problem.

374
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,920
No problem at all.

375
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,880
Come on.

376
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Coming.

377
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,880
Come.

378
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,360
Who knew?

379
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,040
How did it get here?

380
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,320
I don't know.

381
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,040
I didn't see it.

382
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
I sandwiched it in this.

383
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,840
Let's go.

384
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,200
Wait.

385
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
But I think playing like this

386
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,240
loses the meaning of the game.

387
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,160
Don't play like this.

388
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,760
It's boring.

389
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Yeah, we won't be able to play much.

390
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,160
Come on.

391
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,720
So we can't catch it like this anymore, okay?

392
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,600
Let's play another way.

393
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,080
Here we go.

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
He found [the rhythm].

395
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,560
Darn it.

396
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
He got me again!

397
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm going to hit it there.

398
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,480
Come on.

399
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
Now, Wang Xingyue will serve.

400
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,600
A smash!

401
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,360
Got it!

402
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,840
Smash!

403
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,160
Awesome!

404
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,840
Awesome.

405
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm busy being proud.

406
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,600
Catch the shuttlecock.

407
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,280
Let's start.

408
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
I thought they lost.

409
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,440
[I didn't expect] the combo.

410
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,760
People usually can't react.

411
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,560
Five tied.

412
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Good, let's drag it out.

413
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,560
Nice!

414
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,880
Point on serve!

415
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Just keep serving.

416
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,280
One-stop.

417
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,640
It's okay.

418
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,360
Let him serve two more,

419
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,240
or he won't even get the chance to touch the shuttlecock.

420
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,720
Nice shot!

421
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,080
That's too much.

422
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,760
Good!

423
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,480
In the game where both teams' scores

424
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,360
are closely vying with each other,

425
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,880
both teams are just one point away

426
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,400
from winning the game.

427
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
I'm being serious now.

428
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,520
Nine "kills."

429
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,520
It's time to get off work.

430
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
Come on. One last "kill."

431
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,760
Ultimately, will it be the "Go for it!" brothers,

432
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,960
or will it be the twin moon team

433
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,440
that gets the last point?

434
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,680
Cui Shaoyang serves first.

435
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,760
Nice shot!

436
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,840
Like a hot knife through butter,

437
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,120
with a charismatic bearing.

438
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,680
The twin moon team are relaxed,

439
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
and they look confident.

440
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,560
Nice serve!

441
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,840
Point on serve!

442
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,560
"Go for it!" brothers secures the win for the team in the second game.

443
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,880
Nice!

444
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,280
Awesome.

445
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,120
And the team player

446
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,560
for this game is actually,

447
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,440
me.

448
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,640
Darn it.

449
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,440
Shameless!

450
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,440
It's okay.

451
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,240
We won the last game.

452
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,120
It's okay.

453
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,520
It's okay.

454
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,160
It's not a big problem.

455
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,680
It's okay.

456
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,600
Come on.

457
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,080
It's not a big problem.

458
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,960
Because the first two rounds are tied,

459
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,320
we're now going to have one last point

460
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,200
to determine the winner

461
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,640
of the "Story of Kunning Palace" badminton cup.

462
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,280
The final game is on a hairpin trigger.

463
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
Let us see

464
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,520
how the two sides will form troops.

465
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Men's doubles?

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,560
Or shall we do mixed doubles?

467
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,960
Then you go first.

468
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,840
Did I play against you just now?

469
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,800
I didn't play against you just now.

470
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,840
Why, do you want to play against me now?

471
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
Shall we go first?

472
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,080
Let’s see how hard Zhang Zhe plays this round.

473
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,240
Come on, Wang Xingyue.

474
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,200
Keep it up!

475
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,880
The Grand Tutor is coming in aggressively.

476
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,440
Mr. Zhang is also not backing down.

477
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,840
Coming.

478
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,520
I'll apologize first.

479
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,160
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,520
Come on.

481
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,560
The serve that will decide

482
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,040
the teams' "life and death."

483
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,880
Who will be the winner of this "life and death" match

484
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,440
between the two love rivals of the drama?

485
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,840
Now our side to serve,

486
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,360
with a light tap.

487
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,600
Smash!

488
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,680
Nice shot!

489
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,000
I lost again!

490
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,480
Let's still send our applause

491
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,560
to our respectable opponents.

492
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
For team "We're right too."

493
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,480
For team "We're right too."

494
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,600
I hope you won't give up.

495
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,880
Qin Tianyu.

496
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Qin Tianyu, I'm sorry.

497
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,960
The award ceremony

498
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,800
for the "Story of Kunning Palace" badminton cup starts now.

499
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,520
Congratulations to team "Everything we do is right."

500
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,800
Please stand on the stage.

501
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,600
Let's welcome team "We're right too,"

502
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,880
to present the trophy and medals

503
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
for team  "Everything we do is right."

504
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,840
To kill with a borrowed knife.

505
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,880
Thank you.

506
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,200
One by one.

507
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,760
I'll go first.

508
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,440
You go first.

509
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,280
Congratulations.

510
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,120
You guys can't see his reluctance.

511
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,560
Congratulations.

512
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,880
Thank you.

513
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,840
Congratulations.

514
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,880
Thank you.

515
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,400
Let's shake hands.

516
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
My champion.

517
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,320
Thank you, my second place.

518
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,200
Give me a hug.

519
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Lastly, please present our huge trophy.

520
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,920
Here.

521
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,840
Congratulations.

522
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Today's MVP.

523
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,600
Champion!

524
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,320
[Look at the] fireworks!

525
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,640
Dad, mom, did you see that?

526
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,640
I would like to thank my parents.

527
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,720
To be honest,

528
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
a huge part of it was luck.

529
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,160
Thank you very much

530
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
for giving us such

531
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
happy memories and experience.

532
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,920
Maybe you should continue thanking your parents.

533
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,200
Thanks to our respectable opponents.

534
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,120
Thank you, Qin Tianyu.

535
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,160
We're sorry.

536
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,800
Thanks to Zhang Zhe and Wang Xingyue.

537
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,960
Thank you for your skills.

538
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,360
Thank you for being last.

539
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,640
Team  "Everything we do is right"

540
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,440
can play anything right!

541
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,320
"Us too"!

542
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,160
Next,

543
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,200
we're going to announce

544
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,920
our last Wish Challenge,

545
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,480
which is for everyone to cook together.

546
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,880
Cooking?

547
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,160
As we know,

548
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,320
the crew of  "Story of Kunning Palace"

549
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,440
got along very well onstage and backstage

550
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,120
and often had dinner together.

551
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,760
The successful filming of the drama

552
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,360
also comes from the efforts of everyone on set.

553
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,920
So for this meal,

554
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,680
we will invite among the unseen contributors behind the scene,

555
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,840
the director and producer

556
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,960
as representatives,

557
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,800
to thank them for their hard work in the past few months.

558
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,440
Tianyu, you can't lose this round.

559
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,280
I don’t think I will lose this time.

560
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,600
During the cooking process,

561
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,720
we will divide you into two groups.

562
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,880
Before the battle,

563
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,120
we will undergo a competition to split the teams.

564
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
See you in the swimming pool.

565
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,640
Let's change the scene.

566
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,800
Just Yoghurt,  "As You Wish."

567
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
Xingyue, are you tired?

568
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,040
I’m exhausted.

569
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Have a Just Yoghurt.

570
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,400
Sure.

571
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,200
What a strong blueberry fragrance.

572
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,800
Full of freshness.

573
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,480
Look.

574
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,240
Its ingredients list

575
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,280
is very simple and not complicated.

576
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,080
Very good.

577
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,400
I can play games again.

578
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,040
Full of energy now?

579
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,440
Let's go.

580
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,080
Let's go.

581
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm so happy.

582
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,000
This game to split the teams

583
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,800
is between the 5 boys.

584
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,800
I can't believe you girls are out of this.

585
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,840
There's a board in front of you.

586
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,480
The boys will compete through

587
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,680
a pushing game.

588
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,720
Whoever falls into the water first will lose.

589
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,440
You will compete in pairs,

590
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
best out of three.

591
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,320
The girls will choose the grouping.

592
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,520
In the first round, choose four boys out to compete in pairs.

593
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,840
The unchosen one will automatically enter the second round

594
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,280
to compete with the winners of the first round.

595
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,360
The final winner

596
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,400
will get to decide

597
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
how to split into teams when you cook.

598
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,680
This is a test of patience and flexibility

599
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,760
for the male actors.

600
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,160
Do your best!

601
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,400
We will do the choosing?

602
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,320
Let's have a discussion.

603
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,280
Let's go over there.

604
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,600
How about this?

605
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,240
To show that the three of us

606
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,440
are his students,

607
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,480
let's let him automatically go the second round.

608
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,600
He has a wound on his foot.

609
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,200
Okay.

610
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,640
Okay.

611
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Shall we decide internally

612
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,880
on who to let win?

613
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,640
How about this?

614
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,800
Whoever teams up with Qin Tianyu

615
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,120
lets him win once.

616
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,920
No need.

617
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,120
Yes.

618
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,840
It's fine.

619
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,040
Yes.

620
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,960
No need.

621
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,360
Yes.

622
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm telling you, I'm still quite strong.

623
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm strong.

624
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,840
Don't go easy on me.

625
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,360
I can lose,

626
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
but I don't want to be given the win.

627
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,160
Okay, we’ve decided.

628
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,440
The first group, Cui Shaoyang and Wang Xingyue.

629
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,200
Let Cui Shaoyang go the first round.

630
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,520
Then who should play him?

631
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
Cui Shaoyang and Wang Xingyue.

632
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,040
The second group is

633
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,120
Zhou Dawei and Qin Tianyu.

634
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,320
I…

635
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,560
Why does he get a direct admission?

636
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
Why does he get to go to the next round?

637
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,760
His leg is injured.

638
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,920
My foot is...

639
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,520
Good luck.

640
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,640
Next, let’s welcome our first group,

641
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,840
Cui Shaoyang and Wang Xingyue.

642
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,360
Come on.

643
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,200
Slow down.

644
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,760
Good luck.

645
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,520
Come on.

646
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,360
Like a lotus emerging from water.

647
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,920
This is hard.

648
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,000
It's hard to steady yourself.

649
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,560
Wang Xingyue, come on.

650
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Wang Xingyue!

651
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,080
Cui Shaoyang, come on!

652
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,680
Okay.

653
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,160
It's not stable.

654
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,960
Wow.

655
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,080
Here.

656
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Come on.

657
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,960
Come on.

658
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,080
Come here.

659
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,880
Wow.

660
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,760
Such flexibility.

661
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,440
Come on.

662
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,280
Like a lotus emerging from water.

663
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Congratulations to Shaoyang for winning.

664
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,840
Wang Xingyue is so pitiful.

665
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,080
I didn't win fair and square.

666
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,560
I couldn't steady myself.

667
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,160
It's okay.

668
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,240
Next one.

669
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,760
Come on.

670
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,240
Come on.

671
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,040
Good luck.

672
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,360
Lyu Xian can't lose face.

673
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,240
Don't embarrass the Xie family.

674
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,800
Come on.

675
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,200
What are you two doing?

676
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,520
Stop fighting!

677
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,160
Stop fighting!

678
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,960
Stop fighting!

679
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,520
Dawei went down first.

680
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
Tianyu won.

681
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,160
Tianyu.

682
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,720
This is awesome.

683
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,040
Awesome.

684
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,640
Dawei.

685
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,520
Don't lose 2:0. Come on.

686
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,120
No problem.

687
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,640
Three, two, one, go.

688
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,800
It's a dead end.

689
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,840
Be careful.

690
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,120
Be careful, Tianyu.

691
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,280
It's a dead end.

692
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,680
Qin Tianyu.

693
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,080
Come on.

694
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,720
Then both of us will also just move our legs.

695
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,200
Sure.

696
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,960
It's time to test your loyalty.

697
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,200
Someone is pushing my role on me.

698
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,680
She said for my role,

699
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,320
to not forget my role and mission.

700
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,760
Are you ready?

701
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,160
Yes.

702
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,080
Good luck, teacher!

703
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,320
Cui Shaoyang, come on!

704
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,920
Let’s go.

705
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,880
So awkward.

706
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,160
Feels like they can't hold on to the board anymore.

707
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,320
Zhang Linghe.

708
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,080
Cui Shaoyang is shameless.

709
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,840
Cui Shaoyang.

710
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,920
I really lost my balance.

711
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,600
He almost pulled my pants off.

712
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,440
Because Cui Shaoyang fouled in this round,

713
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,480
Zhang Linghe won this round.

714
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,080
Next is the second round.

715
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,160
Are there any other methods to play?

716
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you want to have a chicken fight?

717
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,000
Let's do it here.

718
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,680
Are you sure?

719
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,480
Real men only use one leg.

720
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,000
Come on.

721
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,480
I'll be impressed if the both of you

722
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
can stand steady on one foot.

723
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
Congratulations to Zhang Linghe for winning.

724
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,720
Wow.

725
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,320
Tianyu,

726
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,000
It's your turn.

727
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,440
Well,

728
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,440
you set a rule.

729
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,400
I think the one leg rule earlier is good.

730
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,520
Okay, sure.

731
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,160
Come on teacher!

732
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,840
Come on.

733
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,880
Qin Tianyu went down first.

734
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,880
You set a rule.

735
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,120
Let's not use only one leg this time.

736
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,840
Let's change it.

737
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,520
Another pushing game.

738
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,480
Come on, push away.

739
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,800
What do I do? His center of gravity is lower than mine.

740
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,520
I can't push him down.

741
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,080
Be careful.

742
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,000
Tianyu.

743
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You're only one step away from winning the first victory.

744
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,240
Tianyu, come on.

745
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,880
Soon,

746
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,360
you're finally going to win.

747
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,280
Xie Wei.

748
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,360
You'll always be second.

749
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,280
Back then, in the provincial, metropolitan, and palace examinations,

750
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,160
you always ranked second.

751
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,880
I'll be first this time.

752
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,640
Come on.

753
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,680
Awesome.

754
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,840
Almost.

755
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,040
I said I'd be first.

756
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,680
Wow, I finally won.

757
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,240
In these past two days,

758
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,480
I finally won once.

759
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
It's not easy.

760
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:45,680
Sprinkle flowers.

761
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,680
Tianyu.

762
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,360
You can now choose

763
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,560
three teammates to cook with you.

764
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,320
Tianyu.

765
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,280
My old teammate.

766
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,120
I can cook.

767
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Come, Dawei.

768
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,280
I'll wash the dishes.

769
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:06,760
Come.

770
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,440
Real brothers.

771
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,240
Wang Xingyue, you can cook, right?

772
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,160
Yes.

773
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,280
I can help some too.

774
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,560
Okay.

775
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,320
All three of you know how to.

776
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,800
I don't know how to.

777
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,320
Sorry.

778
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,520
Let's change the scene.

779
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,480
Just Yoghurt,  "As You Wish".

780
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,880
You go down too.

781
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,280
Soy sauce,

782
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,520
oyster sauce,

783
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,160
salt and chicken stock.

784
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,840
Okay.

785
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,360
Yes, mix it.

786
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,200
This tossing.

787
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,200
It smells so good.

788
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,800
Looks legit, Zhang Linghe.

789
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
It looks good.

790
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,640
What did Quan Haojin do to deserve to eat

791
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,600
the meal that's prepared by the eight of us?

792
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,280
Why didn't you continue lying to me?

793
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,600
Don't go.

794
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,640
Don't go.

795
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,800
I'm really scary.

796
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,160
Come on, stab me.

797
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,320
Kill me.

798
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,040
Kill me.

799
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,840
I'll kill you.

800
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,000
Are you sure this is an idol drama?
