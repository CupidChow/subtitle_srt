1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,920
I can cook.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,080
I can cook a little too.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,560
This wok tossing.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,440
The 8 people

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,400
will cook in 2 groups

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,440
and we'll find the winner.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,720
Today is two groups.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,440
It's time to show off your skills.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,280
The theme is "betrayal."

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,520
The theme is "cutting all family ties."

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,840
Hello, everyone.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,400
Which one do you like the most?

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,520
I think the worst is...

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,440
Good morning, friends.

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,800
Welcome.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
Yesterday, we announced

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
that today's Wish Challenge

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,600
will test your teamwork.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
It's a cooking battle between two teams.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
We all know

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,160
that Story of Kunning Palace

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
was completed by all the cast and crew

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
working hard together.

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
Today, we also invited

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,960
Director Zhu Ruibin

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
and producer Quan Haojin

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
to represent the crew

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,240
as today's food critics

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,720
and pick the winner today.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,360
Will it just be our team or will we all be here?

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,160
All here.

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
All here.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,440
Let's go and distribute the groceries there.

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,079
Will we share this kitchen later?

36
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,960
Eight people?

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,400
We have to hurry and take the spots.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,240
Eight people will share this kitchen?

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,880
There are only two stoves.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,960
Eight people will use two stoves.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,079
Gosh.

42
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,400
There are only two stoves.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,120
How should I put it?

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,200
It's time to show off.

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,120
I think I smell victory again.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
We're here.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,480
It's not each team by themselves.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,600
Find your own place.

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,200
What do you mean?

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,800
We don't even have a kitchen?

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Go straight that way.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Don't go up. Go straight.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,560
It's in the other room.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
I think he's lying to me.

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm telling the truth.

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,600
Really?

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,880
There's another room?

58
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
How about we

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,480
show off our teamwork?

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
We are not a team.

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
We are two teams today.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,400
Put the groceries on the table.

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Put them on the table. Don't keep holding them.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
Let's prepare the ingredients first.

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
Prepare the ingredients.

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,640
How about this?

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,160
I'll cut it.

68
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
I'll cut the ingredients now.

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,840
Can you be in charge of washing?

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
They need to be washed.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,800
Then I'll cook...

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,160
I'll make the noodles first.

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,040
It's time to show off my skills.

74
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
I'm just saying...

75
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm here.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,680
Meat must be eaten in big bites.

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,760
Cut big pieces.

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
The shrimp is hard to peel.

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,960
Sit down and peel it.

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,680
It's too slippery.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm preparing everything I need.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Be careful of your eyes.

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,480
I’ll close my eyes.

84
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,880
Wang Xingyue.

85
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
I’m not afraid of this.

86
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,159
Really?

87
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,760
Yes.

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
It doesn't affect you?

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,520
I'm not.

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Let me see if it affects me.

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,280
It doesn't.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait a minute.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm not afraid.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
I suddenly remembered something sad.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,840
You're cutting onions?

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,880
Can you cut some for me?

97
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,800
Give me some.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
He has a bunch.

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Who?

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,280
Thank you.

101
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,320
Qin Tianyu, someone is stealing your onions.

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,159
Stop her.

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,520
Stop her.

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
She took it away.

105
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,040
Can you cut some green onions for me?

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
Are you on my team?

107
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,960
Yes.

108
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,880
Okay, I'll cut it for you.

109
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,120
She lost her memory from cutting too much.

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
She asked if we were in the same team.

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
The theme is "betrayal."

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,840
I forgot.

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,000
The theme is "cutting all ties."

114
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
Come on, show us your cutting skills.

115
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,760
Schrödinger's cutting skills.

116
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,720
I don't know what you cut.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
I cut a few pieces.

118
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
It's really something.

119
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,720
I don't think our characters

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,200
cooked in the drama.

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,080
Zhang Zhe.

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,720
Zhang Zhe cooked in the drama?

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,200
Of course.

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,920
He's not corrupted.

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,200
There's no way he'd have servants in the household.

126
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,520
Start.

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
This water...

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,400
We won.

129
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
Smells good.

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,240
We'll definitely win.

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
This wok tossing.

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Edit this part out.

133
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,520
You don't toss the wok when we don't look.

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

135
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,960
You do it when we're looking.

136
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Almost there.

137
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,040
This pot of beef...

138
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
I'll do my best.

139
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
Actually, I wanted to make

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,280
fried eggs with tomato.

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
I heard one of you say

142
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,600
that you loved fried eggs with tomato.

143
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Me.

144
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,760
It's you, right?

145
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll make you fried eggs with tomato.

146
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,320
Okay.

147
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,400
It's simple and fast.

148
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
You got that feeling, Zhang Linghe.

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,000
What are you looking at?

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm watching you cook.

151
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
Saute the garlic and onions.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,480
Add a spoonful of soy sauce.

153
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,880
Liquid egg with bean sprouts.

154
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
Light soy sauce, oyster oil, salt, and chicken essence.

155
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,360
What do I add?

156
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,440
No.

157
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
What do I add?

158
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Excuse me.

159
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
Let me check my notes.

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
Where is the vinegar?

161
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
Rice vinegar.

162
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,160
Fine.

163
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,160
A little sugar.

164
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,320
Pour a little sesame oil.

165
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
Pour a little.

166
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,280
Pour a little.

167
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,560
Sesame oil.

168
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Isn't this vinegar?

169
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,720
Oh no.

170
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,520
I just put in rice vinegar.

171
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,360
Let me add more.

172
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
What is this?

173
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,440
My notes.

174
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,960
After I boil it, I have to...

175
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,040
See what I found.

176
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,720
Look at this.

177
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,800
What?

178
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
I don't dare to touch

179
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,440
this shrimp.

180
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,720
I'm leaving.

181
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Come on, show us.

182
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,080
This looks good.

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,440
It looks good?

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,160
Thank you.

185
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,160
And it's done?

186
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
I have to eat it again.

187
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
This is a dish made by someone who can't cook.

188
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
Add bean sprouts and vermicelli.

189
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,840
Come on.

190
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,920
What else is needed?

191
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,840
Too little oil.

192
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
More.

193
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Enough.

194
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,160
What else do you need?

195
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,680
What else?

196
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Bean sprouts.

197
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,080
Really?

198
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,440
Yes.

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay.

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,120
The vermicelli.

201
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,520
Oh no, it's sticky.

202
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,160
It's sticky.

203
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,560
It's okay.

204
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,240
Just stir-fry it.

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
Stir it apart.

206
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,640
Okay.

207
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
And...

208
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
That...

209
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,560
This.

210
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,040
No.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,040
No.

212
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,720
It's the eggs.

213
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,040
It's nerve-wracking to cook with you.

214
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,440
What else to add?

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Light soy sauce, oyster oil, salt, and chicken essence.

216
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
Here, light soy sauce.

217
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,880
Light soy sauce.

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,120
Oyster sauce.

219
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
Salt and chicken essence.

220
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,840
Pretty much it.

221
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,480
Okay.

222
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
Yes, stir it.

223
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
Look, it's stirred.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,280
Really.

225
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,240
You can take pictures of Xiening's legs and feet.

226
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
When Xiening stirs,

227
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,720
there's a rhythm here.

228
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,000
Girl group dance.

229
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,640
Okay.

230
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,560
Smells good.

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,520
Perfect.

232
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,880
Awesome.

233
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
She even created a dance move.

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,880
I'm getting ready to slide.

235
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,280
Liu Xiening, do you want to slide it?

236
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,480
Yes.

237
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,520
Come on.

238
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm going to do it.

239
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,120
You slide.

240
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,600
Go!

241
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,200
Done.

242
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Not bad.

243
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,360
It looks good.

244
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,400
Right?

245
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,400
It's really beautiful.

246
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,520
Flip it.

247
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,040
Flip it over

248
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,960
and then we're done.

249
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm so incompetent.

250
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,960
Wait.

251
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,520
Let Shaoyang

252
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,240
try it.

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,040
I’m afraid I'll flip it

254
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,600
and destroy the surface.

255
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
You do it. Slide it.

256
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,600
Let me try.

257
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
I'll stay away.

258
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,880
Alright.

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,200
Don't get it in our faces.

260
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,120
No.

261
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,880
You'll break it like this.

262
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,360
What should I do?

263
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,040
Like this.

264
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,680
Come on, you do it.

265
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,520
You know how to do it?

266
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,200
Is this okay?

267
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,920
Not really.

268
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,600
This is too thick.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,040
I got it.

270
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,840
I have an idea.

271
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
Put the plate there.

272
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,720
Be careful.

273
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,440
Perfect.

274
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,720
Slide it down.

275
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,360
Awesome!

276
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,320
You're amazing.

277
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,320
A successful slide.

278
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
You're amazing.

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,680
Come on.

280
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,000
Slam it.

281
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,720
Good.

282
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,880
The second dish.

283
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,600
This dish is on us.

284
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,320
I have a muscle cramp.

285
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,800
What?

286
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,440
I wanted to do this,

287
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,800
but my arm cramped.

288
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,440
I feel so bad.

289
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Cold stirred beef.

290
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
This is my favorite.

291
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,200
I add this to every dish I eat.

292
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,600
Why is it so big?

293
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,160
It's delicious.

294
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,320
It's not tough.

295
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,760
Is it okay?

296
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Is it good?

297
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:35,840
Is it good?

298
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,600
Not bad.

299
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
It's good.

300
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,880
Not bad.

301
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
This kid is not bad.

302
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,040
Why does Quan Haojin get to

303
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,960
eat food personally cooked by us?

304
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,440
Yeah.

305
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,920
We're willing to cook for Director Zhu.

306
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,240
For Quan Haojin though...

307
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,040
Get one taste per dish.

308
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay.

309
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
The ingredients are ready.

310
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
Amazing.

311
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,320
It'll be done after adding the sauce.

312
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,040
This is seafood with sauce.

313
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Hot.

314
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,680
Fish.

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It looks good.

316
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,600
This dish is called Just for Xuening.

317
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,560
Done.

318
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,280
Finally.

319
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,160
Name it.

320
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,120
What name?

321
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,800
Give it a funny name.

322
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
We can't let them know

323
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,240
it's our team's dishes.

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
Something Pisces.

325
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,840
There are two fish.

326
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
Not Made by Pisces.

327
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,640
Sure.

328
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,240
What's the name of beef?

329
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,160
Story of Kunning Palace will be awesome.
["Cow" is slang for "awesome"]

330
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,680
"Let's go, Cow."

331
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,600
That's great.

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,280
"Good Fortune."
["Fortune" sounds like "chicken"]

333
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,960
"Work hard."

334
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,520
"It's Easy."

335
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,440
Wow, a naming genius.

336
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,880
Good.

337
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,000
What's it called?

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,760
What is it called?

339
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,800
Call it

340
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,400
"Can't win with Qin Tianyu here."

341
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Name of the dish?

342
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,440
"Thunder on a Clear Day."
["Clear day" sounds like "Qin Tian"]

343
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,839
Is that okay?

344
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,400
A clear day.

345
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,359
Sure.

346
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,160
"Thunder on a Clear Day."

347
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
What's inside?

348
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,800
Egg and noodles?

349
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,800
Yes.

350
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,480
"Let's Duel."
["Duel" is pronounced like "egg and noodles"]

351
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,520
"Let's Duel."

352
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,400
Is that okay?

353
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes.

354
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,680
"Next One Counts as Yours."
[Next=shrimp, counts=garlic]

355
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,880
"Chivalrous and Brave."
[Wordplay with "shrimp" and "egg"]

356
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,600
Here come the dishes.

357
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,640
Wow.

358
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,320
Welcome Director Zhu Ruibin.

359
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Welcome Producer Quan Haojin.

360
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,600
Hello everyone.

361
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,680
In front of you,

362
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,080
are the dishes made by

363
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,880
Team A of Story of Kunning Palace's cast.

364
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,680
The other side is the food made by

365
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,120
Team B of Story of Kunning Palace's cast.

366
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
Please have a taste one by one

367
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,000
and choose which team's food

368
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
is better.

369
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,520
Okay.

370
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,400
It looks okay.

371
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,360
It's not as bad as I imagined.

372
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,720
Let's eat first.

373
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,200
Wow, this

374
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
"Thunder on a Clear Day."

375
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
I think

376
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
a crazy name like this

377
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,160
must have been made by Xie Wei.

378
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,760
It's possible.

379
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,920
"Thunder on a Clear Day."

380
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,720
It's just like his personality.

381
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's try it.

382
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,560
Not bad.

383
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,760
Right?

384
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,640
It's delicious.

385
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
Director Zhu, we filmed

386
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,000
for more than four months.

387
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
How come

388
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,960
they never

389
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,280
cooked for us?

390
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,040
Never.

391
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,680
They really didn't.

392
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,520
Try this.

393
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,200
What is it called?

394
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,920
This one.

395
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,000
"Let's Duel."

396
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,320
It's provocative.

397
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,040
Come duel.

398
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,680
Okay, thank you.

399
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
I think this dish...

400
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,320
"Let's Duel."

401
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,240
Who likes dueling?

402
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,520
They all like it.

403
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,240
Really?

404
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,160
I think it's a bit spicy.

405
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,040
Not a bit, Director Zhu.

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,800
It's so spicy.

407
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,360
It can be spicier.

408
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,840
"Good Fortune."

409
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,800
I already know who made this.

410
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm definitely right.

411
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,480
Lu made it.

412
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,080
This is okay.

413
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,040
Not bad.

414
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,240
Good.

415
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,680
In this...

416
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,600
I think there's a bag of salt in the egg.

417
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,640
Mine is bland.

418
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
So spicy.

419
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,480
This is okay.

420
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,400
Which one do you like the most?

421
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,720
Then pick the worst one.

422
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,840
I think the worst is...

423
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Lu.

424
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
What do you think?

425
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,160
Earlier, we were saying,

426
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,840
"Is it okay?"

427
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
I purposely

428
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
went to the bathroom before I came out.

429
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
I was afraid something might happen,

430
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,400
but we came in and found it's not bad.

431
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,760
Really.

432
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,200
And the food

433
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,560
tastes really good.

434
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,080
Really?

435
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
It's really okay.

436
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,320
Which one is the best?

437
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,840
My favorite is...

438
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,200
I knew it.

439
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,880
Guess who made this.

440
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,240
The name "Thunder on a Clear Day"

441
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
suits Xie Wei's character.

442
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,880
No.

443
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
Look at the first word over there.

444
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,240
Lu made it.

445
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,720
Qin Tianyu.

446
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,640
Tianyu.

447
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,360
"Thunder on a Clear Day."

448
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,120
He's a true chef.

449
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,760
I didn't expect it.

450
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,400
Thank you.

451
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,240
Thank you for your love, Director Zhu.

452
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,040
Delicious.

453
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,480
Thank you.

454
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,560
Awesome.

455
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,400
And...

456
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,960
We from

457
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,840
Just Yoghurt's As You Wish

458
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,320
specially prepared

459
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,280
Just Yoghurt

460
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,040
to welcome you all.

461
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,000
Try one.

462
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,040
Thank you.

463
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,840
Just Yoghurt.

464
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,760
After you really taste it,

465
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
you will understand

466
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
what they mean by

467
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
a full and fresh fruity flavor.

468
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,760
Really?

469
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,200
Yes.

470
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,640
Try it.

471
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,120
Okay.

472
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,040
This Just Yoghurt

473
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,000
tastes so smooth.

474
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,160
The ingredients list is easy to understand too.

475
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,360
Delicious.

476
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,920
Delicious.

477
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,080
One more gulp?

478
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,960
One more.

479
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,760
This one.

480
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,400
This "Not Made by Pisces"

481
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,160
is mine.

482
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,000
I think the worst one is the fish.

483
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,480
It's bland.

484
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
It has no taste at all.

485
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,880
It was heated too much.

486
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,640
The meat is a bit tough.

487
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,240
Yes.

488
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,880
Director Zhu, this dish is really...

489
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,000
I think this dish is really delicious.

490
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
It has a sweet aftertaste.

491
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
Sweet aftertaste.

492
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,120
It's the cleanest dish

493
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
on this table.

494
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,880
Right?

495
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,520
It even has plating.

496
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,320
Wow, you are so fake.

497
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
Earlier, we kept saying

498
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,600
that this one was the worst.

499
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Really?

500
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,640
Yes,

501
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,840
because the fish is too cooked.

502
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
It's too cooked?

503
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,560
Yes.

504
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,720
It was steamed for too long.

505
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,080
On this side, it's still this one

506
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,360
that tastes the worst.

507
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,680
Is it too spicy?

508
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,320
Yes.

509
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,600
It's very spicy.

510
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,800
When I took the first bite,

511
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I turned around to vomit.

512
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Not to vomit.

513
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,360
I choked.

514
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,680
Is it really spicy?

515
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,360
You made this, right?

516
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
It's not very spicy.

517
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,560
I just have no idea

518
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,800
what it tastes like.

519
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
So, Xiening,

520
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,760
don't cook for us in the future.

521
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,800
It doesn't taste good?

522
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,600
No.

523
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,520
It's really not good.

524
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,640
But your dish

525
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,920
really got a lot of attention.

526
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,080
Just now, Haojin and I

527
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
were discussing

528
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
if this or the fish tasted worse.

529
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,520
You won.

530
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,560
I won, right?

531
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,120
The winner of this Wish Challenge is...

532
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,840
Qin Tianyu's team.

533
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,400
So happy.

534
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
He's a true chef.

535
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,160
Delicious.

536
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,520
I like this one

537
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:47,920
and this one.

538
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
I like this one among this group,

539
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,560
this

540
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,080
and this.

541
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,800
So,

542
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,840
I like

543
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,360
this side as a whole.

544
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,600
I like this side too.

545
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Thank you.

546
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,160
Let me try the spiciest one.

547
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,680
Have a taste.

548
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,120
Let me try.

549
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,800
How is it?

550
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,560
It's pretty good.

551
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,720
Look.

552
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,360
Delicious.

553
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
Your standards are too high.

554
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,120
You don't think this good?

555
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,040
You are really picky.

556
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,280
I think this is good.

557
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,120
It's really better than I thought.

558
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
This is the worst.

559
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Let me try.

560
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,840
Let me try the worst fish.

561
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,560
Don't.

562
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,680
Don't get food poisoning.

563
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,880
I'll try your fish.

564
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,200
What's the problem?

565
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,000
I think it's okay

566
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
with the sauce.

567
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Let me try.

568
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,680
This fish doesn't count as good?

569
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,520
You are so picky.

570
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,280
It's our fault.

571
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
We didn't dip the fish in the sauce.

572
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,200
Is this yours?

573
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,640
Is it okay?

574
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,120
Let me try.

575
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
Me too.

576
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,280
Thank you.

577
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,000
I can only talk.

578
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,600
I even ate an egg shell.

579
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,560
Sorry.

580
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
I beat the egg.

581
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,960
Sorry.

582
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
In the future,

583
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,120
don't cook when we eat.

584
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,400
That's normal.

585
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
She wants you to replenish your calcium

586
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
and add to the chewiness.

587
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,080
Lu, the potatoes are delicious.

588
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,040
Very delicious.

589
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,840
This chicken is very successful.

590
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,800
Yes.

591
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Be honest. You didn't expect

592
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,840
that we could cook like this, right?

593
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,760
Yes.

594
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,080
I've tasted

595
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,040
every dish just now.

596
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,200
I think everything is good.

597
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
It's all thanks to you.

598
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,080
The key is that we have a chef like you.

599
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,320
No.

600
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
You are half a chef.

601
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
Me?

602
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm just half?

603
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
You're one too.

604
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,040
But I think today's dishes

605
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,120
can be considered

606
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,160
a highlight of our variety show.

607
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,840
Did you remember

608
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,240
any memorable scenes

609
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,440
from our film process?

610
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,200
Yes.

611
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,360
Many.

612
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,680
Of course, what left a deep impression

613
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,240
was when Lu and Xiening parted.

614
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,120
It was when Xiening was leaving to get married

615
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,440
and Lu went to stop you.

616
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,800
The emotional scene between two good friends.

617
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
I beg you.

618
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
I beg you to not be so understanding.

619
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,680
Be a bad person for once.

620
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,680
I was looking for a place

621
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,720
to stop the filming.

622
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,800
When I wanted to stop,

623
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,760
I suddenly couldn't.

624
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,400
I couldn't interrupt the acting,

625
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,440
so it went a little longer.

626
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,920
When I really couldn't let it continue,

627
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,560
I yelled, "Cut."

628
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,240
Then Lu...

629
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
She changed so quickly.

630
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,720
Then I saw Lu

631
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,520
run out happily and say,

632
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,760
"Director Zhu, how was

633
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,280
my crying scene?"

634
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,320
What about Linghe?

635
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,080
For Linghe,

636
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,000
when I filmed his dementia,

637
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
it was hard to balance it.

638
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,560
The worst thing was

639
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,240
when we tied the machine to him in the countryside.

640
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Wow, his back was almost broken.

641
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,400
When that scene comes out,

642
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
you'll be trending again.

643
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,680
It doesn't matter.

644
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
I often tell people about it,

645
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,520
but I think

646
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,440
this shot

647
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
really has

648
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,680
a lost and confused feeling.

649
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,320
Yes.

650
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,040
A blurred state.

651
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,760
The camera helped me a lot

652
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
for this kind of scene.

653
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,840
What were you thinking at the time?

654
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,560
Like, you suddenly wanted to do

655
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,720
a project like Story of Kunning Palace?

656
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,760
As you all know,

657
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,040
Story of Kunning Palace

658
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,080
is based on Shi JIng's novel

659
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Kunning.

660
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,000
When I read that novel,

661
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,320
I thought that every character

662
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440
was outstanding.

663
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,000
I had this idea at that time.

664
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,960
Lu read the script the earliest.

665
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,920
Yes.

666
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,200
And then Director Zhu, right?

667
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,080
And Linghe.

668
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,720
I'm very happy

669
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,160
that everyone

670
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,280
quite liked this.

671
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,520
Everyone gathered together

672
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,560
and worked hard together.

673
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm very happy

674
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,680
we reached this point.

675
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,760
Thank you all.

676
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
Thank you.

677
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,000
Thank you.

678
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,640
Okay, everyone.

679
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,000
When

680
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,560
Just Yoghurt's As You Wish

681
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,680
airs,

682
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,800
Story of Kunning Palace

683
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,720
might be coming to an end too.

684
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,920
Should we

685
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,640
set a goal

686
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,760
for if Story of Kunning Palace

687
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
exceeds 10,000 in iQIYI's popular index?

688
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,360
We'll cook eight more dishes.

689
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,920
Make another table of food.

690
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,800
Let me tell you.

691
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,880
For segments like this,

692
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,040
the first one to speak

693
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,280
has more control.

694
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,880
Those who can't

695
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,360
end up being passive in the end.

696
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,080
So, the earlier you are, the more control you have.

697
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,880
Set an example.

698
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,080
Set an example

699
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,880
and motivate our group.

700
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,520
Yeah.

701
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,880
On behalf of iQIYI.

702
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,960
On behalf of Story of Kunning Palace.

703
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,360
On behalf of

704
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,200
Just Yoghurt's As You Wish.

705
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,720
How about this?

706
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,520
Think about it.

707
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Okay?

708
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,720
Director Zhu.

709
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,080
Director Zhu, I have an idea.

710
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,320
Do you want to hear it?

711
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,120
What is it?

712
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,400
Let's try a flattop.

713
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
I won't do it even if you kill me.

714
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,400
Absolutely not.

715
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,560
I've never had short hair.

716
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Hey,

717
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,840
I want to see the director carry Quan Haojin bridal style.

718
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,600
This is good.

719
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,720
Is it interesting?

720
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,920
Yes.

721
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,080
Really?

722
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes.

723
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
If you think it's not interesting,

724
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,200
we can wear swimsuits.

725
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,640
No.

726
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,400
I think my status as a producer

727
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,840
is too low.

728
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,640
No.

729
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,440
No one is playing with you.

730
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,120
Really, Lu.

731
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,200
What about our friendship?

732
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,040
Why is this...

733
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,440
The filming is over.

734
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,160
Why are you still talking about this?

735
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,120
Don't change the subject.

736
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,840
Hurry up.

737
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,320
Look.

738
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,920
Linghe, now.

739
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,720
Lu attacked me.

740
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,960
You're attacking me too.

741
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,920
Xiening.

742
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
How did I treat you while filming?

743
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
You were so nice to me,

744
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,480
but you still have to complete the mission.

745
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
How about this?

746
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,280
How about this?

747
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,240
The day before yesterday, everyone showed their abs.

748
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,120
Cui Shaoyang and I were too thin.

749
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,320
I think if our broadcast

750
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,920
does really, really well,

751
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,760
we can set a goal

752
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,480
to encourage ourselves.

753
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,800
I'll do the lightsaber transformation challenge.

754
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,920
Then for me,

755
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,240
I'll be the lightsaber.

756
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,720
Okay?

757
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,920
You pull me out.

758
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,680
Okay, Dawei.

759
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,280
Set a goal.

760
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,320
Help me think of one.

761
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,800
Here's the thing.

762
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,000
He is very good at drawing.

763
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,760
Why don't we let him do a rap?

764
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,960
He's good at drawing

765
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,640
and you're going to make him rap.

766
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,680
How about drawing?

767
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,160
Sure.

768
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,320
This is good.

769
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
I'll draw Story of Kunning Palace.

770
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,200
I'll draw something related to Story of Kunning Palace.

771
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,640
No problem.

772
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,560
Good.

773
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,240
Good.

774
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,400
Ye Xiyue.

775
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,680
I'll treat ten fans to dinner.

776
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,400
Drama fans.

777
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,920
Too few.

778
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,760
As You Wish has one million wishes.

779
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,400
You'd have to...

780
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,040
Set a big banquet.

781
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
A private banquet.

782
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,960
Ten fans.

783
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,600
It works.

784
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,040
This is good.

785
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,520
Yes.

786
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,400
That's good.

787
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,800
What's my idea?

788
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,760
To attend the private banquet?

789
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,320
My idea is...

790
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,280
I'll make a video.

791
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
It's a video showing the contrast of Zhang Zhe.

792
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,639
And everyone...

793
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,360
Because, by then,

794
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,400
we'd be halfway through the drama.

795
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,760
No need. You have quite a contrast right now.

796
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,480
Liu Xiening!

797
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,800
No need. You have quite a contrast right now.

798
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,040
They don't need to watch a video.

799
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,880
Is a video needed?

800
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,840
You're so boring.

801
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
How about this?

802
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,199
I'm afraid of heights,

803
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,960
just like I'm scared of the dark.

804
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm afraid of escape rooms.

805
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,920
That's good.

806
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
Then find a tall one.

807
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
You can do bungee jumping.

808
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,560
Sure, I'll do bungee jumping.

809
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,280
By yourself?

810
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,239
Myself.

811
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,120
Yes, I'm my own team.

812
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,120
You're not a team by yourself.

813
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,239
Then you should team up with me.

814
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,480
What's wrong?

815
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:58,960
No.

816
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,120
As your actor,

817
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,520
you have to accompany me.

818
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,640
Look.

819
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,240
There's something wrong with your words.

820
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,280
You're not my actor.

821
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm an actor of your drama.

822
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,080
Shouldn't you help me?

823
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,080
Xiening, have you figured out what you want to do?

824
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,920
I mean,

825
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
why don't you go bungee jumping with Wang Xingyue?

826
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,280
Why are you dragging me into this?

827
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,240
No.

828
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm not afraid.

829
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,840
I'll give you five seconds.

830
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,400
If you can't come up with anything,

831
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,480
you will go bungee jumping with Wang Xingyue.

832
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,040
Five.

833
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,840
Jump into the pool.

834
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,120
Jump into the pool?

835
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,000
If it's too simple,

836
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,760
will it...

837
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,360
Yes.

838
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,520
You need to do a pose as you jump.

839
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,880
Okay.

840
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,320
I'll cosplay as a character

841
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,440
and jump into the pool, okay?

842
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,640
Elsa or something.

843
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,880
Okay.

844
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,360
No.

845
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,160
We don't care about that now.

846
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
How they jump depends on their fate.

847
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,280
The point is he has to jump with him.

848
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,720
Yes.

849
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,440
This is the most important thing.

850
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,560
You have a good memory.

851
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,880
Anyway, you can  justgo with him.

852
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
I really think...

853
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
How about this?

854
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,440
I'll jump with Producer Quan

855
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,920
and then

856
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,280
you also have to contribute

857
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,800
for our project, right?

858
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,240
What do you mean?

859
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,840
Just jump together.

860
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,360
Yeah.

861
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,160
Okay.

862
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,320
Applause!

863
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,400
Encouragement!

864
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
Go!

865
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,200
You two now.

866
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,440
What?

867
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,800
What?

868
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,640
Do you have any ideas?

869
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,800
I wanted to jump into the pool.

870
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,280
This challenge should be

871
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,960
something exciting.

872
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,560
Exciting.

873
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,280
Something hyped.

874
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,680
Let's think about it first.

875
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,880
If Story of Kunning Palace exceeds 10,000,

876
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
I'll sing and dance to "Good Luck Comes."

877
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,720
Okay.

878
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,760
Okay.

879
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,120
Do you want to sing "Good Luck Comes"?

880
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,960
Think of something else for me.

881
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,760
Just sing the theme song.

882
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,360
Or...

883
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
That works.

884
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,080
How about for 30 seconds?

885
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,840
At least 30 seconds.

886
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
No problem.

887
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,240
Next is our most familiar

888
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,600
Mystery Box of Wish segment.

889
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,000
Who will help us

890
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,520
open today's mystery box?

891
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,360
I haven't done it yet.

892
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,840
Okay.

893
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,200
Today, Lu and Linghe

894
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,280
will open the mystery box.

895
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,200
Okay.

896
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,160
I'll go first.

897
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,840
You choose first.

898
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Choose one.

899
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,520
This one.

900
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,640
Do it.

901
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Let me take a look.

902
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,920
I want to see Bai Lu reenact her famous scenes

903
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,160
in Thai, Cantonese,

904
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,040
Northeastern dialect, Sichuan dialect, and all sorts of dialects.

905
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,960
For example, when Jiang Xuening and Zhang Zhe broke up.

906
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,520
When Jiang Xuening and Zhang Zhe broke up.

907
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,200
Look how happy he is.

908
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,840
For example, Ning...

909
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,760
For example, when Ning'er stabbed Xie Wei.

910
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,040
That kind of famous scene.

911
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,480
Lu, you're amazing.

912
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,040
You know so many languages.

913
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,280
I don't.

914
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,840
Let's just use

915
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,120
Northeastern dialect and Cantonese.

916
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,640
Who first?

917
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,840
First with Zhang Zhe.

918
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,480
Zhang Zhe, you two break up first.

919
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,640
Break up first.

920
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,240
Break up.

921
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,880
Okay, come on.

922
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
Okay, ready.

923
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,040
Start.

924
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,680
Why don't you keep lying to me?

925
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
Why don't you keep lying to me?

926
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,840
I...

927
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
I don't want to anymore.

928
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,120
Is it not allowed?

929
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,720
Don't go.

930
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,760
Don't go.

931
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,520
That's it.

932
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,720
Northeastern dialect.

933
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,560
I'll stab you.

934
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,840
Northeastern dialect?

935
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,560
Tell me your lines.

936
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,360
I'll say it for you.

937
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,760
What if you killed me before?

938
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,200
If...

939
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
If...

940
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
What if you killed me before?

941
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,040
That's Henan dialect.

942
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,080
Don't talk nonsense.

943
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,120
That's from Henan.

944
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,040
Do you want to speak Henan dialect?

945
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,000
Henan dialect works too.

946
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,400
No.

947
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,160
Then how about Henan dialect?

948
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,960
What's his line?

949
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,680
Mine is,

950
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
"Why are you so afraid of me?"

951
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

952
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,440
Come on.

953
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

954
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

955
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

956
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,240
And the line after that,

957
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,400
"Come kill me."

958
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,160
Come do me.

959
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,200
Come stab me.

960
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,320
Come kill me.

961
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,560
Come stab me.

962
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,320
Come on, okay.

963
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,720
Come, Director.

964
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,800
Come on.

965
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,680
Quiet on the set.

966
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,240
Ready.

967
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,080
How do you say it?

968
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,640
How do you say it?

969
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,040
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

970
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:08,880
Come on.

971
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,840
Okay, quiet on the set.

972
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,680
Ready, go.

973
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,160
Who's afraid of whom?

974
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,320
Come on.

975
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,200
One more take, director.

976
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,320
Ready, go.

977
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,280
Laugh it out.

978
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,200
I can't.

979
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,160
I can't.

980
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,160
It's okay.

981
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,560
I can keep acting.

982
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:52,960
Come on.

983
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,320
Okay, start.

984
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

985
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,800
So scary.

986
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,280
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

987
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,960
What if you killed me before?

988
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,840
Why is it Sichuan dialect now?

989
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,200
Are you sure it's an idol drama?

990
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,080
Let's see what he can do.

991
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,000
Come on.

992
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,120
Kill me now.

993
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,960
Kill me.

994
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,600
Kill me.

995
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,760
I'll kill you.

996
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,280
I'll kill you.

997
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm so satisfied.

998
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:19,880
Okay, come.

999
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,160
Lu, draw a wish.

1000
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,360
It's so funny.

1001
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,560
Is this a wish?

1002
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,640
You asked her twice.

1003
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,920
It was hilarious.

1004
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

1005
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,160
I'm really scary? (Why are you so afraid of me?)

1006
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,520
I'll pick the one in the middle.

1007
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,200
Okay.

1008
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,000
Oh no.

1009
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,560
Again?

1010
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,800
No abs.

1011
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,920
What?

1012
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,920
Zhang Linghe do a somersault.

1013
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,480
How?

1014
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,200
Do a back flip.

1015
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,080
I'll make space for you.

1016
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,120
3, 2, 1.

1017
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,840
Awesome.

1018
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,640
The last one.

1019
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,440
Director, go pick one.

1020
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,200
Director.

1021
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,200
Okay.

1022
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,360
Let me see.

1023
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,120
Let me see.

1024
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,520
Can Princess Shen Zhiyi

1025
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,400
post more photos in traditional costumes?

1026
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,560
They want you to post more photos.

1027
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,240
Sure.

1028
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,400
A post with 18 photos.

1029
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,280
Okay.

1030
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,400
Okay, I can do this.

1031
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,680
Next is

1032
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,480
the last theme recording

1033
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,160
of Story of Kunning Palace

1034
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,760
for Just Yoghurt's As You Wish.

1035
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,360
It's an audience gala.

1036
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,520
We've invited

1037
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,160
audience members who love Story of Kunning Palace.

1038
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,960
Let's prepare some shows

1039
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,600
and gifts for the audience.

1040
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,760
Okay.

1041
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,400
Let's move to the next scene.

1042
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,880
Just Yoghurt's As You Wish.

1043
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,240
Welcome everyone

1044
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,160
to the venue for today's gala.

1045
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,120
I had no choice.

1046
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,480
All...

1047
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,400
Five squats.

1048
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,120
One.

1049
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,080
Two.

1050
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,200
Hurry.

1051
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,960
Don't shout.

1052
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,200
This is the hardest part.

1053
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,920
Give up.

1054
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,080
Don't shout.

1055
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,360
Life is easy

1056
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,320
as long as you give up.

1057
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,920
It's too hard.
