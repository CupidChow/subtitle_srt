1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,920
"Wisher."

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,720
"The Bad Kids."

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,360
Team 206!

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,640
Requests for dispatch!

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,320
Have my heart beat faster with the courageous love.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,040
I like you

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,200
I only like you.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,720
Lu Xinghe likes Geng Geng!

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
Are you crazy?

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Being crazy

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,600
is the first step to win love.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,880
Of course,

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
sometimes,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm also troubled by having to wait for the new episodes to update.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,560
I'm about to cry.

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,080
I feel like I'm washing my face.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
To thank all these love,

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,480
my friends in parallel space and time

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,400
made

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,880
"Ten Million Promises" with me.

22
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,360
The leading cast of "Story of Kunning Palace"

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,600
will be the second crew

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
heading to Sanya for team building.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,760
They will also fulfill

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,400
five audience wishes during the team building.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,720
I'm grateful.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,720
To be able to fulfill your wish.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,520
You pack your wishes

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
and I'll take Xue Ning.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,520
Let's set off together.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,840
See you in Sanya.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,120
See you in Sanya.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,400
Travel group of "Story of Kunning Palace,"

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,040
the first one to arrive

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
is the female lead of "Story of Kunning Palace," Bai Lu.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,360
This time,

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,160
there must be a way

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,960
to make a new path.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,040
Get active!

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,600
The first one should bring up the atmosphere.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,680
Okay, the second one.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,720
Who are we inviting?

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,320
The dark preceptor Zhang Linghe.

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
Cinnabar pen

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
determines life and death.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,600
Hello!

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,680
Can you run nicely?

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,400
Dark preceptor, right?

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,160
So I have to be dark.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,360
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,880
Hello.

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,680
Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,480
Please take care of me.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
Also,

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
Jiang Xuening's first love,

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wang Xingyue.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
The Ministry of Justice, Zhang Zhe,

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
greets, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Look, my first love.

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,960
The next grand appearance

62
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,000
are the royal siblings,

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Liu Xiening and Zhou Dawei.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,560
Hello.

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,880
Did you two discuss

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
your outfits?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,680
Island style.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
We have Island style.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,760
Island style.

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,720
You two look like cowboys.

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,079
We are...

72
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,960
Have to match both ways.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
So you are...

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
I am...

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,560
Princess style.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,600
Thank you.

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,720
Finally,

78
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,960
is the strongest assistant group of "Story of Kunning Palace,"

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
Ye Xiyue,

80
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Qin Tianyu,

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,680
and Cui Shaoyang.

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,960
Hello, friends.

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,840
Welcome to Sanya team building.

84
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
Thank iQIYI!

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Thank you, iQIYI!

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Thank you, Story of Kunning Palace!

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,880
Do you have any wishes you want to fulfill

88
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
in Sanya?

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,880
I hope we can have fun

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,040
in Sanya.

91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
And bring out the

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Just Pure Drinking Yogurt full of fruits.

93
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,200
Here.

94
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Thank you.

95
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,760
Here.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Cheers to our reunion.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,480
Cheers!

98
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Cheers!

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Cheers.

100
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,640
The ingredients are simple.

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,320
It's smooth and delicious.

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,880
Cheers.

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,680
As you all know, this program

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,600
is to realize

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
the audience's wish.

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,560
What's the first wish?

107
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,000
The first wish will be revealed soon.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Let's borrow

109
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
Director Zhu's big light

110
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,840
to welcome it.

111
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,440
I think the crew is very close.

112
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,640
I want to see a chemistry test

113
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,560
or a group challenge.

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,400
That's right. It's a chemistry test.

115
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,760
After all, good chemistry is key to

116
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,400
improving acting efficiency.

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,960
Bad chemistry would bring tragedies like...

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,440
Bai Lu should know it best.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,640
I wonder if the actors

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,600
have confidence in their chemistry with each other.

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
We have good chemistry.

122
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,520
Don't talk too early.

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
It's hard to say.

124
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:41,920
It's hard to say.

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
We need to put out a disclaimer first.

126
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,360
It's hard to say.

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,120
The chemistry test begins now.

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,640
Everyone will

129
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
enter a house alone

130
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,240
to make a choice.

131
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,159
As long as the entire team picked the same thing, then it's a success.

132
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,800
There are five chances in total.

133
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
If everyone succeeds in the challenge once

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
within five times,

135
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,640
then

136
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,840
we can get a

137
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,280
seafood feast for dinner.

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,160
W-what if we fail?

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,480
What if we don't succeed?

140
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
If you fail all five times,

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,720
we can only get a "sea product" feast.

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,400
Seafood must be...

143
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,480
Can we eat now?

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Can we eat now?

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,640
Actually, it's already made.

146
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,080
Yes.

147
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,160
It's a waste if we don't eat it.

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,560
Sea product? I'm guessing

149
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,040
it might be seaweed.

150
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,520
Open it.

151
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,440
Is it alive?

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
See? I told you it's seaweed.

153
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,520
Rice balls.

154
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,400
Seaweed rice balls, famous sea product.

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
Isn't this pretty good?

156
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,960
It's good.

157
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,840
Yeah.

158
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,440
It looks like it tastes good.

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
It's delicious.

160
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
There's no carbs here.

161
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,760
This is a carb.

162
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,800
I like carbs.

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Right?

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
You like carbs?

165
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,320
Yes.

166
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,920
How about this?

167
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
He likes carbs.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,040
If we lose...

169
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,360
If we lose, he will take the punishment.

170
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
He eats this.

171
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,920
We eat this.

172
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Yes.

173
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,560
Sure.

174
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,600
Okay, it's happily decided then.

175
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,320
Very happily.

176
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,360
How many times do you think we can succeed within?

177
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Set a goal.

178
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
At least once.

179
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,680
Somewhere in the middle.

180
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,280
Three times.

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
Let's cheers each other up, okay?

182
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,520
Okay.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,280
Go for it!

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,680
Bye bye.

185
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,600
That's all for today's recording.

186
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
You worked hard.

187
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Let's go home.

188
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,640
Xie Wei got jealous after seeing

189
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,520
Jiang Xuening talking to others.

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,320
If you make the same choice, you'll succeed.

191
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,880
Bai Lu, do you like fish mint?

192
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,920
How should I choose?

193
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,640
Three, two, one. Come out.

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,200
Come out, friends.

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,120
Why would anyone choose fish mint?

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
I think we should do this.

197
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
We should follow the topic.

198
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,760
He was jealous.

199
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,480
So he felt very bitter.

200
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,240
And angry.

201
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,880
Yes, so it's bitter gourd.

202
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
Yes, that's why we need to bring the fire down.

203
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
I think so too.

204
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,080
Fish mint tastes bad.

205
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,520
Fish mint...

206
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,640
It tastes bad.

207
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,920
In your heart,

208
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Xie Wei will torture Jiang Xuening on purpose

209
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
and give her bad tasting food?

210
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
and give her bad tasting food?

211
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,960
Remember this lesson.

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,480
Mr. Zhang won't.

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,560
Mr. Zhang won't.

214
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Throw him away.

215
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,760
Mr. Zhang won't.

216
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:34,880
Mr. Zhang won't.

217
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,440
Throw him away.

218
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,360
Mr. Zhang won't.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,640
Mr. Zhang won't.

220
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
Mr. Zhang also chose fish mint.

221
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,880
I don't know.

222
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,800
I saw it there.

223
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
I don't know how to choose.

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
Mr. Zhang won't?

225
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Think of a strategy.

226
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,880
How about this?

227
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
Let's go with A B C.

228
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
We didn't mention ABC.

229
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
How's Cui?

230
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,960
Cui.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,520
Got it?

232
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,440
Yes.

233
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,320
Are you panicking?

234
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
No.

235
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
It's impossible.

236
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,760
Cui.

237
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,920
Where's the options for this?

238
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Zhang Liao wants to sneak into the palace

239
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,960
and invite Lyu Xian

240
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,120
to put a mole on his face to disguise himself.

241
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
Please stick the mole on your face

242
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,080
and pick the position for Zhang Zhe.

243
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
If the position picked is the same, you'll succeed.

244
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
Seriously?

245
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm defeated.

246
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,560
Where are the options.

247
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,240
Wait a minute.

248
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,760
Wait.

249
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,400
Why are you...

250
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,840
You pasted it on your eyes?

251
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
I'm blind.

252
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,080
Tell me.

253
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,440
Tell me.

254
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,160
There are so many places on a face.

255
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,720
How can we choose the same position?

256
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:28,800
How can we choose the same position?

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
So she was very confident just now.

258
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,360
Saying we'd definitely get it wrong.

259
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,920
No.

260
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,880
At least we're all sticking it on our faces, right?

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,200
Do you have a new strategy for the next round?

262
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,040
It's useless.

263
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
Useless.

264
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,960
Using a strategy is useless.

265
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,320
Just come on.

266
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,000
Just do it.

267
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,040
Okay.

268
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,120
Since you don't have a strategy,

269
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,480
then let's go inside.

270
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,600
Good luck.

271
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,080
What is this?

272
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
The life of Jiang Xuening and Shen Jie

273
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,480
is rewritten again

274
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,560
and they now have a superpower.

275
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,640
What kind of superpower

276
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,040
will make them miss each other?

277
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,240
I like this question.

278
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,400
How about A B C?

279
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,520
Choose Cui. How's that?

280
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,040
It should be right once.

281
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,640
Cui Shaoyang!

282
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,680
It's so cold.

283
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,920
Zhang Linghe,

284
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
what did you do

285
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,000
when you came out?

286
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,560
B.

287
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,200
It's that.

288
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
I shivered.

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,120
I shivered.

290
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,480
This move is A.

291
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,800
This move is B.

292
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,680
A is this.

293
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,200
This is B.

294
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,160
This is C.

295
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,400
Alright.

296
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,960
Stop talking.

297
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,120
C.

298
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,360
C.

299
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Everyone is different.

300
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,120
Cui Shaoyang.

301
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,920
Everyone is different.

302
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,000
This is too much.

303
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,320
You guys are really bad.

304
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,240
It's too hard.

305
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,600
Why would anyone choose fish mint?

306
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,840
There are so many positions on one face.

307
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
How can we choose the same position?

308
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,680
This move is A.

309
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,640
This move is B.

310
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,760
Everyone is different.

311
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,600
This is too much.

312
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,920
Let's go inside.

313
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,600
So soon?

314
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,240
Zhang Zhe met the proud Xue Shu.

315
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,320
To attract her attention,

316
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,200
he gave her a fruit.

317
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,880
Zheng Zhe gave her a fruit.

318
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,400
Wang Xingyue!

319
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,960
This one.

320
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,480
The green one.

321
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
Come out with your choice.

322
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,760
Wang Xingyue.

323
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,200
Liu Xiening, Ye Xiyue, come out.

324
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
Why did you tsk at me?

325
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,480
They are holding onto a different one from you too.

326
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,680
Okay, let’s show it.

327
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,800
Isn’t Wang Xingyue’s clothes green?

328
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
I thought it was Wang Xingyue.

329
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,040
Yellow Xingyue.

330
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,400
Wang Xingyue.

331
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
Yes.

332
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
That's ridiculous.

333
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,240
Tell me about this red one.

334
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,720
Red.

335
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,640
Red heart.

336
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,480
Now you only have one last chance.

337
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,960
Okay.

338
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Let's think of a strategy.

339
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,000
How about this?

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
We'll choose the smallest one this time.

341
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,200
What if there's no size?

342
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
The smallest and lowest is the simplest.

343
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
I saw the question.

344
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,760
Who didn't close the door?

345
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,520
Close the door.

346
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,520
And take a look while you're at it.

347
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:20,920
What?

348
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,880
What is it?

349
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,680
What?

350
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,800
He really went to close the door

351
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,120
not to steal questions.

352
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,000
Come back.

353
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,440
There are too many words.

354
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,480
I didn't have time to read them.

355
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
Okay, let's go in.

356
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
The smallest, the simplest.

357
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Chicken feet.

358
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
You are Xue Dingfei.

359
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,080
You are meeting Xie Wei at the tavern.

360
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,880
The waiter will serve a plate of chicken feet.

361
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,680
Please enjoy.

362
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,080
If the number of chicken feet everyone ate is the same,

363
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
you succeed.

364
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,000
This pair of chopsticks.

365
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,960
These chopsticks are really good.

366
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,200
This pair of chopsticks.

367
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
How many chopsticks are there?

368
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,080
Chopsticks?

369
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
I will just try two.

370
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
I ate two.

371
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Two?

372
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,120
Ate two.

373
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
I ate two.

374
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,120
How many did you eat?

375
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,440
Two.

376
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Yes.

377
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,560
Yeah.

378
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,640
I'm not done eating.

379
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,120
You're not done eating two?

380
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,960
I ate two.

381
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:31,920
Two.

382
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
I ate it.

383
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,680
You licked it.

384
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,280
Yes.

385
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
We were there.

386
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,120
I have to have the seafood feast.

387
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,040
Spitting out the bones.

388
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,840
Yes, I ate it.

389
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,520
That means I ate it.

390
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,040
He just licked it.

391
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
There's another person.

392
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,480
Come out.

393
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,040
Leaving two behind, right?

394
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,960
Oh no. This person...

395
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,560
How many chopsticks are there?

396
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:14,839
No.

397
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,480
I was worried that

398
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,119
the number of chicken feet they gave us are different.

399
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,599
They asked how many we ate.

400
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,000
I ate it all then.

401
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Xue Dingfei.

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
I think you should eat the seaweed rice balls.

403
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
I-I thought

404
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,200
you'd think the same as I did.

405
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,560
No.

406
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,080
The person who has the least in this round gets to eat, okay?

407
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,840
Let him eat.

408
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,360
It doesn't make sense.

409
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,280
Whoever is wrong will be punished.

410
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,960
Listen to me.

411
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,760
We were so obvious just now.

412
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,600
How many chopsticks are there?

413
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,240
Exactly.

414
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,600
The minority obeys the majority.

415
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,480
He eats the seaweed rice balls with Wang Xingyue.

416
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,520
What?

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,360
How about this?

418
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,480
Let them eat seafood.

419
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,640
We'll have the seaweed rice balls.

420
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,920
I ate too much meat.

421
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,440
That's fine.

422
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,240
Let's go there.

423
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
Okay.

424
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,040
Although you lost the game,

425
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,600
you just showed

426
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,040
the team spirit that our crew won't give up.

427
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,760
It's bitter gourd.

428
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,680
We believe "Story of Kunning Palace"

429
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,160
We believe "Story of Kunning Palace"

430
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,600
is also birthed under such a team spirit.

431
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,840
I want to give you a big compliment.

432
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
The first chemistry test

433
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
for all members to give the same answer,

434
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,240
has failed.

435
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,360
Congratulations.

436
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,840
You got "Sea product" feast as lunch.

437
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,560
Thank you, iQIYI.

438
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm so happy.

439
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,080
Thank you, crew.

440
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,320
Thank you, crew.

441
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,920
Thank you.

442
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
Thank you, "Story of Kunning Palace."

443
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,440
Wow.

444
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,720
I like it so much.

445
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,040
Amazing.

446
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Here.

447
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
Different flavors, right?

448
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
Pick one.

449
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,120
The Imperial Family is so different.

450
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,880
A sense of ritual.

451
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,720
A sense of ritual.

452
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,680
Here, a sense of ritual.

453
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,760
Let's cheers?

454
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,800
Cheers.

455
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,680
Why are they drinking crossed-cup wine?

456
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,160
Here, a sense of ritual.

457
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,520
Here.

458
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,360
I feel uncomfortable.

459
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
What are you doing?

460
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm off work.

461
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm off work.

462
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,600
The story of three people is destined not to include you.

463
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,800
The rice is a bit undercooked.

464
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
It's a little hard to swallow.

465
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,560
Seaweed rice balls.

466
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,320
Is it delicious?

467
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes.

468
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,880
What do you think?

469
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you want some?

470
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,920
Today is our first team building.

471
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,680
So,

472
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
we decided to give you another chance

473
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,520
to fight for the seafood feast.

474
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,320
How's that?

475
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Okay!

476
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Before the last day of our team building,

477
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,400
create a present for the audience

478
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
who has been supporting "Story of Kunning Palace,"

479
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,760
and we can have the seafood feast today.

480
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Is that okay?

481
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,240
Yes.

482
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,120
Okay!

483
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,160
Then we can have seafood feast.

484
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,320
Have one.

485
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Thank you.

486
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,240
Can you do it?

487
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,800
Can you?

488
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,640
I can't.

489
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
I can't.

490
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,760
How about this?

491
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Don't play this drama.

492
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,560
What do you mean?

493
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,960
I heard you were eating hot pot

494
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
the temperature was really high, right?

495
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,760
The three of us.

496
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,960
The three of us.

497
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,200
They were "dating."

498
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
When?

499
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
You're the only one who doesn't know.

500
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,200
That day,

501
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,840
he asked you to eat on his birthday.

502
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,680
But you didn't go.

503
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,080
What was the scene like?

504
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,200
It was Zhang Zhe

505
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
and Miss Jiang.

506
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
Miss Jiang.

507
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,000
It was very romantic

508
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
and snowing

509
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,120
while they ate hot pot,

510
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,560
and there were fireworks setting off on the side.

511
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,680
They were there–

512
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,080
Get to the point.

513
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,560
The point is you were not there.

514
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,280
What did you say?

515
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,400
What did you say?

516
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I didn't say anything.

517
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
Should we have a toast?

518
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,120
Here.

519
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,840
Long time no see.

520
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,000
Long time no see.

521
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,480
May "Story of Kunning Palace" be a hit!

522
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,040
Be a hit!

523
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,360
"Ten Million Promises"

524
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,440
be a hit, okay?

525
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Did you notice any details

526
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,600
while you were raising your cups just now?

527
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
The cup

528
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,320
have different colors.

529
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,200
There are different styles too.

530
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,520
Yes. The cup decides the grouping for the next part.

531
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,960
But she...

532
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
You two are one group.

533
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,800
Why don't we switch?

534
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,680
We're splitting teams?

535
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm sensible.

536
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,040
I'll change with you.

537
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,880
The main point is to be sensible.

538
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,200
I won't change with you.

539
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,440
Go away.

540
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,280
Sensible.

541
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,880
Extra.

542
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
Sensible.

543
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,320
The final result of four cups is...

544
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,760
Groups of two.

545
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,400
Groups of two.

546
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,760
Come on.

547
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,280
Let's raise our glasses

548
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,520
to verify it.

549
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,840
Sensible.

550
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,920
I report cheating!

551
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,040
There's no cheating!

552
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,960
There's someone cheating!

553
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,720
Wishing you happiness.

554
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,600
You will only know this round's content

555
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
in 30 minutes.

556
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
You can move around freely in  this 30 minutes.

557
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,520
In 30 minutes,

558
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,640
you need to find

559
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
the location of the mission.

560
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,000
A hint.

561
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
The final mission has something to do with chemistry.

562
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,280
In 30 minutes,

563
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,600
the two players have to be together for the entire time.

564
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,560
Like this?

565
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,320
The order of completion of the mission

566
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,800
will determine

567
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,040
will determine

568
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,320
the budget you get for

569
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,920
food delivery for dinner tonight.

570
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,720
300 yuan.

571
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,560
200 yuan.

572
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Each team, come up with a slogan for yourself.

573
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,920
When Wei Ning takes action,

574
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,120
they have everything in the world.

575
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
Good!

576
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
Us too!

577
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,520
Take down the 300 yuan.

578
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,960
Cousins are not tired if they're together.

579
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,320
Fake sisters, dispirited together.

580
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,360
Now we can

581
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,400
set off.

582
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
Take a walk and take photos

583
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
with your partner.

584
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,720
Enjoy the team building time.

585
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,320
Let's go!

586
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Go!

587
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm walking but you. have to run.

588
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
Go.

589
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,080
Wait.

590
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,600
Are your shoes fine?

591
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,280
No.

592
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,080
Wait for me.

593
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,680
Wait.

594
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,640
Wow, the beach.

595
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,120
Wait.

596
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,480
We are forced to be a couple.

597
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
We didn't do it willingly.

598
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,200
You're making it sound like I'm willing.

599
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
I just volunteered to fulfil them.

600
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,840
Why did they go there?

601
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,440
They went there to play.

602
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,080
Let's take a look.

603
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,640
Take a look.

604
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,520
Slow down.

605
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,280
Hurry up.

606
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,640
You look like you're walking something.

607
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,040
You know?

608
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,680
Hurry up.

609
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,800
Come down!

610
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm not going.

611
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,800
How can I go without you?

612
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,680
Ridiculous.

613
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
What a coincidence!

614
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,960
Those fated to be will always meet again, right?

615
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,400
Let's go.

616
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,720
Why are you chasing me?

617
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,640
Why are you following us?

618
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,400
We'll do

619
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
whatever you do.

620
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
Why are you following us?

621
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,960
I'm going to tell the teacher.

622
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,280
What if we lay down on the beach chair?

623
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,600
Then we will lay down too.

624
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
They're so good at following us.

625
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Change places!

626
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Follow them.

627
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,760
Let's go to the reef, okay?

628
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
We learned from you.

629
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,280
Reefs.

630
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,200
See what there is.

631
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:48,960
No.

632
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,040
We need to think about

633
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,400
what this 30 minute test is.

634
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,480
I don't think

635
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
it's sports related, right?

636
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,280
I don't think so.

637
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,680
They said we have to take photos too.

638
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,280
Look at my photography skills.

639
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,160
I don't trust it.

640
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,960
Come.

641
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,440
Let me tell you.

642
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,000
The photos I look good in

643
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,960
is because I look like this.

644
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,200
What?

645
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,600
Let me see.

646
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,080
Take a look.

647
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,240
Take a look.

648
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

649
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,960
look at the photo I took for him.

650
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,920
Then, look at the photos he took for me.

651
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,280
Look.

652
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,520
The photo I took for Zhang Linghe.

653
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,040
Pretty boy.

654
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,000
Gosh.

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,040
Look at the one he took for me.

656
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
Let me take a photo of your back.

657
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
No need.

658
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,960
Let me take a photo of your back and–

659
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,320
No need.

660
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,920
No need.

661
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
I won't take it then.

662
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
That's it.

663
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,400
Ning'er.

664
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,840
Let's take a photo.

665
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,520
Come on.

666
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,360
Can you lift it higher?

667
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,280
Higher.

668
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,120
That's it.

669
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,200
Your phototaking skills.

670
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,120
What do you mean?

671
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
You're really not good at taking photos.

672
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,760
You set these settings.

673
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,320
It looks nice.

674
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Let's go.

675
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,040
Let's go find somewhere

676
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,600
for a walk.

677
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,440
Let's walk around.

678
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
We might find something.

679
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,360
Why are you following us?

680
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,040
Why are you following us?

681
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,360
Go quickly!

682
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,560
We aren't.

683
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,880
We're just going this way.

684
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
Don't follow us.

685
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,800
Don't imitate us.

686
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
Do you have any ideas?

687
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,080
Should we go to the pool?

688
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
Swimming pool?

689
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,880
We haven't been to the pool.

690
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
Let's go to the pool first.

691
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
Frisbee?

692
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
There's a frisbee.

693
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,240
Frisbee?

694
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,000
This is a mission.

695
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,720
Definitely.

696
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,520
They are over there.

697
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,240
What are you doing?

698
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,640
We're...

699
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm not telling you.

700
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,520
Where did you get the frisbee?

701
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,560
We found it ourselves.

702
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,240
We found it ourselves.

703
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,520
We found a mission.

704
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,960
We found a mission.

705
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,560
Really?

706
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,880
We all found one.

707
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,760
Yeah.

708
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,800
You lost.

709
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,480
You're at least

710
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,960
at 80 yuan now.

711
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,640
You know?

712
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,840
Only the two of you are fooling around.

713
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
You've been just fooling around, right?

714
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,640
Let us help you take it.

715
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,120
Let me tell you.

716
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,960
Just write

717
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,800
Xie Wei and Jiang Xuening on this

718
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,200
and the waves will take them away.

719
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,720
Really?

720
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,160
Yes.

721
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm Monkey D. Luffy!

722
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,760
You two have fun.

723
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,120
You two play.

724
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,880
Go on.

725
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,400
Have fun.

726
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,320
I think there must be something else.

727
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Because our challenge

728
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
has something to do with chemistry.

729
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,920
It depends on how much chemistry we have.

730
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,120
Last time it was chemistry.

731
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,560
This time, it's couple chemistry.

732
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,600
So, is it related to this?

733
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,800
I think it's very likely.

734
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,600
Something like when they look at the photos taken later,

735
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
whether if you have a lot of photos in the same poses.

736
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,040
Yes.

737
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,000
It's very likely.

738
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,280
How about this?

739
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,040
Let's just take two photos.

740
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,760
Three.

741
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,640
Two.

742
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,160
One.

743
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,480
Wait.

744
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,720
Let's take one too.

745
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,480
You have photos too.

746
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,560
You're in every photo.

747
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,600
30 minutes have passed.

748
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
The mission location is near the swimming pool.

749
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,160
Let's find the director who distributes the mission.

750
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,520
Congratulations

751
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
on finding the mission location.

752
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,880
Are there a secret traps here?

753
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,920
We have to sit back facing each other right?

754
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,280
Yes.

755
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,120
I want my left face.

756
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,080
Thank you.

757
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,000
My right face happens to be the better looking one.

758
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,320
What we are testing now

759
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,280
is still chemistry.

760
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,640
But it's a couple chemistry.

761
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,240
I'll propose a question

762
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,760
related to one of you.

763
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,800
Please write down your answers

764
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,040
on the question board.

765
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,480
If the answer is correct and the same,

766
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
it will be considered a success.

767
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,080
Okay.

768
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Bai Lu's debut work is...

769
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,880
Oh no.

770
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,840
You can't get it correctly.

771
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,680
Debut work,

772
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,840
it is not necessarily a drama.

773
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,280
Wait.

774
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,120
I'll wipe it off.

775
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Okay.

776
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,280
Please show your board.

777
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,000
We don't count...

778
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,080
This is not the debut work

779
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,600
we found on search.

780
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,920
we found on search.

781
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,480
You can't trust that.

782
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
It's Lu Hu's "Message."

783
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,920
I wrote it just now.

784
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,600
Actually the first thing I wrote just now

785
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,400
was "Message."

786
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,120
But I don't think you can guess that.

787
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,160
So I changed it to match yours.

788
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,320
You guys are too harsh.

789
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,360
Let me look.

790
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,760
You can see it too?

791
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,000
I've seen this before.

792
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,720
I just didn't know

793
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
it's the part of this work.

794
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,120
I've seen this part.

795
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,240
It's nice.

796
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,760
It's nice.

797
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,440
We failed this round.

798
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,520
Next you will go for

799
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,920
another ten minutes of free time.

800
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,720
This doesn't count as a failure.

801
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,800
How did it go?

802
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
We have the same answer.

803
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,880
Wrong.

804
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,480
Well,

805
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,320
we should have some ideas now.

806
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,920
What else? Think about it.

807
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,160
Think about it.

808
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
The first song I released.

809
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,760
The one on your Weibo?

810
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,400
No.

811
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,040
No?

812
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,520
My first song was a long time ago.

813
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,720
"Untouchable Lovers."

814
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,360
"Untouchable Lovers" from "Untouchable Lovers."

815
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Really?

816
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,920
Is the song called "Untouchable Lovers"?

817
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,600
No.

818
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,520
Wait.

819
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
What song was it?

820
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,800
What will Dawei choose

821
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,320
between raising a cat or a dog?

822
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,440
You know adults.

823
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,280
You know adults.

824
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
Choose one between two.

825
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
A life and death choice.

826
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,800
Come on.

827
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,600
I want them all.

828
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,080
I didn't think of that.

829
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,679
Adults don't make choices, you mean?

830
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,639
Didn't I hint you?

831
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,960
I was thinking whether an adult has cats or dogs.

832
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,040
The song that Liu Xiening is dancing to in the photo is?

833
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Please show your board.

834
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,199
She definitely doesn't know

835
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,040
Fake sisters, dispirited together.

836
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,480
When Wang Xingyue

837
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,520
carried Bai Lu bridal style on the set,

838
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,480
what were the colors of the clothes they wore?

839
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,080
Three, two, one.

840
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,240
Please show your board.

841
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,000
Because

842
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,960
Jiang Xuening was injured in that scene.

843
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,720
I have to carry her down from the carriage.

844
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,080
There's no chair.

845
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,640
Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands

846
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,560
and jump.

847
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,960
Bai Lu said

848
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,400
can you do it, Wang Xingyue?

849
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,440
So I refused to back down.

850
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,320
Then I got on the carriage and carried her down.

851
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,640
And walked a few more rounds.

852
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,880
I sent it to someone.

853
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,960
He was so angry that he didn't reply my message.

854
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,800
Anyway, he got angry.

855
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,080
The next day,

856
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,800
when he saw me coming to the set with Bai Lu,

857
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,320
he went "Oh, you two had a good time filming last night."

858
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,200
We should grab two phones

859
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,840
and check each other's Baidu Baike.

860
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,600
They all checked it from Baidu Baike.

861
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,760
Help us search it up.

862
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,320
Search what?

863
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,240
Search our names.

864
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,480
Baidu Baike.

865
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,560
Our names.

866
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,120
The next question should be yours.

867
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Search it.

868
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,320
Search your name.

869
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,120
Search yours.

870
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,520
Search mine?

871
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,200
Yes.

872
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,480
Your favorite singer.

873
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,760
Your favorite singer?

874
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,040
Other teams have been asked this question.

875
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,280
I don't think they'll ask anymore.

876
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Let me think.

877
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,160
Your favorite food.

878
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,600
I like meat.

879
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
Me too.

880
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,880
Color, green.

881
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,680
I like green.

882
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,360
Two green.

883
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,000
You like billiards?

884
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,760
Yes.

885
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,040
I can ride bikes and swim.

886
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,240
And games.

887
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,160
Rose.

888
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,960
I can ride bikes and swim.

889
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,160
A game expert.

890
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,080
We should be able to make it when we go in next time, right?

891
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,560
No problem.

892
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,600
You'll definitely be number one.

893
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,920
Let me tell you.

894
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,600
This topic is too tricky.

895
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,440
It's useless to think of anything.

896
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,200
Well,

897
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,040
they didn't say you can't cheat.

898
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,800
I will just hint it to you.

899
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,320
For example, colors.

900
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,040
I will list out all the colors.

901
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
Either pick the first or the second option.

902
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,800
So when they ask color,

903
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,320
you just say, "Colors,

904
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,640
Is it red or yellow?"

905
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,600
Then we choose red.

906
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,920
Red. Yes.

907
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,800
If there are two people,

908
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,120
let's choose one or two.

909
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,240
Anyway, always pick the first one.

910
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,480
If he asks us,

911
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,840
who is more handsome?

912
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,440
It's me.

913
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,840
No. There will be discourse for this.

914
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,480
Should we prioritize winning

915
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,360
or our own opinions?

916
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,760
Prioritize winning.

917
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,120
If we want to prioritize winning, then say it's me.

918
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,520
Say something nice to me though it's against your conscience.

919
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,040
All right. Okay.

920
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,840
No problem.

921
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,480
"Maiden Holmes."

922
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,120
"Flourish in Time."

923
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,040
"Love Crossed."

924
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,800
What if the question asked later

925
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,080
is not about me,

926
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,760
what should we do?

927
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,920
Then it's about me.

928
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
About my hobbies.

929
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,760
You have so many hobbies.

930
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I don't have...

931
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,920
that many hobbies.

932
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,640
Sleeping.

933
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,400
You're making the audience

934
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,680
think

935
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm lazy.

936
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,320
My hobbies are reading, calligraphy,

937
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
painting, and dancing.

938
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm good at everything.

939
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,760
Yes. In your dream.

940
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Okay. Continue the challenge.

941
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,880
Has someone won the first place?

942
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,200
Not yet?

943
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,800
No.

944
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,600
We are gonna win the first place.

945
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,360
Time's up.

946
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,600
Okay.

947
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,320
Continue the challenge.

948
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,400
Okay. Continue the challenge.

949
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Come on.

950
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,680
Come on.

951
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,000
This question is about Zhang Linghe.

952
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,480
In an interview in 2021...

953
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,040
In 2021...

954
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,720
Who did Zhang Linghe say he looks like?

955
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,840
This question has more than one choice.

956
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,160
Please listen to the choices.

957
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,280
Takuya Kimura.

958
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,200
Jerry Yan.

959
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,320
Lee Min-ho.

960
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Takeshi Kaneshiro.

961
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,520
It has more than one choice, right?

962
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,480
If it has more than one choice,

963
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,960
I don't think all of them are correct.

964
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,520
There should be about 3.

965
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,760
Please show the answers.

966
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,280
Bingo.

967
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,320
Are they correct?

968
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
Let's watch a video.

969
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,160
Okay.

970
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,040
A lot of people said

971
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,280
you look like Lee Min-ho

972
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,800
and Jerry Yan.

973
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,680
I know someone said I look like Jerry Yan.

974
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,720
The director of "Love Crossed"

975
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,240
told me that.

976
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,200
He said I look like Jerry Yan

977
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
from some angles in the camera.

978
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,120
As for looking like Lee Min-ho,

979
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,240
I had a style

980
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,320
with bangs.

981
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,600
I was a little chubby back then.

982
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,720
A little.

983
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,560
I'm not saying Lee Min-ho is fat.

984
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,000
I mean I look like him to some extent.

985
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
And someone said I look like Takuya Kimura.

986
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,400
Maybe he looked more like Lee Min-ho

987
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,360
when he just debuted.

988
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,240
That kind of expression, maybe.

989
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,800
Yes, at that time.

990
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,560
At that time.

991
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,920
He looks like Takuya Kimura now.

992
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,800
Because his hair is longer.

993
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,080
And Takeshi Kaneshiro...

994
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,640
Well...

995
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,160
Think twice before you say anything.

996
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,320
He doesn't look like him at all.

997
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,160
What did you just say?

998
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,640
We won, right?

999
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,440
Congratulations.

1000
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,200
You've succeeded.

1001
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,880
You are a team with the best tacit understanding.

1002
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,720
Please come and get 300 yuan for takeout.

1003
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,720
We want to show off.

1004
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,520
See?

1005
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
300 yuan.

1006
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,560
Give us 50 yuan, okay?

1007
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,040
We're gonna sit here to watch you guys.

1008
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,000
What type of song

1009
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,880
is Liu Xiening's favorite?

1010
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,800
I know.

1011
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm writing down the answer.

1012
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,040
Bingo.

1013
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,520
Ta-da.

1014
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,200
Congratulations.

1015
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,000
You've succeeded in the tacit understanding challenge.

1016
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,160
You get 200 yuan for takeout.

1017
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,640
So what?

1018
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,920
You're not the first place.

1019
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,680
Wow.

1020
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
We're here.

1021
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Wait and see.

1022
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,880
We'll win.

1023
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,480
Let's go.

1024
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't believe we'll fail this time.

1025
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,320
We have to win.

1026
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,680
What does Zhou Dawei think

1027
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,920
his ranking in terms of badminton skills is

1028
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
among the crew of Story of Kunning Palace?

1029
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,920
Please show the answer.

1030
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,080
Are you the best?

1031
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,240
Zhou Dawei,

1032
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,680
have you ever defeated me once?

1033
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,760
Absolutely.

1034
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,880
Among the crew, Wang Xingyue always paid the bills.

1035
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,480
How many times has he paid

1036
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
when he was with the crew?

1037
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,520
Well,

1038
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,920
I myself don't even remember that.

1039
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,360
I see.

1040
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,840
This is definitely gonna make you the fourth place.

1041
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm gonna write down a random number.

1042
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm gonna write down a random number.

1043
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,960
That's it.

1044
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,920
Really?

1045
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
I can't believe you guessed it right.

1046
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,960
I want to ask you

1047
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,680
why you both wrote 21 at the same time.

1048
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,400
Because it doesn't matter.

1049
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,760
Whatever.

1050
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,600
Congratulations.

1051
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,960
You've succeeded in the tacit understanding challenge.

1052
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,720
Thank you.

1053
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,840
You can have 80 yuan for takeout.

1054
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,520
Tianyu, Dawei,

1055
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,880
no need to try.

1056
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,040
We've succeeded.

1057
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,640
They've succeeded?

1058
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
They've succeeded?

1059
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,400
Then it's over.

1060
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,320
Is there anyone else?

1061
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,240
Oh, no. Then we...

1062
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,440
Aren't we the last?

1063
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
The game is over.

1064
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,600
I hope the tacit understanding challenge

1065
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,120
can help you know more

1066
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,360
about your partners.

1067
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,760
Our favorite food.

1068
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,200
Meat is my favorite food.

1069
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Me too.

1070
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,520
My hobby now is swimming.

1071
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,000
Red. Yes.

1072
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,560
I hope you can also gain precious friendships

1073
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,080
while working efficiently.

1074
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
Next, you can discuss your takeout

1075
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,080
Next, you can discuss your takeout

1076
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,320
for tonight's dinner.

1077
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,880
The afternoon break.

1078
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,960
The afternoon break.

1079
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,600
The food you ordered has been delivered.

1080
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,520
Enjoy the food.

1081
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,240
It takes a long time to open it.

1082
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,880
Let me help you.

1083
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,600
Let me show you our fried chicken.

1084
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,760
Healthy sandwiches.

1085
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,000
A 30 yuan set meal.

1086
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,080
Ours is Qingbuliang.

1087
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,680
Wenchang chicken.

1088
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,720
Coconut rice.

1089
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,520
Shrimp pancakes,

1090
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,040
and some skewers.

1091
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,520
We didn't order too much.

1092
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,240
Just some seafood products

1093
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,520
and BBQ.

1094
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,920
Something that you can't buy with 30 yuan.

1095
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,880
Time to eat.

1096
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,800
Let's eat.

1097
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,040
Let me see what their food is.

1098
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,480
Wang Xingyue.

1099
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,760
Give me one.

1100
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,480
Let me see.

1101
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,200
You...

1102
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,440
Why were you so easily fooled?

1103
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,360
Why were you so easily fooled?

1104
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,440
There was nothing I could do. I'm no match for them.

1105
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,120
You gave them just because they asked for it?

1106
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,520
Well...

1107
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,560
Do you want some?

1108
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,480
If you want some, present a talent show.

1109
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,000
Don't think I'm cold-hearted.

1110
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,320
Come on.

1111
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Dawei used to be a model, right?

1112
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,680
How about presenting a catwalk show?

1113
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,240
Really?

1114
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,960
Really?

1115
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,160
Yes.

1116
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,960
Come on.

1117
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,080
Give him some music.

1118
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,680
Remember to stop in the halfway.

1119
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,280
Come on. Let's welcome the next contestant, Zhou Dawei.

1120
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,800
You can do it.

1121
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,400
You can do it.

1122
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,840
That's not enough.

1123
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,600
Let me show you something else.

1124
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:15,720
Good.

1125
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,080
Very good.

1126
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,600
Eat.

1127
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,720
Thank you.

1128
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,080
Go.

1129
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,160
We earned it with our own efforts.

1130
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,440
It tastes better.

1131
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,360
It tastes different.

1132
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,360
You're almost done eating, right?

1133
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,840
As you can see, beside the table,

1134
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,600
there are wish mystery boxes.

1135
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Behind each meme,

1136
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,840
there is a fan's wish

1137
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,440
collected on Weibo.

1138
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,720
Pick wishes every day and make them come true.

1139
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,760
You can choose a representative

1140
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,840
to open the mystery boxes.

1141
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,040
Let the one who is the closest to the wish boxes do it.

1142
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,760
Okay, I'll do it.

1143
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,800
I'm gonna pick

1144
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,080
my portrait first.

1145
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,360
The first one.

1146
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,080
Can you ask Zhang Linghe

1147
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,040
to read his fans' private messages?

1148
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,600
Sure.

1149
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,200
I'm gonna read one related to the variety show.

1150
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,040
I really love Xie Wei.

1151
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,720
When can the new variety show be released?

1152
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,000
The postgraduate entrance exam is so tiring.

1153
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,200
The new variety show made me laugh heartily.

1154
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,680
I'm gonna pick Jiang Xuening.

1155
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,920
This one must be a fan of Lu's.

1156
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,080
I want to see Bai Lu open a coconut.

1157
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,280
Later, I will...

1158
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,280
How should I open this?

1159
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,800
Maybe just smash it on the ground.

1160
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,200
Good.

1161
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,480
We opened it on both sides.

1162
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,880
This is good.

1163
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,960
It's done.

1164
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Who wants to drink this?

1165
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,680
I want to drink it.

1166
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:15,720
Okay.

1167
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,560
I'm gonna pick

1168
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,160
Zhang Linghe.

1169
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
I want to see this too.

1170
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,920
This wish is

1171
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,680
please

1172
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,720
ask the actors to do girls group dance.

1173
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,760
Wow.

1174
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,720
I want to see it too.

1175
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,640
We want to see it too.

1176
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,240
But the problem is we don't know how to dance.

1177
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,600
Do you need to learn the dance moves?

1178
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,360
But you don't have the copyright

1179
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,000
of any girls group dance.

1180
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,240
We have the copyright of "Yes OK".

1181
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,680
You have the copyright of "Yes OK"?

1182
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,840
We're iQIYI.

1183
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,920
Learn.

1184
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,160
We want to learn.

1185
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,400
You don't need to learn?

1186
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,920
Do you know how to dance?

1187
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,560
Let's pick the chorus part directly.

1188
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,440
Skip the front part.

1189
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,680
The left hand.

1190
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,440
One, two, three.

1191
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:09,720
Okay.

1192
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,040
I've learned it.

1193
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,760
Teach us first.

1194
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,480
One, two, three.

1195
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,600
It's not like this.

1196
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,760
It's like this.

1197
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,040
It's... "YES! OK!".

1198
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,040
One, two, three.

1199
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,200
Why don't you come and teach us here,

1200
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Assistant Teacher?

1201
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,320
You need to stand in front of us and lead us to dance.

1202
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
What if I'm wrong?

1203
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,320
I'm just gonna teach you, okay?

1204
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,000
Look. When you are dancing...

1205
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,680
One, two, three.

1206
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,400
It's down.

1207
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,160
It's down.

1208
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,120
One, two, three.

1209
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,520
Then...

1210
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,560
Go.

1211
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,440
Balabalaba.

1212
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,080
Should I move my butt too?

1213
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,640
Of course.

1214
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,200
Balabalaba.

1215
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,000
That's it.

1216
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,680
That's enough.

1217
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
There's more.

1218
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,360
That's enough.

1219
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,720
And this.

1220
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,640
A move that makes you seem a little shy.

1221
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,360
Like this.

1222
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,200
There's something on the tip of your nose.

1223
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,680
There is something.

1224
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,400
Something is on the tip of my nose?

1225
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,080
What is it?

1226
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
She wanted to walk to you.

1227
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
But she went there.

1228
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,440
Something is on the tip of my nose?

1229
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,120
What is it?

1230
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,200
Something is on the tip of my nose.

1231
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,080
Come on.

1232
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,840
Music.

1233
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,280
Like this?

1234
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,920
We did it.

1235
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,520
Good.

1236
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,320
We're not bad.

1237
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,040
Not bad, huh?

1238
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,640
This is really amazing.

1239
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,360
To make the next wish come true,

1240
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,720
we need to go to another place.

1241
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,320
Now,

1242
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,720
let's go.

1243
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,840
There should be a slogan before departure.

1244
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,640
Like

1245
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,360
let's change the scene,

1246
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,360
-Yoghurt of Just Yoghurt
-As You Wish.

1247
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:07,800
Is that okay?

1248
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,200
Come on.

1249
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,000
Come on.

1250
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,760
Ready.

1251
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,840
Let's change the scene,

1252
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,760
-Yoghurt of Just Yoghurt
-As You Wish.

1253
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,640
Where are we going?

1254
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,560
We're going to have midnight snacks later.

1255
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,440
Everyone,

1256
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,760
now we're going

1257
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,920
to play the escape room game.

1258
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,360
It's so horrible.

1259
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,800
I'm so worried now.

1260
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,920
Try one.

1261
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,000
Wow, someone is jealous.

1262
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,600
Mr. Zhang.

1263
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,560
Mr. Zhang.

1264
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,280
Mr. Xie.

1265
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,040
What are you doing?

1266
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,600
I have some personal matters to deal with.

1267
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,960
Where did you get the food?

1268
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,560
Let me try some.

1269
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,720
Let go.

1270
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,120
Let go.

1271
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,160
Let go.

1272
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,800
Mr. Zhang,

1273
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
the food looks delicious.

1274
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,960
It is.

1275
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,120
But someone has to eat it first, right?

1276
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Why don't you...

1277
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
Why don't you try it first?

1278
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,600
I knew it.

1279
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,840
Here.

1280
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
I want to see you eat it too.

1281
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,240
Xuening wants to see it too?

1282
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,760
Yes.

1283
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,320
Okay.

1284
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,120
Hurry.

1285
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,680
That's too little.

1286
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,800
Good things should be in pairs.

1287
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,320
Okay.

1288
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,240
So handsome.

1289
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,280
Jiang Xuening, let's go.

1290
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,600
The key point is two words:

1291
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,000
dance battle.

1292
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,520
Come on.

1293
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,720
Stop fighting!

1294
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,880
Stop fighting!

1295
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,280
You are neck to neck.

1296
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,600
We want to watch these two

1297
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,400
have a dance battle.

1298
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,880
Watch men "fight".

1299
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,520
Yes.

1300
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,720
Come on.

1301
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,280
Begin.

1302
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:10,760
Begin.

1303
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,280
Are you standing there as a punishment?

1304
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,920
Come on.

1305
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,960
Zhang Linghe, this...

1306
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,040
What kind of team is this?

1307
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,920
This almost crossed the line.

1308
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,400
It almost crossed the line.

1309
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,800
Welcome to the location of the escape room game.

1310
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,080
There is no one in front of me.

1311
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,360
Wait. Wait.

1312
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,600
Zhang Jiawei (Zhang Linghe).

1313
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
I'm here.

1314
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,960
Liu Xiening.

1315
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,440
You can't do this,

1316
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Your Highness.

1317
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,000
I sing every time I play in the escape room game.

1318
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,640

1319

Who is dragging me?

1326
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,520
What's up there?
