[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,160
Welcome to the escape room game.

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
No, there's no one in front of me.

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,720
Wait.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,960
Zhang Jiawei. (Zhang Linghe's real name)

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
I'm here.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,320
Liu Xiening.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,800
Princess Liu Xiening.

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,080
Liu Xiening.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,240
I sing every time I play the escape room.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,880
♫Love how you stand on your own♫

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,360
♫Won't bow down to anyone♫

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,160
♫Baby Shark, doo-doo-doo-doo, baby♫

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,480
♫Unity is strength♫

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,520
♫Listen to the sound of the sea crying♫

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,520
Be careful. I'm opening the door.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Makka Pakka.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Welcome everyone.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,080
Here, we will

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,240
complete the second Wish Challenge.

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,520
What is the second Wish Challenge?

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,040
It exercises your body and mind.

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
High-intensity shooting without being scared.

24
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
It is...

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
Let's do an escape room game

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
The extra exciting kind.

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,320
The extra exciting kind.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
I want to see

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,240
if I feel anything.

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,320
Liu Xiening's eyes...

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,079
Look at her eyes.

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
"You guys.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's see how you'll 'die' later.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,400
Anyway, I'm not afraid."

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,160
She's like this.

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
Let her go alone.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
Yes, let her go alone.

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
Next, I'll explain

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
the rules of the escape room challenge.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
The escape room challenge will be done in two groups.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
The first group is

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
Bai Lu, Zhang Linghe,

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Wang Xingyue, and Liu Xiening.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,080
The second group is

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
Ye Xiyue, Zhou Dawei,

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,160
Qin Tianyu, and Cui Shaoyang.

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,760
The two groups will explore separately.

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Your mission

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
is to find the three

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,560
keys

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,960
labeled with

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Just Yoghurt "As You Wish"

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,480
on them.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,800
The Door of Props will automatically open

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
after the keys are found.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
You must find the specified props

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,320
in the prop room.

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,680
The team who finds the right prop the fastest

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,160
will win.

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,079
The slower team or the one that gets the wrong prop

61
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,960
will fail

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,400
and need to be punished.

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,160
Does this not count as a punishment?

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
I'll protect you later.

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,000
Please draw the props.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Tank, go.

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,440
Go.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Jiang Xuening's love token handkerchief.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Ours is the crew's carved fan.

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Flower in the lower left corner.

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
How many crosses?

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800
Four.

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,240
Two.

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,960
Blue branches.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,560
Two butterflies.

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,080
Okay.

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,640
Memorized it.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,520
Okay.

79
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,040
No problem.

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,400
Got it.

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,440
The first group, please start the game.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,480
I'm socially awkward.

83
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,640
I can't touch NPCs.

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
NPCs will touch you.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
They're not socially awkward,

86
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
but Wang Xingyue would probably be afraid.

87
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
It’s indeed really dark.

88
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,080
No,

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,320
can you make Cui Shaoyang leave?

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,880
He keeps disturbing our mindset.

91
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,520
This guy...

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,320
It won't be like that.

93
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,760
It's okay.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,080
It will.

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,720
It won't.

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,280
It will.

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,200
It's just a haunted house.

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,920
Will you really

99
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,080
make me the last one?

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,640
No.

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,200
Zhang Jiawei. (Zhang Linghe's real name.)

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,760
I won't.

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,520
Zhang Jiawei. (Zhang Linghe)

104
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,880
I won't.

105
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,120
Even if I run, I'll take you with.

106
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
Even if I run, I'll take you with.

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't frown.

108
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm not frowning.

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,960
I was born

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,600
looking like this.

111
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,920
♫As soon as my heart beats♫

112
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,320
♫As soon as my heart beats♫

113
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,360
♫Love starts to suffer♫

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,720
♫Every minute, every second♫

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,680
Don't be afraid.

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Life and prosperity are determined by fate.

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,640
Life and prosperity are determined by fate.

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
Liu Xiening,

119
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,760
we're counting on you.

120
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,600
What do you mean?

121
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
And your brain.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
Your courage.

123
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,760
We're counting on your courage,

124
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,560
on your brain,

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
and my voice.

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,720
Can't count on you punk.

127
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,400
I sing every time I play the escape room.

128
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,080
I also sing.

129
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm going to sing soon.

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,600
Yes.

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,480
I'll sing if we go.

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Me too.

133
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
♫Unity is strength♫

134
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll sing this.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll sing "The Light of Justice."

136
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,760
♫The light of justice♫

137
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,200
♫Shines on the earth♫

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Let's go.

139
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,400
Let's go.

140
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Let's go.

141
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,680
10 minutes.

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
15 minutes.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,480
Don't be so confident.

144
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,200
Come back alive.

145
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,440
Done in 15.

146
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
3, 2, 1.

147
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
Come on!

148
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
Did you hear that?

149
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,520
The downstairs is getting excited too.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The NPCs downstairs are also getting excited.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,720
The NPCs downstairs

152
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,960
are like this right now too.

153
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,240
They're standing together.

154
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,000
1, 2, 3.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,880
Come on!

156
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,800
Attack them!

157
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,480
What's wrong?

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm not scared.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm not scared at all.

160
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,480
Let me try.

161
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,600
What are you doing?

162
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
Hurry up and hug me.

163
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,680
Hurry up and hug me.

164
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,560
Yes.

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,159
If you dare to let go, I'm telling you...

166
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Come on.

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,640
You're the first one.

168
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
You're the tank.

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,520
No.

170
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
There's no one in front of me.

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm here.

172
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
Zhang Jiawei!

173
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,280
This is me.

174
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,400
But it's seriously dark.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
Hold Bai Lu in the middle.

176
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
Come on.

177
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,920
Yes,

178
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,520
you have to do this.

179
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,800
Yes.

180
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,800

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,520
I don't know.

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Liu Xiening.

195
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,920
Liu Xiening.

196
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Princess Liu Xiening.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,520
This is my hand.

198
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
This is my hand.

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,800
We can't do this,

200
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,680
Princess.

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
We can't do this,

202
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Princess.

203
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,240
Liu Xiening.

204
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,560
Is this Zhang Linghe?

205
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,520
This is me.

206
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,160
Did you grab me?

207
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,840
Yes, I'm holding her in the middle.

208
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,480
Hold me with both hands.

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes.

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
Who is it?

211
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,560
Who is this?

212
00:09:59,560 --> 00:09:59,960
Who's grabbing me?

213
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,400
Who's grabbing me?

214
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,240
Liu Xiening.

215
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,800
Liu Xiening.

216
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm here.

217
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,040
What are you doing?

218
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
Hold her tight.

219
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,040
I will.

220
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,520
No.

221
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
There's no way out now.

222
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,920
Is it a path

223
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
that they surrounded?

224
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,520
♫I want to take you everywhere♫

225
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
♫To fly♫

226
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,920
There's a light over there.

227
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Okay.

228
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,280
The light is on.

229
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,040
Zhang Jiawei. (Zhang Linghe.)

230
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm here. My arm is wrapped around you.

231
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,040
You can't run.

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,080
I won't.

233
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,720
You can't run at all.

234
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,640
I won't run.

235
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't run.

236
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
I see it.

237
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,200
Count the number of chips

238
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,280
by the stairs inside the house.

239
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
After counting,

240
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,800
please write down the correct number here

241
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
and read it out loud.

242
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,040
This one here, right?

243
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,840
The number.

244
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
The stairs we just came down on.

245
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,600
Here.

246
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,920
♫Listen to the sound of the sea crying♫

247
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
It might be scary.

248
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,520
♫Want to ask the heavens and the earth♫

249
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,240
Here.

250
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,920
Be careful.

251
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,880
I'm going to open the door.

252
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,480
It's here. Come.

253
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,920
What's wrong?

254
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,240
Who grabbed me?

255
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,760
Whose hand is this?

256
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,120
My hand.

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,400
My hand.

258
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,560
It's okay. Come.

260
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,840
It's okay.

261
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
I need to put my shirt on.

262
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,920
Wait.

263
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,200
It's okay.

264
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,440
Come.

265
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,040
You can let go now.

266
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,960
We're safe now.

267
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
Let's take a look.

268
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,160
It should be inside.

269
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,680
Chips.

270
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,400
I got the chips.

271
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,320
One pack?

272
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,280
There are quite a few.

273
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,680
Here.

274
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
You can hold the chips

275
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,800
You hold the chips.

276
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,560
Okay.

277
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,680
Wait.

278
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,560
There are more.

279
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,040
Tourists, this way, please.

280
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,840
I really...

281
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm here.

282
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,200
Brother.

283
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,680
Thank you.

285
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm sorry.

287
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,400
Close the door.

288
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,000
It's gone.

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,040
It should be gone, right?

290
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,760
It's gone.

291
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,480
Count the number of chips.

292
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,240
Open it.

293
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,920
Open what?

294
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,840
Open the chips.

295
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,760
I can't open the chips.

296
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,280
Be careful.

297
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Something will probably pop out.

298
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,240
Let me open it.

299
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,760
Be careful.

300
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,480
Lean on me.

301
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,880
It's scary.

302
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,680
Mine will pop too.

303
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,120
Be careful.

304
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Mine will pop too.

305
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Chips...

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
How many chips do you have?

307
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,840
1 piece.

308
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,040
2, 3.

309
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,160
4, 5, 6.

310
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
There's a broken one here.

311
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,920
I don't know if it counts.

312
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,680
6 and a half now.

313
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,440
7, 8, 9, 10.

314
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,760
How about 10 or 11?

315
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,240
How about 11?

316
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,880
I don't think there'll be half of one.

317
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,200
Okay, 11.

318
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,640
Let's go.

319
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,160
Come.

320
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,280
Hold me.

321
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
Say it out loud.

322
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Write down the correct answer.

323
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,720
I'll write 11.

324
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,360
Sorry.

325
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,640
It's okay.

326
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,280
It's us.

327
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
What is this?

328
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Come.

329
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,680
It's me.

330
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
♫Unity is strength♫

331
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,640
♫Unity is strength♫

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,320
♫Unity is strength♫

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Zhang Jiawei. (Zhang Linghe.)

334
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,760
Zhang Jiawei.

335
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm here.

336
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,280
I hugged the wrong person.

337
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,800
Wait, who dropped something?

338
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,400
There's a box here.

339
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,240
Decode it.

340
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,760
There's a new box.

341
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,560
It's okay. We need to squat down

342
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
Count the number of sharks.

343
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,600
After counting,

344
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
find it according to the numbers in the squares and put a check.

345
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,720
The number of sharks?

346
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,920
Where is the number of sharks?

347
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,080
There's light!

348
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,880
Over there.

349
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,640
Let's go, Lu.

350
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,200
Let's go.

351
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,360
It's okay.

352
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,200
It's very safe inside now.

353
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,680
It looks like this in here?

354
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,760
It looks like this in here?

355
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,960
You just saw it?

356
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,920
I just saw it.

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
Okay, I'm closing my eyes now.

358
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,320
Why can't I see anything?

359
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,000
Gosh.

360
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,600
Which shark?

361
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,520
Nothing.

362
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
1.

363
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,720
2.

364
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,120
3.

365
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,720
4.

366
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,680
4, right?

367
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,120
4.

368
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,840
Let's go.

369
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
It's okay.

370
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm going to close my eyes.

371
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,360
Friends.

372
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Friends, I'm closing my eyes.

373
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Close your eyes.

374
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Okay.

375
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Count the number of sharks.

376
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,560
After that,

377
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,000
find it according to the numbers in the squares.

378
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
What does that mean?

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,480
This is a math question.

380
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Calculate how it can equal 4.

381
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,240
How to equal 4?

382
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,560
I got it.

383
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,560
83 minus 71 equals 12.

384
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
12 minus 8 equals 4.

385
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,800
Yes.

386
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,440
Got it.

387
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Okay.

388
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,880
We've calculated it.

389
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,160
The password later might be

390
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,359
8371.

391
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
8.

392
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,280
It's 3 digits.

393
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,640
3 digits?

394
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,920
It's okay.

395
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,600
This is a cartoon character.

396
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,200
A cartoon character?

397
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,120
This is a cartoon character.

398
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
This is a cartoon character.

399
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,080
Take a look.

400
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,800
This is quite cute.

401
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,280
5 sharks.

402
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,640
The password is 3 digits.

403
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
If it's 5, then...

404
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,760
Count the number of sharks.

405
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,800
After counting,

406
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,760
write a check according to the number.

407
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
5 sharks.

408
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,640
3 digits.

409
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,040
I got it.

410
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,280
Let me do it.

411
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,200
Come,

412
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,120
the guru is here.

413
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,600
The first 5.

414
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,840
83 minus 71

415
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,040
equals 12.

416
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,240
12 plus 6 equals 18.

417
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
18 plus 5 equals 23.

418
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
23 plus 94.

419
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,400
117.

420
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
Then it's 117.

421
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,520
117?

422
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,880
Try it.

423
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,320
It worked.

424
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,200
Yes, the password is 117.

425
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
We did it.

426
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,880
Our team relies on you

427
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,040
and your brain.

428
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,680
One key.

429
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
This is our mission key.

430
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,080
We found one.

431
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,640
Sos we need to find the other keys.

432
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
The light is on over there.

433
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,240
The light is on.

434
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,320
That way.

435
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
Shall we go in?

436
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,040
Here.

437
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,040
Where are you?

438
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,320
I’m fine.

439
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,640
Wang Xingyue.

440
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,760
I’m in the front.

441
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,680
Zhang Linghe, do this.

442
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,640
You have to encircle her.

443
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,840
Yes, like this.

444
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,600
It's okay.

445
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,000
Here.

446
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Come, tourists.

447
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,920
What?

448
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
I see it.

449
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,840
We see an NPC now.

450
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,000
Close it.

451
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,200
Close it.

452
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Close it.

453
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,320
Close it.

454
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,960
And then?

455
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,280
Could there be something inside?

456
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,480
I see it.

457
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,160
Grab me.

458
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
Let's go.

459
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,360
You've worked hard.

460
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,240
Let's go.

461
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,880
Don't be afraid.

462
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,760
Close your eyes here.

463
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,600
Close your eyes here.

464
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,920
I'll put her at the end.

465
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,360
Where are you?

466
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm here.

467
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,880
Wait.

468
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,080
This is a key lock.

469
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,080
That's fine.

470
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,360
I don't know where the key is.

471
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,680
Let's go out now.

472
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,520
Come on, move forward.

473
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,760
Here.

474
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,360
I'm here.

475
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,280
Here.

476
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,040
Come. Princess, be careful.

477
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,440
Princess, be careful.

478
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm not afraid.

479
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,680
I'm not afraid anymore.

480
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,640
The person inside is escaping from the chains.

481
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,320
Will she come out?

482
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,640
No.

483
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,680
She's switching to another NPC.

484
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,480
She has to change scenes.

485
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,960
Come on.

486
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,840
The place with lights.

487
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,200
Let's go.

488
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,080
Come, tourists.

489
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm here.

490
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm encircling you.

491
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,560
Come on, we have a maze.

492
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,720
The correct route of the maze

493
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,880
corresponds to 3 digits.

494
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,600
The exit.

495
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Got it.

496
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,720
Do we have to draw it?

497
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,320
Draw it.

498
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,920
What number is this?

499
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
The 3 digits of the maze's route.

500
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,200
Corresponds to 3 digits.

501
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,680
The 3 digits of the maze's route.

502
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
5.

503
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,760
2.

504
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,560
9.

505
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Yes.

506
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,680
I think so.

507
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
No, look.

508
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
It's doesn't come down. It's not a 9.

509
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,160
1.

510
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,320
5.

511
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,960
2.

512
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,440
1.

513
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,960
5, 2, 1.

514
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,840
Sounds nice.

515
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,680
Zhang Jiawei. (Zhang Linghe.)

516
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560
I'll go first.

517
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,000
And my voice.

518
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,280
It's okay.

519
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
You scared me.

520
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,200
I was really scared.

521
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,120
The key.

522
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,960
We got it.

523
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,960
This is a key lock.

524
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,000
Open this.

525
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,840
It's open.

526
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,920
We did it.

527
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,840
We have two keys now.

528
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,560
We still need one more.

529
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
Let's go.

530
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
There are several boxes here.

531
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
There's something inside.

532
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,120
What is it?

533
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Trash.

534
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
What?

535
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,680
It's fine.

536
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,840
It's fine.

537
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm here.

538
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
It hurt so much.

539
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
It's better to team up with us.

540
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,360
It's a relationship among three people.

541
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,120
There won't be a result.

542
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,240
Listen. It must be very funny.

543
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,040
Wang Xingyue wanted to hold Bai Lu,

544
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,480
only to find Zhang Linghe

545
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,160
was holding Bai Lu.

546
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,200
It hurt so much.

547
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,840
The relationship among three people won't have a result.

548
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,000
The light over here is on.

549
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,240
This way.

550
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,240
yes. In here.

551
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,520
♫I see you in front of me♫

552
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,680
Come on.

553
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,160
Liu Xiening?

554
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,560
I'm here.

555
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,400
Come on, Liu Xiening. You go first.

556
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,080
I can't see anything.

557
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,040
It's okay.

558
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,760
I'm holding you.

559
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,960
What's this luminous thing?

560
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,280
I can't see anything.

561
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,000
Touch it.

562
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,360
My head.

563
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,280
Her head.

564
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,840
Here.

565
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,480
Liu Xiening.

566
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm right ahead.

567
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,640
Princess, slow down.

568
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,120
What?

569
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,160
It's useless.

570
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,800
He hit my head directly.

571
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
He hit my head.

572
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,240
He hit my head.

573
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,320
You hung it too low.

574
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
What's that?

575
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,720
We have found

576
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
the three keys.

577
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,120
Done.

578
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
Congratulations, everyone.

579
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,920
The Door of Props of Story of Kunning Palace

580
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,240
has been opened for you.

581
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,120
We did it!

582
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Slowly.

583
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:06,920
Listen.

584
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
Let's stay calm.

585
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,800
Don't panic.

586
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
The light is on. Go that way.

587
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,720
You need to find the prop you want

588
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,960
by touching.

589
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,720
Find Jiang Xuening's handkerchief

590
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,200
by touching.

591
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,520
Be careful.

592
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,000
There is a head above me.

593
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
And there is hair.

594
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,240
The hair of a head.

595
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
They are firecrackers on the floor.

596
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,920
You hold Bai Lu.

597
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,760
What's up there?

598
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,200
It's okay.

599
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,520
There's nobody up there.

600
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,360
There's no one up there.

601
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,040
What's up there?

602
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,960
It's my hair.

603
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,560
I'm sorry.

604
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,920
What is this?

605
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,400
There's a hand here.

606
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,640
I touched one foot and one hand.

607
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
Why can't I touch anything?

608
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,960
You took this?

609
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,960
We didn't find it.

610
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,080
How could we see clearly?

611
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,880
Where is your handkerchief?

612
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,160
We only have a fan.

613
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,200
You should have looked for the handkerchief.

614
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,000
Where is your handkerchief?

615
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,480
We only have a fan.

616
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,000
Your...

617
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,720
You need...

618
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,560
Your mission is to find the handkerchief.

619
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,080
I found the handkerchief.

620
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
I found it.

621
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,600
Take them all.

622
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
Find more.

623
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,680
I found one.

624
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,760
I think they are enough.

625
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,960
I think it's among them.

626
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,160
Pick it out.

627
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
It has embroidery.

628
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,400
You can feel it.

629
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,440
Let me see.

630
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,760
I remember.

631
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,040
I think this is it.

632
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,840
Right?

633
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,120
This is it.

634
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,960
Two X marks.

635
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,840
This is it.

636
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
This is my handkerchief.

637
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,040
How could I forget?

638
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Although I didn't see it just now.

639
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,240
Take a look at what I did.

640
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,520
My foundation should be all over it.

641
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,720
This is the most embarrassing part

642
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,400
in my career.

643
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,040
Sorry.

644
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,240
Next, Team 2, please start the game.

645
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,160
I don't want to be the last one.

646
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
Guys, slowly.

647
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
They are already screaming?

648
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
Let's do this later.

649
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,320
When we go down there,

650
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,400
if your scream sounds very real,

651
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,120
scream deliberately

652
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,680
to scare them.

653
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,520
I'll scream first.

654
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,240
I want to do it now.

655
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm scared.

656
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,960
Your scream sounds unreal.

657
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
This really scared me.

658
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,240
Find...

659
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,160
Find the key first.

660
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,920
Find the key first.

661
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,920
Hello.

662
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,560
Sir.

663
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,520
Is this Cui Shaoyang's voice?

664
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,360
It's okay.

665
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,000
These are all...

666
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,960
The key must be in this cabinet.

667
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,120
But we can't see clearly.

668
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,040
We need to...

669
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,160
touch it with our hand.

670
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,840
Understand?

671
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,800
Take it out first.

672
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,720
See if there's a logo.

673
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,960
Thank you.

674
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,920
Thank you, Madam.

675
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,040
Thank you, Madam.

676
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,080
Thank you.

677
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,240
I have Golden Throat Lozenges.

678
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,800
Thank you.

679
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,200
It's a box over here.

680
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,480
A shark in a trash bag.

681
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,200
A shark in a trash bag.

682
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,520
We need passwords.

683
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,080
We need passwords.

684
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,600
Four letters.

685
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,160
We need passwords.

686
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,200
Take a look around. A shark in a trash bag.

687
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I'm gonna take a look at her again.

688
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm gonna take a look at her again.

689
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,560
Sorry, Madam.

690
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,960
I think

691
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,320
I used much strength to close it.

692
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,560
I used much strength to close it.

693
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,400
What about the cabinet below?

694
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,280
It won't open.

695
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,560
Is it the only way

696
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
that we use the light in the cabinet?

697
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,840
She'll keep screaming,

698
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,320
but we can search the place.

699
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes.

700
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Open it.

701
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,200
Sorry, Madam.

702
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,160
We still need you.

703
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I can't see anything.

704
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,800
Here.

705
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,440
Do it again.

706
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,360
There's a door here.

707
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,000
There is a light flash over there.

708
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,840
Go that way.

709
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,600
Don't.

710
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Come here.

711
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,760
Come here.

712
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,360
Don't.

713
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,160
Don't let me be the last one.

714
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,880
Please.

715
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,080
Help me.

716
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,040
Follow Tianyu.

717
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,840
Follow Tianyu.

718
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,240
Let's follow him.

719
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,640
Let's go.

720
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,480
Come here.

721
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,040
Come here, Tank.

722
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,560
Just kidding.

723
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Come.

724
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,960
Liu Xiening.

725
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Liu Xiening.

726
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,680
Liu Xiening.

727
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,160
It's so big inside.

728
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,880
A shark.

729
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,960
A shark in a trash bag.

730
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,120
There must be someone in the shark.

731
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,560
Don't.

732
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,280
Relax.

733
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,960
It's okay.

734
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,080
A shark in a trash bag.

735
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,760
Wait.

736
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,480
There are Chinese characters on the top of it.

737
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,240
Wait.

738
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,160
There are Chinese characters on the shark.

739
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,880
The Chinese character Jia.

740
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,240
What's the number for the Chinese character Kou?

741
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,880
The Chinese character Kou.

742
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,160
Chinese characters Jia and Kou.

743
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,200
Chinese characters You and Kou.

744
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,840
There should be trash bags over there.

745
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,480
G somewhere else to take a look.

746
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,640
There must be some somewhere else.

747
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Don't go.

748
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm scared.

749
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,080
Let's get together first.

750
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,560
Hurry.

751
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,680
I'm here.

752
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,880
These are all trash bags.

753
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,000
They are screaming, right?

754
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,640
Thank you.

755
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,080
Thank you.

756
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,800
Thank you, Madam.

757
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,880
Thank you, Madam.

758
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
As long as we know she's here.

759
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,960
It's okay that I know you are here.

760
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,880
Where is my shark?

761
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,240
I have your shark.

762
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,920
I have a shark.

763
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,680
Shark?

764
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,400
Take her shark away.

765
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,680
Go.

766
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,080
Take her shark away.

767
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,520
Go.

768
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,200
I'm gonna go get it.

769
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,440
Let's go.

770
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,720
Let's go.

771
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,560
We're gonna go get the shark.

772
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,280
You wait for us.

773
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,240
The shark is behind you.

774
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm scared.

775
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,840
It's okay.

776
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,560
Don't be afraid.

777
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,920
Where are you?

778
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,040
Here.

779
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,080
She wants the shark.

780
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Come here.

781
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,400
Give her the shark.

782
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,800
♫Baby Shark, doo-doo-doo-doo♫

783
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,320
♫Baby Shark, doo-doo-doo-doo♫

784
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,720
Well,

785
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,240
she has left.

786
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,320
She's running away.

787
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,600
Come back!

788
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,000
You just ran away after you scared me.

789
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,720
Wait.

790
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,920
This one.

791
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,800
There's another one.

792
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,480
Here.

793
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,920
There's another one.

794
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Take them all.

795
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,520
Take them all.

796
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
One for the Chinese character Guang.

797
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,480
Two for the Chinese character Kou.

798
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,360
Three...

799
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,720
Three for the Chinese character Hu.

800
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Four for the Chinese character Men.

801
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,720
Guang, Kou, Hu, Men.

802
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,160
The strokes of the Chinese characters.

803
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,000
The strokes of the Chinese characters.

804
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,840
The strokes of the Chinese characters.

805
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
One, two, three strokes.

806
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,800
No.

807
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,120
We need letters.

808
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,280
What letters?

809
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,120
We need letters not numbers.

810
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,440
Yes.

811
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,560
Each one is...

812
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,320
g.

813
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,960
G.

814
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,280
No.

815
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,160
Each one is the same.

816
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,720
It doesn't have a G.

817
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,040
It doesn't have a G.

818
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,560
How to unlock it?

819
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,840
The passwords are wrong if it's not open, right?

820
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,840
Well,

821
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,680
the passwords are these four Chinese characters.

822
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,800
But we need to figure out what they represent.

823
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Take them all.

824
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,040
Take them all.

825
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,560
Guang, Kou, Hu, Men.

826
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,680
Look, there are Chinese characters on this.

827
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,360
This is You.

828
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,240
What's the number for the Chinese character Kou?

829
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,960
The Chinese character Kou.

830
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,920
Chinese characters Jia and Kou.

831
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,880
Chinese characters You and Kou.

832
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
It's a box over here.

833
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,080
A shark in a trash bag.

834
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
This should

835
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,320
be able to form a Chinese character

836
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,600
with this little trash bag.

837
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,840
For example,

838
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,400
which Chinese character can Kou and You form?

839
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,640
They can't form any Chinese character.

840
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,080
Guang and You can form the Chinese character Miao.

841
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,960
Hu and You can't form any Chinese character.

842
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,920
But Hu and Kou can form the Chinese character Qi.

843
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,840
Kou and Kou can form the Chinese character Lv.

844
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,280
Men and Kou can form the Chinese character Wen.

845
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Now, we have Chinese characters Wen, Qi, Lv, Miao.

846
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,360
There are two more characters we haven't found, right?

847
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,920
Let's go take a look in the front.

848
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,760
Follow me.

849
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,719
The light here is on.

850
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,440
Let's holding each other's hands.

851
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,120
I am.

852
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,159
Hold tight.

853
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,960
Now I look like

854
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
I'm helping an old lady cross the street in the wee hours.

855
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,760
My hands are not available.

856
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,480
What is this door in front of me?

857
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,679
There's a door.

858
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
I can't see clearly.

859
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,159
Well...

860
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,960
This is a sink.

861
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,480
This is a bathroom.

862
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,560
This should be a bathroom.

863
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,440
Let's check this.

864
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,200
There is a chain up here.

865
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,960
A chain.

866
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,600
I see myself. I can't believe it.

867
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,200
It's a mirror.

868
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
There should be someone inside, I think.

869
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,560
It's a bathroom.

870
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,360
There's a bathroom.

871
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,320
Here. It should be here.

872
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,680
Go in.

873
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,760
There is a shark here.

874
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
Is there any Chinese character on it?

875
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,520
There's a shark here.

876
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,480
What's the Chinese character on it?

877
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,080
Nothing.

878
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,040
Search the place.

879
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,280
Check the other side.

880
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,200
Sir, sorry.

881
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,440
I need to see the Chinese character.

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
Please turn around a little.

883
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,320
Thank you.

884
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,560
Thank you.

885
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,360
The Chinese character Wang.

886
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,280
You need to memorize

887
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,080
what the Chinese characters are on the previous two sharks.

888
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,040
Jia.

889
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,680
Jia and Kou.

890
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,840
Jia and Kou.

891
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,560
This Chinese character is Wang.

892
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,360
Jia, Kou, and Wang.

893
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,080
Dawei?

894
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,440
Here.

895
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,520
We should also memorize the Chinese characters

896
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,160
on the four bags.

897
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,040
I'll leave it to you.

898
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,960
I'll be the tank.

899
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,080
The first one is Chinese character Guang.

900
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,640
Guang, Kou, and Hu.

901
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,040
Guang, Kou, Hu, and Wen.

902
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,120
Guang, Kou, Hu, and Men.

903
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,080
There should be another Chinese character.

904
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,360
Yes.

905
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,240
I think there should be

906
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,360
one more shark or something like that.

907
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,800
Here.

908
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,760
The light here is on.

909
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,640
There's something here.

910
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,600
What's in the five boxes at the front desk?

911
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,440
Please write down...

912
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,160
Boxes?

913
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,520
The front desk is here.

914
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,320
Could there be people in the boxes?

915
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,440
Or things like human heads?

916
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,040
Should we take a detour?

917
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,240
Yes.

918
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,000
It's inside.

919
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,080
Touch it with your hands.

920
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,080
Touch this.

921
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,440
Here.

922
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,840
No. I don't want to touch it.

923
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,760
This one.

924
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,520
No.

925
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,040
This one.

926
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,560
No.

927
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,400
Try it.

928
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,720
No.

929
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,480
Thank you.

930
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,800
Let me do it.

931
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,000
What is it?

932
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,520
What does that mean?

933
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,640
It's okay.

934
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,880
What's that?

935
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,280
I did it on purpose.

936
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,840
It's okay.

937
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,240
Bro, are you sweating?

938
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Why are your hands so sticky?

939
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,040
It's a hand inside, right?

940
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,800
Yes.

941
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,560
Let's take all of them out

942
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,600
and put them on the table.

943
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,600
Take all of them out and put them on the table.

944
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
We need to write them down, right?

945
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,720
Write down everything in the five boxes.

946
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,640
This is a spider.

947
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,240
A rat.

948
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
A snake.

949
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Leaves.

950
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,160
Have you written everything down?

951
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,120
A snake, a rat, and a spider.

952
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,920
Have you written down the spider?

953
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,160
It's okay.

954
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,840
Gosh.

955
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
He grabbed me.

956
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,880
It's okay.

957
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,200
Thank you.

958
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,080
Thank you.

959
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
Sir, thank you.

960
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,440
I really didn't expect this.

961
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,120
A shark-shaped piece of clothing.

962
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
There should be a Chinese character on it, right?

963
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,200
Here.

964
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,920
The Chinese character Nv.

965
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,440
The Chinese character Nv.

966
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,680
Bravo.

967
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,440
Come on. Give me a pen.

968
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,920
There happens to be a pen.

969
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,520
Come on, let's write them down.

970
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:14,920
Come on.

971
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,400
Great. Great.

972
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,000
They turned off the lights again.

973
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,680
There are lights over there.

974
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,320
I have to go there again.

975
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh my god.

976
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,720
Let's be confident

977
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,280
and protect our girls.

978
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,880
Eight Chinese characters.

979
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,760
Eight Chinese characters.

980
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,560
Guang.

981
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,640
Guang, Kou, and Hu.

982
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Something will come out of it.

983
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm so scared of this sound.

984
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,240
Well...

985
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:44,880
Don't.

986
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,520
With the sound you made, I'm not scared anymore.

987
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,960
It was like

988
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,360
the oral broadcast of the exercise

989
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,320
they do in the morning.

990
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,000
Let's see

991
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,760
if there is anything on it

992
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,160
when it comes out.

993
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,640
What's nearby?

994
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,920
I found this here.

995
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,040
I'll keep it.

996
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,880
You keep it.

997
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,320
Let's go.

998
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,920
There are lights over there.

999
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
Guang and Kou.

1000
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,000
Guang and Kou.

1001
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,640
Guang and Kou.

1002
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,120
Hu and Men.

1003
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,080
Hu and Men.

1004
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,680
And You.

1005
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,560
You.

1006
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,080
Kou.

1007
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,040
And Wang.

1008
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,680
Wang.

1009
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,120
Nv.

1010
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,720
And what's on this is

1011
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,240
a shark in a trash bag.

1012
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,480
A trash bag...

1013
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,760
A shark in a trash bag.

1014
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
That means we should

1015
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,800
put the shark

1016
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,320
into the trash bag.

1017
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,240
Yes.

1018
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
Which Chinese character can form another Chinese character with Guang?

1019
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,280
Guang and...

1020
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,360
Guang and You can form the Chinese character Miao.

1021
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,920
Guang and You...

1022
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,080
They form the Chinese character Miao.

1023
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,120
Guang and You can form the Chinese character Miao.

1024
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,720
Then Hu...

1025
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,920
Hu and Kou can form the Chinese character Qi.

1026
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,160
Which Chinese character should be paired with Nv?

1027
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,840
Nv and Wang.

1028
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,320
Nv and Wang.

1029
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,160
No.

1030
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,440
It's hard to find a Chinese character to pair with Nv, right?

1031
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,600
Nv can be paired with...

1032
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,480
Kou and Nv can form

1033
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,200
the Chinese character Nan.

1034
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,760
Nan as in Nannan.

1035
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,240
Nannan.

1036
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,320
What about the Chinese character Run as in Runtu?

1037
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:25,840
Is Wang needed?

1038
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,640
Run.

1039
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,320
Run as in Runtu.

1040
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,600
The first letter of Nan is N.

1041
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,960
The first letter of Qi is Q.

1042
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,440
R.

1043
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,760
MNQR, right?

1044
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,600
Is it open?

1045
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,760
Yes.

1046
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,280
There is one key.

1047
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,640
There is one key.

1048
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
Only one.

1049
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,640
Now we have two keys.

1050
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,160
Let's keep going.

1051
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,480
Let's go.

1052
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
There are lights over there.

1053
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,800
Dawei suddenly became brave.

1054
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,720
Dawei is so brave.

1055
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
When I see the light,

1056
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,560
I think this is where we found the mirror.

1057
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,080
No.

1058
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,000
This is another place.

1059
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,520
Where? Sister?

1060
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,920
On the head.

1061
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,280
Look back.

1062
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,640
It's up there, right?

1063
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Congratulations, everyone.

1064
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,400
The Door of Props of Story of Kunning Palace

1065
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,120
has been opened for you.

1066
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,080
Let's go.

1067
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,760
We are here to find a fan.

1068
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,640
I really can't see anything.

1069
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,160
We're done.

1070
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,560
Are you okay?

1071
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,680
I'm fine.

1072
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,280
A piece of cake.

1073
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,920
It was good.

1074
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,440
So have you succeeded?

1075
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,200
Look at our fan.

1076
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,800
It doesn't look like it, right?

1077
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,440
There's no way

1078
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,560
the regular script is used in Story of Kunning Palace, right?

1079
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,520
A picture of reading.

1080
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,920
So we took the wrong one.

1081
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,280
This is not it either.

1082
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,960
What is this?

1083
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,320
I'm tired.

1084
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,000
Who is the weakest here?

1085
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,320
It's definitely not me.

1086
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,240
Have one bottle.

1087
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
One for you.

1088
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,200
We are thirsty.

1089
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
We screamed a lot just now.

1090
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,320
I need to drink

1091
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,000
a bottle of yoghurt of Just Yoghurt to get over the shock.

1092
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,040
Come on.

1093
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,400
Congratulations on your success.

1094
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,760
Cheers.

1095
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,800
It contains

1096
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,640
blueberries from the cold areas

1097
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
at 42 degrees north latitude.

1098
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,320
It tastes like fresh fruit.

1099
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,640
Yes. The ingredients of good yoghurt

1100
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,160
are simple and clean.

1101
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,320
It's very delicious.

1102
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,480
In the escape room game just now,

1103
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,120
the winning team is

1104
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,880
Team 1.

1105
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay.

1106
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,960
We are applauding

1107
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,280
for Bai Lu's throat.

1108
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,360
The team who failed

1109
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,040
needs to wear NPC's clothes

1110
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,360
to take a photo

1111
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,760
and post it on Weibo

1112
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,800
when the show is broadcast.

1113
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,720
Okay.

1114
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,680
Okay.

1115
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,320
The members of Team 1 can get off work now.

1116
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,360
We're off work.

1117
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,600
We're off work.

1118
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,440
Thank you.

1119
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,680
Bye.

1120
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,080
I want the shark.

1121
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,760
What is this?

1122
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,600
This is what just followed you...

1123
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,440
This suits you.

1124
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:38,960
I'm gonna wear this.

1125
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,640
Let's go.

1126
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
You can't see who I am anyway.

1127
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,280
It doesn't matter.

1128
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,160
Think of a posture for me.

1129
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,240
Master Roshi.

1130
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,760
The Wish Challenge has begun again.

1131
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,800
We need to buy food ingredients in groups

1132
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,880
through a chain game.

1133
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,000
They bought a lot.

1134
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,920
They bought a lot.

1135
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,920
9 yuan in total?

1136
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,040
Can you give me a discount?

1137
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm gonna name the price.

1138
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,640
Purple cabbage.

1139
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,960
Blueberries. Blueberries.

1140
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,280
Pork butt.

1141
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,160
Minced pork.

1142
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
This is a squid, right?

1143
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,320
Do you feel like we are like the actors

1144
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,720
in American Dreams in China?

1145
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,200
You can't be tempted by beauty.

1146
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,000
Xie Wei.

1147
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,720
The facial expression is a little strange.

1148
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,480
What?

1149
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,400
Go away!

1150
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,720
Don't take mine.

1151
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,000
Dawei, you can't bully a girl. Dawei.

1152
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,560
Which team's food

1153
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,040
do you want to eat?

1154
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,440
Choose your own, please.

1155
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,880
Can you see my tears in my eyes?

1156
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,520
Please, Director.

1157
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,560
Okay. Come on.
