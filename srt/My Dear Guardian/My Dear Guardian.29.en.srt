=Episode 29=

3
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,009
Go and get a CT scan.

4
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,066
You might get the result
in the morning at the soonest.

5
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,180
Okay, thanks, doctor.

6
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,229
Doctor.

7
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,136
Why did you push me?

8
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,606
I'm letting the doctor see my scans.

9
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,170
Well, get in line.
It's my turn.

10
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,670
Sir, wait outside.

11
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,010
After I'm done with him,
I'll talk to you.

12
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,406
Heard that?
The doctor told you to wait outside.

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,789
Doctor, Director Yue
introduced me to come see you.

14
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,425
Who cares who introduced you?

15
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,210
I could say the hospital dean
introduced me.

16
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,160
Watch what you say, mister.

17
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,720
Are you a civilised human?

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,796
Are you even human?

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,676
What's this ruckus? Stop arguing!

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,100
Get out of here if you want to argue.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,636
Doctor!

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,500
Please get me a number.

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,396
Are you the patient?

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,579
The patient is outside.

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,579
Get them in.

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,829
I can't. They can't walk.

27
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,666
I said, get the patient in here!

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,486
If they don't come in,
how am I supposed to check?

29
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,126
Argue here and there!

30
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,579
What is there to argue?

31
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,758
Doctor, are you okay?

32
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,960
Dr. Zhang...

33
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,010
Doctor.

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,060
You have a nose bleed, doc.

35
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,676
-A nose bleed.
-Don't just stand there. Get help!

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,086
-Doctor.
-Dr. Zhang.

37
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,620
Shut up.

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,090
Get help!

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,710
I'm a military man.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,900
I won't give up.

41
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,270
Chen Meng Zhen.

42
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,066
I won't give up on you.

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,170
Liang Mu Ze, are you free right now?
I need a favour.

44
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,350
Meng Zhen.

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,860
Is it about Zhang Yi Chi?

46
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,676
I can't stay put.

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,995
Who are you kidding?

48
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,156
I still have to do my rounds.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,446
I need to operate.
Patients are waiting for me to save them.

50
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,206
-You people are interrupting my work.
-Son!

51
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,436
Yi Chi, your condition is serious!
You need to rest.

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,956
-You hear me?
-That's right, son.

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,156
Listen to the doctor.
Take the medication first.

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Listen to the doctor.
I am a doctor.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,266
I'm the chief physician.

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,556
I believe in science.

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,286
I only believe in hard data.

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,316
What illness do I have?

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,230
You have acute hepatitis.

60
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,851
Acute hepatitis?
You must be kidding me.

61
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:54,756
Do you know what the symptoms
are for acute hepatitis?

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,070
Will a person with acute hepatitis
be as calm as me?

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,996
Acute hepatitis causes one
to lose judgement,

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,316
to be easily agitated!

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,676
They won't be able to think clearly.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,076
The skin turns yellow.
Yellow like jaundice.

67
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,176
Do I look yellow?

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,206
-Is my face yellow?
-Take a look yourself.

69
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,116
Am I yellow? Am I?

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,540
Take a good look. I'm...

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,836
The mirror is yellow!

72
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,140
-Yi Chi.
-Son!

73
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,760
-Ms. Meng Zhen.
-How is he?

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,220
He's not doing very well.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,436
Dr. Zhang cut himself during an operation
and was infected with Hepatitis B.

76
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,916
Despite getting an immunoglobulin
shot right after, the virus is too toxic,

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,100
and it caused the onset of severe
acute hepatitis just now.

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,836
There are signs of hepatic encephalopathy
and bleeding.

79
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,500
He's not thinking straight
and keeps resisting our help.

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,420
What do you need me to do?

81
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,940
Try and keep him calm.
Make him work with us.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,500
Alright.

83
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,836
Will I be able to?

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,036
Of course.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,906
When we were administering emergency care,
he kept calling your name.

86
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,596
Compared to others, I'm sure
he's more willing to listen to you.

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,540
That's why I asked Liang Mu Ze
to go and get you.

88
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,230
Okay, I understand.

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,990
-Let's go.
-Okay.

90
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,100
Yi Chi, you're now the patient.

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,916
You need to quiet down.
Don't get agitated!

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,976
-Dr. Zhang.
-Dr. Zhang!

93
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,500
You can't stop me.

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,686
I don't want this.

95
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,236
Stop holding me down.

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,460
Mr. Zhang.

97
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,390
Look who's here.

98
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,650
Who asked you to come?

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,190
Xia Chu, get her out of here.

100
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,836
This is an infectious zone.

101
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,500
You, get out!

102
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,659
I'll keep you company.

103
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,620
I'll help you get treated.

104
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,850
No need to be scared.

105
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,700
I'm not scared.

106
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,100
I'll stay with you.

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,360
Lie down.

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,446
Yi Chi, listen to her.

109
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,630
Lie down.

110
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,020
Sir.

111
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,370
Do you have any other input
regarding Yi Chi's treatment?

112
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,450
No.

113
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,606
Well, I've stopped practicing
a long time ago.

114
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,196
Besides, internal medicine
isn't my expertise.

115
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,950
We'll do as you see fit, all right?

116
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,260
Meng Zhen is here.

117
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,080
What about Xiao Jun?

118
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,430
He's with a neighbour.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,130
He knows Dr. Zhang is sick.

120
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,880
He told the mum,

121
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,930
that he'll be good
and that he can take care of himself.

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,340
A mature boy.

123
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,909
When will Yi Chi...

124
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,659
be able to wake up?

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,750
I don't know.

126
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,140
Acute hepatitis has a survivability rate
of 50 to 70 percent.

127
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,750
Right now, we're using an artificial liver
to get rid of the toxins in his blood.

128
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,270
Currently, this is the most effective
method to treat acute hepatitis.

129
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,300
But...

130
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,510
But what?

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,660
Each time, 50 percent of his plasma
has to be removed.

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,540
This means that...

133
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,100
a series of allergic reactions,

134
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,880
and potential risk of infection
are highly likely.

-Rao Zhi.

The chief wants you at the meeting room.

149
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,310
Okay, I'll be right there.

150

Xiao Xue.

151
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,090
I have work to do.

152
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,590
Wait here.

153
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,200
Mu Ze will send you home later.

154
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,190
Okay.

155
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,660
Dad.

156
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,750
All the best!

157
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,690
Thanks.

158
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,620
Tian Yong.

159

Assistance
from the Special Forces Brigade.

Rao Feng.

161
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,475
Captain of the Criminal Investigation
Division of Public Security Bureau.

162
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,020
An experienced officer on fieldwork.

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,300
He's currently in charge
of the task force.

164
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,140
Good day, sir.

165
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,356
You've read the materials?

166
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,660
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,660
I also did some extra research.

168
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,676
On what?

169
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,646
Reporting.

170
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,550
Triad rituals and social network.

171
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,276
From now on, you may skip
the "reporting" when speaking.

172
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,240
-Yes, sir.
-No need for the "yes, sirs" too.

173
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,100
Where's your hometown?

174
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,390
I don't know.

175
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.

176
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:27,536
Are you married?

177
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,500
No.

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,990
A girlfriend?

179
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,830
Do you have one?

180
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,440
No.

181
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,020
The bait we left on the City of Desire
has gotten a response.

182
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,316
The Scary Pirate has accepted
our proposal for a deal.

183
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,790
We've confirmed a date and venue.

184
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,110
Bear in mind.

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,190
The goal of this operation
is not an arrest.

186
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,600
It is to assist our internal operations
set the trap.

187
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,560
To determine
Scary Pirate's real identity,

188
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,750
and find the mastermind
behind the ID, Old Master.

189
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,630
Any questions?

190
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,966
No.

191
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,930
Yes.

192
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,580
I'd like a smartphone.

193
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,460
I'm so tired.
I shouldn't have come back with you.

194
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,676
I didn't ask you to come back.

195
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,350
You yourself didn't want
to go to the unit.

196
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,340
If Tian Yong isn't there,
there's no point for me to stay there.

197
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,436
By the way, Tian Yong was shot, right?

198
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,676
How is he now?

199
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,996
Did he get it checked?

200
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,860
He hasn't been going to the hospital.
He wouldn't answer my calls too.

201
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,436
Has he gone back to the unit?

202
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,756
Is there a new mission?

203
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,390
Can't you call him
and help me get in touch?

204
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,646
Just worry about yourself.

205
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,056
Don't bother Tian Yong unnecessarily.

206
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,570
When did I bother him?
I'm just concerned about him.

207
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,220
When are you going back to the US?

208
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,100
I'm not.

209
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,140
Xiao Xue.

210
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,740
The explosion that happened
isn't as simple as it seemed.

211
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,860
The culprit dared
to do something so brazen.

212
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,690
It means they're prepared.
You get it?

213
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,886
Although the neighbourhood
is now under police watch,

214
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,540
but as long as you're here,
your dad must be worried.

215
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,116
So tell me where Tian Yong is.
I'll go to him.

216
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,486
-No.
-Why?

217
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,926
What why?
Why should you go to him?

218
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,580
I'm his girlfriend.

219
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,036
Has Tian Yong accepted you?

220
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,286
His girlfriend?
You're just a girl.

221
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,486
You can't decide on your own.

222
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,036
Well, has Xia Chu accepted you?

223
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,750
You're also pestering her.

224
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,766
Who said Xia Chu hasn't accepted me?

225
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,846
No need to pretend. I know the truth.
You two aren't really together.

226
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,556
You're just putting on a show for Aunt.

227
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,870
You guys live in one house
but sleep in separate rooms.

228
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,740
There's no tension either because
you're useless or she's sick.

229
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,010
Listen up, Liang Shao Xue.

230
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,320
There are many types of love.

231
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,920
For Xia Chu and I, we are...

232
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,410
the kind that love with reason.

233
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:04,726
Well, Tian Yong and I are the kind,

234
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,836
that doesn't need proclamation
to act on it.

235
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,430
He doesn't have to admit it.
I know I'm in his heart.

236
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,900
Where do you get the confidence from?
You're not.

237
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,396
What's the matter with you?
Your love is real love, but mine isn't?

238
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,876
It's my love, my feelings.
It doesn't concern you.

239
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,246
If you won't stop putting me down,

240
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,236
I might just tell Aunt
about your fake relationship.

241
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,590
-I dare you to try.
-I will. Try me.

242
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,046
Where are you going?

243
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,070
To the hospital.

244
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,660
Dr. Zhang.

245
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,756
It's okay.

246
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,620
What do you need, Dr. Zhang?

247
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,260
I want to check on the patients.

248
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,260
Dr. Zhang, in your condition,
I don't think it's a good idea.

249
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,220
Don't worry.

250
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,180
I'll be careful.

251
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,470
I'll keep my distance.

252
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,460
What?

253
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,670
Face mask.

254
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,906
Here.

255
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,850
Okay.

256
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,200
Thanks.

257
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,860
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

258
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,410
Is the director here?

259
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,476
Go and get him, quick!

260
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,300
Bed 21's patient's heart has stopped!

261
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,380
What's the situation?

262
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,556
Dr. Zhang.

263
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,876
Doctor, he's in critical condition.

264
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,886
I've pressed the alarm.

265
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,460
Director Chen should be here.

266
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,220
Where do you feel unwell?

267
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,196
I'm having shortness of breath.

268
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,060
The pressing is making it worse.

269
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,876
Stop pressing.

270
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,046
I can't stop, sir.

271
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,486
His heart will stop if I stop.

272
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,790
Listen to me and stop pressing.

273
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,400
You see this?

274
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,580
The electrode sheet fell off.

275
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,619
Okay, keep calm.

276
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,660
Relax.

277
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,916
You're okay.

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
Okay.

279
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,260
The signal is back, right?

280
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,710
I... I thought...

281
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,250
Sorry, doctor.

282
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,230
Don't be so absent-minded next time.

283
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,589
Yes, sir.

284
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:22,566
Okay.

285
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,580
Everything is fine.

286
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,636
I remember you.

287
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,486
You're the doctor with acute hepatitis.

288
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,876
What are you doing in our ward?

289
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,500
Acute hepatitis?

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,956
Hear me out.

291
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,046
Stay away from me!
Don't come close!

292
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,260
Is that true?

293
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,756
-Yes, it's him.
-Don't worry.

294
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,540
Don't come near. Stay away!

295
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,170
Stay away!

296
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,260
Don't come near.

297
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,476
Xia Chu.

298
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,590
Ms. Meng Zhen.

299
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,140
Yi Chi is missing.

300
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,830
Isn't he in the room?

301
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,750
I fell asleep.
He was gone when I woke up.

302
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,830
Don't be alarmed.

303
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,356
Dr. Zhang is in a stable condition.

304
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,956
He should be all right.

305
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,940
He probably stepped out
for some fresh air.

306
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,900
Xia Chu.

307
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,540
What is it?

308
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,356
Dr. Zhang is in a bit of trouble
at the cardiovascular ward.

309
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,300
Director Chen wanted me to come get you.

310
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,140
Let's go there.

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,996
Director Chen.

312
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,356
We are sick people.

313
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,030
Our immunity is at its weakest.

314
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,716
How could he simply enter
our ward like that?

315
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,780
What if we got infected?

316
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,716
He has Hepatitis B.

317
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,646
That's an incurable disease!

318
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,180
Don't you know that?

319
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,116
Now, now. Please calm down
and let me speak.

320
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,726
Yes, Dr. Zhang did contract
the hepatitis virus during an operation.

321
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,396
But after receiving treatment,

322
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,436
all of his vital signs
have returned to normal.

323
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,836
So you guys need not worry.

324
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,396
Moreover,
Hepatitis B is usually spread through...

325
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,700
No need for the useless explanation.

326
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,420
Once you have Hepatitis B,
there's no way to remain normal.

327
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,940
We need to trust in science.

328
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,396
Are you speaking for him
because you're a doctor too?

329
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,322
Not at all.

330
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,646
You should be thinking
about the patients.

331
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,116
You have to be responsible
for our health and safety.

332
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,166
Yes, okay.

333
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,340
But we must have faith in science, no?

334
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,886
Just now, his spit got onto me.

335
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,780
What if I contracted Hepatitis B?

336
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,876
Listen, don't worry.
His vitals are back to normal.

337
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,100
-Stop it!
-All right?

338
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,876
Sirs.

339
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,206
I think you're mistaken.
Dr. Zhang contracted Hepatitis B.

340
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,326
It doesn't make him a monster.

341
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,476
He went to the ward to treat patients,

342
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,076
not to spread the virus to you
and harm you.

343
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,806
If such simple contact
meant quarantine,

344
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,370
then my advice to you is to just
stay at home and never go outside.

345
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,676
Or else you might get
into an accident on the road,

346
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,990
or get smashed to death
by a falling billboard.

347
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:58,101
The possibility of that

348
00:19:58,186 --> 00:19:59,956
is higher than your chances
of getting infected by Dr. Zhang.

349
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,550
Whatever!
You can stop your nonsense!

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,036
You guys are clearly accomplices.
You probably have Hepatitis B too.

351
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,100
Stay away from me!

352
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,116
-What?
-I'm going to sue you.

353
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,620
I'm going to sue you!
I'll get your license revoked!

354
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,670
Shut up!

355
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,140
Are you finished?

356
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,276
The doctor hit me!

357
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,996
The doctor hit me!

358
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,476
The doctor hit me!

359
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,940
Get lost with your nonsense!

360
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,820
You heard me?

361
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,790
They're doctors but I'm not.

362
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,660
One more word and I'll kick you out!

363
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,020
That patient...

364
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,190
has been quite a handful.

365
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,756
Every time he's here for a check-up,
he wouldn't let resident doctors near him.

366
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,620
He always thinks the staff
are up to no good.

367
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,756
So the way he acted today
wasn't targetted at you specifically.

368
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,300
It was more a purging of his emotions.

369
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,180
So don't take it personally.

370
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,020
No need to feel bad.

371
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,810
We should focus on your recovery instead.

372
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,900
Sir, can I still go back to operating?

373
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,620
With the proper treatment,

374
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,996
if the surface antigen
and E antigen are negative,

375
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,930
it means there isn't inflammation
or infectiousness.

376
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,940
Then of course you can.

377
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,780
What if something like today
happens again?

378
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,876
Do patients know what E antigen is?

379
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,990
Or surface antigen?

380
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,540
Will they be able to trust me again?

381
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,500
Look.

382
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,740
Aside from cardiac surgery,

383
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,460
the hospital has
the administrative department.

384
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,036
I always believe that,

385
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,950
a doctor's worth
isn't tied solely to doing surgery.

386
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,086
Right?

387
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,050
They can also...

388
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,940
You know I love the feeling
of holding the scalpel.

389
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,700
Straightforward.

390
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,180
Accurate.

391
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,070
Using the most direct way
to solve a problem.

392
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,150
Following a clear direction.

393
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,790
Be it good or bad,

394
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,020
there's always an answer at the end.

395
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,190
It's within my own control.

396
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,220
Of course,

397
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,180
the administrative department
plays an important role too.

398
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,740
But it's not what I want to do.

399
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,780
If it comes down to that,

400
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,540
I'd rather leave.

401
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,380
What are you talking about?

402
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,740
With the way you are now,
aside from the hospital,

403
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,710
where else can you get a similar job?

404
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,910
To me, the doctor's coat...

405
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,020
and the military uniform underneath,

406
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,220
are not only a representation of a job.

407
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,650
I mean it.

408
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,540
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have slept so soundly.

409
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,940
Ms. Meng Zhen, don't say that.

410
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,940
Nobody expected such a thing to happen.

411
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,460
Life is unpredictable.

412
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,900
Zhang Yi Chi went to see me
at the book store recently.

413
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,140
He sort of confessed his feelings to me.

414
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,780
But I turned him down.

415
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,510
Because I felt that it would be too hard
for us to be together.

416
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Thinking back now, aside from death,

417
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,260
what else matters?

418
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,260
What can be more important?

419
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,350
Sometimes in life,

420
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,320
we should really be more upfront
with ourselves.

421
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,620
Otherwise, you'd unknowingly
leave behind a whole bunch of regrets.

422
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,110
Ms. Chen.

423
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,036
Uncle, aunty.

424
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,340
You went through an ordeal.

425
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,460
It's nothing.

426
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,100
Where is Zhang Yi Chi?

427
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,350
Director Chen is having a word with him.

428
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:11,836
I'll go find him.

429
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
Doctor Li.

430
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,676
I think you shouldn't go.

431
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,540
Let's wait for him here.

432
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,440
Right, we should wait for him here.

433
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,860
-Yi Chi.
-Yi Chi, how are you?

434
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,500
I'm fine, Mum.

435
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,236
-I'm going to be discharged.
-What? No.

436
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,996
Yi Chi, don't be hasty.
You've just recovered.

437
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,796
You should be monitored a while more.

438
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,820
No need.

439
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,720
I want to go home.

440
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,260
-Yi Chi.
-Zhang Yi Chi.

441
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,756
Mr. Zhang, Mrs. Zhang.

442
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,260
I'm truly sorry about what happened.

443
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,910
It's fine.

444
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,150
Director Chen,

445
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,276
we'd like to talk
to Yi Chi's supervising doctor.

446
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,510
Is that okay?

447
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,850
Sure, I'll arrange for it.

448
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,840
Okay.

449
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,300
Xia Chu.

450
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,620
You were the first doctor
to treat Dr. Zhang.

451
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,686
Tag along.

452
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,780
Okay.

453
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,700
Meng Zhen.

454
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,180
Mu Ze.

455
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,400
Please go and buy some food for him.

456
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,300
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

457
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,100
Okay.

458
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,910
I was on leave for personal reasons.

459
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,590
I only just heard what happened.

460
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,790
What did I tell you?

461
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,406
If you had listened,

462
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,236
and waited for his test results
before you did the operation,

463
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,350
you wouldn't be in this situation now.

464
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,550
Now what.

465
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,140
You failed to save the patient
and put your health in jeopardy.

466
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,236
What was that for?

467
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,460
Nothing.

468
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,980
I'm just stupid.

469
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,980
-Okay?
-Yes, you're stupid.

470
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,020
I've told you many times.

471
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,540
A doctor
is just a profession after all.

472
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,140
You're not god.

473
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,310
Don't put all your hopes on being
able to change the scheme of things.

474
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,420
Towards patients,
we can do our best to save them.

475
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,150
But we don't have to risk our lives.

476
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,100
Ms. Li Juan.

477
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,876
Do you remember when
we were in our second year,

478
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,660
and had our first dissection lesson?

479
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,020
What did Dr. Su write on the blackboard?

480
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,890
What?

481
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,780
Those who don't know the past and present
and don't understand heaven and humanity,

482
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,860
will not attain immortal skills
or the heart of Buddha.

483
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,060
Better to focus on working the land
and weaving to make a living,

484
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,210
than to partake in medical care
and cause trouble.

485
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,740
Any recollection?

486
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,020
None.

487
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,396
Did he write that?

488
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,460
Yes.

489
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,190
You forgot.

490
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,660
You're right.

491
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,080
I am not god.

492
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,236
I even made such a rudimentary
mistake during an operation.

493
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,220
I am not a good doctor, even.

494
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,690
The reason why I give my all,

495
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,356
is not because I wish to change
the circumstance with my own power.

496
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,140
It's because I rather not
be easily influenced by the surrounding.

497
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,420
That's all.

498
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,620
What about now?

499
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,806
Do you still think so?

500
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,770
Of course.

501
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,340
And it isn't just me.

502
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,500
I got the permit.

503
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,990
Really?

504
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,190
That's good news.

505
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,980
Your dream is finally coming true.

506
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,280
Congrats.

507
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,440
If you want me to stay,

508
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,780
I'd consider it.

509
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,030
Even though I don't like
changing my plans for others,

510
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,440
but you're an exception.

511
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,790
I'm willing to do it for you.

512
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,636
As long as you're willing.

513
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,760
Li Juan.

514
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,180
I'm sincerely wishing you the best.

515
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,740
You are finally able
go to where you want,

516
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,620
do what you love.

517
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,520
I'm happy for you.

518
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,830
You take care.

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,700

Chen Meng Zhen.

531
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,180
Do you have a minute?
I'd like a chat.

532
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,020
Come to my office.

533
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,796
-Done packing?
-You're here.

534
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,420
Meng Zhen asked me to get you porridge.

535
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,276
Where is she?

536
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,660
She went down to get some air.

537
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,900
Thank you.

538
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,100
What are you planning to do now?

539
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,060
If this had happened
before I became ill,

540
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,260
I wouldn't care about her stance.

541
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,990
I'd press on.

542
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,220
But now...

543
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,756
Now you have a chance
to correct things, right?

544
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,460
We should always look at the bright side.

545
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,580
Do you know the consequences
of this illness?

546
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,700
Thanks.

547
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,600
I heard for the past days,
you had been the one looking after him.

548
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,570
Yes.

549
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,460
Back when you brought your son here
to seek treatment,

550
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,180
I never thought that...

551
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,300
Zhang Yi Chi and you
would have an episode.

552
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,680
Do you think his parents
would accept you?

553
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,370
I get it.

554
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,750
For a single parent,

555
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,740
his career and family background
are quite the draw.

556
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,980
Normally,

557
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,180
a person's judgement on others,

558
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,700
directly reflect their own inner thoughts.

559
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,240
Do you know my relationship with him?

560
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,220
I only care about
my relationship with him.

561
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,940
I must say you're more impressive
than I thought.

562
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,550
Zhang Yi Chi and I were together
for 10 years.

563
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,716
Aside from not having
a marriage certificate,

564
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,870
we were as good as a married couple.

565
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,620
No matter who ends up with him
in the future,

566
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,390
they will certainly find traces of me
on him.

567
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,620
It was I who moulded him into who he is.

568
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,170
You were together for 10 years
but still ended up separating.

569
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,260
Aside from lack of love,

570
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,820
I can't think of any other reason.

571
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,060
He has Hepatitis B now.

572
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,180
Do you know what that means?

573
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,090
I mustn't be fatigued.

574
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,230
I have to always be careful
about my physical health.

575
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,310
Currently,

576
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,910
treatment of Hepatitis B
is much better than before.

577
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,850
But if it turns into chronic hepatitis,

578
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,400
that will be the end
of my clinical practice.

579
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,710
I have no idea what else I could do.

580
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,620
I'm afraid.

581
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,180
Dr. Li.

582
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,820
You know what?

583
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,100
I've been the family of a soldier.

584
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,940
Do you know what being
a soldier's family entails?

585
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,740
No companionship,

586
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:05,100
no assurance.

587
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,100
No matter what happens,

588
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,060
you are alone in facing
whatever life throws at you.

589
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,126
From the moment I married a soldier,

590
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,179
until eight years after his demise,
I've been taking care of Xiao Jun alone.

591
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,639
Till I met Dr. Zhang
and we had an episode.

592
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,780
Maybe in your eyes,
I have no strong suit.

593
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,900
But at least...

594
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,876
I have what it takes,

595
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,460
to take on whatever outcome
this episode gives me.

596
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,830
Be it love or separation,

597
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,219
joy or sorrow,

598
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,659
this is what I've decided.

599
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,780
I will not regret it

600
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,620
or be afraid.

601
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,830
I think I know why it's you.

602
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,540
I'll go now, Dr. Li.

603
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,380
Put it his way, buddy.

604
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,860
If it was you, what would you do?

605
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,356
Knowing full well
that you can't give your all,

606
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,820
in carrying out your duty
as a husband.

607
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,140
For instance, these dishes
might turn bad at any moment.

608
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,850
Will you still claim a free life
in the name of love?

609
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,420
I can't.

610
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,486
Thank you, Dr. Hu.

611
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,566
-Thank you.
-Not at all. It's our duty.

612
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,676
Mr. Zhang, don't worry too much.

613
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,526
Yi Chi is still young.
He has good bones.

614
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,340
Make sure he gets enough rest
when he gets back.

615
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,790
The condition shouldn't affect
his life and work too much.

616
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,490
How could it not?

617
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,180
Alright, now.

618
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,976
Let the doctors get back to work.

619
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,856
I'm going to the Inpatient Department
to process the discharge.

620
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,736
Go an check on Yi Chi at the ward.

621
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,736
Okay, we'll go now.

622
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,266
I'll accompany you.

623
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,266
Okay, thanks.

624
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,340
-Goodbye.
-I'm off, Director Chen.

625
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,540
Dr. Zhang...

626
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,010
is an only son, right?

627
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,380
Xia Chu.

628
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,020
What is it, sir?

629
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,540
Do you want to go back
to Cardiac Surgery?

630
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,110
Yi Chi told me that you're one of the best
resident doctors under his mentorship.

631
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,140
If you wish to return,
I can arrange it with ER.

632
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,710
What about Dr. Zhang?

633
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,030
Is he coming back?

634
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,870
He...

635
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,920
He will be transferred to
the medical school to teach.

636
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,276
Think it over.

637
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,700
Tell me your decision later.

638
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,470
Aunty.

639
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,160
You came to get Dr. Zhang?

640
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,580
Can he go home?

641
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,340
Yes.

642
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,110
Thanks a lot,

643
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,690
for the past few days.

644
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,780
Thank goodness for your company.

645
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,380
Otherwise, Yi Chi's treatment
couldn't have gone so well.

646
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,380
Previously,

647
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,140
regarding you two's relationship,

648
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,340
I admit...

649
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,860
that I was against it.

650
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:15,500
I believed that in terms of credentials,
you two weren't compatible.

651
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,660
I was afraid...

652
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,620
I was afraid that
you were in it for something.

653
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,220
I'm sorry, Ms. Chen.

654
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,620
I was wrong.

655
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,110
You're not wrong, aunty.

656
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,010
I am in it for something.

657
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,270
I am after him.

658
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,436
His intelligence,

659
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,980
his humour.

660
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,350
His bright and calm demeanour.

661
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,326
If my admiration for him comes across
as a selfish desire in your eyes,

662
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,540
I admit it.

663
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,500
But frankly speaking, isn't love
a form of desire anyway?

664
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,690
So are you,

665
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,530
still...

666
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,150
I'm not thinking so far.

667
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,396
I just want to take care of him.

668
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,476
Consider it as repaying him
for saving my son.

669
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,630
Don't say that.

670
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,210
Let's be real.

671
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,810
A doctor is responsible for the patient.

672
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,920
The patient's family has no responsibility
towards the doctor.

673
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,220
You don't owe me anything.

674
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,820
No need to repay.

675
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,330
I'm not asking for it either.

Dad.

709
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,460
Can we go now, son?

710
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,820
Okay.

711
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,956
Get in, Mum.

712
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,920
Okay.

713
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,180
Mencius said,

714
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,060
a gentleman's happiness
lies in three things.

715
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,700
Does anyone know
what those three are?

716
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,286
Parents are alive and well,
harmony amongst brothers.

717
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,420
First happiness.

718
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,670
Have nothing to be ashamed of
before God or man.

719
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,070
Second happiness.

720
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,140
Find the most talented individuals
and teach and nourish them.

721
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,020
Third happiness.

722
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,260
I was your teacher.

723
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,700
It's my little bit of happiness.

724
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,116
Now I'm going to teach those

725
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,300
who are younger
and have more potential than you.

726
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,580
This will be one big happiness.

727
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,620
You guys should be happy for me.

728
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,020
At the same time,

729
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,840
do even better,

730
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,500
to stand...

731
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,980
in front of the operating table
in place of me.

732
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,836
I hope that after every surgery,

733
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,940
you'd be able to calmly
inform the patient's family,

734
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,790
that the operation was a success,

735
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,380
and not...

736
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,980
"I've tried my best."

737
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,670
Alright, then.

738
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,980
All the best, comrades.

739
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,300
Salute!

740
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,406
Today, I enter the medical profession,

741
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,436
and vow to dedicate my life
to serve others.

742
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,430
I thank and respect my teachers,
the same way I treat my parents.

743
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,716
I will practice medicine
with conscience and dignity.

744
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,540
The patient's well-being
is of my utmost priority.

745
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,956
I will uphold the doctor-patient
confidentiality.

746
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,566
I will do my best to honour
the reputation and noble tradition

747
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,260
of the medical profession.

748
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,526
My colleagues are my brethren.

749
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,476
I will be responsible for my patients.

750
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,316
I will not let difference in religion,

751
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,246
nationality,

752
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,269
race,

753
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:41,860
politics or status
affect my service and aid.

754
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,756
From its inception,
a life shall be given utmost dignity.

755
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,486
Even in the face of danger,

756
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,076
my medical knowledge
will not go against humanity.

757
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,526
I solemnly and autonomously

758
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,100
swear on my name
the above declaration.
