1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,000
Where were you?

4
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,750
Dong'an.

5
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,920
Liang Mu Ze found the tapping device.

6
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,596
Okay.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,700
"Okay?"

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,590
We need to retreat right away.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,270
If we go back empty-handed,

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,940
do you have a good explanation
for Old Master?

11
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
-Old Master.
-Old Master.

12
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,860
The money Gui accepted for the goods,

13
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,230
I've received it.

14
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,276
-Did the transaction go smoothly?
-Yes.

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,236
Any progress with Xia Guang Yuan?

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,596
His assistant, Tang Lin,

17
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,526
has accepted the 100,000 I offered.

18
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,556
She also agreed to provide us
with more research data.

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,696
Good.

20
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,716
Make full use of this opportunity.

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
On a side note,

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,420
in a few days,

23
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,476
I'm going to release more goods.

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,590
For this batch,

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,140
you'll still be in charge
of the transaction...

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,900
from start to end.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,716
Old Master.

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,750
Any problems?

29
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,836
Old Master, didn't you say that
once you get the formula for the sedative,

30
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,366
you'll be able to come back
with Xia Guang Yuan in tow?

31
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,750
There have been some changes.

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,820
The Chinese market had previously been
under the control of Sang Kun and Gui.

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,550
Now, we finally found a way in.

34
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,460
I want you guys to expand
on the network there,

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,750
find new business channels.

36
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,790
Particularly the youth in China.

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,721
Knowing what they like
and their preferences...

38
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:20,495
is key to securing future markets.

39
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,670
This is T4's real opportunity.

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,200
Understood, Old Master.

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,500
And you, Zhuo Ran?

42
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,090
Understood.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,829
But as for my mother's transplant...

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,756
Zhuo Ran.

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Zhuo Ran.

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,110
Old Master has never intended
to treat your mother.

47
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,500
He's only using her to control you.

48
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,140
Old Master isn't going to save my mother.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,356
Is he?

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,420
When will we ever be able
to obtain all the data?

51
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,286
The police
would've probably found us by then.

52
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,840
Not probably,

53
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,540
but definitely.

54
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,070
Ever since the medical forum,
they've already been keeping an eye on us.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
So what now?

56
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,486
What do you think?

57
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,620
I think
we should just take the man away.

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,810
If we can't have Xia Guang Yuan,
at least we can get the daughter.

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,710
You're right.

60
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,096
Doing things step by step like this
is too slow.

61
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,410
Some things...

62
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,930
need to be wrapped up.

63
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,100
I'll leave Xia Chu to you.

64
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,496
I'll sort out the production.

65
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,720
In two days,

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,470
we'll meet at the same place.

67
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,030
Commander Dong,

68
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,570
based on the comprehensive clues
we've gathered,

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,636
the prime suspect
should be Xia Chu's first boyfriend,

70
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,700
Zhuo Ran.

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,390
That man
has had numerous altercations with Mu Ze.

72
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,620
It looks like
he still hasn't gotten over Xia Chu.

73
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,926
So you think he has a clear motive?

74
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,900
That's right.

75
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,716
I've sent men
to conduct surveillance on him.

76
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,526
If this case is indeed related to him,

77
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,836
he should've known
that the tapping device was discovered.

78
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,700
We're expecting him to take action.

79
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,990
(Long Yi)

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,100
I've arrived at her neighbourhood.

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,820
We'll act in one hour.

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,380
What's happening, Lei?

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,670
You may go in, mister.

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,766
Call the captain.

85
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,716
Okay.

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,346
I got the picture now.

87
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,850
What do you want our unit to do?

88
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,660
The two people living at Mu Ze's house
are the witness of the case, Xia Chu,

89
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,510
and Mu Ze's cousin, Liang Shao Xue.

90
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,516
I propose that before things
are sorted out,

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,700
they be moved to somewhere more secure.

92
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,766
No problem.

93
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,740
The Special Forces Brigade
can provide shelter and security.

94
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,510
Mu Ze.

95
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,110
Any other concerns?

96
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,660
-Let me take this call.
-Okay.

97
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,340
Where?

98
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,130
Okay.

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,740
Got it. I'll be right there.

100
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,659
Zhuo Ran turned himself in.

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,386
Yes.

102
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,860
I installed the tapping device.

103
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,430
Why did you do it?

104
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,780
Because I wish to get Xia Chu back.

105
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,566
I wanted to know
what she's doing at home...

106
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,870
every moment of the day.

107
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,470
I want to know everything about her.

108
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,980
To make up for the eight years
that I wasn't with her.

109
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,770
Do you know who that house belongs to?

110
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,230
I didn't know at first.

111
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,670
The day I installed the device,

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,740
I almost ran into him.

113
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,516
Meaning to say,

114
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,686
through the tapping device,

115
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,580
you learned that Xia Chu wanted
to give Liang Mu Ze tranquillisers.

116
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,950
So you purposely switched it.

117
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,845
Right?

118
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,110
Yes, it was overheard on the device.

119
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,356
But I wasn't the one who heard it.

120
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,540
It was Long Yi.

121
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,780
He's my assistant.

122
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,840
He was the one who switched the pills.

123
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,200
(No Access)

124
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,646
Why would he do that?

125
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,166
Because Old Master told him to.

126
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,416
"Old Master?"

127
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,130
He's the founder of T4.

128
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,526
The terrorist attack...

129
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,116
that happened
at the medical headquarters in Isaia,

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,670
was that T4's doing?

131
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,386
Back then,

132
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,156
he smuggled into Willick from China.

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,690
Under the code name T4,
he set up his own army of mercenaries.

134
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,956
On the surface, he operated
under the pretence of trade investment,

135
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,266
but in actual fact,

136
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,360
the things he did were illegal.

137
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,476
What is his real name?

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,536
I don't know.

139
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,966
From the first time I met him,
I've been calling him Old Master.

140
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,640
As for his history in China,

141
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,510
I do not know either.

142
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,016
How did you two meet?

143
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,626
In my final year of high school,

144
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,476
a distant relative...

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,620
had arranged for my mother
to be treated in Willick.

146
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,470
We ended up at an illegal factory.

147
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,540
There,

148
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,406
we endured a very dark time.

149
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,390
We finally managed to escape.

150
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,870
But we ended up almost starving
to death on the streets.

151
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,120
It was Old Master that saved us.

152
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,920
He gave us a place to feel safe.

153
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,720
He even paid for my education.

154
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,020
So in the beginning,
I was very grateful towards him.

155
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,550
You could say that I relied on him.

156
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,230
Until...

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,580
Until what?

158
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,750
Until I graduated university,

159
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,966
he started to let me take over
some accounts of the company.

160
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,500
That's when I realised...

161
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,170
the ugly truth
behind his so-called company.

162
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,580
I didn't want to help him.

163
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,640
I tried to make him stop.

164
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,950
But why would he listen to me?

165
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,220
If you are against his ways,

166
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,860
why would you still work for him?

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,500
He has my mother.

168
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,380
I have no choice.

169
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,326
He's been trying to groom me
as his right-hand man.

170
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,526
I've done all I could...

171
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,030
to not get involved in matters
outside of the finances.

172
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,010
But knowing that my mother's safety
is at risk,

173
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,140
I'm not sure how much more I can take.

174
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,070
So you came to Ningjiang...

175
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,220
because Old Master told you to?

176
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes.

177
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,310
He wants me
to find Sang Kun's younger brother, Gui.

178
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,300
Then he sent his underling, Long Yi,

179
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,480
to become my assistant
in order to monitor me.

180
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,080
So have you found Gui?

181
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,550
We have.

182
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,316
But I only found out later
that Long Yi had killed Gui...

183
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,980
behind my back.

184
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,380
And on the day itself,

185
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,660
he almost went head-to-head
with you people.

186
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,540
He downloaded a program online...

187
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,820
and printed a 3D gun.

188
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,506
And then,
he sneaked Gui out of the hospital,

189
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,956
shot him...

190
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,880
and set up the crime scene.

191
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,860
What about you?

192
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,820
What was your role...

193
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,150
in all of this?

194
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,110
I'm a victim.

195
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,330
I'm bearing the risks of being found out
and losing my mother...

196
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,940
by coming here to tell you guys this.

197
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,630
You have to ensure my safety.

198
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,100
I no longer want to live like a dog.

199
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,670
This isn't the kind of life I want.

200
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,140
I've had enough.

201
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,036
Even in my dreams, I tried to escape
from the shackles he put on me,

202
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,300
but I couldn't.

203
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,460
Everything I do gets reported
to Old Master.

204
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,246
My mother's life may be in danger.

205
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,510
And Xia Chu.

206
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,390
What about Xia Chu?

207
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,750
He knows...

208
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,590
how much Xia Chu means to me.

209
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,276
Just like how he's using my mother
to control me,

210
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,276
he wants to do the same with Xia Chu.

211
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,756
Use her to force me...

212
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,726
to establish drug-trafficking channels
in China,

213
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,310
to be his accomplice in crime.

214
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,030
I can only try my best to buy time.

215
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,500
But with me...

216
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,836
By myself,
there's no way for me to stop him.

217
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,716
For the sake of the two
most important women in my life,

218
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,220
I'm begging you.

219
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,710
I'm willing to cooperate with the police
to bring Old Master to justice.

220
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,500
Officer Rao.

221
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,380
I know you must be dubious...

222
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,500
about what I just said.

223
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,486
It's fine.

224
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,316
You can verify it later.

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,506
But right now,

226
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,930
you need to send men
to Liang Mu Ze's house.

227
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,030
Because Old Master has given the order,
for Long Yi to take care of Xia Chu.

228
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,020
Is there no electricity?

229
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,790
I don't know. I was watching a drama,
and the Internet suddenly stopped.

230
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,376
Hello.

231
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,656
Hi, Ms Xia.

232
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,280
Please come
to the building management office.

233
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,176
What's the matter?

234
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,056
There's a problem
with your house's electricity meter.

235
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,606
We need to check with you
before we can fix the problem.

236
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,870
What's the problem?

237
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,260
What's up?

238
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,646
Something is wrong
with the electricity meter.

239
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,760
No wonder the hair dryer
suddenly stopped working.

240
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,526
I'm going to the management office.

241
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,950
Stay here and be good.

242
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,720
All right.

243
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,710
"Miss Xia?"

244
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,730
Liang Mu Ze!

245
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,926
No matter how fast the lift is,

246
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,006
within three storeys,

247
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,916
a human running
can easily catch up to it.

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,376
So if there's an emergency,
and you have to take the lift,

249
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,976
make sure it goes
more than three storeys.

250
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,280
If needed, press a few more floors
to confuse the pursuer.

251
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,090
Anything you find around you
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

252
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,846
If you can't get away,

253
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,826
try your best to go somewhere
with people...

254
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,200
and call for help.

255
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,606
Fire! Fire!

256
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,636
Evacuate!

257
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,420
-Fire!
-Forget about the things!

258
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,156
-Are you okay?
-Someone's after me.

259
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,275
I didn't see his face.

260
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,836
He addressed me as Ms Xia on the phone.

261
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,456
But I never registered
with the building management.

262
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,230
So I'm pretty sure he came for me.

263
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,926
I was reaching the basement.

264
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,476
I turned and ran just like you taught me.

265
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,816
I pressed several floors in the lift.

266
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,396
I got off halfway...

267
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,310
because I thought someone
might be waiting there.

268
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,990
You did good.

269
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
It's okay now.

270
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,430
I'm here.

271
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,066
When the incident occurred,
it happened to be the change of shifts.

272
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,526
There was no one
in the night shift office.

273
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,490
Rao Zhi.

274
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,856
Anything?

275
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,346
Li Lei and the rest
are at the basement car park.

276
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,436
The management staff and I
have checked the floors of the building.

277
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,796
We didn't find anyone suspicious.

278
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,410
The culprit probably sneaked out
in the minutes following the alarm.

279
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,696
We'd like to check the CCTVs.

280
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,000
Sure, come with me.

281
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,230
All right, guys. Follow me.

282
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,736
Okay, pay attention.
Thank you, everyone.

283
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,240
Please wait here for a bit.

284
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,896
Go with him.

285
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,860
Okay.

286
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,836
We're sorting it out. Please remain calm.

287
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,800
Xue.

288
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,780
Do you have time?

289
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,550
I'd like to talk to you.

290
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,830
Thank you for your cooperation.
Please wait here.

291
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,670
Yes, I'm at home.

292
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,646
Okay, got it.

293
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,780
Okay.

294
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,340
Xue is with her dad.

295
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,390
That's good.

296
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,200
Did the police catch the culprit?

297
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,246
Who is he?

298
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,286
Why did he come after me?

299
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,380
Don't ask.

300
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,446
Is that confidential?

301
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,410
Yes.

302
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,860
All right.

303
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,080
Xia Chu.

304
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,100
I have to return to the unit
before lights-out.

305
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,960
Your break is over?

306
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,750
Come along with me.

307
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,980
I don't mean anything else.

308
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,256
It's much safer at the unit.

309
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,686
It will be the same as last time.

310
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,116
You'll stay at the guest lodging.

311
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,100
I'll be at the barracks.

312
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,076
Commander Dong has spoken to the chief.

313
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,980
-You're welcome any time.
-Thank you, guys.

314
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,940
I understand.

315
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,596
You're doing this for my own good.

316
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,590
Including your timely appearance today.

317
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,150
I'm very grateful.

318
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,290
Get to the point.

319
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,190
But I can't go.

320
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,800
At least not now.

321
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,456
The ER is short-handed.

322
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,880
If I leave without notice,

323
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,020
it will only cause more stress
to my colleagues.

324
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,050
Besides,

325
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,006
the patients I'm currently looking after
in the ER...

326
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,566
haven't been released to normal care.

327
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,750
I have to follow up
when I get back to work.

328
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,696
As for my personal safety,
don't you worry.

329
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,636
I'll protect myself well.

330
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,266
I'll carry pepper spray with me.

331
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,206
I won't take dark alleys,
won't go to secluded places,

332
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,516
won't simply open the door.

333
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,020
I won't give any chances
for the bad guys to get close.

334
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,300
Is that...

335
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,770
okay with you?

336
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,490
All right.

337
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,420
I have to go to the hospital.

338
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,410
I'll take you.

339
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,730
Okay.

340
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,126
Sun Xiao Mo,
you and Li Lei will split up.

341
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,866
You'll continue to locate Long Yi.

342
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,126
Ask Li Lei to send two men
to the hospital.

343
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,926
Before we find Long Yi,
he's in charge of Dr Xia's safety.

344
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,040
All right? Notify me if there's anything.

345
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,150
Get down here.

346
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,136
Leaning out like that is dangerous!

347
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,346
What if you fell?

348
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,516
I'm already 21. I've come across
countless dangerous situations.

349
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,420
Since when have you come to my rescue?

350
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,076
Speak. What's the matter?

351
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,460
What do you mean?

352
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,750
Didn't you tell Mu Ze
that you'd only speak in front of me?

353
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,956
You escorted me to the police station
so early in the day...

354
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,756
and disappeared with my bag.

355
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,856
I waited an hour here for you,
and this is what it's about?

356
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,746
You could very well be a witness.

357
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,000
I have someone I like.

358
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,656
I'm not asking about that.

359
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,976
But I want to talk about it.

360
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,056
Two nights ago,
you went to Yunshan Tunnel, right?

361
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,156
Why should I tell you?

362
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,116
What time did you go?
Did you see anyone there?

363
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,080
Take a guess.

364
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,590
-Guess!
-Xue.

365
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,856
This is very important.

366
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,096
I don't care a lick.

367
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,130
Mind your tone.

368
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,056
I'm not one of your suspects.

369
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,606
I don't have to be interrogated.

370
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,596
You want to talk to me? Sure.

371
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,576
Resign from this stupid job,
and come to the US with me.

372
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,136
We'll have a meal with Mum.

373
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,796
While eating,
I'll be glad to chat with you.

374
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,020
But here, I'm not saying one word.

375
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,250
Xue.

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,050
Xue!

377
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,730
Who is the guy you like?

378
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,510
Liu Ran.

379
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,070
How do you feel?

380
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,750
Miss Xia Chu.

381
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,380
The doctor said my numbers
have returned to normal.

382
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,700
Am I going to be discharged soon?

383
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,636
That will depend on your overall recovery.

384
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,310
Dr Zhang will decide when you do.

385
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,760
What's on your mind?

386
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,000
If...

387
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,460
If my dad could see how I overcame this,

388
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,430
he would be proud, wouldn't he?

389
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,440
From now on,

390
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,710
I will do as you say.

391
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,230
I will live...

392
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,110
for his sake as well.

393
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,820
You can cry.

394
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,700
Cry all you want.

395
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,340
You'll feel better after.

396
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,460
Dr Xia.

397
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,310
I want to make a police report.

398
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,840
Are you...

399
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,810
sure?

400
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,278
This is the hospital's
first successful case...

401
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,156
of saving a patient poisoned
by paraquat...

402
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,070
with supplementary therapy using ECMO.

403
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,340
How long was ECMO installed
on the patient?

404
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,316
Including the waiting time
for the organ, seven days.

405
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,566
I see. Seven days.

406
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,766
Okay.

407
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,766
Try to utilise ECMO outside
of the operating room...

408
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,710
and into the emergency care
of severe cases.

409
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,081
It will be beneficial...

410
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:28,825
to the establishment of the hospital's
emergency response system.

411
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,660
Xia Chu.

412
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,690
Mr Zhang.

413
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,326
Sir.

414
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,926
Let me introduce to you Xia Chu.

415
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,436
A top student
from the Military Medical University.

416
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,136
She obtained her Physician's License
two years after graduating.

417
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,926
She's completed the regulatory training...

418
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,360
and was previously stationed
at Cardiac Surgery Department.

419
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,430
Her performance has been outstanding.
Right, Dr Chen?

420
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,796
Now at the ER,

421
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,270
she played a part in rescuing Liu Ran.

422
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,130
I know her.

423
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,616
For the past two weeks,

424
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,516
I've been conducting
experiential research...

425
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,086
on the various departments
at the hospital.

426
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,740
I bumped into her one time.

427
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,110
That day, she was totally drenched.

428
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,886
She was pulling a cooler box
containing an organ for transplant,

429
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,390
running towards the operating room.

430
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,620
Do you remember?

431
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,126
So that was you.

432
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,260
That's right.

433
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,966
This young lady looks gentle and meek,

434
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,436
but when carrying out her duty,
she's full of vigour.

435
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,126
You know how things are at this hospital.

436
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,326
Over here, women are treated like men,

437
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,086
men are treated like livestock.

438
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,140
You joke.

439
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,530
She's always the one going the distance.

440
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,176
Sir, you're exaggerating.

441
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,480
I am just carrying out my duty, is all.

442
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,446
Yes, good.

443
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,236
Let's go and check on the patients.

444
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,526
Okay. See you.

445
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,490
See you.

446
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,180
During lunch break,
come see me in my office.

447
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,050
You're still here.

448
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,720
Yeah.

449
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,200
If the 4S shop calls, go and get the car.

450
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,510
You're asking me to drive?

451
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,546
You need practice.

452
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,346
It's a necessary life skill.

453
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,970
Next time, you can run faster.

454
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,326
Okay.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,290
I'm off then.

456
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,380
Liang Mu Ze.

457
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,620
From a professional standpoint,

458
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,100
I am considered half your comrade.

459
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,910
I know the meaning
of the military uniform to you.

460
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,336
In one's life,

461
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,576
how much they earn,

462
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,286
what kind of house they own,

463
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,590
what car they drive,

464
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,570
those are all done for others.

465
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,820
There's only one thing...

466
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,760
What kind of person you wish to become
is done for yourself.

467
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,530
Staying true to oneself is hard.

468
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,530
Perhaps it's a life-long lesson
we continue to master.

469
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,510
I am still a newbie.

470
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,540
So I'm sorry.

471
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,890
I can't give you better advice.

472
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,240
But I'd like you to know...

473
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,160
that your decisions are always right,
Captain Liang.

474
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,340
I believe...

475
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,060
Liang Mu Ze, this is the hospital.

476
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,980
You asked me before...

477
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,026
if anyone's habit is found in my life.

478
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,086
You said no.

479
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,230
Not at that time.

480
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,880
But now, I'm telling you
I'm learning to eat durian.

481
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,770
I'm learning to omit the salt
when cooking soup.

482
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,670
I've gotten used to your taste buds.

483
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,760
I remember what you said about the heart
being on top of the stomach.

484
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,590
I no longer want to be even with you,
Dr Xia.

485
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,420
If you insist on getting even,

486
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,366
the next time we meet,

487
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,700
you can ask for it then.

488
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,660
Are you confessing your feelings
right now?

489
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,660
Will you say yes?

490
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,636
I have work to do.

491
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,100
I need to get back to it.

492
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,080
(Ultrasonography room)
(CT room)

493
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,916
If the incident made you realise
my importance...

494
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,100
You're important.

495
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,540
But not because of the incident.

496
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,040
This is what I've been wanting
to tell you.

497
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,150
I like you too, Liang Mu Ze.

498
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,426
Although you're proud and snarky,
always wanting to win,

499
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,670
your intelligence and honesty
make me feel safe.

500
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,110
But most importantly,

501
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,320
you've got a good-looking face.

502
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,930
Thanks.

503
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,180
Especially when you smile.

504
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,336
It's like the desserts you make.

505
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,530
It's rare,
but every time it's filled with warmth.

506
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,176
Living under the same roof
with such a guy,

507
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,636
after some time,

508
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,580
pink bubbles naturally emerged
in my heart.

509
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,750
I feel like I'm the female lead
in an idol drama.

510
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,406
I've even fantasised many times...

511
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,790
about the moment when the two of us
took things off the screen.

512
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,720
You did?

513
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,460
Yes.

514
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,706
Especially yesterday.

515
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,126
You kissed me for the first time.

516
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,750
It was the climax of all my fantasies.

517
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,226
If you had professed your love to me then,

518
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,970
I would've agreed without thinking.

519
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,860
But now...

520
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,920
I know you're getting transferred.

521
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,360
To be honest,

522
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,526
I hate goodbyes.

523
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,360
I don't like being left behind.

524
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,110
Because when the distance is too large,
you'll lose sight of it forever.

525
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,956
You may think my worries are ambivalent,

526
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,550
but they are my honest thoughts
at this moment.

527
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,306
I need time, Liang Mu Ze.

528
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,996
I need to think this through,

529
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,360
whether or not I have the courage
to be in such a relationship.

530
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,690
Can I?

531
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,726
Take your time.

532
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,740
I'll wait.

533
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,970
♫Exchanging everything
We'll become each other's destiny♫

534
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,756
♫I'll make your heart my kingdom♫

535
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,070
♫You and I will make our dream
Come true with our lives♫

536
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,466
♫You and I will make our dream
Come true with our lives♫

537
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,450
No way.

538
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,480
Listen.

539
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,430
I've seen too many long-distance marriages
that most often ended up broken.

540
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,646
A long-distance relationship
not only puts a strain on time and money,

541
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,110
more importantly,
it tests one's character and dedication.

542
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,476
We are already stretched thin at work.

543
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,510
So why choose Hard Mode
in our relationships?

544
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,416
A companion.

545
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,846
It's not a companion
if they can't keep you company.

546
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,950
Spiritual companionship counts, right?

547
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,086
Spiritual?

548
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,960
Do you raise the next generation
with your spirit?

549
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,926
This scene needs voice-over.
Note it down.

550
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,890
Okay.

551
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,926
Don't be silly, girl.

552
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,286
If marriage is the grave of love,

553
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,646
then becoming a widow
is the abyss of hell.

554
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,766
Either he stays or you resign.

555
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,006
Otherwise, be prepared to eat
and shop alone,

556
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,436
celebrate festivals alone,

557
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,136
go for prenatal check-ups
and give birth alone,

558
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,406
handle both parents alone,

559
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,830
and endure a pitiful life
with no one to share your ups and downs.

560
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,180
I don't think it's as bad
as having to use the word "pitiful."

561
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,230
Of course it is.

562
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,796
Think about it.

563
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,536
Your "love rival" is our beloved nation.

564
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,536
Is your land bigger?

565
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,536
Do you have more people?

566
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,870
How can you compare?

567
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,710
Right.

568
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,910
What you said is true.

569
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,500
It's an undeniable fact.

570
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,456
But when he brought it up,

571
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,270
I couldn't turn him down.

572
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,325
Not only did you not turn him down,

573
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,620
you went ahead and divulged
your innermost thoughts, didn't you?

574
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm dumb, aren't I?

575
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,750
Dumb and naive.

576
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,940
Would you have done that?

577
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,270
Me?

578
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,909
I'm even more dumb.

579
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,260
Because of Zhuo Ran?

580
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,030
Aren't things going well with you two?

581
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:32,155
Go and transfer yesterday's B-rolls
into here.

582
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,120
Okay.

583
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,615
Two days ago,
we were supposed to go and watch a movie.

584
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,940
But he said he was busy.

585
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,246
Where did he go?

586
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,340
Supposedly for work.

587
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,330
Anyway, the date was cancelled.

588
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,659
I haven't heard from him since.

589
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,860
Work?

590
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,900
What is it?

591
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,060
Nothing.

592
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,490
Yeah, it's nothing.

593
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,586
In a relationship,

594
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,190
it's either mutually showing love,
or mutually giving or getting hurt.

595
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,266
We're adults, not some young kids.

596
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,890
I'm fine with any outcome.

597
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,790
Anyway,

598
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,090
it's not like I have no suitors.

599
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,270
It doesn't have to be him, right?

600
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,270
If it really came down to...

601
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,386
If I really had to let go,

602
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,220
promise me you'd drink with me then.

603
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,576
Drink until we puke.

604
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,886
Drink until we pass out cold.

605
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,860
All right?

606
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,010
Mi Gu.

607
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,600
The fact that I'm living
at Liang Mu Ze's house,

608
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,510
did you ever mention it to Zhuo Ran?

609
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,680
No, I didn't.

610
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,040
Why do you ask?

611
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,520
Xia Chu.

612
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,796
You're living with that kind of man.

613
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,760
Aren't you afraid?

614
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,920
How did you know?

615
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,356
Mi Gu.

616
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,540
She told me.

617
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,220
Hello?

618
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,110
It's nothing. I'll leave you be.

619
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,140
Bye-bye.

620
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,950
Miss Gu, the producer wanted me
to remind you of the requests.

621
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,580
(Liu Song)

622
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,278
At the hallway today,

623
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:55,206
Mr Zhang specifically introduced her
to the visiting head of the inspection.

624
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,356
That's right.

625
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,206
Director Chen didn't look too amused.

626
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,846
Mr Zhang did a splendid job
during the operation,

627
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,646
so Director Chen couldn't say anything.

628
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,526
Seems like Xia Chu was the most beautiful.

629
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,420
She even charmed Mr Zhang's soul away.

630
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,180
She deserves it.

631
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,860
Doesn't she?

632
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,460
Sorry, guys.

633
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,920
Mr Zhang asked me to come.

634
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,286
I overheard your discussion just now.

635
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,630
Sounded like I was the main star.

636
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,296
It was probably not the first time,
nor will it be the last.

637
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,120
Firstly, I'm thankful that you all approve
of my looks.

638
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,916
I know, I am quite the looker.

639
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,470
There's no doubt about that.

640
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,940
Secondly,

641
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,980
Mr Zhang introduced me to the head...

642
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,256
not because I am pretty.

643
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,556
It's because I was involved with
Liu Ran's treatment from start to end.

644
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,316
I was the one who convinced her uncle
to install the ECMO.

645
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,156
I was also the one
who delivered the lung for transplant...

646
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,100
from the airport to the operating room.

647
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,480
While you guys are busy chit-chatting,

648
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,326
I was in the EICU,

649
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,416
staying by the patient's side
through nights on end,

650
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,410
up until today when the ECMO was removed.

651
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,510
My effort should be remembered.

652
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,030
Lastly,

653
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,156
I'd like to share my favourite motto
with you all as an encouragement.

654
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,276
Being professional and reliable...

655
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,710
is the most cost-effective form
of socialising.

656
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,350
Let's work hard together.

657
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,900
All right. I should head back to the ER.

658
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,800
By the way,

659
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,690
please inform Dr Zhang when he's here
that I dropped by.

660
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,700
Next, let's welcome the President
of Ningjiang's Hospital Association...

661
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,716
who was also our former dean,

662
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,476
Mr Zhang Li Fu, to brief us on his work.

663
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,500
Let's welcome him.

664
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,010
I'm glad to be here.

665
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,520
During the inspection,

666
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,600
I've seen a lot, and heard a lot.

667
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,370
But the thing that impressed me
the most is...

668
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,220
that resident doctor named Xia Chu.

669
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,410
Take a look.

670
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,540
This is a photo I took by chance
of her back.

671
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,040
In this photo,

672
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,380
I can see the most invaluable character
a young doctor should have.

673
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,780
Simple.

674
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,220
Pure.

675
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,380
You could say that she's bordering
on naivety.

676
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,846
But I believe...

677
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,256
that it's the same naivety
that has allowed her...

678
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,596
to bravely speak her mind.

679
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,910
To fight for the patient
with good reason.

680
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,636
She refused to become a vassal
for the more senior doctors.

681
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,576
Amidst the challenging
medical ethics environment,

682
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,526
she abided
by a doctor's code of conduct.

683
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,180
Such a cute heart.

684
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,086
All better.

685
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,966
We often talk about good hospitals...

686
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,080
and good doctors.

687
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,030
What does "good" entail?

688
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,496
Aside from having
the best medical technology,

689
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,536
most advanced equipment...

690
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,596
and a huge number of case samples,

691
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,526
-I think a good hospital...
-Get ready 200 joules...

692
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,676
is not solely defined by
the responsibility and care for patients,

693
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,310
but more so the way
we treat the young doctors.

694
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,446
The bigger the hospital,

695
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,466
the more it should provide space
for young doctors to grow...

696
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,000
and opportunities to improve.

697
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,710
Please remember this.

698
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,020
An industry without young blood
is one without prospects.

699
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,086
That is the reason why I decided...

700
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,720
to share this photo with everyone today.

701
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,996
So, being straightforward...

702
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,670
and not having to compromise
feels pretty good.

703
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,500
♫I had a quick glance at your eyes♫

704
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,880
♫It could be the destiny
But it is not practical♫

705
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,286
♫Your expression popped up on my mind♫

706
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,100
Still reminiscing about my confession?

707
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:49,200
♫I learn to face the music
Instead of evading it♫

708
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,286
You're thinking too much.

709
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,386
Drive safe. No need to reply.

710
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,906
♫If I can't predict the future
I'll leave it up to fate♫

711
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:05,220
♫I can't remember
When I fell in love with you♫

712
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,450
♫I am afraid
That I might lose you one day♫

713
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:19,250
♫Every minute, every second
How do I resist?♫

714
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:26,210
♫I can't help but look forward
To your return♫

715
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,446
♫Replaying the moment I fell in love♫

716
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,630
Is Xia Chu okay?

717
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,546
Have you had lunch?

718
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,956
Where's the coffee?

719
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,380
Just make do with that.

720
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,976
She being fine doesn't mean you're fine.

721
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,800
Worry about yourself instead.

722
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,410
Regarding the tapping device,

723
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,150
I'm willing to bear the responsibility.

724
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,916
And the rest?

725
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,880
The rest?

726
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,816
-The rest of what?
-Why did Long Yi target Xia Chu?

727
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,046
That's Old Master's order.

728
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,286
-Why did Old Master give that order?
-I don't know.

729
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,060
What exactly is your relationship
with Old Master?

730
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,426
I've told you everything.

731
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,500
In spite of the threats
from the evildoers,

732
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,436
I've come clean about my mistake.

733
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,856
I turned myself in,
and am cooperating with you.

734
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,606
I'm not hoping for any recognition.

735
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,110
I just want to be reunited with my mother.

736
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,096
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and verify it.

737
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,756
But you better do it quickly.

738
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,090
Time is ticking.

739
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,180
Of course we'll verify it
as soon as possible.

740
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,406
Since you are so willing
to cooperate with us...

741
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,306
and have provided us with important clues,

742
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,200
we will ensure your personal safety.

743
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,366
So, I hope you don't mind...

744
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,320
spending the night
at the detention centre.

745
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,560
Certainly, Officer Rao.

746
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,100
What are you doing here?

747
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,540
I came to visit the parrot.

748
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,166
Get in.

749
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,240
You get off.

750
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,990
Roger that.

751
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,620
Everyone, ready to deploy parachutes.

752
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,110
Stand up. Clip on the snap hook.

753
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,520
I don't understand.

754
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,066
Why is his job more important to him
than family?

755
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,610
Catching criminals is more important
than his daughter's happiness.

756
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,850
He's trying to destroy my confidence
towards men, love and marriage.

757
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,276
He hasn't had a wink of sleep
in three days, Xue.

758
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,566
Why is that my problem?

759
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,966
I don't care.

760
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,270
He asked for it himself.

761
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,106
He's forgotten that he's a husband
first and foremost,

762
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,526
and a father next,

763
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,150
and a police officer last.

764
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,706
Tell me then.

765
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,286
What about the way you express your
feelings so heatedly and aggressively?

766
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,350
I did not.

767
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,590
Xue.

768
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,476
He is your birth father.

769
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,716
Right?

770
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,406
Just because he doesn't show his emotions
as openly as you,

771
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,156
doesn't mean you're not important.

772
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,620
I'm not important.

773
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,430
He's just cold-blooded.

774
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,530
Are you all right?

775
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,750
Tian Yong!

776
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,478
Are you okay?

777
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:02,926
-Yeah.
-You should be ashamed.

778
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,906
You're an experienced paratrooper
but still got caught in a tree?

779
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,090
It's not his fault.

780
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,646
He was trying to help the new recruit
open the parachute.

781
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,536
That's why he drifted off course.

782
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,676
Are you okay?

783
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,776
Reporting, sir!

784
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,736
I can still jump!

785
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,020
You're still going to jump?
Look at the state you're in!

786
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,510
I'm fine.

787
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,516
Help him. Quick!

788
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,820
Get him to the infirmary.
