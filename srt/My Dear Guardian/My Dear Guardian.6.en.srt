00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,990
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,340
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,969
Sure.

4
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:37,317
Thank you.

5
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:39,674
How is it?

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,800
(Zhuo Ran)

7
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,418
I cooked seafood porridge.

8
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:19,568
I'll turn off the heat
if you don't want to eat.

9
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,629
It's to save electricity.

10
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:24,578
Bring me some.

11
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,171
Such a brat!

12
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:35,299
"Bring me some."

13
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,545
Isn't that my book?

14
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,550
This is my house.

15
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,261
Did you prepare steamed bun?

16
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:08,402
No.

17
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,599
I've homemade whole grain pancakes though.

18
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,850
Do you want to try?

19
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:26,106
Bring it here.

20
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,640
It smells wonderful. I want to try it too!

21
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:53,667
It's quite delicious.

22
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,200
Of course.

23
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,198
It would go well with pickles.

24
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:04,485
Liang Mu Ze.

25
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:05,877
Have of you heard of a story before?

26
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:09,269
Long, long time ago, a man
kept bossing his housemate...

27
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,810
who was a doctor around.

28
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:13,159
Finally, one day,

29
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,590
his housemate poisoned him to death
without anyone knowing.

30
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,113
Haven't you heard that story before?

31
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,321
I've heard about a story.

32
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:27,670
It's about a Special Forces soldier
who was poisoned to death.

33
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,668
Three seconds
before the poison came into effect,

34
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,109
he punched the person
who poisoned him to death.

35
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,299
Have you heard of the story?

36
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,303
What a coward.

37
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:50,968
Thank you.

38
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,873
The book is nice, isn't it?

39
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:16,609
Can you guess who the murderer is?

40
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,975
It's not Umeda Hachiro for sure.

41
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,336
It's not him for sure.

42
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,407
The story is like this.

43
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,548
Let me tell you.

44
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:32,939
In the end,

45
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:37,536
Mitarai was the one who
resolved the Tokyo Zodiac Murders.

46
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,698
Isn't it interesting?

47
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:46,457
I have many detective novels on the shelf.

48
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,948
I can tell you the ending one by one.

49
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,824
Do you know what is
the most miserable thing in life?

50
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,485
Not having any canned food.

51
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,407
Misery is when you're reading the climax
of a detective novel,

52
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:14,478
someone breaks the ending to you
without warning.

53
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,821
Is detective novel
tastier than canned food?

54
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:21,923
I bet Liang Mu Ze...

55
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,514
is as upset as
having constipation for five days.

56
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,496
He deserves it.

57
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,417
He was lazying in the sofa
like a braised egg...

58
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,048
and bossing me around
as if I was his babysitter.

59
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:32,108
Let me tell you.

60
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:34,189
This is just a warning.

61
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,130
If he does that to me again,

62
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,428
You better shut up now.

63
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,388
I'll...

64
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:46,898
Have you finished taking a shower?

65
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,320
Hug me, handsome.

66
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:51,943
Do you want some tea?

67
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,760
Yes.

68
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,339
Sure.

69
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:16,541
Here you go.

70
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,682
Please try it.

71
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,438
What's that smell?

72
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:23,927
What's wrong?

73
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:26,577
Take it away.

74
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,901
Did you just bring my toilet bowl here?

75
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:32,414
Take it away.

76
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,887
Are you scared of durian?

77
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:38,598
I'm not scared of it. I don't like it.

78
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:40,748
So you're scared of it.

79
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,228
Take it away!

80
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:44,608
Sure. Don't be scared.

81
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,398
Here.
Drink some tea to calm down.

82
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:53,773
Here.

83
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,756
I'll finish all of it.

84
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,450
Are you done?

85
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,423
Liang Mu Ze, you're so sensitive.

86
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:35,885
Don't go.

87
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,286
I'm just joking.

88
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:38,416
Take it away!

89
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:39,708
It's not easy to brew the tea.

90
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:41,838
At least take a sip. Don't waste it.

91
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,938
It's either I leave or you take it away.

92
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,720
I'll take it away.

93
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:50,018
I'll get lost.

94
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:10,960
Is it nice?

95
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,040
Is this Pre-Qingming Longjing?

96
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,748
Suitable for kids.

97
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:21,964
You know about tea too?

98
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:24,128
So what?

99
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,461
I swear I'm not secretly thinking that
you're old-fashioned.

100
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,828
My grandma loves drinking tea.

101
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:45,958
When I was young, I always
had Longjing, Pu'er with her.

102
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:47,748
I see.

103
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:50,167
When you go back to
your hometown next time,

104
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,478
I'll prepare some tea leaves for you...

105
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,459
so that you can bring it back
for your grandma.

106
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:54,870
No need.

107
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,361
Don't be shy.

108
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,927
Before I left,
I had stolen quite a bit of tea leaves...

109
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:00,287
from my dad's tea cabinet.

110
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:01,824
My home is near to Hangzhou.

111
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:04,102
I have quite many opportunities
to taste Longjing every year.

112
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,396
No matter how expensive tea is,

113
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:07,958
it is meant to be tasted by people.

114
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,167
Its value will only be reflected

115
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,398
when more people try it.

116
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,939
Don't feel sorry for me.

117
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:13,822
No need.

118
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,449
Don't be shy.

119
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,301
My grandma passed away long time ago.

120
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,468
My grandma passed away long time ago too.

121
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,108
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,887
I didn't know that.

123
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,348
My bed is not covered with bed sheets.

124
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,007
If you feel sorry for me,

125
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,828
lend me a bed sheet
and make the bed for me.

126
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,400
Sure, I'll do it.

127
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:52,575
Something is not right.

128
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,557
Why should I feel sorry for him?

129
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,607
He mentioned his grandma first.

130
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:57,828
I didn't know that.

131
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,968
Why should I contribute my bed sheet?

132
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,109
Why should I make his bed?

133
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:02,555
Who does he think he is?

134
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:04,363
He is your landlord.

135
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,824
It's either you put up with him
or you leave.

136
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,593
Make the bed for him, huh?

137
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,628
Sad story, huh?

138
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,840
Fine, let's make his wish come true.

139
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,627
I've a bad hunch.

140
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:44,016
And in the name of the Moon,
I will punish you!

141
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:47,398
Liang Mu Ze.

142
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:06,863
Poop-picker, wake up! You're getting late.

143
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,328
I'm going to be late.

144
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:55,748
Will you stop staring at me?

145
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:58,838
I'm sorry. I came to the wrong place.

146
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:13,358
I'm doomed.

147
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:31,328
I'm leaving.

148
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,595
Finish it before you leave.

149
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,168
Thank you.

150
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,216
Did you go out to get milk
early in the morning?

151
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,871
I didn't buy it.
You left it in the fridge.

152
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,759
You got it from the fridge?
I didn't keep milk in the fridge.

153
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:49,927
It's here.

154
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,756
Why did you give it to me?

155
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,588
It's not expired. I've checked.

156
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:00,248
It's whipping cream.

157
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:03,108
Do you know
how many calories it contains?

158
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,214
I have no idea.

159
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,582
Why did you give it to me then?

160
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:07,853
You kind of enjoyed it.

161
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,387
-Liang Mu Ze!
-You're going to be late.

162
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:21,521
What did you say?

163
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,892
Forget it. I'll get another driver.

164
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,126
It's okay.

165
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,081
Are you having motion sickness?

166
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:14,973
It's gut fermentation syndrome.

167
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,115
I feel like vomiting.

168
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,348
It's okay.

169
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,686
Just put up with it.
It's not a serious problem.

170
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:21,841
Don't be dramatic.

171
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:23,462
You need to be strong.

172
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:25,647
Liang Mu Ze, you said that on purpose.

173
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,338
You're thinking too much.

174
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,087
I'm just an old hog.

175
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:32,737
I can't tell
whipping cream and milk apart.

176
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,908
They're the same to me.

177
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:34,937
You're talking nonsense!

178
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:37,208
You're angry at me as I made your bed
with a printed Sailor Moon bedding set.

179
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,349
You're seeking revenge.

180
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:39,428
Listen.

181
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:41,929
You're a special forces soldier
and yet you're so petty.

182
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,496
For a man like you,

183
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,417
let alone insomnia,

184
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,318
you may drop dead one day soon.

185
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,452
Who is the petty one?

186
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:49,373
It's you.

187
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:04,178
We're here.

188
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,028
Good morning, Xia Chu.

189
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:28,394
Good morning.

190
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:30,647
He's my comrade.

191
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:31,948
Will you get down now?

192
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,755
Why are you here?

193
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,651
I'm here for something.

194
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,872
Have you eaten breakfast?

195
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:56,109
Yes, I've eaten.

196
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:59,043
Keep it for lunch.

197
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:04,255
What's wrong?

198
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,106
Take it away.
I can't look at it the same way anymore.

199
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,708
This is my comrade.

200
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,302
Find out someone for me.

201
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,798
It's one week after the patient,
Luo Xiao Jun underwent the surgery.

202
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,859
It's time for the review
of heart ultrasonography.

203
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,606
There's no blood clot on septal occluder.

204
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,447
The reading of blood cell count
and coagulation index are normal.

205
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:32,908
No active bleeding is found.

206
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,089
The drainage tube was removed last night.

207
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:36,879
That's great.

208
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:40,314
Dr. Zhang has completed
yet another challenge.

209
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:43,479
The coagulation during the intervention...

210
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,398
and the bleeding management
during thoracotomy were managed well.

211
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,807
I don't deserve all the credit.

212
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,321
Thanks to Xia Chu.

213
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,120
All right. Xia Chu should
come out with a case report.

214
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,762
She's pregnant!

215
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,447
I'm not pregnant.

216
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:17,407
You're pregnant.

217
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,948
You almost puked.

218
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,227
So what?

219
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:21,808
That's the sign of pregnancy.

220
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:26,085
Xiao Jun, don't talk nonsense.

221
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,826
It's always shown on TV.

222
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,218
Stop talking.

223
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:33,638
Why are you laughing?

224
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,514
Yang Mu Ze is such a jerk!

225
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,954
If it ever happens again,

226
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:00,615
I'll poison you to death!

227
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,007
The military medical doctor
needs to attend to something urgent.

228
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:14,832
They need our help.

229
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:15,893
Get ready.

230
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,104
Why is it me?

231
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,361
As Mr. Zhang said,
we need to send a houseman there.

232
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:22,351
You're not in.

233
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,608
All of us unanimously recommended
you as the representative.

234
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:34,481
Are you really pregnant?

235
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,607
If you admit that you studied eight years
in medical school for nothing,

236
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:39,038
I'll admit that I'm pregnant.

237
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,028
Are you pregnant
and he refuses to be responsible?

238
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,588
Isn't that the storyline?

239
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,607
Who refuses to be responsible?
What nonsense are you talking about?

240
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:47,868
That military officer.

241
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:49,567
If not so,
why would you poison him to death?

242
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:51,275
That's between him and me.

243
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:52,977
All right. I got it.

244
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:54,048
Go now.

245
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,527
The success of the surgery has
further strengthened our determination...

246
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,348
to develop and produce 3D technology.

247
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:11,147
I hope we can start from
the department of cardiothoracic surgery.

248
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:13,526
We shall work together
to set up a special fund...

249
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:18,367
for 3D Printing and hologram technology
which is non-profit making.

250
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:21,468
It's to expedite
the development of 3D technology.

251
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,567
From my personal view,

252
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,188
clinical technology innovation
is definitely a good movement.

253
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,452
We welcome such exploration.

254
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:29,816
However, as for the hospital,

255
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:31,047
we need further discussion on it.

256
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,468
We can do it.

257
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:36,201
However, as for the mode of operation
of the special fund,

258
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:37,923
we need further clarification.

259
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:38,983
Don't worry.

260
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,669
I'll draft a Strategic Cooperation
Framework Agreement as soon as possible...

261
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,887
and explain to all of you in detail.

262
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,948
That's great.
We'll wait for the good news, Mr. Zhuo.

263
00:22:48,257 --> 00:22:50,967
Dr. Zhang.
Thank you for making the contact.

264
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:52,167
Sorry to have troubled you.

265
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,308
Don't worry.

266
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,139
Not to mention you're Xia Chu's friend.

267
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:59,578
Personalized medicine is the trend.

268
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,968
3D printing technology
is an important element.

269
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:07,047
If the special fund
can go through smoothly,

270
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:11,360
I think it's beneficial to everyone
be it your company,

271
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:14,987
our hospital and department
or our potential patients.

272
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:16,321
It's a win-win situation.

273
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,501
It's worth doing.

274
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,426
Do you have time for lunch?

275
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,080
I would like to treat you
and Xia Chu a meal.

276
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:25,412
I need to conduct a surgery
in the afternoon.

277
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:27,826
Furthermore, Xia Chu hasn't come back yet.

278
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:29,132
Where did she go?

279
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:31,457
She's gone to the military camp
for health security tasks.

280
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:33,025
Are you looking for her?

281
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:37,057
It's such a hot day
yet you guys have to work under hot sun.

282
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:38,148
Thank you for the hard work.

283
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,098
It's our duty.

284
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,640
It's mainly because
casualties have increased lately.

285
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,358
Not only do I have to manage equipment
and medicine supply alone,

286
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:47,701
I also have to take care of the patients.

287
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:49,042
I'm really up to my neck.

288
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:51,728
What are they doing?

289
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,778
Have you heard about
The Heavenly Maid Scatters Blossoms?

290
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,446
It's time for you to see new things.

291
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,452
Liang Mu Ze, can you do it?

292
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,373
He's Liang Mu Ze
of Special Forces Brigade.

293
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:18,094
His marksmanship was made known
in the division during the training.

294
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,178
Some people call him the God of Guns.

295
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,610
God?

296
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:24,942
He's just mental.

297
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:28,682
Get ready to shoot.

298
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,869
I injured my arm. I need treatment.

299
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:18,185
(Treatment Room)

300
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,616
The wound is not too bad.
No stitches are needed.

301
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:26,276
Stop moving!

302
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:28,504
It's too big.

303
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:29,808
What?

304
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:31,099
The plaster is too big.

305
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,120
It's not nice looking.

306
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,727
Everyone looks ugly when they're injured.

307
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,687
Don't bolster yourself
if you want to look good.

308
00:25:35,728 --> 00:25:37,518
Why did you fool around for no reason?

309
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:43,724
Do you really think that
I was fooling around?

310
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:44,818
Weren't you?

311
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:46,702
You shot down cans of beer in a row.

312
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:50,367
No doubt it's interesting to watch
but what can the tricks do...

313
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:51,388
when it comes to actual battle?

314
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:54,967
A few years back,

315
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,958
there was a kidnapping case.

316
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,848
The Special Forces had to assist the SWAT
in rescuing the hostages.

317
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:05,528
However, the kidnappers
threw a gas tank right off the roof.

318
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:09,458
Fortunately, an officer found out about it
and shot the gas tank with a gun.

319
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,119
The gas tank exploded in the air.

320
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,336
Not only did he save himself,

321
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:14,767
he also saved the hostages.

322
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:16,748
He also saved the onlooking crowd.

323
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:20,637
You're right.
It's not practical in war.

324
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:22,540
However, in a battlefield,

325
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,897
one will encounter more violent situations
with blood and gore.

326
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:29,838
Those situations can only be handled by
these unusual training.

327
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:55,998
It's done.

328
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,201
Where is the sink?

329
00:26:58,631 --> 00:26:59,571
It's next door.

330
00:27:00,198 --> 00:27:01,078
Thank you.

331
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,295
By the way,

332
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,957
take care of the wound hygiene.

333
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:10,174
Rest well.

334
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:13,071
-Keep the wound dry.
-Sure.

335
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:22,017
The kidnapping case that you mentioned
sounded dangerous.

336
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,918
Did you experience it on your own
or did you hear it from someone?

337
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:26,786
I made up the incident.

338
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:29,948
I just wanted to make a point.

339
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,389
That's smart.

340
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:41,858
Xiao Bai, I'm leaving.

341
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:42,869
Okay, bye.

342
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,200
Bai, I've reserved a table.
Pack up.

343
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:48,004
Sure, bye.

344
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,492
Is Mr. Zhuo back yet?

345
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,007
He's not coming back today.

346
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:57,108
What?

347
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,001
How is it going?

348
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:18,988
Do you like her?

349
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,433
I'm just looking around.

350
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,700
She's coming over to our office
for recording.

351
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,121
If you like her...

352
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:30,072
Really?

353
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:32,377
I'm obsessed with her.

354
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,648
Will you bring me to your office
to see her?

355
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,171
No problem.

356
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:43,147
This is my name card.

357
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:45,542
When Mr. Zhuo is back,

358
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:46,763
inform me at the first instance.

359
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:48,560
No problem.

360
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:50,480
That's great!

361
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:57,173
Do you want some fish?

362
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,767
These snakeheads reached only today.
They're fresh.

363
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:00,887
Listen.

364
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:03,120
The snakehead is best for soup making.

365
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:05,800
It's good for muscles
and it helps in wound healing.

366
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:07,461
What do you think?
Will you buy a snakehead?

367
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:09,847
I'll get one.

368
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:11,018
Sure.

369
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,318
It's just a machine.

370
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:19,028
Can it print a weapon?

371
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,222
If we work on the materials,

372
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:24,237
any object can be produced with data.

373
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,012
3D printing will rule the world soon.

374
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,127
We, on the other hand,

375
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,948
is changing the rules of the game
in the present world.

376
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:35,388
Are you trying to print weapons
because of the owner of that car plate?

377
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:36,975
What have you found?

378
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:39,521
It's not confirmed yet.

379
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:48,548
It's time for dinner.

380
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,884
Is this a new bowl?

381
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,360
Do you need so many bowls?

382
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,471
No, I don't need it.

383
00:29:57,969 --> 00:29:59,119
Why did you buy it then?

384
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,327
You don't have to use all the tableware.

385
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:02,588
You can appreciate the beauty.

386
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:05,348
Can you see that?

387
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,477
I plan to buy more beautiful
tableware and hang them on the wall.

388
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:09,978
It'd look nice in the photos.

389
00:30:10,764 --> 00:30:11,744
You're just fooling around.

390
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:16,855
Life is all about
fooling around endlessly.

396
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:02,975
The steamed dumplings are ready.

397
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:08,077
Have you taken a shower?

398
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:11,498
Didn't I tell you
you must keep the wound dry?

399
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,449
I didn't wet it.

400
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,076
Listen, take care of the wound.

401
00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:23,297
Don't take it lightly.

402
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:24,847
If the wound is infected,

403
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,228
you'll ruin my reputation.

404
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,181
What reputation do you have?
The reputation of a houseman?

405
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:30,748
What's wrong with being a houseman?

406
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:33,118
A houseman can be passionate
and ambitious too. Okay?

407
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:34,167
Think about it.

408
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,548
All the experts used to be a houseman
who had ascended with time.

409
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:42,290
If everyone treats us differently
just like you,

410
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,874
how do doctors become better?

411
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:45,215
How does medicine field develop?

412
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,673
The fish soup is bland.

413
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:53,316
What are you doing?

414
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,500
Don't add salt!

415
00:31:57,947 --> 00:31:58,847
If you consume too much of salt at night,

416
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:00,167
it'll cause more burden to kidneys.

417
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,287
You will be at a risk of losing caesium.

418
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:04,607
Furthermore, it may trigger
tens of diseases including stomach cancer.

419
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:06,937
It's not good for wound healing too.
More importantly...

420
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:08,878
More importantly,
you're having an early menopause.

421
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,669
Premature menopause.

422
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,970
My mum used to have the same symptoms.

423
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:14,495
Liang Mu Ze!

424
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,418
Liang Mu Ze!

425
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:25,991
Give me back the fish soup!

426
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:26,972
Give it back to me!

427
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,693
Give me back the snakehead fish soup!

428
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:30,954
Give it back to me!

429
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:47,247
Oh no.

430
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:00,480
He is mental!

431
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,340
He insisted to add
so much of salt in the soup.

432
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,201
He ruined the soup.

433
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,853
Just let him be. It's not for you anyway.

434
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:08,954
Why are you so upset with him?

435
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:12,025
I bought the snakehead. I cooked the soup.

436
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,207
I even treated his wound.

437
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,998
I need to be responsible to my cooking
and my patient.

438
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,441
You're nothing but stubborn.

439
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,971
He just added some salt in the soup.
How is that a big deal?

440
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:27,200
Do you know?
Liang Mu Ze did so many strange things.

441
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:30,242
He doesn't sleep at night.

442
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:32,166
He's always posing
in the living room for no reason.

443
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:33,947
I saw that many times by chance.

444
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:14,508
What's going on?

445
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:40,817
He would just stare
straight into your eyes.

446
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:42,080
It's really scary.

447
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,617
You make a man...

448
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:47,027
sleep on a bed covered
with Sailor Moon printed bedding set.

449
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,768
It'd be strange if he can fall asleep.

450
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:50,216
Also,

451
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,430
he insists to
close the curtain during day time.

452
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:54,641
The whole house is lifeless.

453
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,464
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

454
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:10,991
I'm trying to avoid the light.

455
00:35:11,032 --> 00:35:12,572
This is my curtain!

456
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:13,853
This is my house.

457
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,046
Is he a cactus monster or what?

458
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:25,756
He's full of thorns!

459
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:27,727
Being vigilant at all times
could be a conditioned reflex...

460
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:29,200
as he's a military officer.

461
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,487
It's nothing do to with being vigilant.

462
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:32,967
He's too bossy.

463
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,160
He wants to take control of everything.

464
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:35,520
He wouldn't even allow me to sing.

465
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,760
♪Missing you so much♪

-Will you stop singing?

469
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:52,256
Will you stop singing?

470
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,617
What's wrong?
My singing is not too bad.

471
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:55,628
Are you sure?

472
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:58,354
You must have misunderstood
the meaning of "not too bad".

473
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,260
I think it's all right.

474
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:01,601

Are you awake now?

480

-Liang Mu Ze!
-What?

481
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,790
That's too much, isn't it?

482
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:28,320
He's inhumane.

483
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:31,976
However, Dr. Xia,

484
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:35,008
why don't you consider some other hobbies?

485
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:38,418
After all, your singing is truly annoying.

486
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,188
Who is annoyed?

487
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:41,867
I'm the annoyed one, okay?

488
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,838
Listen.

489
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:46,988
What drives me up the wall is
he caused harm to Er Miao!

490
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,154
Did you feed it raw meat?

491
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:58,075
Yes.

492
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:00,073
It doesn't eat raw meat.

493
00:37:00,123 --> 00:37:01,863
That's why it's yearning it. Am I right?

494
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:03,258
Of course.

495
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,399
I love meat. Especially ones like you.

496
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,268
Spend the rest of your life with him.

497
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:14,585
Spend the rest of your life with me.

498
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:16,173
Okay?

499
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:17,873
Sure.

500
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,521
You're a pervert cat!

501
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,058
Spend the rest of your life with me.

502
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,527
I'm dying.

503
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:33,327
You brought a female cat home.

504
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:34,777
If it's a male cat,

505
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,908
it would be following you around.

506
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,548
I'm so irritated.
How could you still laughing at me?

507
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:44,217
What is so irritating?

508
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:45,692
You didn't sell yourself to him.

509
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:48,103
If you can't put up with him,
just move out.

510
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:49,798
It's easy to say.

511
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:51,671
Moving out

512
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:54,603
means looking for a house
and redecorating the place.

513
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:56,664
I don't have the time.

514
00:37:58,246 --> 00:38:00,626
Ladies, do you like the bed?

515
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:05,802
Thank you.

516
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,401
By the way, is your landlord
really so annoying?

517
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:11,881
Doesn't he have some plus points?

518
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:14,853
He's not really annoying.

519
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:15,994
He's just strange.

520
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:18,277
Speaking about plus points,

521
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,127
the training camp that he's in
is quite near to the hospital.

522
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,617
There were a few occasions
where he stayed at home...

523
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:24,828
and he let me hitch a ride
to the hospital the next day.

524
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:27,816
Compared to most guys,

525
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:29,325
he's quite tidy and neat.

526
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:30,906
He is hygienic.

527
00:38:31,468 --> 00:38:33,628
He always makes his bed.

528
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:35,209
It's as if no one has slept on it.

529
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:37,287
Furthermore...

530
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:38,880
What?

531
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,558
Come in.

532
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:10,315
Liang Mu Ze.

533
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:11,407
What's wrong?

534
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:13,344
Well...

535
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,872
I heard noises
coming from the living hall.

536
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,400
Can't you hear that?

537
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,213
No.

538
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,471
I think I must have heard it wrongly.

539
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:29,336
Well...

540
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,701
There are thunders and lightnings.

541
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,673
It's quite loud.

542
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:39,381
Are you scared?

543
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:40,801
I'm not scared.

544
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:53,729
I'm a little scared.

545
00:39:58,822 --> 00:39:59,879
Forget it.

546
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,340
I'm going back to my room.

547
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:04,115
Let's go to the living room.

548
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:05,376
I can't sleep anyway.

549
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:15,582
Liang Mu Ze.

550
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:18,618
Are you having insomnia again?

551
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,421
If you can't fall asleep,

552
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,118
you can try meditation.

553
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:25,433
Firstly,

554
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:27,605
close your eyes.

555
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:31,173
Relax your body.

556
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:35,529
Then, starting counting.

557
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:43,910
One, two, three, four, five.

558
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,148
Inhale.

559
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,458
Count to five.

560
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,810
Exhale.

561
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:06,259
Inhale.

562
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:11,439
Exhale.

563
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:22,576
No matter what,

564
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:24,246
ever since we share a house,

565
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:25,567
my mum doesn't have to worry

566
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,708
about my safety anymore.

567
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,120
In that case,

568
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,825
he's not completely useless.

569
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:35,413
Then why are you picking on him?

570
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,786
Please know your position.

571
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:38,876
He's your landlord.

572
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,127
He's not your husband.

573
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:42,726
As long as he doesn't install
a hidden camera to peek on you...

574
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,447
or doesn't sell his house away,

575
00:41:44,488 --> 00:41:47,138
all the other things are not important.

576
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:48,852
Of course.

577
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,882
If you plan to move in with him,

578
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:53,143
then we shall adjust the standards.

579
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:55,604
I don't plan to move in with him.

580
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:56,776
Do you know?

581
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,846
Everything that you just complained...

582
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,077
sounded as if both of you
are a little couple...

583
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,538
trying to get along with each other.

584
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:04,714
What nonsense are you talking about?

585
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:07,213
It's quite good actually.

586
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,887
At least you have someone
to pick fight with at home.

587
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,228
You guys can take care of each other too.

588
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:14,002
It's better than living alone like me.

589
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:15,675
Mr. Zhuo is back in the office.

590
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,036
He wants to have dinner
with you tonight.

591
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,057
I have to go.

592
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,274
Why are you in a rush?

593
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:23,259
Slow down.
