1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:42,866
Why did such a dramatic
matter happen to me?

4
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,577
I'm sorry, Mi Gu.

5
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,576
I've just found out
that I left you behind.

6
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,377
You had already left
when I went back for you.

7
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:22,776
Where are you now?

8
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:23,777
Did you return home?

9
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:26,088
Please don't be mad at me.

10
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:28,656
Too many troubles happened tonight,

11
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:30,857
my mind went blank.

12
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:33,257
Forgive me, Mi Gu.

13
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:40,217
Silly girl, I've reached home.

14
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:41,711
Rest assured.

15
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,407
Get some rest too.

16
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:48,737
Everything will be better tomorrow.

17
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:00,657
This is my name card.

18
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:03,957
Remember to call me if Xia Chu
goes to this kind of place again.

19
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,285
Miss Mi Gu?

20
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:11,206
Do you know me?

21
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,542
You took the wrong luggage.

22
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,177
That's yours.

23
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,217
We've never met before.

24
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,790
Never.

25
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:56,160
Halt!

26
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,417
Turn to the left!

27
00:03:58,943 --> 00:03:59,973
Face forward!

28
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,289
The destination is TSC base.

29
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,017
Run and go!

30
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,520
One, two, one...

31
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:46,221
-Xiao Teng!
-Yes!

32
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:47,141
Lead the team!

33
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,537
Captain!

34
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:53,727
Welcome back!

35
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,284
How's the water temperature?

36
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:57,657
It's too cold.

37
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,097
That's why I lead the team back.

38
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,097
What's wrong?

39
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,250
Do you want to try?

40
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,057
Yes, I do.

41
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,004
Report!

42
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,085
Captain,
the Brigade Headquarters want you...

43
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,826
in the Brigade Commander's office
at 11:00.

44
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,160
-Okay, noted.
-Yes!

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,560
Is Xiao Jun hospitalised?

46
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,184
Yes.

47
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,390
His operation is tomorrow,
I wish to take leave.

48
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,057
No.

49
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,424
Someone from the higher unit
is coming tomorrow.

50
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,687
Thunderbolt Commando was picked
to take the comprehensive assessment.

51
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:32,856
As usual,

52
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,207
every participant's result
will be recorded.

53
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:38,537
The team will fail
if any one of you gives up.

54
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,137
So...

55
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:41,497
Think thoroughly...

56
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,151
whether to put Tian Yong on.

57
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:44,656
I don't have to think.

58
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:45,617
Just let him decide.

59
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:49,096
It's a matter of the honor
of the Special Forces Brigade...

60
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:50,617
and your future.

61
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,217
Liang Mu Ze,

62
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,537
don't let me down.

63
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:56,857
Yes!

64
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,352
Luo Xiao Jun's condition is complicated.

65
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,810
A simple interventional surgery
can only cure ASD,

66
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:06,457
but it's useless
to the left inferior pulmonary artery.

67
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,929
It's the same to thoracotomy,
the wound is large...

68
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,762
and it damages the patient's
cardiopulmonary function.

69
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:30,785
So I think
the most secure way is...

70
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,271
to have a hybrid operation by combining
medical and surgical treatment.

71
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,370
You, cardiologists perform
the blocking of ASD.

72
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,130
We, cardiac surgeons operate
on the pulmonary artery.

73
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,003
The operation duration
can be shortened in this way.

74
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:45,545
And extracorporeal circulation
is not needed either.

75
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,826
The post-operative survival rate
will be improved.

76
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,280
If the interventional surgery fails,

77
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:54,647
we can still perform
surgical repair of ASD.

78
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:56,002
In this way,

79
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,622
we can avoid a second surgery situation.

80
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:02,017
This will put forward higher requirements
for our performance.

81
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,857
I hope that everyone can work together.

82
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,242
Okay, you're dismissed.

83
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:18,617
This case can be written in the SCI case.

84
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:21,554
Guess whom Zhang will take
to enter the operating room.

85
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,081
May I have your attention?

86
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:30,617
Xiao Xiao.

87
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:31,888
Yes.

88
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:32,889
From now on,

89
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,217
you're in charge of Luo Xiao Jun.

90
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,589
Tomorrow,
you're going into the operating room.

91
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:39,184
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

92
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,401
I'll work hard and get the job done.

93
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:46,747
Hand over the information to her.

94
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,043
If anyone wishes to observe my surgery,

95
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:53,563
I hope that you guys

96
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:57,082
can impress me with your performance.

97
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:07,771
Teacher,

98
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,087
I'd like to talk to you.

99
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:13,377
What's the matter?

100
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:16,440
I was the one discovering
Luo Xiao Jun's condition...

101
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:20,049
and I'm in charge of
communicating with his mother.

102
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,970
So what?

103
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,680
That's why you thought...

104
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,474
you could daze and desert at will
during today's preoperative...

105
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:30,617
discussion meeting?

106
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,129
You can do whatever you want
because he is your loot, right?

107
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,337
No.

108
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:42,120
Let me tell you this.

109
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:45,240
There are only two results
of saving lives.

110
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,496
Either a promise success,

111
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:48,577
or zero failure.

112
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:49,657
There's no other choice.

113
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,457
Do you know how complicated
Luo Xiao Jun's surgery is?

114
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,798
Do you know how risky his surgery is,

115
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,519
how high the risk is?

116
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:05,976
If you have never
thought about what I said,

117
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:09,986
I'll never allow
an unprepared resident...

118
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,387
to enter my operating room.

119
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm sorry, Teacher.

120
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm extremely disappointed...

121
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:19,920
with what you did today.

122
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,490
(Miss Lan)

123
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,630
(Miss Lan)

124
00:09:58,605 --> 00:09:59,485
Miss Lan.

125
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,952
Girl, why didn't you answer my video call?

126
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,297
Are you working overtime?

127
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,097
No, no overtime today.

128
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,448
My internet is down.

129
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,548
I don't want to waste my internet data.

130
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:12,577
Have you eaten?

131
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:14,687
Yes.

132
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:16,177
What did you eat?

133
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:17,752
I ate...

134
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:21,333
my homemade sweet and sour ribs.

135
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,990
I cooked vegetables too.

136
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:26,145
And a bowl of millet congee
with half a steamed bun.

137
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,624
Not bad.
You have made yourself a hearty meal.

138
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,057
Of course.

139
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:33,376
A healthy body leads to a healthy life.

140
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,927
That goes without saying.

141
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:36,976
Right.

142
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,497
You need to take care of yourself.

143
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:40,680
You're out there.

144
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,484
I don't request anything,

145
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,746
but you need to eat well...

146
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,597
and take good care of yourself,
do you hear me?

147
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:50,864
Girl,

148
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,667
how is Liang Mu Ze's house?

149
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:55,032
Do you still want to move out?

150
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:56,574
I do.

151
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,444
When are you going to move out?

152
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,295
How's your house-hunting?

153
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:03,183
I can come over to help you
if you're not free.

154
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,230
Never mind.

155
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,151
The house...

156
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:07,295
I've already found one.

157
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:12,680
It's very near to our hospital
and the environment is good.

158
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,400
I like the renovation as well.

159
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:16,933
The point is
the landlord is not in the country.

160
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,614
He is unfamiliar with the domestic market.

161
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:22,127
The fee is over
one-third below the market rates.

162
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,568
It's cost-effective.

163
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:26,937
I see.

164
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:28,216
That's great.

165
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,417
Then I'll tell Mu Min.

166
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:32,064
No, don't...

167
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:01,016
Mom.

168
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,600
Son, what are you doing?

169
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,201
I'm going to sleep.

170
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:05,657
Sleep?

171
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,577
Are you sleeping alone
or sleeping with someone?

172
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,490
Mom, I'm in the unit.

173
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,376
I know that.

174
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,200
How is it?
What progress are you two making?

175
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,240
It's good.

176
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,177
How good is it?

177
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:24,177
How good is it?

178
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,520
When we're at home,

179
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:28,767
she cooks,

180
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:29,977
I wash the dishes.

181
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:32,618
And then,

182
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:34,505
we go for a ride.

183
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,777
Both of us know each other's job.

184
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:41,993
What a relief!

185
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:45,257
We talk every chance we have.

186
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,817
Move out from my house in one week.

187
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:51,273
It's very good.

188
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:52,194
Really, very good.

189
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:54,393
Is it?

190
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:55,698
Yes, we're good.

191
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,257
Then why did her mother tell me,

192
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:01,049
that she found a rental...

193
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,176
and that she's ready
to move out to live alone?

194
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,857
-Really?
-What do you mean?

195
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,574
Stop playing dumb!

196
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,377
She didn't tell me that.
What's going on?

197
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,057
Did you tell her that you have a son?

198
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:13,577
Did you?

199
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:17,057
Liang Mu Ze, I think you're crazy.

200
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:19,129
I'm not... I...
I... My reception... I...

201
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,816
Hello, Mom,
I've got bad reception here. Hello?

202
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,216
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you this.

203
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:23,896
If you dare to kick her out,

204
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,777
I'll find you a new tenant right away.

205
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,406
Too much noise, I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.

206
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,737
-You wait and see!
-The reception is bad.

207
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:30,696
I'm sure

208
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:31,967
I can still deal with you.

209
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:34,337
I can't hear you.

210
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,296
-Mom...
-Liang Mu Ze!

211
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,217
Mom...

212
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:41,114
This brat!

213
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,042
(Old lady)

214
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,257
You had trouble sleeping too?

215
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:14,858
What do you mean?

216
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,176
You can't sleep,

217
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:20,217
but I'm just waiting to sleep.

218
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,967
How's your preparation
for the assessment?

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
I'm a bit cringed but
I don't want to give up.

220
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:34,983
Then just go on.

221
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,656
But I'm afraid that
I'll affect the result of the team.

222
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:42,543
"Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share".

223
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:44,777
Is this how they said?

224
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:50,046
The recruits line up,
the Special Forces Brigade...

225
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,222
Hunter Military School, Isaia,

226
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:53,463
we are brothers.

227
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,687
I leave my life to you,
the result means nothing.

228
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,519
What's after that?

229
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:06,536
What do you mean?

230
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,657
How does the poem continue?

231
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,184
Captain Liang,
I wish you could hear yourself.

232
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:15,927
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

233
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,150
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our Armour suit and spear shine.

234
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,246
We move forward, your hand in mine.

235
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,467
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

236
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:32,757
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our Armour suit and spear shine.

237
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,085
We move forward, your hand in mine.

238
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,416
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?

239
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:40,791
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

240
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,321
Our Sire sends the troops,

241
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:43,841
let’s make our Armour suit
and spear shine.

242
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,048
We move forward, your hand in mine.

243
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,937
The age of death of the deceased is
in the range between 40 to 45 years old.

244
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,856
The cause of death
is hemorrhagic shock...

245
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,257
due to the gunshot wound on the chest.

246
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,017
From the deceased's skin wound
and the residue,

247
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:00,577
the deceased was
bitten by a large dog after he died.

248
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,656
But this is not the most crucial point.

249
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,856
The most crucial point is that
from the pathological anatomy,

250
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,776
I found the deceased had suffered
from a very severe kidney disease.

251
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,897
He even needed a kidney transplant.

252
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:13,246
Transplant?

253
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:14,167
Yes.

254
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:17,069
Moreover, the deceased and the data...

255
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,816
sent by the Interpol
of the seriously wounded person...

256
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:23,336
who was almost kidnapped
in Isaia Joint Medical outpost,

257
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,486
are highly matched,

258
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,240
no matter if it's their ABO RBC
blood group or MHC antigen.

259
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,098
Rao Zhi,

260
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,973
there's been a murder
in Jiaotong University's district.

261
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,030
Okay, noted.

262
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,961
I'm going to the scene.
We'll talk about it later.

263
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:44,881
Okay.

264
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,297
Let's go.

265
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,238
Take a look in there. Yes.

266
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,506
Rao Zhi, how is it?

267
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:57,435
It's in there.

268
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:58,473
Rao Zhi.

269
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,127
Rao Zhi, over here.

270
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:51,456
(In the operation)

271
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:54,844
The blood vessel of the kid is fine,

272
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:58,127
it might be difficult.

273
00:17:58,812 --> 00:17:59,692
Okay, noted.

274
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:01,556
Go a little further.

275
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,103
How is it? Are you okay?

276
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,016
Gearing up, I can't wait.

277
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:24,266

278
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:25,760

Let's go!

How is Xiao Jun?

312
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,137
I just received the news.

313
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:48,537
The operation didn't work.

314
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,297
Bradycardia!

315
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:21,046
Stop!

316
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:22,176

Yes!

319
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:25,922
Let me do it.

320
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:52,985
I think we should repair the ASD.

321
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:55,417
No.

322
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:58,480
The heart rate and blood pressure
of the patient are unstable.

323
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:00,600
He can't undergo cardiac surgery.

324
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:15,336
Why did it fail?

325
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:16,520
How could it fail?

326
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,256
There shouldn't have been no problem
about the surgical plan.

327
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:20,697
What's the problem?

328
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,377
I don't know.

329
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:30,786
It would be great if I knew it.

330
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,075
Xia Chu,

331
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,266
do you know that?

332
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,610
The responsibility of a doctor...

333
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:46,488
is to relieve often,

334
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,185
to comfort always,

335
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,770
to cure sometimes.

336
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:56,337
It means that...

337
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,577
medicine...

338
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,329
has boundaries that we can't reach.

339
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,487
Doctor is not God.

340
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:08,562
I've tried my best.

341
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:12,769
Really.

342
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:19,337
Perhaps the God of Fortune
is not on our side this time.

343
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:35,377
Then...

344
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:38,017
Then what should we do next?

345
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,256
When he has recovered,

346
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:42,680
we'll repair the atrial septal defect

347
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,191
and the surgery of the pulmonary artery.

348
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,520
But...

349
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,720
his cardiopulmonary function
was seriously damaged.

350
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:53,040
Can he really withstand the trauma?

351
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:03,712
I hope so.

352
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:29,657
How's your wound?

353
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,289
It's fully recovered.

354
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:35,000
Then why did you act like
you were dying during the assessment?

355
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,899
Why would your strength
be reinforced otherwise?

356
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,640
Xiao Jun's condition is not good.

357
00:30:02,097 --> 00:30:03,097
Have you asked the doctor?

358
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:06,817
No.

359
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:08,537
What about giving a call?

360
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:12,097
I'm scared.

361
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,080
13944822375

362
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:18,801
It's Dr. Xia's number.

363
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,857
I have Zhang Yi Chi's number,
why would I ask her?

364
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:22,838
Dr. Xia is prettier.

365
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:24,096
You're shallow.

366
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:27,754
I can get over it.

367
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,486
You can do it too,

368
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,257
sooner or later.

369
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:18,487
Mu Ze.

370
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,034
What would you do...

371
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:33,377
if you knew Xiao Jun's operation
didn't work?

372
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:41,617
Call the doctor to ask about
the reason why it didn't work...

373
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:46,897
and the next arrangement of the operation
to start an early preparation.

374
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:53,593
Right, it should be like this.

375
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:57,618
And you'll comfort
Xiao Jun and your sister-in-law.

376
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:02,160
You'll tell them
that you'll protect them,

377
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,351
even if the sky falls.

378
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:06,097
You've always been like this, right?

379
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:10,738
What are you holding back for?

380
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:13,682
I'm not sure.

381
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:20,360
I'll be scared...

382
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:31,657
if it's a very bad result.

383
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:33,657
Will you?

384
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,217
I will.

385
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,178
Then what should I do?

386
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,480
I dare to stand in front of you,

387
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:49,178
because I know you're right behind me.

388
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:52,320
You too.

389
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:59,080
Go find your comrade
and fight with them.

390
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:33,721
It's me.

391
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:36,441
I'm looking for the house.

392
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,057
It's not about the house.

393
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:43,640
It's about Xiao Jun.

394
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:50,042
So you know.

395
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:54,337
The reason of the failure
is not known yet.

396
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,320
I have no idea...

397
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:58,875
why it became like this.

398
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,465
Perhaps that's what
clinical practice is like.

399
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:06,641
Even if we're well-prepared,

400
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,713
there might still
be a probability to fail.

401
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,537
We are making the second surgical plan.

402
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:14,626
It needs some time.

403
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,441
No matter if you believe it or not,

404
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,360
I still want to say...

405
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:22,880
actually,

406
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:26,440
we, the doctors, are the ones who wish...

407
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:30,520
more than anyone else
that the patient could be safe...

408
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,989
every time we send them
to the operating room.

409
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:36,258
We...

410
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:46,646
I'm sorry.

411
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:49,658
Anything else?

412
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,111
If you have nothing to ask, I'll...

413
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:56,167
800-meter road with obstacles.

414
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,705
When I reached two-thirds of it,

415
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,832
I thought I couldn't do it.

416
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:06,716
8000-meter mazy run.

417
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,738
When I reached the final mile,

418
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:12,085
Tian Yong was hurt.

419
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,026
I carried him.

420
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:17,929
I knew he was hurt.

421
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,970
And he knew I was exhausted.

422
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:25,084
But the reason I carried him
and ran to the finish line...

423
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,817
was only because he wished
to be on the field.

424
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,786
What are you trying to say, Liang Mu Ze?

425
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,017
Xiao Jun is only eight years old.

426
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,906
I know the hospital is not my battlefield.

427
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:51,417
Now I also know that
doctors are irreplaceable.

428
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:57,120
So I ask you not to give up...

429
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:01,777
on Xiao Jun no matter what,

430
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,257
okay?

431
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,330
I got it.

432
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,321
I'll pass your message to Dr. Zhang.

433
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,530
Thank you.

434
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:51,322
Dr. Zhang.

435
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,151
I just finished an operation
and came here to see Xiao Jun.

436
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:56,898
You've worked hard.

437
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,115
What did you buy?

438
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,166
A customer ordered a bracelet from me.

439
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:06,417
She was eager to get it so I went out
to buy some accessories.

440
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,817
I heard it from Mu Ze
that you've opened a book store.

441
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,355
Opening a book store is my hobby.

442
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:20,905
I sell some clothes designed by me
and some freelance designers in the store.

443
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,613
And I sell some
cultural and creative products too.

444
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:24,872
Dreaming is important,

445
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:26,273
but it's important to earn a living too.

446
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:29,123
Don't you think, Dr. Zhang?

447
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:36,226
Dr. Zhang,

448
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:39,120
does Xiao Jun still have a chance?

449
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:44,467
Will you be willing to try...

450
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:48,188
if we arrange a cardiac surgery
for Xiao Jun?

451
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:54,977
For his current situation,

452
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:58,138
it might be hard
to proceed with an interventional surgery.

453
00:37:58,537 --> 00:37:59,577
I think...

454
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:02,951
we're more confident
on performing a surgery.

455
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:05,657
I follow your decision.

456
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:10,057
I feel bad for him
as he has to suffer a lot...

457
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:12,633
at this young age,

458
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,912
but you are a doctor.

459
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,897
I believe in your choice
as long as Xiao Jun can be cured.

460
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:22,993
I trust you, Dr. Zhang.

461
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:26,289
I understand.

462
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:45,097
Who is it?

463
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,222
It's early.

464
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:51,177
Coming!

465
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:57,200
Why have you come here?

466
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:00,560
I want to sleep on my half Tatami.

467
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:02,587
Have you had breakfast?

468
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:03,508
Yes.

469
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:06,139
Don't mind me, carry on.

470
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,160
There are food and beverages
in the fridge, help yourself.

471
00:39:09,754 --> 00:39:10,634
Okay.

472
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:14,258
Didn't you tell me that...

473
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:17,440
you're really busy
preparing for the surgery?

474
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:23,218
The surgery didn't work.

475
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:27,291
Why?

476
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:30,577
I don't know.

477
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:35,440
Perhaps it's often the case.

478
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:39,080
The patient whom the doctors
pay a lot of attention to...

479
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:41,817
might not have a positive outcome.

480
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:45,809
I increasingly find that...

481
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:48,882
what we can do is very limited.

482
00:39:50,009 --> 00:39:51,320
I think...

483
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,000
something's wrong
with the Feng Shui of your house.

484
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,768
Did you get someone
to read the geomancy?

485
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:58,897
Why don't you move out?

486
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:02,922
I wish too.

487
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:05,257
But the other houses are more terrifying.

488
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:07,659
Come to our district.

489
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,125
There's a unit in our district,

490
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,326
it has the same layout as mine.

491
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,247
It's right above us.

492
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:15,139
Does it have
a floor-to-ceiling window too?

493
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:17,457
It does.

494
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:38,177
That...

495
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,047
He gave me this at that day
after you left.

496
00:40:43,697 --> 00:40:45,497
To get your news.

497
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:49,525
I was thinking to throw it away,

498
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:51,937
but then I thought
he might not mean any harm.

499
00:40:51,977 --> 00:40:53,377
It's been years after all.

500
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:54,927
I'll just throw it away.
