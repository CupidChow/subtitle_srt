=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,489
So long as I'm in my uniform,

4
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,859
I must adhere to my
professional values.

5
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:41,694
This is my principle.

6
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:44,865
So...

7
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,120
you've never had any regrets?

8
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:50,248
Never.

9
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,746
That's one thing we have in common.

10
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,983
And insomnia.

11
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:57,904
I recovered a long time ago.

12
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,880
-Really?
-Of course.

13
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:02,575
How did you recover?

14
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:04,582
There are 24 hours a day.

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,414
I've been working and
studying for 20 hours.

16
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,592
The remaining three to four hours
is my nap time.

17
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:10,920
I naturally recovered.

18
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,746
Why do you set yourself a rule
not to date a special forces soldier?

19
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,683
Why do you keep
asking me this question?

20
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:20,640
Because you've never answered me.

21
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,760
I want to know...

22
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:30,440
whether your insomnia is cured...

23
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,033
or just temporarily suppressed.

24
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:35,542
What does it have to do with you?

25
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:38,920
Until yesterday, maybe nothing.

26
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:41,913
What about now?

27
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,023
What about now?

28
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:48,496
Liang Mu Ze.

29
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:55,129
Dr. Xia!

30
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,674
I can't sleep as the rain is pouring.

31
00:02:58,715 --> 00:02:59,704
Why don't you go and take a rest first?

32
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:00,785
I'll be here with the captain.

33
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,312
You don't have to be sorry.

34
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,743
Go and take a rest. It's okay.

35
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:09,825
Go.

36
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:16,102
-Thank you!
-Keep off the rain!

37
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,720
Don't move! Seize him!

38
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:27,707
Don't move!

39
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:30,280
Sit tight! Don't move!

40
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,666
-Don't touch me.
-Hang in there!

41
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:33,587
Don't touch me.

42
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,480
Don't move!

43
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:39,619
What's wrong?

44
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,480
He wanted to extubate
when he woke up! Don't move!

45
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,223
Don't be afraid.

46
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,104
This is a closed thoracic drainage.

47
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,345
Don't touch me!

48
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,346
-Calm down!
-Don't touch me!

49
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,578
It won't do! Press him down!

50
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,031
-Let me go!
-Don't move!

51
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:04,949
Hold his legs steady! Good!

52
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:08,878
Let me go!

53
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,720
-Let me go!
-Hurry up!

54
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,376
Let's transport him while he's sedated.

55
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:45,529
Yes!

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,720
Only one trapped victim
was discovered?

57
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,112
This man's injury is a bit strange.

58
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,879
He claimed that he
was kidnapped to the island.

59
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,677
But the response situation was critical,

60
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:00,955
we have no time to
conduct a full search,

61
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:04,106
so the police have to follow up
the following specific situation.

62
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,607
Okay, we'll meet you at the hospital.

63
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:07,528
Okay.

64
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,546
Easy!

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,960
Slow down!

66
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:27,807
Dr. Zhang.

67
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,247
We just finished up.

68
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,400
Brigade Commander said
you were trapped overnight...

69
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:32,401
and have just escaped.

70
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:33,816
I'm fine, sir.

71
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,626
You performed a
closed thorax drainage for him.

72
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:37,306
He had a hemothorax.

73
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:38,865
His situation was bad
when we found him.

74
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,906
So I can only perform it on the spot.

75
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:42,385
Seems like you really
are the best doctor...

76
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,226
under field conditions in our hospital.

77
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,750
Here, give a hand!

78
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:47,974
The patient needs further inspection.

79
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,136
Okay.

80
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,009
Wait.

81
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,066
What's wrong?

82
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,494
During the last medical forum,

83
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,507
the man who escaped with a
broken leg after the fall was him.

84
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:13,670
Are you sure?

85
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,591
I'm sure.

86
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:31,615
Sir,

87
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:33,783
there's a problem with the data set
that I sent to your email.

88
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:34,864
I already resent it.

89
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:35,785
Please check your email.

90
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,023
Okay.

91
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:39,416
What data is it?

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
It's the clinical trial data set.

93
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,537
Didn't you ask me to send it to you?

94
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,590
Coming.

95
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,826
Coming, Xia.

96
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,047
Change your shoes!

97
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,441
Didn't you see I'm mopping the floor?

98
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:10,424
Why do you do this every time?

99
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:12,706
Can't you appreciate
my hard work, Xia?

100
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,216
You haven't been home for three days.

101
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:15,880
And you're like a bandit entering
the village once you reach home.

102
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,456
Listen,
I'm not letting you in next time.

103
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:18,537
You'll live on the streets.

104
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:19,458
Do you hear me?

105
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,390
I'm doomed.

106
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,746
Mi Gu?

107
00:07:58,485 --> 00:07:59,359
I'm off to edit the clips.

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,625
I might work all night.

109
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,465
I left you some breakfast
in the microwave.

110
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,874
Remember to take the key
when you leave,

111
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:05,834
because it's the only one key.

112
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,945
I need you to send it to me.

113
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,247
Mi Gu.

114
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,208
Gui was wounded.

115
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:11,506
He was sent to the hospital
for rescue treatment.

116
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:12,471
(Emergency Department)

117
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:14,080
Cardiac Surgery, Ward 13.

118
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,281
The doctor in charge is Xia Chu.

119
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:21,261
You take the 3D projection equipment
and come to Mi Gu's house.

120
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:22,920
Then meet me at the hospital.

121
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:41,878
Rao Zhi.

122
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:43,551
Where is he?

123
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:44,472
He is sent to the ward.

124
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,536
This is a sample of blood
collected from his body.

125
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,655
Send it to the technical team
for examination immediately.

126
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,576
Yes.

127
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,359
Is there anything else on him?

128
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:53,553
Nothing for the time being.

129
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,169
Dr. Xia.

130
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:00,383
Officer Rao.

131
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:01,584
How is he?

132
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,178
His health is very frail now,
he needs to rest.

133
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:05,936
Can I take him back?

134
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:06,968
Now?

135
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,266
I'm afraid you can't.

136
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,025
Here's the thing.

137
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,865
A fisherman filed a
report yesterday.

138
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:14,665
Saying that the fishing boat
he had moored...

139
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:16,266
at Xiangsheng Shipyard
for repair was stolen.

140
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,592
It's similar to
the boat we found on the island.

141
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,906
I wish to take him back
to cooperate with the investigation.

142
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:24,152
Since we can't take him back,

143
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:26,162
can I ask him a few questions right now?

144
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,512
Wait a little longer.

145
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,200
He is in a coma now.

146
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,090
I'm afraid he can't
answer your questions.

147
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:32,335
Dr. Xia.

148
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:34,096
Listen to the doctor.

149
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:36,775
Thanks for understanding.

150
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:40,264
You and Xiao Qiang stay here.

151
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:42,120
Inform me immediately if he's awake.

152
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,041
Yes!

153
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,546
You've worked hard, Mu Ze.

154
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:47,016
It's my job, Rao Zhi.

155
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,226
We'll head back to the camp
if there's nothing else.

156
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:51,400
Okay.

157
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,961
We're going to the island.

158
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,520
-Let's go together.
-Okay.

159
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:08,720
Okay, I'll be right there!

160
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:10,906
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

161
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,480
Get going, I'm fine.

162
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,160
I'll be right there!

163
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:16,000
Why do you help?

164
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,777
This is the time for
our captain to show himself.

165
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,370
What's your involvement there?

166
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,226
Don't you think you're an extra?

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,920
Thank you.

168
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,208
Why aren't you leaving?

169
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,641
I'm about to leave.

170
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,586
Right, the...

171
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,585
About the patient, I tell you...

172
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,506
No matter what,
I have to get him cured.

173
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,466
Only then he can promptly cooperate
with the police investigation.

174
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,466
I believe in your
professional judgment.

175
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,184
What I mean is,

176
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,465
that patient is suspicious.

177
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:50,359
So be wary when you treat him,

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,280
understand?

179
00:10:53,296 --> 00:10:54,176
I understand.

180
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll leave first.

181
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:57,521
Wait.

182
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,529
Follow me.

183
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,080
Take it.

184
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,001
What is this?

185
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:17,217
Cherry paste.

186
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,112
You made it?

187
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,350
I was so busy in the last few days.

188
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,591
I've wanted to give it to you.

189
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,040
Remember to put it in
the fridge and eat it.

190
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:28,791
Okay.

191
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,392
Who else did you make it for?

192
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:34,225
You only bought a few cherries.

193
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,256
They were only enough for one jar.

194
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,505
Making you one jar is already good.

195
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,426
Who else can I give it to?

196
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:43,512
Okay.

197
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,200
Dr. Xia, I'm going.

198
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,666
You messed up my hair.

199
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:10,480
Xia Jun, get off.

200
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,542
Get off.

201
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,253
Dr. Zhang, thank you
for sending us back.

202
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,397
It's right on my way.

203
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:17,954
Moreover, I want to
come here to buy a few books.

204
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:20,318
(Passer-by Bookstore)

205
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,824
How about this? Xiao Jun,

206
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,151
you bring Dr. Zhang in.

207
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,367
I'll go get some food.

208
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,408
We haven't eaten yet.

209
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,000
Open the door, young man.

210
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,072
Do you like my mother?

211
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:41,986
Why do you suddenly
ask me this question?

212
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:43,632
Do you?

213
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,402
I do.

214
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,313
Will you marry her?

215
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,319
Will you?

216
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,423
I don't know that yet.

217
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:02,262
You are a coward, Dr. Zhang.

218
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:04,128
I hate cowards.

219
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:05,912
So does my mother.

220
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:08,752
Don't come here to buy books anymore.

221
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,113
Why are you still standing here?
Go on in.

222
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,776
It suddenly occurs to me
that I have to drop by the hospital.

223
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:23,832
Or I'll come again when I have
plenty of time.

224
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,525
That's okay, too.
Go ahead.

225
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,206
Okay.

226
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:29,905
Goodbye.

227
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:30,855
Do you want to take some food?

228
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:31,776
Never mind, thank you.

229
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:35,864
Slow down.

230
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,790
What's wrong?

231
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,792
Didn't you sleep on
the island last night?

232
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,669
I took a nap at dawn.

233
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,830
I didn't dare to sleep deep.

234
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:36,312
Just go.

235
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:39,337
Why?

236
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:40,784
I'll help you with the rest of it.

237
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:43,479
What's with the response?

238
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,217
With your current state of mind,

239
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:47,103
there's no way for you
to work the night shift.

240
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:49,736
Everyone will be in trouble if any
medical accident happens.

241
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,240
But the duty roster is arranged.

242
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,742
It's okay.

243
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,303
I'll inform Dr. Zhang.

244
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,226
He knows your situation too.

245
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:03,637
Are you leaving or not?

246
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
Deal.

247
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:10,968
Thank you.

248
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:44,762
You're finally back before
the living room explodes.

249
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:08,280
Liang Shao Xue, are you still alive?

250
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:11,721
I'm alive.

251
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:14,056
I'm eating snacks and drinking Werdery.

252
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,960
I digest while I eat.

253
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:17,711
I'm alive and well.

254
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:21,305
Since you're alive,

255
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,026
then get up and clean this pigsty up!

256
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,272
Then you just consider me dead!

257
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:34,517
Carry me.

258
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:37,360
The floor is too dirty.
I can't touch it with my paws.

259
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:56,520
You want to die, is that it?

260
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:59,026
Okay, I'll give you what you want.

261
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,439
Just as Pao Ding butchered his cow
in ancient times,

262
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,112
today, I'll stab you with my knife.

263
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,190
Say no more.

264
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,182
I'll stab you 81 times.

265
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:10,975
The bad guy must die.

266
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:16,774
This silly girl's
brainwave killing method...

267
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,254
has improved yet again.

268
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:24,872
Liang Shao Xue, aren't you dead?

269
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:26,222
What is this?

270
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,222
It's my Moments.

271
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:32,823
And what is the content?

272
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,089
It's the brigade's New Year party.

273
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,720
It is OK!

274
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,600
It is OK! It's my OK!

275
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,207
No. This...

276
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,032
Tian Yong found it.

277
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,647
It's the brigade's mascot.

278
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:51,383
Darn it!

279
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:54,926
Where are you going?

280
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:55,866
None of your business!

281
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:00,065
Whatever!

282
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:16,199
Look.

283
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,040
That girl has been hanging around
the door for more than ten minutes.

284
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,057
Comrade, withdraw
from the cordon!

285
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,138
Let me handle this.

286
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,263
Give me back my OK!

287
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,399
Report!

288
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,430
Report!

289
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:14,655
Come in!

290
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,736
-Captain!
-What's the matter?

291
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,608
Someone tried to break the checkpoint
but was stopped by the lieutenant.

292
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,186
Any identification on her?

293
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,427
-Your sister.
-Who?

294
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,320
Your little sister.

295
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,718
-Don't stop me!
-This is a military camp.

296
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,654
Stop messing around.

297
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,639
-I want to go in and find OK.
-Stop messing around!

298
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,880
OK!

299
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,109
-I'm here to pick you up!
-Loud noise is forbidden!

300
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,990
I warn you! Do not make noise!

301
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:48,445
Xue!

302
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,960
Let go!

303
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:54,760
Let go!

304
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,292
How old are you?
You still bite?

305
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:01,154
-Let me see.
-I'm fine. I'm really fine.

306
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,359
-Apologize!
-No!

307
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,360
Apologize!

308
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:05,321
Never mind.

309
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,242
-Apologize!
-I'm fine, captain, forget it.

310
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:08,447
Forget it.

311
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,535
Get yourself to the infirmary.

312
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:13,263
It's not a big deal.
I don't need to go to the infirmary.

313
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,960
Follow me!

314
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:19,623
Hurry up!

315
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,480
What's going on?

316
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:26,197
Are you okay?

317
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:30,386
Hurry up!

318
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:32,301
This girl is ridiculous.

319
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,397
Guardees are sacred and inviolable!

320
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:39,250
Didn't you see the
words in front of the door?

321
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,654
I didn't see them.
I didn't even see the camp's gate.

322
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,735
This is common sense!

323
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:46,354
Listen, you were lucky it was Tian Yong.

324
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:47,635
Otherwise, you would've been shot.

325
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,953
Right, I have no common sense!

326
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,336
No one taught me that!

327
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,185
Not only that, I'm ill-bred,

328
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:54,360
rude, and out of control.

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,427
All because my parents
weren't around to raise me.

330
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:58,348
Shut up!

331
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:00,465
And you! Let me tell you,

332
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,374
one of them is busy
traveling and socializing,

333
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:04,774
the other is busy solving cases.

334
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:09,056
I don't mean as much as
a golf club, a snowboard,

335
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:11,480
a case, or a criminal to them!

336
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:14,800
-Xue.
-Right.

337
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,959
What were you doing at
the night of New Year's Day?

338
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:19,426
I was in the camp.

339
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:20,957
Right.

340
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,118
You threw a party at the camp.

341
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,800
You invited Xia Chu
but you didn't invite me.

342
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:27,130
Of course.

343
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:29,760
A party for the elders like this,
I wouldn't come too if you asked me.

344
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,680
But you didn't ask me a thing.

345
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm sad about it too.

346
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:36,880
Liang Mu Ze.

347
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,401
Xue, it was remiss of
me not to invite you.

348
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:40,557
But I didn't invite Xia Chu.

349
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:41,878
She was here to work.

350
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:44,880
No one loves me anyway.

351
00:21:45,144 --> 00:21:48,400
No one likes me anyway!

352
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,800
Everyone hates me!

353
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,066
-Report!
-Come in!

354
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,009
OK!

355
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,060
How's your hand?

356
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,325
It's fine.

357
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,940
Really, it's fine.

358
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,348
So this is your parrot.

359
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:18,887
Right, the one I adopted.

360
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,528
I told you that, you forgot it again?

361
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,646
That animal assisted therapist?

362
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,805
Yes.

363
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,213
Are you sure?

364
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,040
I just got a call from
the Forestry Bureau.

365
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,280
They contacted an animal
adoption agency in Ningjiang.

366
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,240
The headquarters of this agency
is based in the United States.

367
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:34,920
They cooperate with
the University Hospital...

368
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,440
through some charities...

369
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,031
to provide specialized animal
escort service for the needy.

370
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,537
Right, I applied to adopt it.

371
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:42,818
My healing partner.

372
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,327
Are the procedures of
the agency complete?

373
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,368
They are complete.

374
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,760
I've checked with the Forestry Bureau
and the Forest Police.

375
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,987
I contacted the head
of the agency as well.

376
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:54,120
The information they gave matched.

377
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:56,856
They gave me permission
to hand this parrot over to her.

378
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:58,113
Okay, then.

379
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,240
The wise ancestors are long gone,
there is no future emperor in sight.

380
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:08,483
Across the vast land I sing this song,
weeping alone for my sad plight.

381
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:18,078
What did it say?

382
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,560
This is a poem...

383
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,039
by Tang Dynasty poet,
Chen Zi Ang. "Song..."

384
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,470
-"Song of the Youzhou Exile."
-Right.

385
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:27,973
You knew it too!

386
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:29,294
Did you guys teach it?

387
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:30,681
He taught it.

388
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,908
What is this?

389
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,960
This is not my bird!

390
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,130
Report!

391
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:46,263
Captain, I'll leave first
if there's nothing else.

392
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:47,477
Come back!

393
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,544
Keep an eye on her.
I'll go look for the Brigade Commander.

394
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:50,960
-Captain!
-This is an order!

395
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,640
I hate you guys!

396
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:12,576
You want to take a leave?

397
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,507
Yes.

398
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:14,428
What's wrong?

399
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:15,840
My cousin is here.

400
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:16,761
I need to send her back.

401
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:19,360
How old is she?

402
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:20,426
Is she mobility-impaired?

403
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,160
Why must you send her?

404
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:24,074
Let me tell you, Liang Mu Ze.

405
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,619
The camp is not your house!

406
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,091
You come and go as you wish
all day long.

407
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:30,620
Are you a citizen or a soldier?

408
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,910
Right.

409
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:37,281
Was it your cousin who fought the sentry
at Gate One?

410
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,339
Yes.

411
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:40,760
She knows nothing.
I already lectured her.

412
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:41,681
I can understand

413
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:42,712
that she knows nothing.

414
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,600
But you, as a military officer,

415
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,920
should know the confidentiality and
safety regulations of the brigade.

416
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:51,880
Can people who returned from overseas
like them casually enter the barracks?

417
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:53,787
Where is she now?

418
00:24:54,346 --> 00:24:55,546
She is at my place.
Tian Yong is keeping an eye on her.

419
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,546
Isn't Tian Yong supposed be on duty?

420
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
Is he a bodyguard?

421
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:00,476
Tian Yong is off duty.

422
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:01,709
It won't do either!

423
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,480
-Quickly send her back!
-Yes!

424
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:10,392
Ridiculous!

425
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:19,418
Are you done?

426
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,680
You did all the good things.

427
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:25,320
My brother would have told me off
if I didn't distract him by crying.

428
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:32,417
Does your hand still hurt?

429
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:33,588
It's fine.

430
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,280
Really? Then I'll bite it again.

431
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,417
That won't be necessary.

432
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,743
I'm just kidding.
Why are you so nervous?

433
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:44,664
You're boring.

434
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,000
Why did you adopt a parrot?

435
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:03,560
It's none of your business.

436
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:06,919
If you're sick, I think you...

437
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
It's you who are sick
and your family too!

438
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,080
Sorry, I...

439
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:13,961
I didn't mean it.

440
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:16,562
I just want to express my concern.

441
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,643
I don't need your concern.
I have no shortage of love.

442
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:26,720
Then why did you adopt this parrot?

443
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:28,000
Are you done?

444
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,240
You're nagging like the Longevity Monk!

445
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:31,122
You can't say that.

446
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:32,800
The Longevity Monk is
a monk and I'm a soldier.

447
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:36,320
You haven't taken your parrot.

448
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't want it, you can have it!

449
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,360
Didn't you come here for it?

450
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:42,270
The OK I'm looking for is
a parrot that can talk smack with me.

451
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,591
It's obvious that this is not the one.

452
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,264
Cursing is not chatting.

453
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:48,320
-Why do you care?
-I don't.

454
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,311
I'm just reminding you

455
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:50,800
that cursing is not chatting.

456
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,641
Are you done? You're so annoying!

457
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:57,223
You can't leave until
your brother comes back.

458
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,344
Okay, I won't leave.

459
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:25,282
Who will talk with you?

460
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,755
What?

461
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
I'm thinking...

462
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,513
who will talk with you,

463
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
if you leave it here?

464
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,680
Won't you feel lonely?

465
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,466
The...

466
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,680
What...

467
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:13,958
Thank you.

468
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:19,005
What do you mean?

469
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:22,417
Thank you

470
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,680
for asking me such a question.

471
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:32,834
The clinical laboratory has confirmed...

472
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,920
that the victim who was hospitalized
was the fugitive, Gui.

473
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,240
He was involved in a
drug-trafficking case.

474
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,160
The whereabouts of the drugs
had yet to be found.

475
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:41,320
Team 1 is going to
the hospital to back Li Lei up.

476
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:43,160
Li Lei, Xiao Qiang,

477
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,111
keep an eye on the suspect.
Take a look over there.

478
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:46,317
Sun Xiao Mo, take Team 2 and
search the island with me.

479
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,400
Everyone, stay safe.

480
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:48,401
Do not miss any clues.

481
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,462
The family of patient in bed number 16.

482
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,647
They are not here. We're in charge.

483
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,679
Take this receipt...

484
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,790
and go to the
radiology department downstairs...

485
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:04,271
to make an appointment for the patient's
afternoon X-ray examination.

486
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:07,233
It's invalid.

487
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,526
Invalid?

488
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,549
It can't be found in the system.

489
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,670
We can't make an appointment for you.

490
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,080
Come back after you ask the doctor.

491
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:18,491
Thank you.

492
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:34,960
Xiao Qiang! Xiao Qiang! Wake up!

493
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:36,000
Xiao Qiang!

494
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,440
Where is he?

495
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:44,200
Doctor.

496
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,080
It's the doctor.

497
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:12,000
Xiao Xiao, what's wrong?

498
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,360
Xia Chu, the patient
in bed number 13 is missing.

499
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:16,281
What?

500
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:18,489
How is Xiao Qiang?
Is he all right?

501
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,009
Have the backup reached?

502
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:23,800
I got it.

503
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:25,642
Immediately notify
the Traffic Control Center...

504
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:26,912
to block the roads out of the town.

505
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:28,920
You guys stay put
and wait for our further information.

506
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:30,728
Okay.

507
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:33,640
Something happened in the hospital.

508
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:34,561
The suspect was kidnapped.

509
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,680
Who did that?

510
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:38,243
It's not known.

511
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:40,893
He was taken away alive.

512
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:42,659
It's mostly about the drugs.

513
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:46,880
Seems like the drugs we confiscated
last time during the medical forum...

514
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,880
was only a part of it.

515
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:51,836
We can find the person
if we find the supply.

516
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:54,680
So far,

517
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:55,800
nothing has been found.

518
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:58,251
Where did they hide the drugs?

519
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,768
Where's the boat?

520
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,960
It's been sent to
Xiangsheng Shipyard for repair.

521
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,321
Notify Li Lei and the others
to meet us at Xiangsheng Shipyard.

522
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,440
Yes.

523
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,233
Who is he? Do you recognize him?

524
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,040
The patient's drainage tube
wasn't extubated yet.

525
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:30,880
Right.

526
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,210
Where were they going?

527
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,320
He didn't even want his life.

528
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,965
What's wrong?

529
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,000
He wanted to extubate when he
woke up. Don't move!

530
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,080
Do you think the police can find him?

531
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:57,080
Will they hold us
accountable if they can't find him?

532
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:03,283
-Where are you going?
-Look for the patient.

533
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,050
Is Tian Yong married?

534
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:11,882
Does he have children?

535
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:14,096
What does he like to do?

536
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,897
What is his zodiac?
What is his blood type?

537
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,386
Does he snore when he sleeps
or smack his lips when he eats?

538
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:26,871
Two things.

539
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:28,800
Liang Shao Xue might be heading
to your camp.

540
00:32:30,268 --> 00:32:31,868
I know that, I'm sending her back.

541
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,577
And about the fishing boat last night.

542
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:37,800
Did the officer in charge say
it'll be sent back to the shipyard?

543
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,487
Yes.

544
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:41,230
Do you still remember
the name of the shipyard?

545
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,760
Why do you ask this?

546
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:44,880
Hurry up and tell me.

547
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:47,288
Xiangsheng Shipyard.

548
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:49,566
Why? Do you want to go there?

549
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:50,487
Xiangsheng Shipyard?

550
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,689
Driver, to Xiangsheng Shipyard.

551
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,760
Why do you want to go there?

552
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,520
Brother, I'm asking you
about Tian Yong's birthday.

553
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,161
Quickly tell me.

554
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:09,600
This is not the way back home.

555
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:21,635
Where is the thing?

556
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:27,680
The thing
was discovered by the police.

557
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,482
It was confiscated.

558
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:38,920
Where is it?

559
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:48,564
It's in the secret compartment...

560
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,128
Don't kill me. Listen to me.

561
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,899
I found a channel.
I have another investor.

562
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,320
(Beware of falling objects)

563
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,671
Watch your step.

564
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:49,835
Slow down.

565
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:51,557
Officer,

566
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:53,958
I found the gauze
covered with blood over here.

567
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,939
Xiao Mo, Lei Zi,

568
00:35:08,257 --> 00:35:09,400
take everyone to search everywhere.

569
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,761
Yes, let's go.

570
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,560
Let's sell it and make money together.

571
00:35:35,314 --> 00:35:36,720
It's better than following Old Master.

572
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:40,200
Don't you want to
get rid of Old Master?

573
00:35:41,298 --> 00:35:46,160
Zhuo Ran, I know that
you let me go on purpose at the hotel.

574
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,579
You want to join forces with me and

575
00:35:48,844 --> 00:35:49,844
take down Old Master, right?

576
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,000
How is it?

577
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:57,921
Not found.

578
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:00,930
Chief,

579
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:02,051
try to think.

580
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,388
Is there any
secluded spot in your shipyard?

581
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,913
Anyway, I found these gauzes over here.

582
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:10,273
Other places...

583
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,200
Right.

584
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:14,081
Did you check the watertight
compartment of the boat?

585
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,080
Watertight compartment?

586
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,560
Usually, a bulk carrier
has double-layered bilge and walls.

587
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:23,621
The space between the two layers
serves as a watertight compartment,

588
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,618
a food storage, and a fuel storage...

589
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:28,480
while maintaining the stability
and buoyancy of the ship.

590
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:29,751
But this watertight compartment...

591
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:30,960
can be easily changed
into a secret compartment.

592
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:34,320
Those unlawful boatmen
will hide the seabirds...

593
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:38,198
they captured on the island
and some smuggled goods in it.

594
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,680
-Where is the boat?
-Boat?

595
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,440
The boat is at the
new shipyard over there.

596
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:43,408
Let's go to the new shipyard.

597
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,491
Let's go. I'll take you there.

598
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:46,760
It's about a mile away.

599
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,826
What I said was true.

600
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:54,483
Zhuo Ran,

601
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:57,881
I can cooperate with you.

602
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,785
Please trust me.

603
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:01,561
Don't kill me.

604
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,400
Sang Kun didn't believe that...

605
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:08,811
the one who wanted him dead
was his own brother.

606
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:10,977
For that alone,

607
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:12,926
you shall die.

608
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:18,655
No!

609
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:21,616
You can't kill me...

610
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,668
Zhuo Ran.

611
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:28,920
Old Master has never wanted
to cure your mother's illness.

612
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:32,640
He has been
using your mother to control you.

613
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:34,316
And...

614
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:36,008
And

615
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:38,434
do you know how your father died?

616
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,963
I know.

617
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,297
Old Master told my brother.

618
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:50,000
I know
it was my fault to set my brother up.

619
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:51,227
I deserve to die.

620
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:52,698
But what about you?

621
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,573
Aren't you the same as me?

622
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:56,880
You're a betrayer too.

623
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:01,266
Do you want to know the truth?

624
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:02,699
Do you?

625
00:38:03,018 --> 00:38:04,178
Tell me, do you?

626
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,440
Let me go.

627
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:10,381
Then I'll tell you how
your father died.

628
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,942
Do you want to know the truth?

629
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:14,669
How did your father die?

630
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:34,986
This is an order from Old Master.

631
00:38:39,148 --> 00:38:40,298
We need to evacuate now.

632
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:48,979
The thumb.

633
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,460
It sounds like a gunshot just now.

634
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:18,531
Follow me!

635
00:39:22,131 --> 00:39:24,160
Break it up! Be safe!

636
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:25,703
Rao Zhi!

637
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
How is it?

638
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:21,801
Just finished asking.

639
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:30,953
You go ahead.

640
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,072
You said you were here
to look for your patient?

641
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:40,864
Yes.

642
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,290
How did you know he
was going to come here?

643
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:50,190
I remember his reaction
when I was reviving him.

644
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:53,258
I guess he will be here.

645
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:56,146
Can you tell me
what his reaction was?

646
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,857
He refused to leave after he woke up.

647
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,486
His eyes fixed in the direction
of the secret compartment...

648
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:02,680
and he wanted to
reach out his hand to it.

649
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:07,280
I guess it must be something
important to him hiding in there.

650
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:09,722
So he'll definitely return
and look for it.

651
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:16,799
How is it?

652
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,742
What's the situation on
the secret compartment?

653
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:20,170
We managed to open it
but nothing was found inside.

654
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,891
Someone might have transferred
its contents.

655
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:23,636
Rao Zhi.

656
00:41:23,924 --> 00:41:26,200
There were no signs of struggle
at the scene or on the body itself.

657
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:29,431
Our preliminary findings
suggests that is it possible,

658
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:30,872
that he caused his own death.

659
00:41:31,378 --> 00:41:32,538
But he was seriously injured.

660
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:35,272
It was impossible for him to
come here alone from the hospital.

661
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:37,316
So, further evidence
collection is needed to...

662
00:41:37,357 --> 00:41:38,877
confirm whether it was suicidal.

663
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,550
This is the evidence bag.

664
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:47,233
This gun is made of plastic.

665
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:51,738
A plastic gun?

666
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,840
It was 3D printed, right?

667
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,241
Why are you here?

668
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:02,204
Xue went to the camp
to find me.

669
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:04,280
I was sending her home
and decided to drop by.

670
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:05,960
Mu Ze,

671
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:07,880
you said this is a...

672
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:09,161
3D printed gun.

673
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:11,274
3D printed gun?

674
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:12,774
Have you seen it before?

675
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:18,550
Didn't my medicine get changed
to the 3D printed one?

676
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,479
So I did lots of research...

677
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,640
and read many materials about
3D printing technology.

678
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:24,520
Like this kind of gun,

679
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:26,201
it can only be made by 3D printing.

680
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,400
So I suspect...

681
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:29,321
Liang Mu Ze,

682
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:32,043
I don't want to hear it now.

683
00:42:33,265 --> 00:42:34,360
I want to leave for a while.

684
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,249
I need to be alone, can I?

685
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,147
Where are you going?
I'll give you a ride.

686
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,530
Never mind.

687
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,488
-Then I'll leave with Xue.
-I don't want to leave.

688
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:53,547
What do you want?
Uncle Rao is busy.

689
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,177
What are you doing?

690
00:42:56,218 --> 00:42:57,104
Just do his job.

691
00:42:57,145 --> 00:42:58,400
I'm not here to watch him work.

692
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:07,794
Xue,

693
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:10,281
it's getting late.

694
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:11,768
Go back with your brother.

695
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:13,680
I don't want to!
I want to stay here!

696
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,247
Don't try to get rid of me!

697
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:45,543
(Liang Mu Ze)

698
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,875
Our preliminary findings
suggests that it is possible,

699
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,396
that he caused his own death.

700
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:42,481
The first thing you do
when you're in danger is run, get it?

701
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,418
Liang Mu Ze!

702
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,480
Liang Mu Ze!

703
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:30,934
Xia Chu!

704
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,599
Let me go! Don't come near me!

705
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,520
It's me!

706
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:42,121
Are you hurt?

707
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:51,240
I'm here, don't be afraid.

708
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,801
Don't be afraid. It's fine.

709
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:57,040
I'm here, don't be afraid.

710
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:02,109
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

711
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:06,862
It's fine. There, there.
