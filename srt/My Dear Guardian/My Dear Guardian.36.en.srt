00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,280
He got high on anaesthesia.

4
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,789
He is talking nonsense.

5
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,688
He is talking nonsense.
But you feel happy after hearing it.

6
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,969
Who's talking nonsense?

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,442
I'm Sailor Moon.

8
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:56,688
In the name of the Moon, I'll punish you!

9
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:59,775
Oh, my.
Isn't this Sailor Moon's catchphrase?

10
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:03,656
I can't believe I'm hearing this
from a special forces soldier.

11
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:04,786
Did you teach him that?

12
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,417
No. I...

13
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:07,549
No.

14
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,231
Sailor Moon is a couple gift from her.

15
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,880
Liang Mu Ze.

16
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:17,135
A set of Sailor Moon bed sheet.

17
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,957
Liang Mu Ze, keep quiet.

18
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,354
Bed sheet?

19
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,825
-No.
-You don't need to explain it.

20
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:24,985
Your dad is here.

21
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,298
He's waiting at the door.

22
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:30,287
What are you doing? Just go.

23
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:32,802
Check his body temperature.

24
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,446
His face was hot just now.

25
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:36,217
Xia Chu.

26
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,905
Xia Chu.

27
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:40,982
Xia Chu.

28
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,049
I love you.

29
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,514
Stop it. Captain Liang.

30
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,868
Let me check your body temperature.

31
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,166
Where did you come from?

32
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,996
I came from my mother's womb.

33
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,165
Why did you come here?

34
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,706
What do you think?

35
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:38,654
After receiving the call from your unit,
I was frightened.

36
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,912
So I asked your grandpa to contact
the leader at your war zone.

37
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:45,437
When I heard that you're safe
and have completed the exercise,

38
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,528
I came to see you immediately.

39
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,004
You asked Grandpa for help?

40
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,573
It's all because of you.

41
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:57,554
I can do everything for you.

42
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,307
So...

43
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,839
Does Mum know about it?

44
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,331
I dare not tell her.

45
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,874
Although I normally do things slowly,

46
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,586
when a big problem occurs,
I am very clear-headed.

47
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:17,251
I've informed your grandpa.

48
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,845
So she won't know about this.

49
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,255
Don't worry.

50
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,452
I'm sorry, Dad.

51
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:36,942
You have your own life.

52
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:40,352
I can't make decisions for you.

53
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:45,642
But you have to think carefully about it.

54
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,392
I've thought about it.

55
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,202
However...

56
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:53,502
However?

57
00:04:56,142 --> 00:05:00,924
If I don't become a great doctor...

58
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:03,584
who makes history,

59
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,397
will you be disappointed?

60
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:26,537
I have overcome
many difficulties in life.

61
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:28,953
So many.

62
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:31,928
To me,

63
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,108
I only have one most important
masterpiece.

64
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:38,139
And that is you.

65
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:44,575
So since the day you were born,

66
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,733
no matter what job you do,

67
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:50,053
be it a success or failure,

68
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:53,495
my answer remains the same.

69
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,330
I want to join Liang Mu Ze
at his outpost.

70
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,826
Life is short.

71
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:21,137
I hope you will be happy.

72
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,659
Life can be long too.

73
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:26,753
So you must find carefully...

74
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:30,114
the one who will be your life partner.

75
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:33,420
But don't worry about making mistakes.

76
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:36,731
Dad and Mum will always be with you.

77
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:38,221
Got it?

78
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:41,886
Yes.

79
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:45,757
Thank you, Dad.

80
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,565
I will be very happy.

81
00:06:56,062 --> 00:07:00,592
The moon is lingering...

82
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,012
-Brigade Commander.
-Don't sit up.

83
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:10,122
Just lie down.

84
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,549
Are you okay?

85
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:16,995
I'm okay.

86
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,956
I had some allergies.

87
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,039
I'm fine now.

88
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:22,532
What about you?

89
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,807
I'm fine. I just had a few stitches.

90
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:26,543
Good to hear that.

91
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,798
Actually...

92
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:34,904
the command post told me
that the foreigner who got caught...

93
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,628
mentioned about Tian Yong.

94
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:45,650
This is the photo given by the police.

95
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,092
It's confirmed that he is the commander.

96
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:56,612
What's the matter?

97
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,014
Do you know him?

98
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,090
His name is Zhuo Ran.

99
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,671
He's Xia Chu's first love.

100
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,796
He was missing since 18 years old.

101
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,536
He just came back
to the country this year.

102
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:08,487
You're right.

103
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,315
When he was missing,

104
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,542
he was using another identity.

105
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:16,423
He was in the military
and have been at war.

106
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,960
He's the most valuable mercenary
in the world right now.

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,381
One of the representatives
in the foreign armed forces...

108
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,307
is a former comrade in arms.

109
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,650
What is his other name?

110
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:28,994
Pei Yu.

111
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,598
You're not the first one
who said that I'm lucky.

112
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,830
Who else?

113
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,505
He was not a comrade in arms.

114
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:37,890
Before you,

115
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,667
he was my only failure.

116
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,781
Who is this guy?

117
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:54,677
Pei Yu.

118
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:04,639
The higher-ups gave order...

119
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,520
to have liaison between the police
and the military for a full search.

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,821
Is there any news?

121
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:10,978
As of now,

122
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:14,145
we are stepping up the search.

123
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:18,238
Your mission is to focus on recovery.

124
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:34,183
Miss Mi Gu, I have received
the amended proposal.

125
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:36,185
What shall we do next?

126
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,170
-Mi Gu.
-Do you have 10 thousand RMB?

127
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,552
I'm doing a business with my friends.

128
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,345
I still need some money
to join the partnership.

129
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,865
You must help your brother.

130
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:45,743
Call him before weekend.

131
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:48,818
Help him to achieve his dream
to start a business.

132
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:50,628
Miss Mi Gu, are you feeling better?

133
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,704
Mi Gu.

134
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:53,653
I found someone else
to manage your programme.

135
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:54,961
You take a rest at home.

136
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,208
I'm warning you.

137
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,768
Don't call me again!

138
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:26,802
Mi Gu.

139
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:31,362
Zhuo Ran?

140
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:37,492
Is that you?

141
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,867
Yes, it's me.

142
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,161
Did anyone follow you here?

143
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,015
No.

144
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:06,098
I have deleted
the address that you sent to me.

145
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,655
I've applied a long leave.

146
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,595
May I know the reason?

147
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,867
Let's go to the hospital.

148
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:54,125
Zhuo Ran.

149
00:13:58,742 --> 00:13:59,824
Zhuo Ran.

150
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:29,162
I'm cold.

151
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,042
I'm cold.

152
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:38,832
So cold.

153
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:40,882
I'm cold.

154
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:58,571
♪I'd like to find out♪

155
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:04,092
♪If my mask of foolishness♪

156
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:11,312
♪Could deceive you♪

157
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:15,672
♪I'm putting on my best performance♪

158
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:16,682
I'm cold.

159
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,609
Mum.

160
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,812
Why did you only take my brother with you?

161
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,452
You're unfair.

162
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,412
Are you going to abandon me?

163
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:42,692
Don't leave me.

164
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,012
Don't leave me.

165
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:47,482
Don't go.

166
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,562
Don't leave me here.

167
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,362
I won't go.

168
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,652
I won't leave you here.

169
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,162
I won't leave you here.

170
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:28,322
The Training Unit and Public Security
Bureau has confirmed his identity.

171
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,185
According to their analysis,

172
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,647
it's highly possible
that he came back to the city.

173
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,585
They have asked us
to do a thorough investigation.

174
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:38,808
Find out his whereabouts
as soon as possible.

175
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:39,963
Yes, sir.

176
00:16:40,862 --> 00:16:42,372
Unit One. Continue to track Tian Yong.

177
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:43,557
Unit Two, follow me.

178
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:44,676
Yes, sir.

179
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:49,991
Xia Chu.

180
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,228
Xia Chu.

181
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:53,463
Xia Chu, there is a problem.

182
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:56,035
Liang Mu Ze's condition is not good.
Go have a look.

183
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:12,947
Sir. How is he now?

184
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,571
He has high fever.

185
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,252
He also has indirect muscle spasms.

186
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:18,508
From my initial findings,

187
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,285
his wound is infected.

188
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:24,781
Infected?

189
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,317
I've taken his blood sample.

190
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,077
I will take it to the hospital
for testing.

191
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,361
Xia Chu. Don't stand there. Hurry up.

192
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,176
Xia Chu.

193
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,940
What?

194
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,591
Send him back to the hospital.

195
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,657
The condition here is not ideal.

196
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,753
Yes.

197
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,368
Let's do it together.

198
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,393
Don't worry, Commander Dong.

199
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:04,823
I will report Captain Liang's condition
to you.

200
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,244
Thank you, Xia Chu.

201
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,486
Dad, I'll get going.

202
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,629
Go.

203
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:16,416
Be careful.

204
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,375
According to the test results,

205
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,794
it should be
Acinetobacter Baumannii infection.

206
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:18,602
We have sent Liang Mu Ze
to the emergency room.

207
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:21,998
After several consultations,
we put on high dosage of sulbactam...

208
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,875
and combined with tigecycline.

209
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,521
We hope it can control
the bacteria in his body.

210
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,473
Is it controlled?

211
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,931
We are unable to confirm that now.

212
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:36,241
After some time,

213
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,710
we will do an analysis
of the bacteria in his body.

214
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,910
Only then,

215
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,207
will we know if the medicine is effective.

216
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:45,072
So...

217
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:47,360
If it is not effective,

218
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,415
what will happen?

219
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,663
We have prepared several plans.

220
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:55,903
If this doesn't work,
we will try another plan.

221
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,988
He should have changed jobs.

222
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,837
If he hadn't joined the exercise,
he wouldn't be injured.

223
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,371
His wound wouldn't have been infected too.

224
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:07,642
Enough.

225
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:08,888
You don't have to say it.

226
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:11,092
Sir.

227
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:13,346
Madam.

228
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,052
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:19,027
I didn't take good care of Mu Ze.

230
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:20,398
It's not your fault.

231
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,761
He's an adult.

232
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,967
He should be responsible
for his decision.

233
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:31,925
Liang Ren Dong.

234
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:34,044
You're so heartless.

235
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:43,046
Director Song.

236
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,015
Can we visit him?

237
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,527
His body is very weak now.

238
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,859
It's better not to enter the ward.

239
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:53,921
I understand.

240
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,748
We won't enter the ward.

241
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,789
We will look from outside.

242
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:01,944
Sure.

243
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,298
Xiao Xiao.

244
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:27,171
Did I wash my hands
before stitching the wound?

245
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,008
I don't remember.

246
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:37,535
I don't remember anything.

247
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:39,426
Of course, you don't remember it.

248
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:41,315
You don't have to remember it.

249
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,396
It's a classical conditioning
in every surgeon.

250
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,181
It's impossible that you will forget.

251
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,666
Please.

252
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,635
Don't be so paranoid.

253
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,322
They are still checking
why he was infected.

254
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:55,076
There is no conclusion yet.

255
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:58,017
Why do you take responsibility for that?

256
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:01,506
Do you want more conflicts to happen?

257
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:03,660
I...

258
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,059
Hello.

259
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:09,501
Xia Chu.

260
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:12,703
Director Chen wants you and Xiao Xiao
to come to the meeting room.

261
00:23:12,783 --> 00:23:13,894
Now?

262
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,060
Yes.

263
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:26,662
Sir, Xia Chu reports.

264
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,314
Come in.

265
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,640
Sir, are you looking for me?

266
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,892
Where is Xiao Xiao?

267
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,807
She was stopped by
the patient's family members.

268
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,161
She will be here soon.

269
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,842
Let's start.

270
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:48,271
Recently,

271
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:52,116
there have been
two surgical site infection cases.

272
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:55,346
It's caused by Acinetobacter Baumannii.

273
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:58,888
First patient, Liu Ran has passed away.

274
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:01,269
And now, the patient is Liang Mu Ze.

275
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:04,635
Currently, he is in the
emergency intensive care unit.

276
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,652
We are not sure what will happen.

277
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:10,089
If the first case was an accident,

278
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:15,882
then we have to take the
second case very seriously.

279
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:19,542
Today,

280
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:22,362
I have invited
all the resident doctors here...

281
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:26,901
not to criticise anyone
or to hold anyone accountable.

282
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:32,387
I just hope that we can gather
and listen to other's experiences...

283
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:33,866
in clinical treatment.

284
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:36,958
So that you may benefit
and improve yourself.

285
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:40,202
Xia Chu.

286
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:41,601
You go first.

287
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,239
You have dealt with both patients.

288
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:46,881
Especially Liang Mu Ze.

289
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:48,517
You stitched his wound.

290
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,082
What's your opinion about his infection?

291
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:04,030
Did you overlook anything
when you were treating him?

292
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:15,185
Xia Chu.

293
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,554
Mr Zhou is talking to you.

294
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:23,852
To be honest,

295
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,433
I have been asking myself this question
in the past two days.

296
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:29,148
Outdoor...

297
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,384
During war...

298
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,417
In that setting,

299
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,537
it may not be possible to achieve a
germ-free situation like in the hospital.

300
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:40,177
I'm worried that this happened
because of my careless mistake.

301
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:43,745
But it wasn't.

302
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,956
When I was treating Liang Mu Ze,
I am certain...

303
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,862
that I was very careful.

304
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:53,051
There wasn't any operational problem.

305
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,089
Sir, Xiao Xiao reports.

306
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:02,207
Come in.

307
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:04,728
Xiao Xiao.

308
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,748
You were at the site during the rescue.

309
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:09,539
Xiao Xiao.

310
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,758
What's your evaluation
on how Xia Chu treated the patient?

311
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:14,850
You witnessed the entire process.

312
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,761
You were the bystander.

313
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,170
Perhaps you saw other details.

314
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:23,532
All I can say is that
she was very serious...

315
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:24,963
but she wasn't calm.

316
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:29,182
I don't think this is
how a professional doctor...

317
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,182
should be when treating a patient.

318
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:52,841
So about the prevention
of Acinetobacter Baumannii,

319
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:55,481
do you have any opinion?

320
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:56,671
We can discuss.

321
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:57,982
Okay?

322
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,470
You knew what happened.

323
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,724
We just went through
a life-and-death situation.

324
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,067
Of course, I know.

325
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,178
That's why I asked if you could do it.

326
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,815
You said you can.

327
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,981
You insisted to stitch him up.

328
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:17,007
I understand
that you wanted to save him.

329
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:19,110
But you weren't calm, were you?

330
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:24,939
I thought we were friends.

331
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,489
I don't know what
your definition of a friend is.

332
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:30,971
I treat you as my friend.

333
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:34,503
That's why I want to tell you that
when you're facing this patient,

334
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,958
you personal feelings have taken over
your professional ethics.

335
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:43,215
When Mr Zhou asked me about my opinion,

336
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:45,535
I voiced out my intuition.

337
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:48,047
I didn't want to lie.

338
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:51,003
I didn't ask you to lie.
You just had to keep quiet.

339
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,730
Isn't this your forte?

340
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,297
I know you want to be
the chief resident doctor.

341
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:03,894
I never thought
that you would think that way too.

342
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:09,223
I never thought
that you would think that way.

343
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:29,026
Xia Chu.

344
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:38,942
Mr Zhang.

345
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,444
Are you busy now?

346
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:47,088
It's regarding Mu Ze's medical condition.

347
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,871
His condition is bad.

348
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:53,282
I really want to save him.

349
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,798
But I don't know what else I can do.

350
00:28:58,422 --> 00:29:00,402
Sir, please teach me.

351
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,362
Please teach me.

Dear Professor Ye Jun.

361
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,162
I apologise for contacting you
out of the blue...

362
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,412
I'm a doctor from Hospital 109
of the People's Liberation Army.

363
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,178
I tried calling your office phone number
but couldn't get through.

364
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:19,216
I've sent you an SMS
but you didn't reply.

365
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:22,127
I wonder
if you've received my previous email.

366
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,832
The patient's condition
is deteriorating.

367
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:27,963
He is starting to have septic shock.

368
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:31,402
He is in coma and has hallucinations.

369
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,631
These are signs of impending death.

370
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:42,838
Stay calm. Let's just wait.

371
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,750
I don't understand.

372
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,872
It's just bacteria.

373
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:54,538
Bacteria is found everywhere.

374
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,639
It's impossible
that it will take my son's life.

375
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:03,838
It has mutated
and become drug resistant.

376
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:08,387
All the antibiotics that we could get
don't work on him anymore.

377
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,203
Must you use antibiotics?

378
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,892
Can't you think of other methods?

379
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:15,772
Besides antibiotics,

380
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:18,732
I don't believe there's no other
method that can kill the bacteria.

381
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:20,002
Lower your voice.

382
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:23,609
Say something.

383
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:26,004
Aren't you doctors?

384
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:28,924
I'm sure you have other methods, right?

385
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,325
-Calm down.
-I can't.

386
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:34,737
Bacteriophage.

387
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,492
What is it?

388
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:41,587
Bacteriophage is bacteria's worst enemy.

389
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,377
It's a special group of virus...

390
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:47,556
that parasites on
selectively target bacteria or fungus...

391
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,756
and replicates within bacteria.

392
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:52,524
It eats and kill bacteria from inside.

393
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,055
It uses physical attack so there
isn't antibiotic resistance problem.

394
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,827
As long as we find
the relevant bacteriophage,

395
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:01,521
it can kill the Acinetobacter Baumannii
inside his body.

396
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:02,808
Impossible.

397
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,781
There are many types of bacteriophage.

398
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:06,814
How do we find it
in such a short period of time?

399
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:10,273
I've contacted Professor Ye Jun from
Ke Hua University's Biology Lab Center.

400
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:14,006
His lab
is doing research on phage therapy.

401
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:16,235
They have collected
many types of bacteriophage.

402
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,180
Moreover, Acinetobacter Baumannii
is on their research list.

403
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,887
He is willing to provide
the phage therapy plan.

404
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,715
Phage therapy?
We have thought about it too.

405
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:28,881
But it is not part of
mainstream medical practice.

406
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:32,411
The rise of antibiotics
has completely pushed it aside.

407
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:35,183
Even if you have this treatment plan,

408
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,783
you won't be able to get approval
from the department in charge.

409
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:40,355
We may face the risk of breaking the law.

410
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,518
Brigade Commander, Mr Dong Zhi Gang,

411
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:44,538
has submitted a request
to the higher-ups.

412
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:47,122
They will try their best
to talk to the department in charge,

413
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:48,622
and get a special arrangement.

414
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:52,315
What is the progress of the phage therapy
in their lab?

415
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,050
There is a successful case study.

416
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:55,652
How many cases?

417
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:58,664
One.

418
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:15,282
If the phage therapy has problems,

419
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:20,818
are we going to lose him forever?

420
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,362
Since he joined the military,

421
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:35,158
we have lost him.

422
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,630
It's not the same.

423
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,551
I know he is with the special forces.

424
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:43,250
Even though I didn't see him,
I felt ease.

425
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:47,139
I...

426
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,356
I dare not think about it.

427
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,406
I dare not.

428
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:11,874
Let's not do the phage therapy.

429
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:14,677
It's too risky.

430
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:18,975
Believe in him.

431
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:22,321
He will make his own choice.

432
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:42,135
Braised Egg.

433
00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:44,188
Can you put on a smile?

434
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:50,369
I've told you
that you look nice when you smile.

435
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:01,436
Now,

436
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:03,520
you must be suffering.

437
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:09,217
Memory cleared.

438
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,433
Do you feel better now?

439
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:19,900
Do you still remember?

440
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:23,312
When I was being held hostage,

441
00:35:24,902 --> 00:35:29,444
I was so scared and you said to me,

442
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,305
"Do you trust me?"

443
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:35,042
"I'm here..."

444
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,682
"so you will be fine".

445
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:43,798
This time,

446
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:46,609
I ask you to trust me.

447
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,202
I'm here.

448
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:51,572
You will be fine.

449
00:35:56,742 --> 00:35:58,082
As long as we are together,

450
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:02,202
there is no difficulty
that we can't overcome.

451
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,682
Liang Mu Ze, listen carefully.

452
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:21,722
During the treatment,

453
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:25,452
you might be in even more pain.

454
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:29,353
I'm afraid that this decision...

455
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,002
is just my wishful thinking.

456
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:39,914
If...

457
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,522
you want to give it a try,

458
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,092
please give me a sign.

I will make sure you're safe.

465
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:37,102
I've talked to my dad.

466
00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:39,253
He will use his network
in the medical field...

467
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,522
to convince
the heads of relevant department.

468
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:43,482
We hope to get the approval earlier.

469
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:45,402
How's the situation on your side?

470
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,732
Professor Ye Jun has successfully
grown phages.

471
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:50,423
The treatment is all set.

472
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:51,550
Once we get the approval,

473
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,310
we can carry out
the treatment immediately.

474
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:57,532
(Outpatient Department)

475
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,662
Noradrenaline. Add 30mcg per minute.

476
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:21,692
Atropine, 0.5mg.

477
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:23,214
-Prepare CPR.
-Yes.

478

Zhi Gang. How is it?

479
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,342
I got it.

480
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:34,595
Thank you for your hard work.

481
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:37,086
All right.

482
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:38,923
What did he say?

483
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,552
There is no result yet.

484
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:43,903
He plans to meet the higher-ups
to hurry them.

485
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,497
Sir, the first batch
of bacteriophage is here.

486
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,834
Leave it there.

487
00:40:53,262 --> 00:40:55,290
Perhaps
we still have to wait a little longer.

488
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,509
We can't wait anymore.

489
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,648
The patient's blood pressure, pulse
and oxygen saturation level is low.

490
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:01,928
After the shock, he is now unconscious.

491
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:05,027
If we wait longer,
he will suffer organ failure.

492
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:07,058
We must carry out the treatment now.

493
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,472
We have not received the approval yet.

494
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:11,953
Director Hao.

495
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:14,262
We have signed the consent form.

496
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:16,535
We stand firm on our decision.

497
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:20,114
No matter what the outcome is,
we will accept it.

498
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,609
We will not blame the hospital.

499
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,278
Look. Shall we give
him the medicine first?

500
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,543
Yes,

501
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,216
I understand your feelings.

502
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:42,800
But this treatment is special.

503
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:45,012
Without the approval from higher-ups.

504
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:46,191
I'm afraid...

505
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:47,200
Dr Hao.

506
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,881
Liang Mu Ze is having high fever again.

507
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:50,624
What?

508
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:53,649
Xia Chu.

509
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,658
Xia Chu, what are you doing?

510
00:41:55,738 --> 00:41:56,758
Xia Chu.

511
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,486
Xia Chu.

512
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,536
Dr Xia. Please leave for a moment.

513
00:42:28,222 --> 00:42:29,275
Xia Chu.

514
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,548
Open the door.

515
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,201
Xia Chu.

516
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:37,498
Xia Chu, open the door.

517
00:42:37,578 --> 00:42:38,652
Xia Chu.

518
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:40,100
What are you doing?

519
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:46,795
Xia Chu.

520
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,223
What are you doing?

521
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:49,918
Xia Chu.

522
00:42:50,398 --> 00:42:51,629
Open the door!

523
00:43:06,552 --> 00:43:07,442
Xia Chu.

524
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:13,799
Xia Chu.

525
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,949
Stop it!

526
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,095
What are you doing?

527
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:05,256
I will bear the consequences.

528
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:06,467
You...

529
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:11,109
Wait for your suspension letter.

530
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:20,682
