3
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,340
(Outpatient Department)

4
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,770
-What are you doing?
-I'm in the store.

5
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,789
What's up?

6
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,290
Nothing much.

7
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,430
I just got off from work,
and thought I'd call you.

8
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,450
Miss, how much for these books?

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,410
Hang on.

10
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,450
-Are you a member?
-Yes.

11
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,050
We have a four-for-80 promotion right now.

12
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,190
We accept digital payment.

13
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,510
Please come again.

14
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,949
How's business?

15
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,890
Pretty good.

16
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,170
By the way, I organised a reading session
at the store...

17
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,730
based on movies.

18
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,010
We had a pretty huge crowd.

19
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,280
The reception was fantastic.

20
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,350
The zodiac bookmarks I designed
sold pretty well, too.

21
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm thinking
of doing zodiac-themed hats,

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,640
socks, t-shirts, and the like.

23
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,050
What's your zodiac sign?

24
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,829
Wait, let me guess.

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,710
-It's...
-Meng Zhen.

26
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,640
Let's have a meal this weekend.

27
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,950
I'll come and fetch you and Xiao Jun.

28
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,560
What's the occasion?

29
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,030
I'd like to introduce you and Xiao Jun...

30
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,150
to my parents.

31
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,790
I want to announce to them...

32
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,270
that you're my lover.

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,350
Sure.

34
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,370
All right.

35
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,710
See you this weekend.

36
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,910
Xiao Jun.

37
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,050
Time for your medicine.

38
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,090
All done?

39
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,510
Mum.

40
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,330
Yes?

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,110
Actually, Zhang Yi Chi is all right.

42
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,600
Why are you telling me this?

43
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,910
He may not be athletic,

44
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,829
but he has a brilliant mind.

45
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,890
A woman should find a clever husband.

46
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,450
It'll save you a lot of trouble.

47
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,210
Who told you that?

48
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,530
It's true.

49
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,470
That's what Xuan Xuan said.

50
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,550
For her sake,

51
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,490
I must work hard
and become a smart person.

52
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,470
Good. You have my support.

53
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,370
So it doesn't have to be Daddy Liang?

54
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,009
Liang Mu Ze is my father.

55
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,650
Zhang Yi Chi is your husband.
There's no conflict.

56
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,780
What do you mean "husband?"

57
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,450
We're not even past first base.

58
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,730
What are you thinking
with that little head of yours?

59
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,390
About your happiness.

60
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,490
Okay.

61
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,970
I'll try my best to lead a happy life.

62
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,930
All right?

63
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,130
All right.

64
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,150
Good boy.

65
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,470
Dr Xia, I don't know
if I'll survive the infection.

66
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,230
But there's something I must tell you.

67
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,690
The truth is,

68
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,320
I regretted my decision
the moment I swallowed the pesticide.

69
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,830
I thought I would die for sure.

70
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,230
Thank you for not giving up.

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,870
You've prolonged my life.

72
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,970
I never was a brave person.

73
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,270
But my father's passing reminded me...

74
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,950
that I must live on.

75
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,110
Not just for myself,

76
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,990
but for the sacrifices he made for me.

77
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,200
This ordeal at the age of 18
was too painful.

78
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,070
Luckily, I was given a second chance.

79
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,410
The gentle breeze.

80
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,610
The warm sunlight.

81
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,130
The scent of foliage.

82
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,390
Even the most minute speckle of dust
makes me feel alive.

83
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,050
If even for one day...

84
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,720
One day is enough.

85
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,770
Dr Xia,

86
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,290
thank you.

87
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,670
Besides "thank you,"

88
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,210
I don't know what else to say.

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,750
Thank you.

90
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,870
I have no regrets.

91
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,910
Every patient steps into a hospital...

92
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,990
with the hopes of getting better.

93
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,410
And every doctor puts on her white coat...

94
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,950
with the belief that it is her duty
to cure them.

95
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,150
In the brutal struggle
between life and death,

96
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,590
the patient may be fragile,

97
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,550
but the doctor must be strong.

98
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,430
We fight against a common enemy,

99
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,310
licking our bleeding wounds
in our respective ways.

100
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,110
We seek victory,

101
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,630
but the possibility of defeat
is ever-present.

102
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,430
Life is full of vicissitudes.

103
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,290
In the face of the light,

104
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,110
what is victory?

105
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,870
One must keep living.

106
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,110
With courage, and passion.

107
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,830
Liu Ran passed away.

108
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,630
Have you met Old Master?

109
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,970
Does he know about the merchandise?

110
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,550
He knew the moment it happened.

111
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,790
And he didn't suspect you?

112
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,770
If I had done it,

113
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,330
I wouldn't have had the nerve to see him.

114
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,510
That's what he probably thought.

115
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,270
What's his next move?

116
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,590
He'll let me know when the time comes.

117
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,150
At least he hasn't shut me off.

118
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,050
That risky move,
whether for you or for me,

119
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,350
was the right move.

120
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,840
Whether it's the right move
doesn't depend on what you say...

121
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,630
but what you do.

122
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,650
I get it.

123
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,510
I'll cooperate with the cops
from here on out.

124
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,820
As long as I can save my mother.

125
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,420
Good.

126
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
How's your arm?

127
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,940
Commander!

128
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,760
It's still weak.

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,380
A further check-up is required.

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,380
Is that what the doctor said?

131
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,380
I feel I should get it checked.

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,970
Right. Go in the afternoon.

133
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,980
Yes, sir!

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,970
The rest of you,
go back and recalibrate.

135
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,830
Then assemble at the canteen for dinner.

136
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,600
Thank you, Commander!

137
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,270
Dismissed!

138
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,820
Tian Yong!

139
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,870
Tian Yong!

140
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,370
Tian Yong!

141
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,840
I knew it, you're back!

142
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,210
How did you know Tian Yong was back?

143
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,640
Tarot cards.

144
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,020
You can tell the future with tarot cards?

145
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,070
Of course.

146
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,150
Look. I have four cards here.

147
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,920
Each represents a question.

148
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,680
Where is Tian Yong?

149
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,260
What is Tian Yong doing?

150
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,960
When is Tian Yong coming back?

151
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,540
That's only three questions.

152
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,500
What's the last one?

153
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,790
Three and four are pretty much the same.

154
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,790
How are they the same?

155
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,130
They're both single digits.

156
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,910
Okay. Fine.

157
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,100
Let me ask you.

158
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,600
How did you know Tian Yong
was coming back today?

159
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,000
Well,

160
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,110
I held my breath,

161
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,150
closed my eyes,

162
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,390
and put my hands together.

163
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,790
Focusing my gaze on the card,

164
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,830
I asked my question.

165
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,240
The thoughts in my mind
coalesce in a confusion of magnetic waves.

166
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,020
Then suddenly,

167
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,270
I heard your wife
coming downstairs with a soldier's wife.

168
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,090
They said you were coming back today.

169
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,250
After all that hocus pocus,
turns out you got it from someone else?

170
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,590
What does it have to do with tarot cards?

171
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,740
Nothing.

172
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,670
Then why did you bring out
the tarot cards?

173
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,710
Foreshadowing.

174
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,190
It's a performance device
in ancient oral literature.

175
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,950
The tarot cards are meant
to arouse the audience's interest...

176
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,330
and serve as a prelude
to the main message.

177
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,480
You scared me.

178
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,490
Commander.

179
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,970
Quit talking nonsense.

180
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,580
What's it to you?

181
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,790
Easy there.

182
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,970
Are you injured?

183
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,940
-Keep an eye on her.
-Yes.

184
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,330
How did my brother get injured?

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,650
What do you think of my foreshadowing?

186
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,250
Don't hit your brother so hard next time.

187
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,570
Let's go.

188
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,000
Commander, I'll send her home right now.

189
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,090
Is it just me, or am I getting old?

190
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,970
I couldn't understand a word
your cousin was saying.

191
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,790
Oh, no. I don't get her, either.

192
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,080
Neither does the rest of my family.

193
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,470
Really?

194
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,300
You said Tian Yong
is not compatible with your cousin.

195
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,700
Indeed.

196
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,900
Tian Yong is an ancient literature buff.

197
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,990
If the two of them get together,

198
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,080
they'd have trouble communicating.

199
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,160
They're not right for each other.

200
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,150
Not necessarily, Commander.

201
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,530
Of all the ways youngsters
communicate today,

202
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,760
language is the least significant.

203
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,300
Really?

204
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,930
Isn't that a good thing?

205
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,330
Yeah.

206
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,370
I still don't get it.

207
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,160
Why are you still here?

208
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,850
To keep you company.

209
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,080
Don't you find the camp boring?

210
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,250
It is boring.

211
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,130
So why don't you go?

212
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,570
Because I want to keep you company.

213
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,190
This mission...

214
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,450
is very dangerous, isn't it?

215
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,500
No.

216
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,530
You're lying.

217
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,840
My brother hasn't had an injury in ages.

218
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,390
Did you guys...

219
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,440
kill someone?

220
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,400
What did it feel like?

221
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,450
"A hundred battles
have worn my armour down."

222
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,110
"Yet, I won't return
until the enemy is defeated."

223
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,680
Wang Chang Ling's...

224
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,520
"Conquering the Distant City,"

225
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,200
poem four of seven?

226
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,920
That's right.

227
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,010
You know something?

228
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,530
While you were gone,

229
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,800
I've been poring over that book
you gave me.

230
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,140
For a girl of 21,

231
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,720
memorising 300 Tang poems
is a great feat.

232
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,600
You've worked hard.

233
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,210
Then there's my AMBD.

234
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,170
What's that?

235
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,350
You know ADHD?

236
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,740
Yes.

237
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,260
If left untreated until adolescence,

238
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,970
it'll become what's known...

239
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,590
as autoimmune mucocutaneous
blistering disease.

240
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,400
You mean...

241
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,040
something's wrong with your brain?

242
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,510
Can't you tell?

243
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,470
I think you're very smart.

244
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,550
I think so, too.

245
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,830
But...

246
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,460
I can't concentrate
for more than five minutes.

247
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,130
I'm always getting lost.

248
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,750
I'd talk to you one second,
and fall asleep the next.

249
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,850
But despite the difficulties,

250
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,320
I still memorised the poems for you.

251
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,030
Do you know...

252
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,360
what this means?

253
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,630
Wait here.

254
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,350
Tian Yong!

255
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,400
Where are you going?

256
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,380
-For me?
-Yes.

257
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,040
Why an hourglass?

258
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,050
Since you can only concentrate,
for five minutes at a time,

259
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,060
it means you should raise...

260
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,241
your memorising efficiency
within a five-minute duration.

261
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,371
The hourglass empties in five minutes.

262
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,560
You can use it to time yourself.

263
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,570
Set yourself little targets. Such as...

264
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,060
I said those things to you...

265
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,800
not because I wanted to discuss
how to study poetry...

266
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,760
Yes.

267
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,790
That's right. Not just poetry.

268
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,740
It can also help you keep track
of your life.

269
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,030
And make you more aware.

270
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,520
What's the matter?

271
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm thinking.

272
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,630
About what?

273
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,200
If you'll kiss me
in the next five minutes.

274
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,240
I won't.

275
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,880
I swear on my code of conduct,

276
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,370
not just in the camp,

277
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,790
but even the remote wilderness,
that I will not.

278
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,800
You can trust me 100 percent.

279
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,270
Really, it's a matter of principles.

280
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,760
Then do you...?

281
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,480
Do you...

282
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,560
want...

283
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,550
to taste...

284
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,920
my lipstick?

285
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,400
It contains lead.

286
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,230
I'll get poisoned.

287
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,500
-Tian Yong!
-Here!

288
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,260
Does your phone have any romantic songs?

289
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,400
Play them.

290
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,420
-Now?
-Yes.

291
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,000
-Are you sure?
-You'd better hurry.

292
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,670
Look into my eyes.

293
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,230
What do you see...

294
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,990
in my eyes?

295
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,360
Mum...

296
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,960
Mum...

297
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,710
Reporting in!

298
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,740
Captain, Captain Rao Zhi
of the City Security Bureau...

299
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,090
wants you to have this.

300
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,050
Thanks.

301
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,070
Liu Ran passed away.

302
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,160
Friend, are you done crying?

303
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,720
Sorry.

304
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,870
Thanks.

305
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,500
I can't stand that song.

306
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,640
So why did you play it?

307
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,370
It's the only song in my phone.

308
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,240
You were asking for it, then.

309
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,430
I'm an orphan.

310
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,760
I grew up in a children's home.

311
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,710
I was adopted once.

312
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,960
But because I wouldn't speak,

313
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,680
I was sent back.

314
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,150
After that,

315
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,590
I joined the army at 18.

316
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,160
At first, I just wanted to make a living.

317
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,560
But after I came here,

318
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,400
I never wanted to leave.

319
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,870
What about your parents?

320
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,670
I have no idea.

321
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,720
This hourglass...

322
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,790
and the "300 Tang Poems" I gave you...

323
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,360
are the only pieces of memory
I have left of them.

324
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,550
Do you hate them?

325
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,600
I do.

326
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,040
How could I not?

327
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,830
A part of me hates them,

328
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,400
but a part of me wishes to see them
in my dreams.

329
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,800
Although in my dreams,

330
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,190
I never get to see their faces clearly,

331
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,120
they're always leaving me

332
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,520
or passing away.

333
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,680
Every time, it ends with me...

334
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,320
waking up in tears.

335
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,230
If only I can see them in a dream one day,

336
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,200
I'd be...

337
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,630
content.

338
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,120
Actually, I'm the same as you.

339
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
You?

340
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,000
Although I'm not an orphan,

341
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,640
nor did I grow up in a children's home,

342
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,910
I seldom get to see my parents.

343
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,480
They're always busy.

344
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,750
Or...

345
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,800
they just don't want to see me.

346
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,030
Why wouldn't they?

347
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,990
Do you know why I adopted the parrot?

348
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,040
I was sexually assaulted.

349
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,320
I was 13.

350
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,720
I went to a doctor, did the examinations.

351
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,480
Then my mum brought me to the US.

352
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,170
Perhaps in my parent's eyes,
I'm like a tumour,

353
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,550
constantly reminding them
of their failure as parents.

354
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,720
I destroyed their marriage.

355
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,440
I made them feel insecure and frustrated.

356
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,050
That's why I like
to wear quirky outfits...

357
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,920
and put on quirky makeups.

358
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,800
I want them to hate me.

359
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,760
To hate me so much
that they can't ignore me.

360
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,840
My brother says I'm dumb.

361
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,190
What do you think?

362
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,520
It seems I am kind of dumb.

363
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,870
So dumb that I can only make friends
with a parrot.

364
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,270
I talk to it every day.

365
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,640
When I cuss at someone,
it'd cuss at that person, too.

366
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,170
It never questions me,

367
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,600
nor does it know right from wrong.

368
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,680
It's always on my side.

369
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,200
Ever since I had it,

370
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,920
I realised...

371
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,000
I can face this miserable world...

372
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,350
with a smile.

373
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,400
Yes, it's dumb.

374
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,430
But it's also useful.

375
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,710
Isn't that right?

376
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,710
Xiao Xue.

377
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,970
I wanted to tell you this...

378
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,640
after our kiss.

379
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,770
But then you played that song...

380
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,590
and told a story that's sadder than mine.

381
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,560
I couldn't take it.

382
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,270
Do you know...

383
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,470
why I'm giving you the parrot?

384
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,430
Because your kindness...

385
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,990
will make it forget its anger...

386
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,390
and become a better version of itself.

387
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,110
Tian Yong.

388
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,160
All those poems must've messed
with your head.

389
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,080
You don't understand anything.

390
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,440
I do.

391
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,260
Not only will kidnapping Xia Chu
teach Liang Mu Ze a lesson,

392
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,240
it'll also force Xia Guang Yuan
to cooperate.

393
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,130
Given the groundwork you've laid
with the girl and her father,

394
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,750
this should be a cinch.

395
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,870
Xia Chu, it's me.

396
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,870
What's up?

397
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,970
Let's meet up.

398
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,481
Sorry.

399
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,741
At the Japanese restaurant
opposite your hospital.

400
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,380
I booked a private room.

401
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,890
See you there.

402
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,410
Zhuo Ran...

403
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,830
(Rao)

404
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,700
Did you ask Xia Chu out?

405
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,160
Yes.

406
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,580
What do you want?

407
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,300
Don't you know how I feel about Xia Chu?

408
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,450
I'll send someone to protect her.

409
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,610
Don't try anything funny.

410
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,690
Li Lei, come here for second.

411
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,960
-Dr Zhang.
-You're here.

412
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,330
Where is Xia Chu?

413
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,850
She's on leave today.

414
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,100
What's the hurry?

415
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,000
Can you give me a ride after work?

416
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,530
I'd like to visit Xiao Jun.

417
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,380
You want me to give you a ride?

418
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,020
It's a little out of the way.

419
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,910
I'm supposed to have dinner
with Meng Zhen...

420
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,210
and Xiao Jun tonight.

421
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,530
I'm going to introduce them to my parents.

422
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,150
Your parents...

423
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,710
There's no need to worry.

424
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,450
I know what you're thinking.

425
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,110
Relax.

426
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,110
I know what kind of women
I should get involved with...

427
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,330
and what kind of women I shouldn't.

428
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,230
Since I got involved with Meng Zhen,

429
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,430
I'll go all the way.

430
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,920
Trust me.

431
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,040
Take good care of them.

432
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,670
Zhuo Ran.

433
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,660
Zhuo Ran.

434
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,390
Zhuo Ran.

435
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,250
What do you see?

436
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,210
Zhuo Ran.

437
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,570
That's right.

438
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,250
It's our past.

439
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,770
Let go of me, Zhuo Ran.

440
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,270
And our future.

441
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,230
Let go.

442
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,070
How have you been?

443
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,250
Pretty good.

444
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,210
And you?

445
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,690
I'm...

446
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,830
doing okay myself.

447
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,350
Everything is coming together
as I planned.

448
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,400
My predicament will soon be over.

449
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,310
When it's finally over,

450
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,680
will you...

451
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,750
give me another chance?

452
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,110
Did you ask me out...

453
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,270
just to give me this ridiculous speech?

454
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,670
Did you?

455
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,350
I want to make up...

456
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,050
for what the old Zhuo Ran did.

457
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,930
When he saw the environment
you grew up in,

458
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,630
he shrank.

459
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,670
He couldn't confront the pain of loss,
and chose to run away.

460
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,930
He was a fool.

461
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,480
So I came back.

462
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,310
I want to show him...

463
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,270
that I can do...

464
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,110
what he couldn't.

465
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,040
I can fit in with your family.

466
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,850
I can give you the life you want.

467
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,810
Xia Chu.

468
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,670
The past eight years
have not been in vain.

469
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,990
Finally, I can do this.

470
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,150
But I can't.

471
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,550
You planted the listening device...

472
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,490
in Liang Mu Ze's house, didn't you?

473
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,230
Mi Gu never told you
that I stayed in Liang Mu Ze's house.

474
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,400
You lied to me.

475
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,410
Yes.

476
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,350
I stalked you.

477
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,470
And not just once.

478
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,870
I know I'm being ridiculous,

479
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,210
but I can't help myself,
but to know everything about you.

480
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,790
To make up for the eight years
that we've lost.

481
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,080
Xia Chu.

482
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,630
The stalking,

483
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,360
the listening device,

484
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:04,999
it was all me.

485
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:08,030
But I won't apologise.

486
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,420
(Braised Egg)

487
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,229
What are you doing?

488
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,780
Liang Mu Ze.

489
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,010
Where are you?

490
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,600
In the Japanese restaurant
opposite the hospital.

491
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,570
I'm just kidding.

492
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,229
It's not funny at all.

493
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,379
Are you worried he's mad?

494
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:52,320
Don't bring him into this.
Zhuo Ran, you disrespected me.

495
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,100
-I did?
-Yeah, who do you think you are?

496
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,980
Who let you answer my call?

497
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,890
How do you think Liang Mu Ze will react?

498
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,490
I don't want to think about it.
How he reacts has nothing to do with you.

499
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,190
But you do.

500
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,810
If he could hang up on you
at the sound of my voice,

501
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,930
is he any different from the Zhuo Ran
who abandoned you eight years ago?

502
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,290
Do you want to make
the same mistake again?

503
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,390
Enough!

504
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,730
-Let me send you home.
-No, I'll walk.

505
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,870
Calm down.

506
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,860
I'm very calm right now.

507
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,740
It's you who's too presumptuous.

508
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,820
Look, when you left,

509
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,410
I was a little fazed by the loss
of an old friend at first...

510
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,540
and went through a rough patch.

511
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,560
But later, I enrolled
in the Military Medical University...

512
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,850
and made many new friends.

513
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,890
Studying, dating, extracurriculars...

514
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,330
I did it all.

515
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,970
I got by just fine.

516
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,530
I wasn't as pathetic as you thought.

517
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm not some lovesick damsel
waiting for your rescue.

518
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,250
I won't give up
just because my first relationship failed.

519
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,820
Not in the past, not now,

520
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,030
not ever.

521
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,750
As for Liang Mu Ze,

522
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,080
I love him.

523
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,130
If he takes your "hi" the wrong way,

524
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,290
and things don't work out,

525
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,350
it doesn't mean you and I
will go back to the way we were.

526
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,330
The past is in the past.

527
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,210
I've moved on from my 18-year-old life.

528
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,890
Even if it wasn't perfect,
I don't want to live it again.

529
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,350
I live for the present, and the future.

530
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,290
My relationships should be decided by me,

531
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,180
not you.

532
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,850
The reason I came here
is to make myself clear to you...

533
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,630
once and for all.

534
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,550
Do you understand?

535
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,460
Liang... Liang Mu Ze.

536
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,790
What are you doing here?

537
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,030
I'm here to fetch you.

538
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,430
Let's go.

539
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,521
But we haven't gotten to the eel rice yet.

540
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:21,391
It's your favourite, Xia Chu.

541
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,990
I no longer like eel rice.

542
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,110
Please let go of me.

543
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,510
In that case,

544
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,390
we'll go back to our normal lives.

545
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,070
When did you come back?

546
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,310
Did you see my message?

547
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,870
Can you slow down, Liang Mu Ze?

548
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,830
Liang Mu Ze.

549
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,910
I know you're mad at me.

550
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,910
You didn't like me meeting up
with Zhuo Ran, did you?

551
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,690
Don't deny it.

552
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,350
I know that's what you're thinking.

553
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,150
You're hurting my hand.

554
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,990
I met up with him...

555
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,850
not because I couldn't get over him,

556
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,780
but because I did.

557
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,510
I wanted to set the record straight,
so he would let go, too.

558
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,870
In any case,

559
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,270
I loved him before.

560
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,230
Since we came together on good terms,

561
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,990
we should part ways on good terms.

562
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,550
Because we may never see each other again.

563
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,910
Do you understand, Liang Mu Ze?

564
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,080
Do you understand, Liang Mu Ze?

565
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,020
-Why don't we go to this restaurant?
-Sure.

566
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,110
Why is she on the ground?
Are they having a fight?

567
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,310
Don't mind them.

568
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,670
Get up.

569
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,630
I can't walk. I don't want to walk.

570
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,150
Liu Ran passed away, do you know that?

571
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,350
The lung transplant was a success,

572
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,070
but the infection got to her.

573
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,830
All the doctors...

574
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,130
stood by and watched her drift into sleep.

575
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,330
There was nothing they could do.

576
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,850
Nothing.

577
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,990
It was totally hopeless.

578
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,000
Don't cry.

579
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,780
Have you any idea...

580
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,670
what I've been through the last few days?

581
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,690
I was so sleepy, but I couldn't sleep.

582
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,210
I kept seeing her in my dreams.

583
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,250
She even thanked me, as if I deserved it.

584
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,770
I couldn't help her.

585
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,350
I couldn't do a thing.

586
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,450
Being a doctor is so hard.

587
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,330
Everything is one big confusion.

588
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,760
It's so tiresome.

589
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,630
There, there.

590
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,810
Come.

591
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,990
Get up.

592
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,170
Why?

593
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,290
You said you couldn't walk.

594
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,630
I'll carry you on my back.

595
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,770
Are you sure?

596
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,910
Come on.

597
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,030
Is something wrong?

598
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,270
Nothing.
You're a little heavy, that's all.

599
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,310
Just kidding. Hold tight.

600
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,960
Hold tight.

601
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,330
You have a stubble.

602
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,090
It's time to shave.

603
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,470
I'll do it when I get back.

604
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,670
Your ears are red.

605
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,870
They're freezing.

606
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,910
Let me blow on them.

607
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,190
That's enough.

608
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,020
I see so many documentaries
of this calibre every year.

609
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,970
They're all too dramatic.

610
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,310
There's no subtlety.

611
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,310
What do you think?

612
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,950
(Zhuo Ran)

613
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,120
Perhaps the closer I am to their lives,

614
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,070
the hardest it is for me to take
an objective view.

615
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,800
Amateur.

616
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,110
What did you say?

617
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,510
She said you're very honest.

618
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:24,870
That's right.

619
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,470
(Zhuo Ran)

620
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,190
Excuse me, I have to take a call.

621
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,720
Zhuo Ran, listen here.

622
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,050
I'm having a gathering with my friends.

623
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,450
I have my own life and career.

624
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,770
I can't be at your beck and call 24-7.

625
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,520
I'm not some maid
that you can order around at will.

626
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,550
I detest this kind of relationship.

627
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,430
Say something.

628
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,430
Every saint has a past.

629
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,670
Every sinner has a future.

630
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,930
Isn't that right, Mi Gu?

631
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,030
What's with you?

632
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,570
Why are you telling me this?

633
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,710
I'm in the hotel.

634
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,970
Are you coming?

635
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,110
No.

636
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,570
My party has just started.

637
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,790
I'll be waiting for you.

638
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,390
Had your phone call?

639
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,710
Yes.

640
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,110
By the way,
we just broke out a bottle of wine.

641
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,660
It's pretty good.

642
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,310
Shall we go inside and taste it?

643
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,630
Come on.

644
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,160
No, thanks.

645
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,240
You guys go ahead.

646
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,720
You came.

647
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,030
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

648
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,590
I don't feel like it.

649
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,390
What's wrong?

650
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,950
Why are you drinking so heavily?

651
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,610
I thought I had to wait all night for you.

652
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,850
Was the party fun?

653
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:27,930
Sure.

654
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,010
A group of beautiful,
intelligent men and women,

655
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,890
sipping their
10,000-dollar-a-bottle wine,

656
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,070
musing over topics of social justice...

657
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,690
and equality...

658
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,450
They pretend to stand up
for the underprivileged.

659
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,090
But I assure you,

660
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,850
those people...

661
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,170
haven't the slightest clue
what life is really like.

662
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,890
Not once have they
considered stepping out...

663
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,690
of the extravagant,

664
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,530
highly-intellectual,

665
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,910
culturally-elitist,

666
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,690
and socially-superior little bubble.

667
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,490
I watched them...

668
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,890
descend into their
own self-indulgent world,

669
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,410
their faces immaculate and pompous.

670
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,250
Do you think it was fun?
