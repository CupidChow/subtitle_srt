His spine is a little crooked.

11
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,170
When he carried me down
the stairs yesterday, I felt it.

12
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,250
To be frank,

13
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,480
after I turned 14,

14
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,850
I haven't seen much of him.

15
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,810
It's highly unlikely that I had caused...

16
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,320
his back to be crooked.

17
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,730
In my memory,

18
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,430
I remember how he would carry me
on his shoulders when I was a kid,

19
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,540
and held me high up.

20
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,210
Now,

21
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,840
how did his spine become crooked?

22
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,660
Perhaps it's lack of calcium.

23
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,280
I know about those scientific theories.

24
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,410
What I wish to say is,

25
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,329
just because this man...

26
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,370
wears a police uniform,

27
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,890
I believed that he was invincible.

28
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,890
Who knew he'd get exhausted too?

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,970
Maybe other people don't see it.

30
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,680
He himself doesn't see it.

31
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,150
But I can.

32
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,760
His back is crooked.

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm heartbroken.

34
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,630
Just like you said,

35
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,310
I still hate him.

36
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,670
Still, I wish I could do
something for him.

37
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,650
But I'm just a lunatic.

38
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,400
You're not.

39
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,370
You know what I said to him yesterday?

40
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:12,019
I said,

41
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,760
"Stay away from me."

42
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,089
"I hate you."

43
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,890
If he doesn't wake up,

44
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,970
that would be the last thing...

45
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,320
I ever said to him.

46
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,480
That would be...

47
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,080
our farewell.

48
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,890
Perhaps this is a hint from God.

49
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,090
Only that...

50
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,170
it was done in a more dangerous way.

51
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,810
Right.

52
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,030
This is a huge hint.

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,540
Blood connection
is stronger than you think.

54
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,280
Xiao Xue.

55
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,250
Just because he doesn't convey
his emotions wilfully like you,

56
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,010
doesn't mean he doesn't care.

57
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,290
Daddy, I feel sick.

58
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,110
I want to go home.

59
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,315
I'll take you home
once you finish the Dr.ip.

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,260
Be good.

61
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,460
Please.

62
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,260
I want to go home now.

63
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,690
Be good, Tian Tian.

64
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:47,250
I'll buy you delicious snacks
when you finish the Dr.ip, okay?

65
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,630
You mean it, right?

66
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,852
Promise me you'll stay with me too.
You mustn't leave.

67
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,978
I promise you, I'll stay by your side.

68
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:58,250
Okay. Pinky promise.

69
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,460
Pinky promise binds you
to the word for 100 years.

70
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,370
If you break it, you'll become a dog.

71
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,090
Good girl.

72
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,070
Do you have pen and paper?

73
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,610
I'll get some.

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,020
What's this?

75
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,120
I modified it using
the unit's bulletproof vest.

76
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,660
I use it when I'm Dr.essed
in civilian clothing.

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,330
I want you to have it.

78
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,020
What for?

79
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,880
To keep you safe.

80
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,940
I'm wearing a bra.

81
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,450
How am I supposed to wear this?

82
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,380
Maybe go back and try to...

83
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,390
Try to find a way.

84
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,060
Such a straight guy.

85
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,890
Put away the heart protector.
I don't want to catch sight of it.

86
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,370
Why?

87
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,790
It's ugly.

88
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,100
Isn't is obvious?
I don't want to see it.

89
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,210
Is it ugly?

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,020
You still donated blood
despite your injury?

91
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,850
Worry about yourself first, Dr.. Xia.

92
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,210
I'm doing good.

93
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,170
Good?

94
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,990
That parcel was sent to you.

95
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,490
If you got blown up by it,
would you still be good?

96
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,110
Were you worried about me?

97
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,420
Of course.

98
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,860
Who was the sender?

99
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,290
The police is still investigating.

100
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,550
My coffee.

101
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,530
Don't move. Come here.

102
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,590
What are you doing?

103
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,770
What are you doing? Hey.

104
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,850
Sit down.

105
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,980
Relax.

106
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,940
Relax.

107
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,740
Relax.

108
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,600
Enjoy this moment.

109
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,330
How is it?

110
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,560
Left. The left side.

111
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,790
Yes, that's the spot.

112
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,960
Liang Mu Ze.

113
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,310
With your skills,
you'll be able to run a massage shop.

114
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,250
I'm sure you'll have returning customers.

115
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,970
This is my family's ancestral skill.

116
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,280
However,

117
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,100
this skill of ours...

118
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,730
is reserved
for only one person this whole life.

119
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,660
Xia Chu.

120
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,290
Do think it over again.

121
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,130
Come to the unit.

122
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,730
Where?

123
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:57,400
♪Every minute, every second,
how do I resist?♪

124
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,650
♪I can't help but look forward
to your return♪

125
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,530
See?

126
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,010
We don't have answers to many questions.

127
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,650
But there's one answer
that I'm sure of.

128
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,980
What is it?

129
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,880
The moon is lovely tonight.

130
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,660
Yes, it is.

131
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,620
Alright, Captain Liang.
Thank you.

132
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,210
I feel rejuvenated now.

133
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,890
I can return to my work.

134
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,790
Hope your hand recovers well.

135
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,790
Do you still remember the tips...

136
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,480
I taught you about staying safe?

137
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,810
Don't travel alone.
Do not stay in the hotel alone.

138
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,100
Set the speed dial
to call the police.

139
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,080
Shut the doors and windows
when alone at home.

140
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,820
Do not put down the home adDr.ess
for deliveries.

141
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,290
Take note of the location
of lifts, stairs and alarms.

142
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,770
Aside from that,
no matter how fast a lift goes,

143
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,940
a person running can catch up
to it within three floors.

144
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,380
So during emergencies,
in order to ditch pursuers,

145
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,510
choose to go further than three floors.

146
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,030
Press more floors if needed
to confuse the pursuer.

147
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,540
Anything around me
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

148
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,980
If I really can't get away,

149
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,960
then go to somewhere with people
and call for help.

150
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,760
Captain Liang.

151
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,500
What you've told me,

152
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,680
I have them etched in my mind.

153
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,300
I won't forget it.

154
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,910
Not bad.

155
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,450
I'm off.

156
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,290
-Dr. Zhang.
-Doctor.

157
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,410
Why are you here?

158
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,075
This is Ke Wei's grandmother.

159
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,435
We just came
from the Public Security Bureau.

160
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,840
We were told Ke Wei was sent here.

161
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,190
How is he?

162
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,450
Doctor.

163
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,170
He's badly injured.

164
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,710
What's most life-threatening is that...

165
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,790
the foreign object pierced through
the right atrium penetrating the heart,

166
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,565
and right chest,
straight up the right side of the neck.

167
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,040
In addition,

168
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,360
the cut in the right atrium
is very close to the coronary artery.

169
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,280
We haven't been able to determine
if the aorta is damaged.

170
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,340
We can only find out during the operation.

171
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,010
Doctor, please, I'm begging you.

172
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,580
You have to save him.

173
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,245
He is the only heir of the family.

174
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
Madam.

175
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,970
Please calm down.

176
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,050
Tell me.

177
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,400
Does he have any criminal record
or history of mental illness?

178
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,090
No, none.

179
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,480
My grandson has always been good.

180
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,090
He's a good kid.

181
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,810
Doctor, this man is very important
in our following investigation.

182
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,500
Please do your best to save him.

183
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,500
Don't worry.

184
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,220
As a doctor,
we'll do everything in our power.

185
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,810
-Thank you.
-If there are no problems,

186
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,570
please sign this consent form.

187
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,730
I can't believe you agreed
to do the operation.

188
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,160
What to do.

189
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,360
Director Chen is overseas.

190
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,730
Dr. Lu is sick.

191
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:18,260
I'm the only one with experience
treating foreign matter penetration.

192
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,530
Who else is going to do it?

193
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,160
He blew up several people today.

194
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,290
That's why we need to save him,
so that he can be interrogated.

195
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,900
Putting aside his injuries,
the incident today is a huge deal.

196
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,060
Have you considered the risks
of saving him?

197
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,490
The police will be monitoring.

198
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,890
Our media department
will be recording the whole process.

199
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,830
Besides,

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,990
if something did happen,
I could only blame it on bad luck.

201
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,330
You can just ignore it.

202
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,090
You should at least wait for the results,

203
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,710
to his infectious diseases check
before performing the operation.

204
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,180
There's no time.

205
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,170
He may die at any moment.

206
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,410
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

207
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,180
You're unbelievable.

208
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,660
You always think you're right.

209
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,970
Be it at work or in relationships.

210
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,080
You and Chen Meng Zhen
are not compatible at all.

211
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,370
You and I are compatible.

212
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,250
We're both smart and cautious.

213
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,440
How did that end up?

214
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,720
Dr. Zhang, the patient's blood pressure
is falling.

215
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,580
What's the situation?

216
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,890
He's spazzing non-stop.

217
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,710
-Begin anaesthesia.
-Okay.

218
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,690
Ke Wei, it doesn't matter
what happened before.

219
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,620
Right now, you're my patient.

220
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,310
I'm trying to save you.

221
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,630
I hope to get your cooperation.

222
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,410
At least, let your family
see you again, all right?

223
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,470
Ready to open the chest.

224
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,250
Steady.

225
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,820
Let's finish it in one go.

226
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,990
Ready.

227
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,540
One, two.

228
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,770
Apply pressure.
Use the hemostatic forceps.

229
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,040
Over here.

230
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,410
Sorry, sir.

231
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,290
It's okay.
Stop the bleeding with gauze.

232
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,950
I'm going to change my gloves.

233
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,920
Okay.

234
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,560
The blood pressure continues to drop.

235
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,270
The pulmonary artery is badly damaged.

236
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,610
Quick, hasten the blood transfusion.

237
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,890
Increase noradrenaline. Quickly!

238
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,050
Move it!

239
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,570
(In operation)

240
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,200
Doctor...

241
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,940
How is my grandson?

242
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,880
Say... Say something.

243
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,290
Say something.

244
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,770
It will be okay.

246
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,440
My grandson.

247
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,260
Mi Gu.

248
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,920
Xia Chu.

249
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,260
I've been looking for you.

250
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,240
Wait for me at the ER night shift room.
I'll be right there.

251
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,610
This sentence lacks punch.

252
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,350
But I can't come up
with a better expression.

253
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,410
Highlight it.

254
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,180
We'll go over it again during editing.

255
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,810
Okay.

256
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,890
This is everything.

257
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,050
I'll take a copy with me.

258
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,370
Xiao Xiao.

259
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,800
Have you ever thought about
changing your job?

260
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,490
Why do you ask?

261
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,410
Just curious.

262
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,540
Say for instance,

263
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,390
you're dating a very busy man
who is abroad.

264
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,060
You two love each other.

265
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,890
Are you willing to change your job
for the sake of your future...

266
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,430
and move to be with him?

267
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,750
Why am I the one to switch jobs?

268
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,980
Why can't he?

269
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,120
His profession is a little special.

270
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,850
It's not up to him
to decide whether he can leave.

271
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,890
You're talking about Liang Mu Ze, right?

272
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,190
It doesn't matter who it is.

273
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,260
I just want to know,
if you were in their shoes...

274
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,230
I won't.

275
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,230
You're so sure?

276
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,450
Do you know...

277
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,770
what are the words I heard the most
since young?

278
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,460
In primary school,

279
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,110
I got first place.

280
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,280
The elders and teachers would say,

281
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,040
"A girl only performs well
in primary school."

282
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,280
When I was in middle school,
I got first again.

283
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,280
Once again, the elders and teachers said,

284
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,190
"The boys haven't shown
their true power."

285
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,320
I got into the Science Experimental Class
in high school.

286
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,540
The Math teacher's favourite phrase was,

287
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,190
"I don't expect anything much
from girls on this question."

288
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,070
"But if the boys got this wrong,
they will be caned."

289
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,160
It didn't matter I could answer all of it.

290
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,690
When I got into
the Military Medical University,

291
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,010
at the start of my internship,
my supervisor would say,

292
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,070
"Females are strong in theory."

293
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,710
"But when it comes to actual practice,
men are still better."

294
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,490
In today's medical environment,

295
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,690
doctors are not allowed to make mistakes.

296
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,750
Especially female doctors.

297
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,210
One mistake and that might destroy
any hope of holding a surgery knife.

298
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,380
So,

299
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,270
I've endured 27 years of hardship.

300
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,970
There's no way I could give up
my career over a man.

301
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,640
However,

302
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,420
I've given it serious thought.

303
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,350
To be like Professor Lin Qiao Zhi,

304
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,940
remain single my whole life.

305
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,810
I'll only live for myself.

306
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,430
A lifetime is long, Xiao Xiao.

307
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,340
Don't you find such nonchalance boring?

308
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,510
But it's the kind of boredom I chose.

309
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,690
Done.

310
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,210
I've seen the proposal.

311
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,220
I think...

312
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,370
the topic is still somewhat vague.

313
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,330
Let's work on it some more.

314
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,770
Also,

315
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,930
confirm next week's guest
soonest possible.

316
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,270
The styling?

317
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,840
We'll decide when I get back.

318
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,640
Bye-bye.

319
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,630
Done with work?

320
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,440
Where is the granny?

321
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,640
The village chief is waiting
in the car with her.

322
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,910
Why did you want to see me?

323
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,980
She's Ke Wei's grandmother.

324
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,650
Who?

325
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,700
Ke Wei.

326
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,740
The delivery guy who sent you the parcel.

327
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,690
How did you know them?

328
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,140
I met them while working
on the "left-behind children" project.

329
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,670
We've kept in touch.

330
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,690
So,

331
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,200
do you know him well?

332
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,150
Was he like this before?
Did he have aggressive tendencies?

333
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,380
The young man seemed honest.

334
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
Aside from being a little quiet,

335
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,380
I didn't find anything wrong
with his personality.

336
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,160
Then why would he...

337
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,690
I'm not sure.

338
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,120
Maybe,

339
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,420
it has something to do with the things
he'd been reading on the Internet.

340
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,160
What's that?

341
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,920
I found this photo on his computer.

342
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,500
Why would he have a photo like that?

343
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,730
Did you report it?

344
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,470
Because I called the police,

345
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,210
that's how I found out
what happened and hurried here.

346
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,650
His grandma is devastated.

347
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,060
She's lived her whole life
in the countryside, a good, honest life.

348
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,930
Now, suddenly she's dumb-struck.

349
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,000
She kept asking,

350
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,870
if she could visit the officer
who was injured.

351
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,810
I understand.

352
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,300
At this point in time,
an apology is meaningless.

353
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,910
But it is the grandma's
sincere wish after all.

354
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,710
Could you...

355
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:54,157
pull some strings?

356
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,140
How about this?

357
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,020
When the patient has stabilized,

358
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,190
and the family has calmed down,
we'll discuss it.

359
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,450
There's one more thing.

360
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,200
What is it?

361
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,670
Zhuo Ran and I are together.

362
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,510
Does that upset you?

363
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,860
No.

364
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,980
But I want to tell you this.

365
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,850
Treat him like a stranger
and get to know him once more.

366
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,410
Keep yourself safe.

367
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,320
Don't fall too hard, too quickly.

368
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,550
Also,

369
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,990
between you and him,

370
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,540
I'm forever your friend.

371
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,770
Let's have dinner tomorrow night.

372
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,860
I have a lot I want to tell you.

373
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,330
Sure.

374
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,186
(Ningjiang News: Drug Busts)

375
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,290
On the 25th of December, 2009,
during a military office operation,

376
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,660
a drug dealer kidnapped the son
of his accomplice, who just turned 18.

377
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,780
Xia Chu.

378
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,220
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

379
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,620
An injured that was sent in
is not doing well.

380
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,810
I need to check on him.

381
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,360
Let me ask you something.

382
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,040
Can you sign for Bed 14's patient?

383
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,200
Okay.

384
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,720
What is it?

385
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,720
Thanks, Dr. Xia.

386
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,650
What did Zhuo Ran's parents
do in the past?

387
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,130
I only know that
his mother's health is not good.

388
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,900
As for his father,

389
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,180
I don't think he ever spoke about him.

390
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,050
Why did you suddenly ask?

391
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,350
I'm currently
sorting out tapes in the resource room.

392
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,070
I came across this drug dealer's son.

393
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,970
He looked so much like Zhuo Ran.

394
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,500
Dr. Xia.

395
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,720
I'll talk to you later. I have to go.

396
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:44,423
???

397
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,370
Dr. Xia!

398
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,470
Dr. Xia.

399
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,570
I'm Li Lei's wife.

400
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,610
Could you please play this for him?

401
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm sure he'd wake up after hearing this.

402
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,140
Please help.

403
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,630
The patient's condition is serious.
We need six pints of blood.

404
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,010
Please hurry up.

405
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,990
The patient just became a parent.

406
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,190
Okay, thanks.

407
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,790
Is the condition very bad?

408
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,100
Severe septic shock.

409
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,500
The coagulation index is a mess.

410
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,650
The drugs have failed to stabilize
his brood pressure.

411
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,220
Administer more drugs.
Transfuse the blood once it arrives.

412
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,250
Got it.

413
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,250
Hang in there.

414
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,250
Bear it with a bit more.

415
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,450
Once this is over,

416
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,930
you'll be able to see your family.

417
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,350
Hi, can you please hasten
the delivery of plasma?

418
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,890
The patient in ER needs it urgently.

419
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,050
Thank you.

420
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,260
(Emergency Department)

421
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:16,810
The blood pressure is stabilizing.

422
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,930
So, did he say anything in the end?

423
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,290
He was put under general anaesthesia.

424
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,340
He was unconscious.

425
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,100
How about before that?

426
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,900
During your attempt to save him,
had he mentioned any names?

427
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,860
He had been in shock.

428
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,720
When he was on the operation table,
he started having spasms.

429
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,740
Okay, that will do for now.

430
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,010
Thanks for your help, Dr. Zhang.

431
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,080
Don't mention it.

432
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,950
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

433
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,810
The heartbeat is abnormal.
Ready the defibrillator.

434
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,740
200 joules. Get ready.

435
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,120
I'm sorry.

436
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,570
-Hello?
-Hey, Meng Zhen.

437
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,500
I'm off work.

438
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,250
What about going for a movie?

439
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,170
I'm sorry. I'm not free.

440
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,140
Wait.

441
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,040
About what happened,

442
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,800
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

443
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,760
I'd like to explain to you in person.

444
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,430
I can't right now.
I have customers at the shop.

445
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,710
I can go and help.

446
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,180
It's okay.
Talk again next time.

447
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,730
Have tea, aunty.

448
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,360
Thank you.

449
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,430
You're welcome.

450
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,250
Just now,

451
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,130
I took a look around your shop.

452
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,700
The furnishings aren't what I expected.

453
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,790
It's quite Westernised.

454
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,330
Thanks.

455
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,100
Independent book stores like this
are commonly found elsewhere too.

456
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,790
If you're free, you should check them out.

457
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,550
Most people buy books online now.

458
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,250
Hardly anyone visits book stores.

459
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,200
Buying books online
is a form of consumerism.

460
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,230
Visiting book stores is a lifestyle.

461
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,440
Each has pros and cons.
They do not overlap.

462
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
Does Yi Chi...

463
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,310
know I came to see you?

464
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,400
Thank you.

465
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,260
My visit today is a little sudden.

466
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,630
Since I met you the other day,

467
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,200
I haven't been able
to sleep the past days.

468
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,360
Yi Chi's dad told me
to be more open-minded,

469
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,770
about you and him.

470
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,100
Honestly,

471
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,060
I am unable to do so.

472
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,770
I know my son well.

473
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,530
These past years,

474
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,840
he's had a few girlfriends.

475
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,790
They didn't last long.

476
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,980
As for the ones he brought home,

477
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,940
it was only perfunctory.

478
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,590
But, there's a good saying.

479
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,650
Dating and marriage
are two different things.

480
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:27,070
If you two
were still youngsters in your 20s,

481
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:32,280
dating and spending a few years together
wouldn't have required me to butt in.

482
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,170
But the fact is,

483
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,300
both of you are no longer young.

484
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,320
Especially you.

485
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,040
Chen.

486
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,130
It is not easy for you
to raise a child alone.

487
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,060
Compared to a romantic
but improbable relationship,

488
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,790
I think a stable marriage
is what you need.

489
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,290
Clearly,

490
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,940
my son isn't the suitable
marriage candidate for you.

491
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,640
I worry that he's wasting your time.

492
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,330
What do you think, Chen?

493
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,250
Chen?

494
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,380
Aunty.

495
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,860
Don't be anxious.

496
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,410
Before he can waste my time,
I first have to allow him to.

497
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,480
I never said I'd let him.

498
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,490
So there's no reason
to say he's wasting anyone's time.

499
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,690
Miss Zhen, we're here.

500
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,440
Give me a minute.

501
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,450
We'll wait for you inside then. Be quick.

502
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,560
Okay.

503
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,240
Sorry, aunty.

504
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,780
I have an appointment with clients.

505
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,440
I have to go now.

506
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,750
See you.

507
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,810
From the CT scan,

508
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,210
the foreign object is still some ways
away from the aorta.

509
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,130
As such,
the fact that a huge tear occurred,

510
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,010
shows that the patient's spasms
on the operating table...

511
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,430
Excuse me.

512
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,250
(Xiao Wen of Diagnostic Lab)

513
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,580
Where was I?

514
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:42,540
Spasms.

515
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,610
Spasms.

516
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,710
So,

517
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,070
in future,
when we administer anaesthesia,

518
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,430
we have to be mindful
of the right timing.

519
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,190
Understood?

520
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,010
Stop staring and jot it down.

521
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,290
Steady does it.

522
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,780
Let's finish it in one go.

523
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,810
Here. Over here.

524
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,820
-Sorry, sir.
-It's fine.

525
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,090
Stop the bleeding with gauze.

526
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Hello, Xiao Xiao.

527
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,080
Dr. Zhang, you haven't left I hope.

528
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,050
Not yet.

529
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,320
What's the matter?

530
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,923
The lab just called to say,

531
00:37:36,008 --> 00:37:38,130
that the perpetrator for the explosion
who just tied, Ke Wei,

532
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,895
showed three positives
for the Hepatitis B marker.

533
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,015
All medical personnel who took part
in the operation,

534
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,955
need to get Hepatitis B
immunoglobulin injection.

535
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,250
Dr. Zhang, you're actually scared of pain?

536
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,890
I haven't had an injection in years.

537
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,130
By the way,

538
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,090
What is the window period?

539
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,100
One month.

540
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,480
Alright then. After one month,
I'll do a blood test.

541
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,173
Make sure you rest more
during this period.

542
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,440
-Okay.
-Don't stretch yourself thin.

543
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,500
Thanks.

544
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,970
Dr. Zhang.

545
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,100
Thanks.

546
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,500
Please don't, Dr. Zhang.

547
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,720
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,170
I'm sorry.

549
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,310
I kept trying to call you just now.

550
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,600
But you didn't answer.

551
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,550
I thought something had happened to you.

552
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,370
No such thing.

553
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,300
I don't have my phone on me, that's all.

554
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,210
Right now, in my life,
aside from Xiao Jun,

555
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,360
there's nothing else
that is worth mentioning.

556
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,590
What about me?

557
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,440
You...

558
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,000
were never a part of my life.

559
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,910
Chen Meng Zhen!

560
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,210
Didn't you tell me
to think our relationship through?

561
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,200
That is why I'm here today.

562
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,320
I've thought about it long ago.

563
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,330
You are Xiao Jun's mother.

564
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,930
In your heart,

565
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,610
no one can replace him.

566
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,770
When my father asked me
if I was ready...

567
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,090
to accept him,

568
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,570
the reason I did not answer
wasn't because I was unsure,

569
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,640
but because to me, this wasn't
something I had to think about at all.

570
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,050
I even thought that...

571
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,070
we won't have our own children
in the future.

572
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,110
He alone is enough.

573
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,280
That's what I thought.

574
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,050
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell them.

575
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,900
In that situation,

576
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,610
I wouldn't want to tell you either.

577
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,960
I thought maybe I was being hasty.

578
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,480
That you wouldn't believe me.

579
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,850
Why me?

580
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,130
Maybe it's fate.

581
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,150
The whys don't matter.

582
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,500
I just know we get along.

583
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,210
From the moment I met you.

584
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,120
Get along?

585
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,380
So my credentials don't matter.

586
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,610
Even if I'm not the best, right?

587
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,480
-Right.
-But it matters to me.

588
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,410
The man I want to marry
has to see me as the best.

589
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,590
My family and career,
everything I've gone through,

590
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,340
has created the best version of me today.

591
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,580
He would marry me because he knows
he's making the best choice,

592
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,730
not because he's making a huge sacrifice.

593
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,170
I care about that.

594
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,820
I don't see the difference!

595
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,610
It's just semantics!

596
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,245
There is,

597
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,260
Dr. Zhang.

598
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,850
Maybe you're used to having
everything go your way.

599
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,670
You've never seen the other road that
is full of potholes and covered in mud.

600
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,860
Sacrifice is a momentary satisfaction.

601
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,250
It has to be sincere acceptance
for two to...

602
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,320
This is what my late husband said,

603
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,960
when he proposed to me.

604
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,730
I still remember now that he's gone.

605
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,800
He wasn't as polished as you.

606
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,690
He was a brute military man.

607
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,070
I was his biggest pride.

608
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,580
Am I yours?

609
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,780
We are from two different worlds.

610
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,370
The closer we get,

611
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,080
the harder it becomes.

612
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,250
Do you know why we asked you to come?

613
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,333
There was an explosion
at the neighbourhood Xia Chu lives.

614
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,960
Who did it?

615
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,780
According to the news,
it was a delivery guy.

616
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,160
We have tested...

617
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,450
the traces of the explosive
found at the scene.

618
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,030
The deliveryman had used a very
professional variety of the C-4 bomb.

619
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,140
Previously,

620
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,820
the composition bomb that was used
in the Isaia incident,

621
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,170
was very similar
to the one used this time.

622
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,780
Should I say this is T4's signature?

623
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,930
When Old Master's goods
were confiscated at the border,

624
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,480
he mentioned this to me.

625
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,360
That he'd get revenge in Ningjiang.

626
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,990
Why didn't you say anything?

627
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:05,020
-I thought he wouldn't dare.
-You thought?

628
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,220
Because of your assumption,

629
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,500
Officer Rao and Officer Li
are hospitalized.

630
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,320
My mother is in his hands.

631
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,080
Her life is at stake.

632
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,050
How did he get in touch
with the deliveryman?

633
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,940
City of Desire.

634
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,210
Scary Pirate.

635
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,210
Scary Pirate?

636
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,970
That's Old Master?

637
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,730
Scary Pirate is just an ID.

638
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,990
Isn't it?

639
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,690
If Old Master wants it,

640
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,260
anyone can be the person using the ID.

641
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,000
Ask him what Old Master's goal is.

642
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,290
Why did Old Master do this?

643
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,680
Maybe it's for revenge.

644
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,590
Listen carefully.

645
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,150
If you wish to save your mother,

646
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,730
you better buckle up.

647
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,890
We expect your full cooperation
in the investigation,

648
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,930
and subsequent operation.

649
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,840
Thank you for watching my stream.

650
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,360
If you enjoyed it,
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.,

651
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,590
I'll be here waiting for you all
at Room 2924.

652
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,150
Love you!

653
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,030
(Zhuo Ran)

654
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,590
Hello.

655
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,100
Nice song.

656
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,290
2924.

657
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,900
You watched my live stream?

658
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,930
It was more interesting than I thought.

659
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,380
Thanks for the compliment.

660
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,850
You have no idea
the amount of preparation I have to do,

661
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,570
for the 2-hour stream every night.

662
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,010
What about your work?

663
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,570
I still do it. This is extra income.

664
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,080
It doesn't affect my main job.

665
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,330
Later, I still have to update my website.

666
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,670
So hardworking.

667
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,010
Aren't you tired?

668
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,095
I am.

669
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,250
How could I not be tired?

670
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,340
But no matter how tired,

671
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,080
I just have to sit by the full-height
window of my house,

672
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,540
and I'll feel like my energy...

673
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,200
has been recharged.

674
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,980
Zhuo Ran.

675
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,070
Back then, why did you leave
without saying goodbye?

676
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,280
Did Xia Chu ask you to ask me?

677
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,250
No.

678
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,290
I'm the one who wants to know.

679
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,700
Is it because of your father?

680
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,380
Why did you suddenly bring him up?
