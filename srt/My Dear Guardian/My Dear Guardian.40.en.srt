3
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,289
Eat it.

4
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,210
Eat it.

5
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,490
I want you to eat it!

6
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,690
Eat it.

7
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,410
Hurry up.

8
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,840
I know you didn't expect me

9
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,730
to come back alive
when you sent me here.

10
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,300
It'd be best if I could
complete the task.

11
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,826
If I couldn't,

12
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,210
you can have me to
do the dirty work for you

13
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,050
and get rid of the thorn in your side,

14
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,250
right?

15
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,770
You have a good memory.

16
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,340
Eat it.

17
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,620
I wasn't planning on staying alive.

18
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,860
But Old Master,

19
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,800
what makes you think

20
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,730
you can leave China alive?

21
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,106
(Rao Zhi!)

22
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,666
(Long Yi is heading out to sea
by motorboat.)

23
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,130
(We are sending our
men over to block him.)

24
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,020
(I'm at the dockside. I'll go!)

25
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,110
This is Whale.

26
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,290
Old Master is dead.

27
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,410
Pei Yu ran away.

28
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,530
Don't waste your energy, Liang Mu Ze!

29
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,290
You can't catch me.

30
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,530
Did you kill Old Master?

31
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,970
He deserved to die.

32
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,986
Don't forget your identity!

33
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,950
Pei Yu!

34
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,030
Pei Yu no longer exists in this world.

35
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,226
It's not today and here

36
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,210
that I forgot my own identity.

37
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,230
I don't need you to remind me.

38
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,270
I still remember the taste

39
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,160
of Xia Chu's lips.

40
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,400
I tell you what.

41
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,450
It was only Zhuo Ran
whom Xia Chu liked.

42
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,770
You are

43
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,250
just his shadow.

44
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,580
Just kill me.

45
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,210
You don't deserve it.

46
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,210
♫I had a quick glance at your eyes♫

47
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,590
♫It could be the destiny
but it is not practical♫

48
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,400
♫Your expression popped up on my mind♫

49
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:59,610
♫I learn to face the music
instead of evading it♫

50
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,810
♫Remembering your interests,
getting closer to you♫

51
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,440
♫If I can't predict the future,
I'll leave it up to fate♫

52
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,930
♫I can't remember when
I fell in love with you♫

53
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:23,160
♫I am afraid that
I might lose you one day♫

54
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,960
♫Every minute, every second,
how do I resist?♫

55
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,776
Five minutes.

56
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,786
♫I can't help but look forward
to your return♫

57
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,210

58

♫Replaying the moment I fell in love♫

59
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,640
You gained weight.

60
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,420
I ate well

61
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,240
and I didn't lose any sleep.

62
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,570
Aunty is doing well.

63
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,510
There are volunteers
taking turns to take care of her.

64
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,430
Good.

65
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,930
Then

66
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,090
I can rest assured.

67
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,910
Before I came here,

68
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,780
I had a lot I wanted to say.

69
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,546
Just cut to the chase.

70
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,010
Time's running out.

71
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,910
I'm sorry.

72
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,680
You don't look like a
woman in her thirties.

73
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,569
You're too silly.

74
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,089
No woman is truly silly

75
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,830
unless she's willing to be one.

76
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,800
This may be our last meeting.

77
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,710
I've been wanting to
ask you a question.

78
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,620
Did you

79
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,430
ever love me?

80
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,100
Even for a moment?

81
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,980
No.

82
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,536
I'd been treating

83
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,840
you as a handy tool.

84
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,090
Let's go.

85
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,936
Mr Zhang, goodbye.

86
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,656
Goodbye.

87
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,346
Goodbye, sir.

88
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,586
Do your revision.

89
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,416
Mr Zhang, goodbye.

90
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,690
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

91
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,230
It's me.

92
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,070
I'm on the way to the airport.

93
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,630
Then I wish you

94
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,020
a safe journey.

95
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,520
We probably won't see each other
much in future.

96
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,976
You should put your own health

97
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,560
in the first place.

98
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,130
(And I want to tell you)

99
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,970
(that you've been an)

100
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,090
excellent doctor in my mind.

101
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,226
I believe that

102
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,810
you'll be an excellent
teacher in the future.

103
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,990
Well,

104
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,500
then I'll

105
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,670
do my best to

106
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,326
live up your expectation

107
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,550
to be an excellent teacher.

108
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,490
Goodbye.

109
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,730
Mister,

110
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,320
please Dr.ive faster.

111
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,480
Okay.

112
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,120
Meng Zhen!

113
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,340
Mum, let's go.

114
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,750
I...

115
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,020
I want to eat

116
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,770
the sponge cake you make.

117
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,370
♫You were familiar to me at first sight♫

118
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,520

125
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,930
It's strange.

126
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,550
My heart beats faster

127
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,976
than usual

128
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,250
every time I see you.

129
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,380
I feel a strange familiarity towards you,

130
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,680
like we've known
each other for a long time.

131
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,290
Xue is here to volunteer again.

132
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,630
How is it?

133
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,610
Do you feel good today?

134
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,130
Aunty said her heart
is beating a little fast.

135
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,560
Let me listen.

136
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,830
Do you feel stuffy or
pain in the chest?

137
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,990
This shouldn't be a problem.

138
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,520
Then why is her heart racing?

139
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,850
Perhaps

140
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,320
her transplanted heart

141
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,340
recognises you.

142
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,980
Rest well.

143
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,900
Call me if there's any problem.

144
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,896
Thank you, Dr. Xia.

145
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,080
You're welcome.

146
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,550
It's a young soldier.

147
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,970
What?

148
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,390
I mean the donor who
donated his heart to me.

149
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,610
If he was alive,

150
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,860
his heart might race

151
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,426
like mine does

152
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,250
when he sees you.

153
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,640
Aunty,

154
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,200
can I listen to his heartbeat?

155
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,630
♫There's something about you

♫Until the day we meet♫

172
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,540
♫Can the missing companionship
instantly fulfil♫

173
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,540
♫Your love♫

174
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,340
Xiao Xue,

175
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,450
write a letter to my son for me.

176
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,960
Okay.

177
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,410
What do you want to write?

178
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,770
What left me yesterday

179
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
can be retained no more.

180
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,350
What worries me today

181
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,340
are the times for which I feel sore.

182
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,370
This is Li Bai's poem.

183
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,970
I like Li Bai too.

184
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,130
Why did I recite Li Bai's poem?

185
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,530
Just recite it.

186
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,570
In autumn wind for miles
and miles the wild geese fly.

187
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,930
Let's follow them with eyes
and Dr. Ink in tower high.

188
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,290
Your writing's forcible,
like ancient poets.

189
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,630
Your writing's forcible,
like ancient poets.

190
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,370
Mine is in Junior Xie's
direct and easy style.

191
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,340
Both of us have ambitions high.

192
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,630
We'd bring the moon down from the sky.

193
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,530
Cut running water with a sword,
it will flow faster.

194
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,300
Dr. Ink wine to Dr. Own your sorrow,
it will grow heavier.

195
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,160
(If we despair in our
lifetime of all affairs,)

196
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,450
(tomorrow let us sail away)

197
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,090
with loosened hairs.

198
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,986
(Son,)

199
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,900
(I know you've been blaming me)

200
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,386
(for taking your little brother away)

201
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,810
(and leaving you.)

202
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,596
(I wasn't being partial.)

203
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,660
(I really had no choice.)

204
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,666
(There's no mother)

205
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,610
(willing to abandon her own child.)

206
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,910
(After all these years,)

207
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,960
(you've always kept me company
under the guise of Zhuo Ran.)

208
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,830
(You learned his every move)

209
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,270
(and his emotions)

210
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,670
(to comfort me.)

211
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,260
(It wasn't that I didn't
recognize you.)

212
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,930
(Just that)

213
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,010
(I thought you could)

214
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,110
(live on without guilt
if I said nothing.)

215
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,780
(Come to think of it,)

216
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,050
(we really made a lot of mistakes.)

217
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,026
(I should have stopped you)

218
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,730
(back then on the boat.)

219
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,320
(I should've stopped you from)

220
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,850
(eating that leftover and)

221
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,930
(kneeling before that demon
no matter what.)

222
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,306
(I'd rather die with you)

223
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,370
(that night)

224
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,380
(than watching you)

225
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,490
(compromise yourself for me)

226
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,860
(and live a miserable life.)

227
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,720
(It's time to get back up)

228
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,680
(on your feet.)

229
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,250
(If it's possible,)

230
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,840
(please abandon your disguise and)

231
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,530
(remove the masks on your face.)

232
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,770
(Even for a day)

233
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,620
(or for an hour.)

234
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,410
(Trust me,)

235
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,620
(you're my son, Pei Yu.)

236
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,290
(You don't have be to someone else.)

237
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,110
(You just need to be yourself.)

238
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,720
(We'll face it)

239
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,140
(and atone for our sins together.)

240
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,730
(Please believe that)

241
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,690
(I love you still.)

242
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,290
(I love you always.)

243
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,920
I am Pei Yu.

244
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,070
I am Pei Yu.

245
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,810
Brother.

246
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,786
Remember,

247
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,866
I'm going to Beijing to

248
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,610
attend the independent
student recruitment.

249
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,106
The details between me and Xia Chu

250
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,320
is in this letter.

251
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,146
We recently had
some conflict because of the novel

252
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,150
by Josephine Tey.

253
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,680
Remember to cheer her up for me.

254
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,106
Mother's habits

255
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,330
are in this notebook too.

256
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,010
Most importantly,

257
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,136
remember

258
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,270
you must smile.

259
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,680
A brighter smile.

260
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,680
Right, that's it!

261
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,210
I'll get on first.

262
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,416
Remember,

263
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,226
from now on,

264
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,570
you're Zhuo Ran.

265
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,540
I am Pei Yu.

266
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,880
I am Pei Yu.

267
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,040
I am Pei Yu!

268
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,780
I am Pei Yu!

269
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,426
I am Pei Yu.

270
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,930
I am Pei Yu.

271
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,130
I am Pei Yu.

272
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:54,690
(Three months later,
Pei Yu is sentenced to death)

273
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,820
Thank you, Master Le Tian.

274
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,266
Thanks for keeping
me company all this time.

275
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,850
You've worked hard.

276
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,576
If you meet other patients

277
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,040
like me afterwards,

278
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,600
remember to tell them that

279
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,530
everything will be fine

280
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,190
no matter how hard things get.

281
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,140
It's going to be all right.

282
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,460
We can do it!

283
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,176
Sorry to trouble you.

284
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,590
It's all right. Rest assured.

285
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,190
Leaving home with three big laughters,

286
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,270
I'm not an

287
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,730
ordinary man!

288
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,090
I don't feel like he's gone.

289
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,050
Tian Yong isn't gone.

290
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,040
When I sent the parrot off,

291
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,110
I got a strong feeling that

292
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,420
Tian Yong will see this.

293
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,050
It was the parrot who brought him to me.

294
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,320
And they healed me together.

295
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,230
Now that

296
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,896
my parrot has become

297
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,690
Master Le Tian from OK,

298
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,800
it's going to heal more people!

299
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,840
Tian Yong isn't gone.

300
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,220
It's true.

301
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,710
He is in the poem
which I read just now.

302
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,420
He is in every laughter
of Master Le Tian too.

303
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,190
And here,

304
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,660
he's in here too.

305
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,890
He's always been here.

306
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:08,489
Xiao Xue,

307
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,020
I've decoded the

308
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,969
WeChat message that Tian Yong sent

309
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,449
via his WeChat account, Mr Parrot.

310
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,810
It's in this book.

311
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,920
Read it if you want.

312
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,170
Okay.

313
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,330
Let's go.

314
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,179
Tell me

315
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,980
what your next plan is.

316
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,040
I want to take a graduate exam
in Chinese Literature.

317
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,420
Really?

318
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,130
Which college do you want to apply?

319
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,115
Mother's alma mater.

320
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,066
She has a senior

321
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,330
who studies Poetry Phonology.

322
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,460
It's good.

323
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,250
Are you sure about that?

324
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,066
Just give it a try.

325
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,770
I'll try it next year
if I can't make it this year.

326
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,356
Life is long,

327
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,820
I'm going to make it.

328
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,270
You can do it.

329
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,800
Mother said

330
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,830
she'll return to help
me prepare for the test.

331
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,570
We rent a unit downstairs
at Mu Ze's place.

332
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,730
Come home for

333
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,120
dinner if you're free.

334
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,110
Okay.

335
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,976
You do your best, too,

336
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,010
Officer Rao!

337
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,870
Okay.

338
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,540
Okay.

339
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,410
We, father and daughter,

340
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,030
will try our best.

341
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,990
In the future, if I'm free,

342
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,500
I'll try to spare

343
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,770
a day every week.

344
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,096
Really?

345
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,400
To accompany you.

346
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,410
(This is a voiceless memo.)

347
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,730
(I only hope Xue could understand)

348
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,080
(I've always prepared
to bid farewell to you.)

349
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,610
(Because that is the preparation
ceremony for the next meeting.)

350
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,330
(It's the best comfort on the days)

351
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,550
(when we we can't meet.)

352
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,330
(If)

353
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,450
(we can't meet again,)

354
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,056
(I'll remember the
way you look every time)

355
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,480
(you said goodbye to me with a smile.)

356
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,440
(Please)

357
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,050
(remember the poem below.)

358
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,390
(They are willing to)

359
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,230
(be a star in the sky.)

360
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,916
(They are willing to)

361
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,450
(be a light on the ground.)

362
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,040
(I might sacrifice)

363
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,670
(when I)

364
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,930
(enter the restricted area.)

365
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,510
(Leaving the footprints,)

366
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,990
(paving the way)

367
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,330
(for those who come after.)

368
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,080
(I'm grateful to the world)

369
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,150
(for accepting my body.)

370
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,440
(I'm grateful to my girl)

371
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,050
(for giving me the time of eternity.)

372
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,610
(And you'll always have my soul.)

373
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,100
(Trust me, Xue.)

374
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,190
(All the pain and waiting)

375
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,810
(won't be wasted.)

376
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,770
(Someday,)

377
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,260
(they'll become your love)

378
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,930
(and courage.)

379
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,730
(I wish you have a blissful life.)

380
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,170
I'm cured.

381
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,970
I don't lose sleep and

382
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,770
I don't have to eat
sleeping pills anymore.

383
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,650
I'm all well.

384
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,346
I saw someone

385
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,086
selling lychee honey yesterday.

386
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,760
So I bought one for each of you.

387
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,000
Taste it.

388
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,060
Tell me if it's delicious.

389
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,336
But its taste

390
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,850
is not the same as before.

391
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,880
Everything has changed.

392
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,640
Only you two are this lively.

393
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,500
Here, cheers.

394
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,610
Cheers!

395
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,186
Uncle, don't Dr. Ink this fast.

396
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,830
It's fine, I'm happy.

397
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
It's rare that Mu Ze takes a day off.

398
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,560
You're off duty too.

399
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,306
I tell you what, it's hard

400
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,696
to have a reunion dinner

401
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,850
in our family.

402
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,866
Right.

403
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,946
Here, Xia Chu.

404
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,386
Try your uncle's cooking.

405
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,530
Thank you, aunty.

406
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,666
Here.

407
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,630
This one.

408
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,750
Taste it.

409
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,930
Thank you, aunty.

410
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,730
I think

411
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,396
we should refurnish the house.

412
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,276
How is it?

413
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,316
How about this?

414
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,686
Let's visit the furniture stores while

415
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,510
we have time tomorrow morning.

416
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,290
Tomorrow?

417
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,620
Tomorrow...

418
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,930
No, we have things to do.

419
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,206
What are you up to?

420
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,386
My unit is going to film a publicity video

421
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,976
about military conscription tomorrow.

422
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,990
I'm the actor.

423
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm going to be the viewer.

424
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,766
Anyway, you'll leave tomorrow.

425
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,646
Just make this easy.

426
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,536
Quickly pack your luggage after this meal.

427
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,790
Don't forget any stuff.

428
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,930
I know.

429
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,626
Aren't you afraid

430
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,506
that Xia Chu will be unhappy after

431
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,970
refurnishing this house?

432
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,960
No.

433
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,000
Son, let me ask you.

434
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,156
What will you do when there's

435
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,476
disagreement between me and Xia Chu

436
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,780
in the future?

437
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,160
What will I do?

438
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,580
What should I do?

439
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,250
What to do?

440
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,640
What will I do?

441
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,630
Do you have any
suggestion, old comrade?

442
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,430
Don't Dr.ag me into this.

443
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,310
If that's the case,

444
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,466
just mind

445
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,330
our own women.

446
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,990
This is a great idea.

447
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,986
Come on.

448
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,370
Let's have a another toast.

449
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,450
Come!

450
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,096
Xia Chu,

451
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,210
thank you.

452
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,360
From now on,

453
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,146
Liang Mu Ze's everything

454
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,450
is yours.

455
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,440
Well, if that's all right, aunty.

456
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,120
Here, cheers!

457
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,050
Turn right!

458
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,600
At ease!

459
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,566
Halt!

460
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,550
Switch post!

461
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,960
Is every department ready?

462
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,640
Okay, ready!

463
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,970
Rolling!

464
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,930
Three, two, one, action!

465
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,250
(My name is Liang Mu Ze.)

466
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,760
(It's the homophonic word of "a fine
fowl perches only on a fine tress".)

467
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,706
(I grew up, like most)

468
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,370
(of the teenagers,)

469
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,266
(under the protection)

470
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,850
(of my relatives and mentors
before I was 18 years old.)

471
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,590
(When I turned 18,)

472
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,100
(I entered the military school)

473
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,560
(and put the uniform on.)

474
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,130
Prepare to fight!

475
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,710
(Here)

476
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,496
(we fight like the scorching sun.)

477
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,920
(We become stronger.)

478
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,640
(Here)

479
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,460
(we cleave through the waves,)

480
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,890
(shed blood and tears.)

481
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,020
(Here)

482
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,996
(we reach for the sky.)

483
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,380
(We witness growth.)

484
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,100
(Here)

485
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,710
(we push the limits)

486
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,370
(and create glory.)

487
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,110
(Here)

488
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,086
(we grind the battlefield,)

489
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,500
(Dr.awing our sword.)

490
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,620
(Here)

491
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,656
(we pass on the spirit)

492
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,090
(of defending our dignity.)

493
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,400
(Here)

494
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,360
(we experienced extreme pain)

495
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,770
(and tasted the moment of pleasure.)

496
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,540
(Here)

497
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,450
(we lost the waywardness and
arrogance of our youth)

498
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,450
(and gained the unyielding
spirit of a man.)

499
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,480
(We water our youth with our blood!)

500
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,130
(We create the Great Steel Wall
with our responsibilities.)

501
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,236
(We share the same name)

502
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,630
(and the same faith!)

503
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,706
(We are)

504
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,856
(the Chinese People's Liberation Army!)

505
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,530
(The End)
