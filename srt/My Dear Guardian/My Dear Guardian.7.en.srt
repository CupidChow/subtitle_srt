00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:48,138
Please enjoy the food.

00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,276
About the show...

5
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:11,876
Currently, the form and content
have not been confirmed yet.

6
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:12,967
If you have any ideas,

7
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,499
feel free to tell me anytime.

8
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:15,837
Of course,

9
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,509
throughout the recording process,

10
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,650
we'll also fully respect your opinions.

11
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:25,961
-About the...
-How did you know Xia Chu?

12
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,611
We started as Internet friends.

13
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:40,806
I found an article
she wrote on the Internet...

14
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:42,917
about her first love.

15
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:44,721
At that time,

16
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,536
I was about to graduate from university.

17
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:48,076
I couldn't find a job yet.

18
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:50,761
Quota for postgraduate studies
had all been filled up.

19
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:51,865
My boyfriend wanted to break up with me.

20
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,286
I was extremely depressed.

21
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,761
But after reading her article,

22
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,751
I was inspired.

23
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:58,545
I replied to her article.

24
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:01,836
Then, we started texting
each other on WeChat.

25
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,241
Later on, we arranged a meet-up.

26
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,480
It's kind of weird.

27
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:11,376
Although our age gap is quite big...

28
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,425
and our personalities are so different,

29
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:16,466
but somehow we had endless
topics to talk about every time we meet.

30
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,378
Maybe it's because
we are both brilliant individuals...

31
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,949
and role models of outstanding
contemporary young women?

32
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,536
Hence we empathize and admire each other.

33
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,806
Did she ever mention to you about...

34
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,631
You?

35
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,040
Yes.

36
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,345
Me.

37
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:38,689
Of course she did.

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,390
She told me a lot
about your past with her.

39
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:42,426
What happened after that?

40
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,617
Was she in a new relationship?

41
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,960
She had a relationship
during her university years,

42
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:48,802
but it ended very soon.

43
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:50,546
She was too busy.

44
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,626
Too busy?

45
00:03:57,658 --> 00:03:59,198
Perhaps it was because she was too busy.

46
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,478
Perhaps it was because of other reasons.

47
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,450
Perhaps it was because of you.

48
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,604
What do you want to know?

49
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:14,946
(Long Yi)

50
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,636
Please excuse me.

51
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,625
His name is Liang Mu Ze.

52
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,796
He's from the Special Forces.

53
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,915
Now an army major.

54
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,616
Xia Chu is close to him.

55
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,440
They're living in together now.

56
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,111
I got it.

57
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:44,195
It's fine.

58
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:46,366
You should get going if you're busy.
Don't worry about me.

59
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:51,196
It's him.

60
00:04:58,815 --> 00:04:59,875
It's really him.

61
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,751
Are you okay?

62
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:15,786
(Outpatient Department)

63
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,056
Please clear the front.

64
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,588
Make way, please.

65
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,376
Please make way.

66
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,466
I'm sorry. You have to wait outside.

67
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:56,816
(Military and Police Take Down Drug Den)

68
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,596
Cheers to our final night together.

69
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,536
Is everyone ready?

70
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:14,560
This is the final test
of this military training program,

71
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,221
namely the endurance test.

72
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,236
It's the ultimate test of your willpower.

73
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:22,415
As soon as someone touches the tear gas,

74
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,916
I'll start the timer.

75
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:27,485
The test ends when each individual
leaves this room...

76
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,186
and marks will be added
into your final scores.

77
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,645
In other words,

78
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:33,335
as long as you stay
in this room long enough,

79
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,226
you can still catch up with the scores
although you were behind?

80
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:37,826
That's right.
Good luck to everyone.

81
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,677
It's going to be a tough one today.

82
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,454
Liang Mu Ze.

83
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:42,865
You'll put the tear gas

84
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,416
-into the pot.
-Okay.

85
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,536
Let's make a deal first.

86
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:50,136
Whoever leaves this room first
will buy everyone a meal.

87
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,967
-Sure.
-No problem.

88
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:54,636
Liang Mu Ze.

89
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:56,916
How could you start
without telling us first?

90
00:06:58,106 --> 00:06:59,446
I'm going all out.

91
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,305
I really want to know...

92
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:08,206
if you were ever defeated before
all these years in the force.

93
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,236
Of course he was.

94
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:12,726
I'll take him down today.

95
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,811
I want to know who that legend is.

96
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,566
I must meet him.

97
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,109
You can't meet him anymore.

98
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,356
He died in service.

99
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,399
If it wasn't for him,

100
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,610
I wouldn't be sitting here alive today.

101
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:27,586
This is wrong.

102
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:29,712
What did you say?

103
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,452
You should walk ahead of me.

104
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:34,816
Is there a difference?

105
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,030
It'll be the right direction
when you walk ahead of me.

106
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,476
Following you keeps me steady.

107
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,882
It has been eight years, Mu Ze.

108
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,944
You don't have to walk in my footsteps.

109
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:50,134
I need to.

110
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,316
To others,

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,140
many things may change in eight years.

112
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,416
But to me,

113
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:02,076
you'll always be my captain.

114
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:12,523
The patient is experiencing
ventricular tachycardia.

115
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,886
Get the defibrillator.
IV infusion, 100 mg of lidocaine.

116
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,716
Heart rate is back to normal.

117
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:28,726
Why did you drink so much today?

118
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:31,135
Don't you have to
return to the force tomorrow?

119
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,691
Stop drinking. It's bad for your stomach.

120
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:38,883
Tomorrow is an off day.

121
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,436
You cried?

122
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:44,466
Tear gas.

123
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:51,720
My head hurts.

124
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,606
I'll make you honey drink to sober up.

125
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,095
Sit down and talk with me.

126
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:30,246
Today is the anniversary of
Luo Liang's death.

127
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,016
Luo Liang?

128
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:33,040
Yes.

129
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:35,640
Xiao Jun's father.

130
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,950
You were right.

131
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:41,241
Eight years have passed.

132
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:45,237
But I still think he is here.

133
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,606
He is still by my side and in my life.

134
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,770
Sometimes when I'm in my dreams...

135
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:55,966
or when I had too much to drink,

136
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,131
I'll want to talk to him.

137
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,376
I can't believe and
accept the fact that...

138
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,726
he has totally disappeared from my life.

139
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:10,966
I can't accept it.

140
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:26,526
Luo Liang and I majored in
Special Forces Military Training.

141
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:30,046
We joined the Special Forces Brigade
after we graduated.

142
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,086
Like our Brigade Captain Dong Zhi Gang
always said,

143
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:36,341
"When two similar sharp edges
with the same shine meet,

144
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,886
sparks will fly when they collide."

145
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:43,185
We graduated the same year,

146
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,225
served under the same force,

147
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,846
and became platoon sergeants.

148
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:48,840
Everything was a competition between us.

149
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:54,626
We competed in our trainings
and shooting skills.

150
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:56,640
Start!

151
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:09,905
-Beat him!
-You can do it!

152
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:11,466
Even in the activity room
during break time,

153
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:14,840
we competed in arm wrestling.

154
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,655
You can do it!

155
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:21,206
You can do it!

156
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,640
Those were the days in the force.

157
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:24,886
Everything was a competition.

158
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:26,929
There must be a winner
and loser in everything.

159
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,800
Everyone gave his very best.

160
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:32,826
Being passionate in everything
was the law of survival in the force.

161
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:38,596
It was also a special way of expressing
the friendship between Luo Liang and me.

162
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,440
At that time, comrades
in the force would call us...

163
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:47,916
military elites who are equally matched.

164
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:53,000
When we were
at the peak of our competition,

165
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:58,246
the force wanted to form
a younger special operations force.

166
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,665
All the young officers
in the special force...

167
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,520
signed up for the position of captain.

168
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,925
After many rounds of tests,

169
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,880
it was down to Luo Liang and me.

170
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:11,561
How did it go?

171
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:12,822
I lost to him.

172
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:17,713
Why didn't you attend
our first training this afternoon?

173
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,826
I was tired so I didn't want to go.

174
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,376
No matter how tired you are,
you're still the lieutenant.

175
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,066
Bond with the team and train warriors.

176
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,335
The entire brigade is watching us now.

177
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:36,006
No matter how tired you are,
you have to endure it.

178
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:38,395
In that case, I'll withdraw
from Team Thunder tomorrow.

179
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:40,126
I don't care who becomes the lieutenant.

180
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,612
Now that I'm Team Thunder's captain,

181
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:46,664
you are dissatisfied?

182
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,051
Answer me.

183
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:52,355
Yes, I am.

184
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:54,206
Didn't you see the test results?

185
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:56,281
What makes you captain? Tell me.

186
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,201
What makes you?

187
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,210
The way you're behaving now
says that I'm more worthy.

188
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,639
You're not fit to be
captain of Team Thunder.

189
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,246
You don't even have
the basic qualities of a soldier.

190
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,778
Shut up.

191
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,398
I don't need a lecture from you.
Get lost.

192
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:14,555
As a soldier,

193
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:18,636
you rise from where you fall
on the battlefield.

194
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,655
Taking things personal like this,

195
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:24,339
giving others your attitude
and giving up on yourself...

196
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,320
make you a coward.

197
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:48,775
Do you feel better now?

198
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:50,368
Get up. Let's continue.

199
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:54,346
No.

200
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,035
You've already wasted a lot of energy
punching the sand bag today.

201
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,966
If we continue to fight,
I won't win fairly.

202
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:01,751
How are you so sure that you'll win?

203
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:04,754
We'll become rivals for a lifetime,
won't we?

204
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,566
There's still a long way to go.

205
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,927
We don't have to do this now.

206
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:15,926
The Brigade Captain told me that
you're a good sword.

207
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:17,936
But you still need to be sharpened.

208
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:23,326
It might do you good
that you're not captain.

209
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,225
Tomorrow morning at 9:00,

210
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,185
gather for indoor close-quarters combat.

211
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:30,036
I'm busy. You can proceed without me.

212
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:31,616
Don't you dare.

213
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,146
Sir.

214
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,579
Lieutenant of Team Thunder,

215
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,680
code name Whale, requests to return.

216
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,116
Fall in.

217
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,386
From today onwards,

218
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,596
not a single soldier here
will be left behind.

219
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,225
Do you hear me?

220
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,196
Only death will keep us apart.

221
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:09,736
Xiao Jun's mother said
you went on a mission together.

222
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes.

223
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,486
We went on a mission together

224
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:21,626
but he didn't return.

225
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:26,886
He was the only one who didn't return.

226
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,441
As usual,

227
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:49,025
write your will and
the receiver's address.

228
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,486
Submit it before you disembark.

229
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,990
Captain, aren't you going to write one?

230
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,839
Meng Zhen doesn't want to do it.

231
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,126
She said she'll be
waiting for me to go home.

232
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:11,486
Is she going to deliver soon?

233
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,486
One more month to go.

234
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,206
If I don't make it back,

235
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,535
you guys have to look after
the baby and her for me.

236
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,585
Don't worry.

237
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,373
Your son is also my son.

238
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,958
In your dreams!

239
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,146
Your parents are also my parents.

240
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:30,155
Your pet is also my pet.

241
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:34,989
Do you remember that poem we recited
during the joint activity?

242
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:37,363
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, Captain!

243
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:38,786
You start.

244
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:39,707
Yes, Captain.

245
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:44,506
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

246
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,127
Ready and go!

247
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:50,071
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

248
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:53,720
To war we are summoned,
So prep our weapon.

249
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:57,501
We'll fight against one foe.
Why do you say I am bare?

250
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,236
Why do you say I am bare?

251
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,226
Why do you say I am bare?

252
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:22,743
Are you okay?

253
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,986
I want some honey drink.

254
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,196
I'll go get it.

255
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,516
Here you go. I made soup too.

256
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:51,655
Sister-in-law, let me do it.

257
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,396
-How does it taste?
-It's delicious.

258
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,195
-You like the taste?
-It's so delicious.

259
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,576
-Eat more if you like it.
-It's so good.

260
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:01,465
Go help out in the kitchen.

261
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:02,446
Yes.

262
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,174
I have more coming up.

263
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:06,239
Don't tire yourself out.

264
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,618
Take a seat, sister-in-law.
I'll get them.

265
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,025
-Alright.
-Help me with this.

266
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:09,946
Give it to me.

267
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,706
-Put them here.
-I'll do it.

268
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:15,696
Take a seat.

269
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:18,455
This soup looks good. You made this?

270
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,036
Yes. It took me the whole afternoon.

271
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:24,275
Let me do it myself.
They're looking at us.

272
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:25,736
We are used to it already.

273
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:27,696
So what if they are looking?

274
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,240
I'm just being a good role model.

275
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,428
When they get married and have a family,

276
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,089
they must know how to love their wives.

277
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:36,830
Captain, teach me will do.

278
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:38,791
Our Lieutenant doesn't
need help with that.

279
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,738
After being admitted
into the military hospital,

280
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:44,799
he received a huge sack of love letters.

281
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,401
Food can't shut you up.

282
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:47,595
Are you envious?

283
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,176
Good for you, you little punk.

284
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:52,056
Nothing catches your heart
in that sack of love letters?

285
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,216
That's not it.
It's just that I'm still young.

286
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:55,397
I'm not in a hurry.

287
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:57,476
You're not but I am.
Sister-in-law.

288
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:00,221
Can you introduce someone to me?

289
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:02,046
Sure. I'll match you up with someone.

290
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,307
What kind of girl do you like?

291
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,796
I'm shy to say this but
I really don't ask for much.

292
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:08,146
As long as

293
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,855
she's as pretty as you.

294
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,395
Isn't that asking for too much?

295
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,960
How should I say this...

296
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,055
In order to meet my wife,

297
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,246
I gave up half of my life.

298
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,000
Great.

299
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:31,296
Captain Luo is talking
very weirdly today.

300
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:32,665
I'm not used to it.

301
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:33,886
That's because I'm happy.

302
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:37,756
I'm becoming a father soon.

303
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,250
This is a big news!

304
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,385
It's great news!

305
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:47,944
-Here's to you, sister-in-law.
-Alright.

306
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:49,485
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

307
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:56,646
I want to have a word with you two.

308
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,855
After this meal today,

309
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:01,816
I want you to really train yourself hard.

310
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,095
Not only train yourself,

311
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,428
but everyone in our team too.

312
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:09,956
We can't be all form but no substance.

313
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:12,737
We must demand of ourselves
actual combat standard

314
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,411
Don't go easy.

315
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:18,103
Don't go soft. Don't be lenient.

316
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:23,006
I hope everyone
is sturdy and indestructible.

317
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:26,453
I hope everyone come back safely
after every mission.

318
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,452
I want to see results, not accidents.

319
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,036
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, Captain.

320
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:34,336
-Let's toast.
-Here.

321
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,271
Cheers to my wife. You've worked hard.

322
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:46,864
I just finished my work.

323
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:47,955
Place your order first.

324
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,666
Once I arrive, we can start eating.

325
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:01,906
I am sorry.

326
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,285
It's okay.

327
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,309
Is Zhuo Ran's family member here?

328
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,260
Yes.

329
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:09,174
-You're Zhuo Ran's kin?
-Yes.

330
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:10,324
Zhuo Ran?

331
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:11,385
That's right.

332
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,125
Patient experienced
ventricular tarchycardia.

333
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,536
We've checked the cardiac markers.

334
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:18,656
Myoglobin and troponin have
substantially increased.

335
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:20,815
Patient's condition has stabilised now,

336
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,210
but he's still unconscious.

337
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:24,511
I suspect that
it's a heart-related problem.

338
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,687
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?

339
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:40,175
Can you hear me?

340
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,387
Xia Chu.

341
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,287
Xia Chu.

342
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,545
Xia Chu.

343
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:06,686
He knows Xia Chu?

344
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:08,720
Xia Chu.

345
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,666
Did this happen before?

346
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,666
I'm not sure about that.

347
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,406
I just got to know him recently.

348
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:18,937
It's for work.

349
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,366
When this happened,
what was he doing?

350
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:23,496
Eating and talking.

351
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,082
Everything was normal?

352
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:26,876
Yes.

353
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:30,554
While we were eating,

354
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:31,965
he received a phone call.

355
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:33,685
After that, his mood changed.

356
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,226
He passed out before I got a chance
to ask him what happened.

357
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:38,606
-Have you done the imaging test on him?
-Not yet.

358
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:41,855
Here's the thing.
Since his family member is not present,

359
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:45,206
we can only let the doctor decide about
his treatment plan.

360
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:46,435
As his friend,

361
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:49,096
can you sign the letter of permission?

362
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,160
-I can.
-Alright.

378
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:55,228
Don't forget to get her a present.

379
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:57,080
All right.

380
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,244
Present?

381
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:06,897
What should I get her?

382
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,716
Have you found the origin of
the blue diamond on the cane?

383
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:34,855
Investigate it quickly.

384
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:42,455
I can't leave.

385
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:44,825
He's still in the emergency room.
No one is here but me.

386
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,746
I have to accompany him.

387
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:48,654
You must be worried.

388
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,510
I'm hanging up.

389
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,858
How is it? Is it serious?

390
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:56,776
We found a problem
based on his electrocardiogram.

391
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:59,797
However, it's not a typical
pattern of myocardial infarction.

392
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:02,474
We'll wait for
the cardiology doctor to arrive...

393
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:04,295
and do a radiography
on his coronary artery.

394
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:13,006
There's an emergency here.

396
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:15,625
A patient in the emergency room
is in need of an operation.

397
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,206
I'm held up by the director.

398
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:19,461
Alright.

399
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:20,640
Okay. Let's meet up another time.

400
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,865
I am sorry for holding you up.

401
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:25,181
It's just a small matter.

402
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:28,486
Actually, I'm also a friend of Zhuo Ran.

403
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,705
But if you still feel bad about it,

404
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,846
you can add me on WeChat
as a consolation.

405
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,312
I'll scan your code.

406
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,233
Sure.

407
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,396
I'm Zhang Yi Chi, a cardio surgeon.

408
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,800
You are?

409
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:51,866
I'm Mi Gu.

410
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:54,897
Nice to meet you.

411
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,490
Miss Mi Gu, what's the update
on your proposal?

412
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:16,951
The director is asking about it again.

413
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,286
Good morning.

414
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:03,202
How did I fall asleep?

415
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:04,667
You'll have to ask yourself.

416
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:06,296
After I poured you a cup of honey drink,

417
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:07,465
you were already fast asleep.

418
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:08,886
I couldn't even wake you up.

419
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:11,305
How do you feel?

420
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,356
Does it feel good to
sleep through the night?

421
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,985
Alright now, Captain Liang.
You should go wash up.

422
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,625
Come and have your breakfast
after you're done.

423
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,766
Start repenting later.

424
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,416
I made the yogurt and jam myself.

425
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,625
It's all natural.

426
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,385
Wholemeal slices and nuts...

427
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:35,474
can protect your mucosa
and blood vessels that were damaged...

428
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:36,897
after exposing to tear gas.

429
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:38,112
And of course,

430
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:43,236
this freshly-blended mixed fruits juice
that is rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin B.

431
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,305
They work as a lubricant
to speed up the detoxification process.

432
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,646
The top choice for defeating poisoning.

433
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,446
A good day starts with good breakfast.

434
00:32:52,786 --> 00:32:53,806
Let's do it, Captain Liang.

435
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:07,385
You were more adorable last night.

436
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:08,476
That's enough, Xia Chu.

437
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:12,621
I'm serious.

438
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:18,118
I thought you lack emotion...

439
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,242
and nothing can touch you heart.

440
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,032
But after listening to
what you said last night...

441
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:24,333
I didn't say anything.

442
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,876
Nothing at all.

443
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:29,882
Fine.

444
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:43,326
I made an appointment for you
with the psychiatrist in my hospital.

445
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,193
What?

446
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,141
Send me to work at nine o'clock today
and then go for your appointment.

447
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:50,962
I'm busy. I have training.

448
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,055
Isn't your training over?

449
00:33:53,346 --> 00:33:55,006
I don't need to see a psychiatrist.

450
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:57,185
Of course you do.

451
00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:59,326
Although you're from the special forces,
you're still a human.

452
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:01,326
If you want to sleep in peace at night...

453
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:03,152
Liang Mu Ze.

454
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:07,356
Look what I've got.

455
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,605
Meow. Let me take a look too.

456
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:22,320
Will you go now?

457
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:28,835
You're threatening me.

458
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:30,304
Yes.

459
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,409
Alright. I got it.

460
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,763
Dr. Li, you want to see me?

461
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,564
The radiography report of
the patient who experienced...

462
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:42,895
a sudden ventricular tachycardia is out.

463
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:45,945
He has been transferred
to cardiology ward?

464
00:34:45,986 --> 00:34:47,030
There is no vacant bed yet.

465
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:49,060
I'll get him transferred
once someone gets discharged.

466
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,299
Okay.

467
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:52,914
I'll check at the emergency department.

468
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,072
Hold on.

469
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,636
You bailed on your parents again?

470
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:01,949
How did you know?

471
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,866
Your mother told me.

472
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,606
She wants me to remind you
to have your meals regularly.

473
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,831
I realised that you're becoming
more virtuous lately.

474
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:18,356
Men like women like that, don't they?

475
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:23,886
It seems like my effort
as training partner is not in vain.

476
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:26,945
You've grown up.

477
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,566
Of course I have to.

478
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:29,760
That's great.

479
00:35:35,722 --> 00:35:37,120
Let's meet at the same
place this weekend.

480
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:38,073
I'll be waiting for you.

481
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:45,960
Where is that?

482
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,549
You're awake. Are you feeling better?

483
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,800
Where is Xia Chu?

484
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,890
I haven't contacted her yet.

485
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,895
Do you want to eat something?

486
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:32,006
I'll go buy some food for you.

487
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,666
Can you get me a bottle of mineral water?

488
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:39,735
Okay, I'll buy you some porridge too.

489
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:41,135
You haven't eaten anything
the whole night.

490
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,066
You must be hungry.

491
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,380
There's a stall selling steamed buns
opposite the hospital.

492
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:45,705
The steamed buns are especially delicious.

493
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,166
I'll buy you some.

494
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,606
Thank you.

495
00:36:51,597 --> 00:36:52,477
I'll be right back.

496
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:12,336
Seeing a psychiatrist is not a big deal.

497
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:14,874
It's just like talking
to a hole in a tree.

498
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,123
Let me tell you this.

499
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:22,065
Human brains are just like a container
filled with different emotions.

500
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,366
Sometimes, you'll have to empty it out.

501
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:26,200
If you don't,

502
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,680
it will explode.

503
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:33,829
I'm getting off now.

504
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,760
Liang Mu Ze,
you must attend the appointment.

505
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:40,983
You must.

506
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,120
You really must.

507
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:51,917
Make way please.

508
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,320
Xia Chu?

509
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:55,080
Xia Chu.

510
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:56,001
Mi Gu.

511
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:57,400
-Xia Chu.
-Mi Gu.

512
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,317
Xia Chu.

513
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:00,280
Mi...

514
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,334
-Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.
-What?

515
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,915
Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.

516
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:28,294
The radiograph of your left ventricle
and coronary artery...

517
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:29,395
shows no sign of infarction.

518
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,526
We can eliminate the possibility of
myocardial infarction.

519
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:34,280
However, we've found that
at the apex of your heart,

520
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,520
most of the ventricles don't contract.

521
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:38,343
From the radiography,

522
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,318
a swollen ventricle that looked
like a wilting octopus is seen...

523
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,566
and the markers of myocardial damage
has started to increase.

524
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:46,461
It means...

525
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:48,785
death of heart muscles.

526
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,551
Judging by your current condition,

527
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:54,234
I can say that the dizziness...

528
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:58,745
and chest-pain is all due to
stress cardiomyopathy.

529
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,143
Stress cardiomyopathy?

530
00:39:02,742 --> 00:39:03,975
You've always been healthy.

531
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:05,346
You even wanted to
get into a military school.

532
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,927
How can you have stress cardiomyopathy?

533
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:10,876
Xia Chu.

534
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:15,425
This condition is usually caused by...

535
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,811
intense emotional or physical stress.

536
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:18,902
For example,

537
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,273
a shock,

538
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:25,593
deep fear or a sudden loss of a loved one
which can cause an epilepsy attack.

539
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,646
In your case, it's because
of a phone call.

540
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:37,551
I want to talk to Xia Chu in private.

541
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:39,813
No problem.

542
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,004
Don't get worked up.

543
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,170
Do your ward rounds 20 minutes later.

544
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:48,080
Yes.

545
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:56,966
Liang Mu Ze.

546
00:39:58,887 --> 00:39:59,867
Why are you here?

547
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,055
I'm looking for someone.

548
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:01,985
Is it Zhuo Ran?

549
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:02,926
No, Xia Chu.

550
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,939
Why is everyone asking for her today?

551
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,410
-Who else did?
-Director Zhang.

552
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:09,054
I just got a call
from Cardio Surgery Department.

553
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:10,945
They need you to check on ward 18.

554
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:12,726
-Alright, I got it.
-I'll get back to work now.

555
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:16,845
She is in that ward.

556
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:17,786
Go on.

557
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,045
I met Mi Gu just now.

558
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:31,576
She told me you're in the hospital.

559
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:35,640
She sent you here?

560
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,778
You were together last night?

561
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,920
What's with the phone call?

562
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,339
You have to tell me, Zhuo Ran.

563
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:50,952
What did you call me just now?

564
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,150
Zhuo Ran.

565
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:53,560
You still remember this person,

566
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:55,522
don't you?

567
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:01,379
Of course I do.

568
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,486
What are you saying?

569
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:07,669
You do remember.

570
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:12,955
You should also remember
those weekends you spent together,

571
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:15,593
those detective novels we read together,

572
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:17,708
the path we took together after school,

573
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,028
that bottle of water,

574
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,646
that diary and the never-ending
letters you wrote each other.

575
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,796
All those memories
were your past with Zhuo Ran.

576
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,071
It's Zhuo Ran.

577
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,292
Xia Chu, it's Zhuo Ran.

578
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,439
It's Zhuo Ran.

579
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:31,905
Calm down, Zhuo Ran.

580
00:41:31,946 --> 00:41:32,966
-You can't get up...
-This.

581
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:38,040
This part of me almost stopped beating
just now.

582
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:39,326
It's because...

583
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:44,258
I was sad that you forgot Zhuo Ran.

584
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,150
I need to do my ward rounds now.
I'll visit you later.

585
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:57,257
That comrade...

586
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,460
Don't be with him.

587
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,869
Are you kidding me?

588
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:12,861
It can't be him.

589
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:23,147
Anyone can misunderstand
my relationship with him,

590
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:25,467
but not you.

591
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:28,203
For a very long time,

592
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,845
I can't even stand hearing the words,
special force.

593
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:32,547
Let alone getting into a relationship.

594
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:36,914
You should know the reason.

595
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,280
Xia Chu.

596
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:54,753
Why are you here?

597
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,190
It was in the car?

598
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:02,279
I'm so forgetful.

599
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,820
Sorry for causing you trouble.

600
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,240
Thank you.

601
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:09,000
Where are you going?

602
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,033
I'm going to visit Xiao Jun.

603
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:11,564
Have you seen the psychiatrist?

604
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,300
I am talking to you.

605
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,270
-No, I didn't.
-Why?

606
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:17,604
I don't want to.

607
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,506
Liang Mu Ze,
do you still want the photo?

608
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:23,075
It's up to you.

609
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:40,969
Where are you?
