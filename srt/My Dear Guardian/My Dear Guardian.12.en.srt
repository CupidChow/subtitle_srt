00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,130
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:47,320
Old Master.

4
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,466
It's been a while, Zhuo Ran.

5
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:56,845
Old Master.

6
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,160
How is it going with the company?

7
00:01:58,856 --> 00:01:59,880
Everything is going well.

8
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,996
But I've heard that there has been
a little trouble with this task.

9
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,645
It's just a bit tortuous, that's all.

10
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:05,560
Tortuous?

11
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:08,480
This doesn't sound like your
usual way of doing things.

12
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,501
Old Master,

13
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,294
I have flexible ways to get things done,

14
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:12,715
it depends on the target.

15
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,924
Approaching the target's daughter,
I get it.

16
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:18,000
But why mess with the army?

17
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,135
In order to remove all obstacles,

18
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:23,156
to hold the daughter card in our hands.

19
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:25,409
Isn't that what you sent me to China for?

20
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,016
So...

21
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:30,373
you are acting in
the interest of the company,

22
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,324
is that right?

23
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:32,506
Of course.

24
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:34,847
There's nothing personal here.

25
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,560
Good.

26
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,729
Trusting you is a right decision.

27
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,790
Thank you for your trust, Old Master.

28
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:45,280
Zhuo Ran,

29
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:49,600
your mother hasn't been
in the best of health lately.

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,215
Can I talk to her for a minute?

31
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,560
She's resting.

32
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:56,054
The doctor said,

33
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:57,943
her blood vessels that
have been bypassed before...

34
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,084
are blocked again.

35
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,925
Looks like the medicine isn't working.

36
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,480
She needs a heart transplant.

37
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:05,704
You should finish the task
as soon as possible...

38
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:08,045
so that you can come back early.

39
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:11,058
Without her son around,

40
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,919
how am I supposed to arrange...

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,000
such a major operation for her,
am I right?

42
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:18,360
I got it.

43
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay, that's all.

44
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,560
I'll be waiting for the good news.

45
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:43,743
Old Master,

46
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:44,680
he is lying.

47
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:49,039
He didn't approach the military major...

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,580
simply to complete the task
you assigned him.

49
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:57,720
Long Yi,

50
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,840
do you know the tips of flying a kite?

51
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,120
The wind direction,
wind force, running speed...

52
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,871
and the timing to pull the string,

53
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,554
if you can get these things right,

54
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:15,926
the kite will fly high and far.

55
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,030
However,

56
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,326
no matter how high or how far it flies,

57
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,265
as long as the string is still in my hand,

58
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,176
it will never fly away.

59
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:31,960
Old Master,

60
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:34,662
I'm going back to China tomorrow then.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,136
Do one more thing for me before you leave.

62
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:39,920
Okay.

63
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,722
Get rid of Gui.

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,724
He approached my client
without permission.

65
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,593
I'm afraid he's getting greedy.

66
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:48,546
Got it.

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,320
Thanks.

68
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:08,675
If you really want to read that book,

70
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,280
I can buy you another one online.

71
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,587
Never mind, I'll go back and look again.

72
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:15,240
Okay.

73
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,678
Have you met with Mi Gu lately?

74
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:22,440
Lately?

75
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,787
We met once after we came
back from the flood relief mission.

76
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:29,599
What's the matter?

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,680
You want to talk to her?

78
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,141
No, I'm just asking.

79
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,056
Mr. Zhang asked you
to find out about this for him, didn't he?

80
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,000
No.

81
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:42,586
It's very obvious that Mr. Zhang
has a thing for Mi Gu.

82
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:46,966
I just didn't expect you would do such
meddlesome thing.

83
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,606
Once again, you're out of
character, Captain Liang.

84
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,520
Bye.

85
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:59,273
(Outpatient Department)

86
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,596
Liang Mu Ze, come to the
flower shop now, it's an emergency.

87
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:20,288
The most crucial first
step in floral arrangement...

88
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,585
is to choose the right color scheme,

89
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:24,025
avoid using too many different colours.

90
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:25,075
For example,

91
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,686
these three colours I use seem more...

92
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:32,799
Avoid using too many different colours.

93
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,954
For example,

94
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,835
choose the colours based
on the age and personality...

95
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,680
of the person you are
giving the flower basket to.

96
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,191
When I chose this gladiolus,

97
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,080
we should trim its roots.

98
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,016
What brings you here?

99
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:46,942
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:53,360
Xiao Jun's little girlfriend
sent him a postcard,

101
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,501
I came here to give it to him.

102
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,560
Since I'm here, I stayed to
learn about floral arrangement,

103
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,941
cultivate my taste.

104
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:00,447
Meng Zhen, where's Xiao Jun?

105
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,521
He's upstairs, go and see him.

106
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,680
I'll be upstairs then.

107
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,136
Enjoy your class.

108
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,430
To make it absorb more water,

109
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,891
I cut it diagonally.

110
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,278
Xiao Jun.

111
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,469
Liang Mu Ze, you're finally here.

112
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:27,239
Hurry up, show me the moves
of the military boxing skill again.

113
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,352
-Now.
-What's the matter?

114
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:29,560
Who picked on you again?

115
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:32,166
No one, it's for Xuan Xuan.

116
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:33,518
A month ago,

117
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,459
she sent a postcard to the hospital.

118
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:37,727
But by the time it arrived,
I was already discharged.

119
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,598
Dr. Zhang just gave it to me today.

120
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,241
She mentioned in her postcard that
she wanted to see me...

121
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,262
do the military boxing
skill on her birthday.

122
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:47,654
But I can't remember some of the moves.

123
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:48,844
This is the emergency?

124
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,064
-This is very important to me, okay?
-Okay.

125
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:52,080
Xiao Jun!

126
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,240
What's the matter?

127
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:55,720
Nothing.

128
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,964
Mu Ze, would you like to stay for dinner?

129
00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:58,960
Sure.

130
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,194
Xiao Jun,

131
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,805
stop pestering Mu Ze all the time.

132
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,591
He just came back, he's tired.
Give him a break.

133
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:05,616
It's okay. Let me hang
with him for a while.

134
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:06,757
Okay.

135
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:12,233
Have you done your homework?

136
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,234
Just a little bit left.

137
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,394
Finish your homework first.

138
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:15,361
Yes, Sir!

139
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:17,680
You need to do this.

140
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,821
Yes, Sir!

141
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,440
Why are you here alone?

142
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,320
Meng Zhen went food shopping.

143
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
She's making you a welcome-back dinner.

144
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:36,920
Look.

145
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,600
That's me right there.

146
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,463
Looking good, right?

147
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,320
I looked sharp in military uniform.

148
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:48,680
Does he work for your hospital?

149
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,061
No.

150
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:53,514
Their company
has set up a fund in our hospital...

151
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:54,945
called Public Interest Research Fund.

152
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,134
That day,

153
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:58,089
Xia Chu's friend said she
wanted to interview me,

154
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,262
so I took her to record some footage.

155
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:00,653
I didn't expect that
she actually aired them.

156
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,486
Xia Chu's friend? Mi Gu?

157
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes.

158
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,640
Director Mi said
in her next show, she is planning to...

159
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,920
interview urban independent bookshops.

160
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:18,391
I think I should recommend
Meng Zhen's shop to her.

161
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,652
It'll be good publicity for her shop.

162
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
Who? What did you call her?

163
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,341
Meng Zhen.

164
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,560
Chen Meng Zhen.

165
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:27,799
Nice, right?

166
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,800
Not only is her name nice,

167
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,440
she's very beautiful too.

168
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,946
And she's elegant.

169
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:36,834
Not only does she know how to enjoy life,

170
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,093
she also has great business mind.

171
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,724
Look how well she manages her small shop.

172
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,166
Whoever gets to marry her
will be a very lucky man.

173
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,413
Dr. Zhang, do you come here often?

174
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:50,634
No, this is my first time.

175
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,120
I will come here more often from now on.

176
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,120
Don't come here again.

177
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,560
Don't hit on her.

178
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,294
I'm not hitting on her.

179
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:01,000
If you are making a mistake,
you must correct it.

180
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,232
Wait, correct what?

181
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,531
I'm an unmarried man
who admires a single woman.

182
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,286
There's nothing wrong with that.

183
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:11,973
Meng Zhen is different.

184
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,118
Besides, I know fully well what
you are into, Dr. Zhang.

185
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,460
You can admire Meng Zhen,
just don't hit on her.

186
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:21,061
If she and Xiao Jun
are hurt because of you,

187
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,160
I won't let you off.

188
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,577
Let me ask you a question.

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,896
What's your relationship with her?

190
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,040
With Meng Zhen? She's the
widow of my fallen comrade.

191
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,821
I know she's the widow
of your fallen comrade.

192
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,046
So she's not your lover, is she?

193
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:38,455
In any case,

194
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,166
even if I'm interested
in Chen Meng Zhen...

195
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,427
Meng Zhen, you're back!

196
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,519
I forgot my phone.

197
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,835
Don't mind me.

198
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,046
You guys carry on.

199
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:48,065
I'll be back soon.

200
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,448
-Dinner will be ready when I get back.
-Okay.

201
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:50,729
-Take your time.
-Okay.

202
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,251
Don't buy too much food.

203
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:55,952
She's so nice.

204
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:57,680
Go back. Are you
really going to stay for dinner?

205
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,717
Shouldn't I leave after dinner?

206
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,320
No dinner for you, just go.

207
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,838
Honestly, I was just joking.

208
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,979
Did you fall for it?

209
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,440
Fine, I'll leave.

210
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,863
I can see that if I really stay,

211
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,204
you're going to lose your appetite.

212
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,059
All right now, just go.

213
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:19,480
Doesn't your hospital have a
toxicology and pharmacology laboratory?

214
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,160
Yes, the best in the city. Why?

215
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:23,364
Examine this bottle of pills for me.

216
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,200
Is this an official task
or a private favour?

217
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,720
A tough ask. Just go already.

218
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,600
Fine, leave it to me.

219
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:39,400
How are the patients?

220
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:43,395
Mr. Zhang, what are you doing here?

221
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,720
Isn't today your off day?

222
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,595
I'm running an errand for a friend.

223
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm just dropping by to...

224
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,665
bring you girls some food.

225
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:52,680
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

226
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,595
Most of the patients are doing fine,

227
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:58,326
except for one patient
who just had a heart surgery.

228
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,585
After he woke up,

229
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,817
his emotions became
unusually sensitive and fragile.

230
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,225
According to his wife's description,

231
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,166
he has become a totally different person.

232
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,063
His personality changed?

233
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,794
I looked into the heart donor.

234
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,985
He was a young man in his 20s,

235
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,006
who loved to read and write poetry.

236
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,195
When he was recuperating,

237
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,055
he even composed nearly 100 song lyrics.

238
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:21,632
You are saying that
his personality changed,

239
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,893
because he has someone else's
heart in his body now?

240
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,120
I was just thinking that...

241
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,946
since the heart delivers
blood to the whole body,

242
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,631
including the brain,

243
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,504
is it possible that...

244
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,856
when some of the donor's stem cells
reach the brain,

245
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:39,504
it has affected the memory
function of the recipient,

246
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,765
and that this could
be a sign of rejection?

247
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,566
I think you are overthinking this.

248
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,882
It's actually a
psychological implication.

249
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:48,995
Think about it,

250
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,286
a man who has been suffered
from heart disease for over 20 years,

251
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,665
had a narrow escape from death.

252
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,745
He has received a second chance to live,

253
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:57,696
it's completely normal that
his personality has changed dramatically.

254
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:01,793
Besides, he also knew that his donor
was a young man in his 20s.

255
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,640
And unconsciously,

256
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,280
it could affect him
psychologically too, right?

257
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:10,296
It's hard to tell about such stuff.

258
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,783
There's one thing
I've always been curious about.

259
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:15,735
You see, about the Chinese
characters invented by our ancestors,

260
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:19,090
the one word that associates
with emotions and feelings,

261
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,191
is 'heart'.

262
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,647
You see,

263
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,988
when one sees a pretty
woman, his heart flutters.

264
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,428
When one falls in love,
he finds his heart's desire.

265
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,124
When one has a breakup, his heart breaks.

266
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,400
Am I right?

267
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:34,696
Could there be something that
cannot be explained medically in this?

268
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:36,034
How about this?

269
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:38,001
Go talk to the doctors
in psychiatry department,

270
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,252
they may have better advice.

271
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,191
Okay, I'll go now.

272
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,982
Dr. Zhang,

273
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,973
there's something wrong
with those pills you gave me.

274
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,606
Hang in there, Liang Mu Ze.

275
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:18,880
Go now.

276
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:25,400
What's wrong with them?

277
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:27,694
The compound of these pills are a bit odd.

278
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,176
Where did you get it from?

279
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:30,480
Don't bother with where did I get it from.

280
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,440
You just need to tell me
if it's toxic or not.

281
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,074
Fine.

282
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,046
I'll let you know when
the results are out.

283
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,357
-Be quick.
-Okay.

284
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,400
-And don't tell anyone else.
-Okay.

285
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,440
Mr. Zhang.

286
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
What are you doing back here?

287
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,416
Did you get that bottle of pills just now
from Liang Mu Ze?

288
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,400
He told you too?

289
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,116
He's such a big mouth.

290
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,120
He even asked me to keep it a secret.

291
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:58,600
Why did he want to examine it?

292
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,452
Why do you care...

293
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,880
about his affairs?

294
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,301
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

295
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:22,940
(Outpatient Department)

296
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:35,840
Get in the car.

297
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,126
Did you take the bottle
of pills I gave you?

298
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,080
I did.

299
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,481
Is there a problem?

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,840
No.

301
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:45,640
Then why did you ask Mr. Zhang
to find someone to examine it for you?

302
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:47,281
Zhang Yi Chi told you?

303
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,520
I saw it myself.

304
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,791
What exactly are you
thinking about, Liang Mu Ze?

305
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,613
Did you think I gave you fake drug?

306
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:54,640
No.

307
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,320
This has nothing to do with you.

308
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,640
Who does this have to do with then?

309
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:00,257
-Get in the car first.
-Why exactly?

310
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:01,446
You have to give me an explanation.

311
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,590
Otherwise, I will think
my good intention has been misunderstood.

312
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,480
I'll explain it after
the results are out.

313
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,576
Fine then.

314
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,999
I'll see you when the results are out.

315
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,890
Rao Zhi, okay, I'll be right there.

316
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,240
Uncle Rao.

317
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,565
I hope I didn't disturb you.

318
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,074
You didn't.

319
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,240
What are you doing here?

320
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,586
I once made a promise to your aunt.

321
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,200
No matter how busy I am,

322
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:50,116
I must take one day per week
to spend time with her and our daughter.

323
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,526
In the past,

324
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,277
we visited this park often.

325
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:59,336
They would feed the pigeons
and I would doze off on this bench,

326
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:02,755
occasionally woken by their laughter,

327
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:07,144
watching them running around.

328
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,427
At that time,

329
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,322
I felt that no matter how hard
and exhausting my works were,

330
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,080
it was worth it.

331
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,452
Xue is coming back home.

332
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:20,600
She didn't listen to me.

333
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,600
She only informed me
after she booked the flight.

334
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:25,453
But Mu Ze,

335
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:26,680
I can't see her.

336
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,040
I understand.

337
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:30,745
Send me her flight number,

338
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,116
leave the rest to me.

339
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:33,760
Thanks.

340
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:35,558
By the way,

341
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,296
you said you suspected someone
had broken into your house.

342
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,659
I've gotten someone
to pull the CCTV footage...

343
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,640
from the streets around.

344
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:43,335
There are a lot of footage.

345
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,686
It might take some time.

346
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,320
It's okay, no hurry.

347
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:48,664
I've installed CCTV in my home.

348
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,560
If anything happens,
I'll be the first to find out.

349
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:52,679
After that,

350
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,510
is there anything else unusual happen?

351
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:56,687
Someone switched my usual medication.

352
00:17:58,645 --> 00:17:59,680
Who did it?

353
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,772
I'm getting the ingredients
of the medicine checked.

354
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,993
I will contact you if there is a problem.

355
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:08,280
Uncle Rao,

356
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,240
have you ever thought that

357
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:14,286
if you let Xue and Aunt
see you at work,

358
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:17,000
all misunderstandings would be cleared?

359
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,833
I've always thought that...

360
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:21,640
the elimination of crime is not
really about anything else,

361
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:25,148
it's to protect their smiles.

362
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:30,523
But sometimes there is more evil
in the world than we can imagine.

363
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,480
Honestly,

364
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,280
I don't dare to risk it.

365
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,480
I'd rather keep them far away.

366
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,464
Old Master, we have a problem.

367
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:47,987
Several of our processing plants
outside the country have been robbed.

368
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:48,880
All the goods are gone.

369
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:50,600
-Who did it?
-Gui.

370
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:52,063
You sure?

371
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:53,064
Without doubt.

372
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,960
And I just got word that
he's on a boat to China.

373
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,791
Notify Zhuo Ran.

374
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:01,680
Yes.

375
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,200
Who is this?

376
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,680
Mi Gu.

377
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,320
What's the matter with you?
Why do you look so nervous?

378
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:34,841
The lift pervert is back.

379
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,560
He almost got into my place today.

380
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:40,560
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

381
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:42,794
Running into such a pervert,

382
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:44,225
why are you so unlucky?

383
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,320
It's all because...

384
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:47,480
Because of what?

385
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,960
Because I've been down on my luck.

386
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,000
Have you had dinner?

387
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm so mad that I've lost my appetite.

388
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:03,298
Has that annoying colleague
of yours set you up again?

389
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,879
It's that braised egg, Liang Mu Ze.

390
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:09,507
He actually took the medicine
I gave him to our hospital for testing.

391
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,734
What is he thinking about?

392
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:15,281
Did he seriously think that
I would take advantage of...

393
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,822
my own profession to poison his drug?

394
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,080
Am I that wicked to him?

395
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,120
Xia Chu.

396
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:21,868
I've made up my mind.

397
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:23,560
This time, I'm really going to move out.

398
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:24,831
I don't want to share a place...

399
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:25,960
with a man who has such
evil thoughts anymore.

400
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:28,133
What if he did find out something?

401
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:29,354
What can he find out?

402
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,115
I gave him that drug personally.

403
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:32,256
It's impossible that there's
something wrong with it.

404
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:33,960
I switched the pills.

405
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,800
What do you mean by that?

406
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:46,046
The day I went to pick up Er Miao,

407
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:49,656
I replaced the bottle of pills
with tranquillizers.

408
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,440
You...

409
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,960
Why?

410
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,607
Because of Zhuo Ran.

411
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,120
He was really worried about you.

412
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,886
Xia Chu isn't doing good.

413
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,080
When I had a meal
with her the other day,

414
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:11,560
I noticed that she was very tense
and stressed.

415
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,475
It can't be.
I just had a video chat with her,

416
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,326
she seemed fine.

417
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,555
She even told me that
she was going to join...

418
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:19,845
the frontline of flood relief
with her medical team.

419
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,120
She has been avoiding me.

420
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,205
My return this time
seems to have made her feel distressed.

421
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,360
You want me to talk to her?

422
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,705
What is this?

423
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:39,760
Tranquillizer.

424
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,861
Xia Chu has
a history of sleeping pill addiction.

425
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,656
It's a bad habit
she picked up after I left.

426
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:49,802
I knew that.

427
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,880
But she hasn't had
insomnia for a long time.

428
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,726
But I'm still worried.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm afraid that she would relapse.

430
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,186
You've been keeping an eye on her?

431
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,200
Yes.

432
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:00,680
What do you want me to do?

433
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:05,028
Find a chance to go
through her backpack.

434
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,919
If you find those pills,

435
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,140
replace them with this.

436
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:10,768
Its dose is very small,

437
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,089
equivalent to a placebo.

438
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,060
It won't affect her much if she eats it.

439
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:17,360
You and I both want her to be well,
right?

440
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,160
I really thought that
bottle of pills were yours.

441
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:25,280
Are you guys close?

442
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,199
If you aren't close,

443
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,760
things like switching my pills,

444
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:31,960
why would he come to you?

445
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,781
Because he knows we are good friends.

446
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:36,455
Last time when he suddenly fell ill,

447
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:37,960
you were the one who
took him to the hospital.

448
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,357
We were talking about work that time.

449
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:41,360
Mi Gu,

450
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:44,520
I want the truth.

451
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,560
Xia Chu,

452
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,296
do you remember the man at the airport...

453
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,164
I told you about,

454
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:58,795
the one I fell in love
with at first sight?

455
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,840
I used the same suitcase as him.

456
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,634
He was staying at the
hotel opposite my house.

457
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,462
His window was just opposite my house.

458
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:12,723
A French window.

459
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:15,806
I thought I was meant to be with him.

460
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,480
Until you told me that

461
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,880
he was Zhuo Ran.

462
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:24,855
I didn't tell you before
because I thought...

463
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,280
I could let go.

464
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:30,702
I didn't want to make things complicated.

465
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:34,240
Then why are you telling me now?

466
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:38,749
I'm sorry.

467
00:23:58,764 --> 00:23:59,640
It's me.

468
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,360
Xia Chu just came by.

469
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,880
She learned about the pills.

470
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:09,160
Liang Mu Ze is now having
the drug examined.

471
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:13,958
It's fine.

472
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,733
Those pills I gave you,

473
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:16,714
even if they're tested,

474
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,928
they won't find anything wrong in it.

475
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm not worried about the pills.

476
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,512
I'm worried about our relationship.

477
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:24,640
Us.

478
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,360
Xia Chu and I.

479
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:28,960
You and I.

480
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:32,880
Gui betrayed us, get rid of him.

481
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,560
Copy that.

482
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:41,793
Zhuo Ran, are you there?

483
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,975
I really don't want to lose Xia Chu.

484
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,200
And I don't want to miss out on you.

485
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:54,326
Missing out on me
might actually be a blessing to you.

486
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:56,640
Whether it's good luck or bad luck,

487
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,199
I just want my own choice.

488
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,560
I only trust my own judgment.

489
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:04,989
You can reject me,

490
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,920
but don't try to change my mind.

491
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,280
Xia Chu,

492
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,991
it was Zhuo Ran who
asked me to switch the pills.

493
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,134
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhuo Ran.

494
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,920
Z-h-u-o, R-a-n.

495
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:22,400
Hello, Xia Chu.

496
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,000
Zhuo Ran?

497
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:25,400
It's me.

498
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,086
Xia Chu,

499
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm back.

500
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,496
Have you met with Mi Gu lately?

501
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:35,647
I switched the pills.

502
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:36,640
You...

503
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:38,215
Why?

504
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,660
Because of Zhuo Ran.

505
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
He's really worried about you.

515
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:26,031
I've found a place.

516
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,200

521
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,729
Sorry for the trouble
I've caused you during this period.

522
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
Thank you.

523
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:05,790
If you are leaving,
take all those things you bought with you.

524
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,911
They are too big for me to take away,
I'll give it to you.

525
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:12,360
I don't want those junk.

526
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,274
What junk?

527
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:17,062
I hand-picked those stuff
and I paired them carefully.

528
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:19,600
And you are just going to leave them here?

529
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:21,713
Just abandon them here?

530
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:24,920
Have you ever thought about my...

531
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:30,523
Thought about what?

532
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:34,342
Have you even thought
about these junks' feelings?

533
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:37,776
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

534
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,680
Wait.

535
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,480
Let me show you something.

536
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:54,840
This...

537
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:02,093
You installed a surveillance in the house?

538
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,656
You spied on me?

539
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,287
I have no interest in your privacy.

540
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:12,639
I installed surveillance to
keep an eye on my house,

541
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,542
to protect you.

542
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,843
This isn't spying.

543
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,700
And it just happened to record
what you friend did.

544
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:26,061
She did it for a reason.

545
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:29,793
The pills she switched aren't harmful
to the body of the person taking them.

546
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:31,191
No matter her reason,

547
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,457
no matter what her purpose is,

548
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,226
I found that my pills had been switched,

549
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:35,746
so I took it for a test.

550
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:36,840
Nothing wrong with that, right?

551
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:40,160
No.

552
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,120
Why are you still leaving then?

553
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,480
Get out of the way!

554
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:49,560
Let go!

555
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,560
Let go!

556
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:55,536
Stop it, Xia Chu.

557
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:57,720
Let go! I'm not mad at you!

558
00:30:58,115 --> 00:30:59,066
Who are you mad at then?

559
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,112
I don't want to say.

560
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:01,113
Then you are mad at me.

561
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,360
No, I'm not mad at you, really!

562
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,320
I just had too much going on today.

563
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,889
First, I found that you took
the drug I gave you for testing,

564
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,206
and I was furious.

565
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,758
I went to see Mi Gu.
I just wanted to complain to her,

566
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,040
I didn't expect that she would tell me...

567
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,016
Forget it, that's not important.

568
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:17,080
Everything just came together.

569
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,301
I'm in over my head.

570
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,120
I don't know how to digest it.

571
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:21,663
I need time.

572
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:23,011
I need space to calm myself down.

573
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:24,230
I need to get my mind straight.

574
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,320
At least right now, I don't
want to see you, Liang Mu Ze.

575
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:28,560
No.

576
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:34,240
Get out of my way!

577
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,964
If you don't want to see me, it's fine.

578
00:31:58,005 --> 00:32:00,149
I can leave, but you can't.

579
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,200
Not to mention that it's night now.

580
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:05,472
What do you care?

581
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:07,080
I don't.

582
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,098
I need you.

583
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:17,427
My cousin is returning
home at the end of the month.

584
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:18,600
That's your business.

585
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,252
I've sent you her flight number.

586
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:22,160
Pick her up for me.

587
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:23,053
Why should I?

588
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:24,043
She will stay here too.

589
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,400
You two try to bond and
get along with each other.

590
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:27,937
She will be living here,

591
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:28,839
but I won't.

592
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,320
Help me out, Xia Chu.

593
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,080
Please?

594
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:36,191
I really have to leave now.

595
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:37,102
Call me if you need anything,

596
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:38,440
but I might not be able to answer it.

597
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:41,160
I haven't agreed to it yet!

598
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,195
There is another thing I need to tell you.

599
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:44,320
I don't want to hear it.

600
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:50,600
Fine, tell me, hurry up.

601
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:52,262
My cousin,

602
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,280
Liang Shao Xue,

603
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,016
she has adult ADHD.

604
00:32:57,748 --> 00:33:00,332
She has difficulty in concentrating
and controlling her emotions.

605
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,875
She also has intermittent depression.

606
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:05,480
-She can pass out at any time.
-What?

607
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:06,848
So when you pick her up,

608
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:08,173
make sure you pay
attention to her condition.

609
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:10,400
Be careful and more careful, okay?

610
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,883
You know she is sick...

611
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,271
and you are still asking
me to pick her up?

612
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:14,163
Well, you are a doctor.

613
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:15,604
I am a cardiothoracic surgeon!

614
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,345
That's still a doctor.

615
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:19,000
Besides, other than you,

616
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,670
I don't trust other people.

617
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:23,719
So it can only be you, Xia Chu.

618
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,240
Stop flattering me.

619
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:29,160
All right now.

620
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:31,880
Be a good girl, Da Miao.
I'll get you some candy when I get back.

621
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,603
Xia Chu,

622
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:52,760
I bought you some custard
buns and put them in the fridge.

623
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,720
No one's going to
fight you for it this time.

624
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:55,691
Don't eat too much.

625
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:04,200
You fool.

626
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,997
You bought so many.

627
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:07,480
How am I going to finish it by myself?

628
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,280
I want to eat some too.

629
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:16,480
Share it with me.

630
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,073
(Military and police join forces
to dismantle drug dealer den)

631
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,570
(Password: 920218, Dad)

632
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:39,613
(Pei Yong Yan)

633
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:44,640
Xiao Ran,

634
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,535
what are you doing?

635
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm sorting out the greeting cards
from my friends.

636
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:51,811
Clean it up and sleep early.

637
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:52,760
Okay, Mom.

638
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:55,920
Who is it?

639
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,760
Coming.

640
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,084
-Who are you?
-Who are you looking for?

641
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,025
-Who are you looking for?
-What are you doing?

642
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:05,894
Xiao Ran.

643
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:10,120
What are you doing?

644
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,328
You're Pei Yong Yan's wife?

645
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:16,714
Ex-wife.

646
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:20,040
Did you receive anything
from him recently?

647
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,914
We have been out
of touch for a long time.

648
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,479
I came here to avoid him.

649
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,507
I really don't know what
he's doing out there!

650
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:28,674
Please let us go!

651
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:30,440
We know nothing!

652
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,960
Where is he?

653
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:39,240
He's dead.

654
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:41,560
Even his body is gone.

655
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,280
I'll ask you again.

656
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,560
Did you receive anything
from him recently?

657
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,216
No.

658
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,400
No.

659
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,080
Kill them.

660
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,981
He's dead! I know nothing!

661
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,202
Stop it!

662
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:03,760
Don't hurt my mom!

663
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:07,061
I have got the stuff. I'll give it to you.

664
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:20,603
Is this all?

665
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:21,640
Yes.

666
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:44,663
Sir,

667
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:46,320
please take us in.

668
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:53,960
I don't want to stay here.

669
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:56,240
I don't want to live in
the shadow of his crimes.

670
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,604
I want a new life.

671
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:00,748
Please let us live.

672
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:03,139
I will do as you say and work for you.

673
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,280
I will do whatever you tell me to do.

674
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:07,284
-Please.
-Son!

675
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:08,240
Long Yi.

676
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:19,920
Please.

677
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:30,920
You deserve to die.

678
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:46,840
Nice shot.

679
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:53,920
Looks like you really hate him.

680
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,885
Even his head is blown off.

681
00:38:58,971 --> 00:38:59,983
I found Gui.

682
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:02,600
Where is he?

683
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:10,918
The ID of Zhou Lan,
which we have been monitoring,

684
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:14,314
was found to have been logged in
by someone else at Xiong's company.

685
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:18,867
After that, he engaged with someone
with the ID, Buddha on City of Desire.

686
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,914
They agreed to pick up the goods
at Wenhui Hotel...

687
00:39:20,955 --> 00:39:22,535
at 3:00 PM the day after tomorrow.

688
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,160
As for the identity of the other party,

689
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,200
it is not yet clear.

690
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,483
Keep an eye on this Xiong person.

691
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:33,440
Yes, Sir!

692
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:34,960
So this is Gui?

693
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,488
As the founder of the platform,

694
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:40,880
I have a way of finding out every ID
that appears on the platform.

695
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,280
By the way,

696
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:53,316
a medical forum will be held
at Wenhui Hotel two days later.

697
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,561
The security measures will definitely
be much tighter than usual.

698
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,468
Yet he chose to hand
out the goods at that place.

699
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:01,600
Why would he want to do that?

700
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,840
Xia Guang Yuan?

701
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,314
Since Gui wants to
replace Old Master so badly,

702
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:18,255
he won't let go of this opportunity.

703
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:21,088
Are you saying that Xia Guang Yuan
is his real target?

704
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Gui is too greedy.

705
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,200
Where are you going?

706
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,960
The hotel.

707
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:51,652
Gui, I've confirmed it.

708
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,531
Xia Guang Yuan will attend
the event as scheduled.

709
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:54,440
Good.

710
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,928
What about the deal
with Xiong the day after?

711
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:00,880
I'll go personally. Leave it to me, Gui.

712
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,026
Finally, I'm going to meet Xia Guang Yuan.

713
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:21,369
Are you home?

714
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,320
I am.

715
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:23,240
What's the matter?

716
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,040
Draw the curtains.

717
00:41:29,684 --> 00:41:30,920
Open the window too.

718
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,160
Do you see me?

719
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,520
I do.

720
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,520
What are you doing up there?

721
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:50,925
I am watching you.

722
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:54,640
It's windy.

723
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,276
It's nothing.

724
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,396
Do you have any plans two days later?

725
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:02,040
I have work to do that day.

726
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,826
Are you going to cover the medical forum?

727
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,586
How did you know that?

728
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:10,280
I always have a way of finding out about
the people and things that interest me.

729
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,400
I would like to ask you
for a favour, Mi Gu.

730
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,920
Go on.

731
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,000
The test results are out.

732
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,784
How is it? Is it poisonous?

733
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,112
I can't exactly say it's poisonous,

734
00:42:45,153 --> 00:42:47,095
but it's not completely safe either.

735
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,240
What do you mean?

736
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,240
Do you know about its characteristics?

737
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,105
It dissolves very easily in water.

738
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,447
That's right.

739
00:42:56,488 --> 00:42:58,587
The inside of the pill is porous,

740
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:00,218
it dissolve easily in water,

741
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:01,880
making it easy for
the patient to swallow.

742
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:03,640
This is the key feature
of 3D-printed drug.

743
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:06,854
3D-printed drug? Are you sure?

744
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:08,105
It can't be wrong.

745
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,573
Our department is also
working on developing this.

746
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,880
The main ingredient of the drug
is a combination of several herbs...

747
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:15,870
that have a calming and sedative effect,

748
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,051
synthesized by 3D printing technology.

749
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:19,647
Most importantly,

750
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:24,280
it is overdosed with an adjuvant
called aristolochia debilis.

751
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:28,276
Long-term use of this drug
comes with the risk of liver cancer.

752
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:31,040
What are you going to do with this drug?

753
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,080
For an assassination mission?

754
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,236
Put the drug away.

755
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:38,200
I'll come and get it from you.
