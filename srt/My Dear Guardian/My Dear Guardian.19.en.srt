1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,990
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,340
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:39,240
Durian flavored?

4
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,021
I'll eat it outside then.

5
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:44,480
No, eat it here. It's fine.

6
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,720
I'm immune to the smell
of durian now.

7
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,195
Have a bite.

8
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,496
I'll pass, thanks.

9
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,511
So you still don't like it.

10
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:56,840
Of course I don't.

11
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:00,051
Then why did you make a durian cake?

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Because you like it.

13
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,971
I heard from Dr Zhang that...

14
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,110
you've been transferred to the ER.

15
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,480
Are you adjusted?

16
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,200
To be honest, I'm still trying to.

17
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,306
These past two days,

18
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,760
I've lost three of the patients
under my care.

19
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:47,923
There's one patient,

20
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:51,786
she has paraquat poisoning
and is currently bed-ridden.

21
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,579
She may look fine right now,

22
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:56,880
but when tomorrow rolls around,

23
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,766
her liver will start to deteriorate.

24
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:01,719
Following that,

25
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,615
pneumonia and atelectasis will occur,

26
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:04,606
or pulmonary edema.

27
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:06,560
She might get pulmonary fibrosis.

28
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:08,535
At last,

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
she would suffocate to death.

30
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,960
Up until her last breath,

31
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,070
the patient is aware and conscious.

32
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:20,600
Isn't that scary?

33
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,766
Isn't there even one successful case?

34
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:26,953
There is.

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,170
But it's very rare.

36
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:33,499
It depends on how much and when
the patient consumed the poison.

37
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,360
If it is less than 10ml,

38
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:39,000
with a timely gastric irrigation
and blood filtering,

39
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,851
plus a bit of luck from
the person themselves,

40
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,370
perhaps...

41
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:48,800
I mean there is a chance
they could get through it alive.

42
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,840
So what is the condition of
the patient here?

43
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,259
I don't know.

44
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,110
She wouldn't say anything.

45
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,570
Why did she try to kill herself?

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,230
How much did she consume?

47
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:06,861
How long since she drank it?

48
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,759
She wouldn't say.

49
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:10,560
Her father couldn't explain either.

50
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,899
If she had drunk a lot,

51
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,329
there's no point in emergency care.

52
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,680
But what if?

53
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,000
What if she only drank a little
and there's a chance for her to live.

54
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,083
She's only 18 years old.

55
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:23,425
18 years old is the prime of youth.

56
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,206
Why did she do it?

57
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,400
She is a cute girl.

58
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,001
Plus she just started university.

59
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,640
She's pretty and is well-liked.

60
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,674
After going out with friends
to have a meal,

61
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,655
she went home that night
and took the poison.

62
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:35,652
Why?

63
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,400
What exactly happened
that made her do such a thing?

64
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,120
Sexual harassment.

65
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,870
What?

66
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,456
You said the girl is young and pretty,

67
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:54,270
just started university
and has never had a relationship.

68
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:57,600
So why did she go out for a meal
and then tried to kill herself later?

69
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:00,110
She might have been sexually harassed,

70
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,280
so she wanted to die.

71
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,802
Maybe that's why

72
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,000
she wouldn't say anything.

73
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,520
Liu Ran.

74
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,200
Liu Ran, can you hear me?

75
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,920
Liu Ran, listen to me.

76
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:26,567
You have to tell me
how much you consumed.

77
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:28,440
Half a cap?

78
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:30,160
Or one cap?

79
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,219
If you don't tell me,

80
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,440
I won't be able to determine
how much drug to administer.

81
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,718
Can you hear me, Liu Ran?

82
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,040
Liu Ran?

83
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,059
Dr Song, Bed 16 is not doing well.

84
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,230
They need you there.

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,549
Watch over Liu Ran.

86
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:55,838
I'm a resident doctor here.

87
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,880
My name is Xia Chu.

88
00:05:58,747 --> 00:05:59,637
Liu Ran.

89
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:01,800
Listen carefully.

90
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,114
I know.

91
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,044
You must have felt hopeless.

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,270
That's why you made such a decision.

93
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,320
I understand your pain.

94
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,470
Truly.

95
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,440
But what I want you to know is,

96
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,306
no matter...

97
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,408
No matter what harm
your body was subjected to,

98
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,619
you're still you.

99
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,462
There is no reason for you
to feel sorry or ashamed...

100
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,213
due to the harm.

101
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:32,811
Just like...

102
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,845
Just like the ulcer in your mouth.

103
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,440
It's just bodily damage.

104
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,120
It has no other significance.

105
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:43,868
Remember this.

106
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,172
You did nothing wrong.

107
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:49,280
The one who should be punished isn't you.

108
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,120
You didn't do anything wrong.

109
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:00,354
Liu Ran.

110
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:02,334
Do you hear me?

111
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:04,280
You're not at fault.

112
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm not at fault.

113
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,280
I'm not at fault.

114
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:12,991
I'm not at fault.

115
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:17,240
Doctor.

116
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,200
Please.

117
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,280
Please, save me.

118
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,400
I still want to go to school.

119
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:35,880
I want to go to university.

120
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:37,348
Don't be scared.

121
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:38,480
You'll be fine.

122
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:40,080
But you need to tell me,

123
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,040
how much did you drink?

124
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:48,488
Liu Ran's family?

125
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,690
I'm here, doctor.

126
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,662
-How is my daughter?
-Hurry up and pay.

127
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:53,240
Okay.

128
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,351
It's that way!

129
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,127
Yes, okay. I'll go now.

130
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:03,247
You guessed right.

131
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,535
She...

132
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,103
talked.

133
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,755
How much did she take?

134
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,000
She didn't ingest it.

135
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,095
She held it in her mouth for a while.

136
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,299
She couldn't stand the smell,

137
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,440
so she spat it out.

138
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,950
Can she be saved?

139
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,458
The scary thing about paraquat is that
even if you didn't ingest it,

140
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,110
it can still penetrate into the blood
through the skin...

141
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,520
and bind itself to plasma proteins.

142
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,520
That means...

143
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,270
Doctor, I've done the payment.

144
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,040
Okay.

145
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,731
It will be very difficult,

146
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:42,160
but we have come up
with a complete treatment plan.

147
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,279
The first step is to administer the drug
and continue with hemoperfusion.

148
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:49,200
The following day, third day,

149
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:52,776
seventh, fourteenth
and twenty-first days...

150
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:55,397
are very important time frames
during the course of the rescue.

151
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,824
This includes chest CT
and hematuria routine.

152
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,654
A full check-up has to be conducted
at every time frame

153
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,205
to better monitor the patient's condition.

154
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,256
After the first day,
we wait for the third.

155
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,220
After the third day,
we wait for the seventh.

156
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,819
Typically,

157
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,310
days 7 to 14 is the period
when the condition worsens.

158
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,939
The fourteenth day
will determine the outcome.

159
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,200
Not many have been able
to make it through.

160
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,320
We have to be mentally prepared.

161
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:48,303
(Outpatient Department)

162
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,000
Liang Mu Ze.

163
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,960
Dr Xia.

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,360
Listen.

165
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,263
I tried the cake.

166
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,766
It was still warm.

167
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,183
So I thought...

168
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:05,294
the person who brought it
must still be close by.

169
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,040
Your love of detective novels has its use.

170
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,959
No, this has nothing to do
with detective novels.

171
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:12,892
Because you're the only person...

172
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:16,880
who would bring a freshly-baked cake
straight to the hospital for me.

173
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:22,131
Forgive me for being too free
during my break.

174
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,585
The cake is good.

175
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:25,966
It's rum-flavored.

176
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,014
Yesterday, it was chocolate.

177
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,880
The day before, it was peach
and butter flavour.

178
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,010
Every bite after that,

179
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,031
I've savored with intention.

180
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm glad you like them.

181
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:38,582
I like them a lot.

182
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:41,760
Are you getting off work now?

183
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,870
Not yet.

184
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,200
Scarring has appeared
on Liu Ran's left lung.

185
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,370
Is there no other treatment available?

186
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,150
Even if there is,

187
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:56,200
it's not something I get to call.

188
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,653
Liang Mu Ze, don't you think
I'm so useless?

189
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm watching a living person
being stifled to death in front of me.

190
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,532
I really feel like a useless idiot.

191
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,069
I don't get why anyone would invent
a thing like the paraquat.

192
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,143
It is a poison without any proper cure.

193
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,712
-If it didn't exist...
-Dr Xia.

194
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:25,080
Let me tell you.

195
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:26,800
Guns,

196
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:28,680
they can kill.

197
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:31,049
But it can also stop the killing.

198
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,970
Right?

199
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,320
Heroin.

200
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,280
It kills people.

201
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,521
But morphine?

202
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:38,600
It alleviates pain.

203
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:42,289
In this world, nothing is
in black and white.

204
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:47,406
Paraquat was first invented
to be the most effective herbicide.

205
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,214
But due to being misused
by certain people,

206
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,680
it was then labelled as a poison.

207
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,928
Maybe the world would be better
without paraquat.

208
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,599
But that no longer applies to us.

209
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,521
In this world,

210
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:02,022
nothing is set in black and white.

211
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:06,240
What we can do
is to make sure we make...

212
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:07,920
the best decision each time.

213
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,093
So, Dr Xia,

214
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:13,395
stop thinking about
how the world would be without paraquat.

215
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,016
Rather than being a smart ostrich,

216
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,204
it's better to be a brave idiot.

217
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:22,320
One such brave idiot is Don Quixote.

218
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,400
Remember that.

219
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,175
A great knight may fail,

220
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:30,080
but they will never be beaten.

221
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,920
The same goes for a great doctor.

222
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,400
A great doctor.

223
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,480
Am I...

224
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,161
capable?

225
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,342
Of course you are.

226
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:44,840
When I say you are, you are.

227
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,800
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

228
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,080
Thanks for the cake
as well as what you just said.

229
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,680
Now go back and do a good job.

230
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,376
Even when it gets busy,

231
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,487
you have to uphold
your military pride, okay?

232
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:13,658
Bye-bye.

233
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:34,392
Previously, we've conducted
activated carbon gastric irrigation...

234
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,653
and hemoperfusion on Liu Ran.

235
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:39,480
We also administered Glucocorticoid
and immunosuppressive therapy.

236
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:41,320
During the past few days,

237
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:44,160
the state of her pulmonary fibrosis
has worsened.

238
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,286
The blood oxygen saturation
is unsatisfactory.

239
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:47,913
So this morning,

240
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,600
we've issued a medical crisis notice.

241
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,517
What is the patient's family background?

242
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,333
She lives in the suburban countryside.

243
00:14:58,549 --> 00:14:59,859
Her parents divorced when she was young.

244
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,320
She's been living with her father
who does odd jobs.

245
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:03,844
In the past few days,

246
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,280
her father has been the one
taking care of her at the hospital.

247
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,040
Her father's wish
is not to give up on her.

248
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,173
He hopes we'd do our best to save her.

249
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:15,785
Yi Chi.

250
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,760
Does the ECMO Team
have any suggestions?

251
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:23,880
To be honest,

252
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,612
even if this patient is put on the ECMO,

253
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,310
the probability of recovery
is very low.

254
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,710
But it's not totally ruled out.

255
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:46,741
Saving such a patient
will require a lot of investment.

256
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:49,581
And I don't just mean investment
from her family.

257
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:52,960
There are many more tangible
and intangible community resources.

258
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,880
For her current situation,

259
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:59,080
we can't be sure if she'll make it
for a lung transplant.

260
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:01,518
Many organs have been badly damaged.

261
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,099
Her physical state is weak.

262
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,800
Even if she had a lung transplant,

263
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:06,868
would she be able to recover?

264
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,800
That is another problem.

265
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,960
You all know
that transplantable lungs are scarce.

266
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,852
Are we really going...

267
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:16,313
to put all our patients
through the same trial?

268
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,240
One more thing.

269
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,564
The ECMO Team has just been established.

270
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,828
To put it bluntly,
the survivability of patients...

271
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:26,640
directly impacts
the team's future reputation.

272
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,148
Thus,

273
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:32,176
I think it's best that
we eliminate the patients...

274
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:33,207
who are beyond saving.

275
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:37,097
Give the chance
to patients who can directly benefit...

276
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,440
from ECMO treatment.

277
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:41,000
Make those patients
the focus of clinical treatment.

278
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,574
This way,

279
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:46,577
our team's future prospects
and development at the hospital...

280
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:47,640
would be better.

281
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:51,600
Dr Zhang.

282
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:55,930
The reasoning you just put forth
is pretty cruel.

283
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,170
It is cruel.

284
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:58,616
But that's the reality.

285
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:00,200
But we are doctors, not God.

286
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:03,640
A doctor's duty
is to do our best to save lives.

287
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,109
Even if we cannot guarantee that
all will be saved,

288
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,880
we have no right to determine
who dies, can we?

289
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:12,393
The miracles of this world
have never been decided by doctors.

290
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:14,160
Why can't we give her another chance?

291
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:18,621
Is our refusal
for the sake of the patient...

292
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,400
or is it out of fear of failure?

293
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,640
Xia Chu.

294
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:29,120
I understand where you come from.

295
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:30,877
However,

296
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,868
when the hospital makes a plan,

297
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:36,120
we cannot put our hopes on miracles.

298
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:38,212
We need to take into account the risks.

299
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:41,120
It has to be totally safe. You understand?

300
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,502
Alright.

301
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,640
Let's put that aside for now.

302
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:50,026
Now,

303
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:53,574
let's continue with
Liu Ran's treatment plan.

304
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:04,560
What's that?

305
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:06,478
ECMO.

306
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,320
It's the abbreviation for extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation.

307
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,872
Let me show you.

308
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,000
This is the machine.

309
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,935
Simply put,

310
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,158
it is a cardiac and respiratory
life support...

311
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,680
where blood is pumped outside of your body
to a heart-lung machine to be processed...

312
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,171
before it goes back to tissues
in the body.

313
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,200
It's not a treatment in and of itself.

314
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:29,360
It takes over the functions
of the heart and lungs...

315
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,028
so that further treatment
can be carried out.

316
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,042
It buys more time...

317
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,583
so that the patient can wait
for a transplantable lung.

318
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,280
Then how long will we have to wait?

319
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,160
It's hard to say.

320
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:46,160
We'll have to see if
there are suitable donors.

321
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:51,110
What if there's none?

322
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,600
What if she can't make it until then?

323
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,782
Then what?

324
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:58,561
Theoretically,

325
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:00,822
one can be put on the machine
for an extended time.

326
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,219
However,

327
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,720
with the prolonged usage,

328
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:07,283
the probability of complications
will also increase.

329
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:10,919
Currently, Liu Ran is already
suffering from respiratory failure...

330
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,136
and pulmonary fibrosis
that are life threatening.

331
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:17,560
ECMO and a lung transplant
are the final and only hope left.

332
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,190
It's just that...

333
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,574
this opportunity also poses
very big risks.

334
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:25,888
Once installed,

335
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,040
there's no going back.

336
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:29,120
Moreover, the success rate

337
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,751
is less than 30 percent.

338
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:36,040
The price is also very high.

339
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,280
I'd like to hear what you think.

340
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,880
Will you give it a try?

341
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,000
Liu Ran's family?

342
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:56,664
I'm glad you're here.

343
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,826
I'd like to brief you
on Liu Ran's condition.

344
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,280
Doctor, I get it.

345
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,228
Please install the...

346
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,513
the...

347
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:04,680
That machine of yours.

348
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,120
ECMO

349
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:07,720
Yes, ECMO.

350
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,694
The treatment plan is prepared
after consulting all departments.

351
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,997
Who said you could approach
the patient's family in private...

352
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,640
and talk to them about ECMO?

353
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,760
You broke the rules, you know that?

354
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,200
To install the ECMO,

355
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:29,558
it will cost at least 70, 80 thousand.

356
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,560
There's also the expenses of ICU
after that.

357
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,840
Not to forget the lung transplant.

358
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,335
That's a lot of money.

359
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:35,800
Where do you propose he get it from?

360
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,723
If he doesn't have it,
he can crowdfund it online.

361
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:40,939
He said, as long as he is
able to save Liu Ran,

362
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,542
even if there's only a sliver of hope,

363
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,803
he is willing to try.

364
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,959
The outcome of that
may be that the patient dies,

365
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,280
but he still has to bear hundreds of
thousands of yuan of medical debt.

366
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,720
Will he be able to bear it?

367
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,939
But the fact of the matter is,

368
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,098
the one lying on the hospital bed
is his only daughter.

369
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:58,370
He should at least be informed
that there is a way...

370
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,257
that could save his daughter's life.

371
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:02,598
For the sake of this 'sliver of hope',

372
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,639
you want him to sell his possessions,
what little thing he has.

373
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,840
Have you thought about
his future then?

374
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,926
If the pressure of using ECMO
is more than the actual final benefit,

375
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,565
then I think
there's no point in letting him know...

376
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,082
of the machine's existence.

377
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,534
So how much is the daughter's life worth?

378
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,280
We shouldn't be the ones
to have to answer.

379
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:26,698
Moreover,

380
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:27,798
we do not have the right...

381
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,929
to decide on their behalf
not to install the ECMO.

382
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,650
What if the decision
would cause the family to lose everything?

383
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,880
How would you know
if they'd lose everything?

384
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,059
Xia Chu, you're too idealistic.

385
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,388
You're still too young.

386
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,659
While Liu Ran is even younger.
She's only 18.

387
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:42,534
Her life is just starting.

388
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,440
I really don't wish to give up
on her like this.

389
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,040
I thought after going to the ER,

390
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,840
your views would change a bit.

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm sorry, Mr Zhang.

392
00:21:58,202 --> 00:21:59,560
Maybe I'm beyond saving.

393
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:01,369
But...

394
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,160
you've convinced me.

395
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:10,320
The ECMO Team had another discussion.

396
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,200
We decided...

397
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,760
to give it a go.

398
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:17,720
Director Chen has agreed too.

399
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,214
Alright.

400
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:24,440
I respect everyone's decision.

401
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:25,642
Okay.

402
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll get the equipment ready.

403
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:31,080
Xia Chu.

404
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,640
The possible complications
of installing ECMO...

405
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:36,647
must be explained clearly
to Liu Ran's father.

406
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,430
He has to sign the consent form.

407
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:39,895
Will do.

408
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:03,794
(Dr Xia)

409
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:08,988
What happened?
How did the crash happen?

410
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,337
It's not my fault.

411
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:11,788
I was driving normally.

412
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,452
He appeared out of nowhere
and gave me a shock.

413
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,703
Ask them if you don't believe me.

414
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:17,924
Ask them.
I really didn't do anything wrong.

415
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,778
Xia Chu.

416
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,990
Has the parent signed the form?

417
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:25,560
I can't find Liu Ran's father.

418
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
Call him then.

419
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,021
I did.

420
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:30,240
No one answered.

421
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,200
Maybe he's gone to raise money.

422
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,360
Their hospitalization
is put on credit, right?

423
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:39,801
No, he wouldn't run away.

424
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:40,960
He's not that kind of person.

425
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:43,755
Come on. How well do you know him?

426
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:45,539
He said, even if it's a sliver of hope,

427
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,800
he will not give up.

428
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:48,295
But he also said,

429
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:49,859
the medical fees are too expensive.

430
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,040
One day costs a few thousand yuan.

431
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:55,040
That was before he fully understood
the severity of paraquat poisoning.

432
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,418
Doctor, we just received a call.

433
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,129
A badly-injured traffic
accident victim nearby...

434
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,345
is being sent to the hospital.

435
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:01,916
Notify Orthopedics, Neurosurgery
and the blood bank.

436
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,692
-Prepare for emergency treatment.
-Okay.

437
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,730
I'll let you handle CS tonight.

438
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:05,800
-Call me if anything.
-Okay.

439
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:14,881
The victim was knocked by a car.

440
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:15,937
There's bleeding on the head.

441
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:17,598
Blood pressure is 80/40.
Blood oxygen at 85.

442
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,295
Doctor, he's Liu Ran's father.

443
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:20,180
What?

444
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,260
I want...

445
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:23,760
to see my daughter.

446
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:27,503
My daughter.

447
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:30,448
Doctor.
A brain injury. He needs a ventilator.

448
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:31,589
To the EICU!

449
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,740
(Emergency Department)

450
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,579
The patient's blood pressure is falling.

451
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,349
Is the blood here?
Chase them.

452
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,757
Transfuse the blood once it arrives.

453
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:48,800
Okay, I'm going.

454
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,488
Prepare for tracheal intubation.

455
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,460
Got it.

456
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,148
No intubation!

457
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,619
I don't want intubation!

458
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:56,818
Calm down!

459
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:57,703
Hold him down!

460
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:59,170
Calm down. You need to calm down!

461
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,458
No intubation. Go save my daughter.

462
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,969
Save my daughter.

463
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,752
Save my daughter...

464
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:08,253
Save my daughter.

465
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,360
Save my daughter!

466
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:13,308
Save her!

467
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,255
Save my daughter...

468
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:16,716
Listen to me. Calm down.

469
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:19,194
Save my daughter!

470
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,400
My daughter!

471
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,760
My daughter!

472
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,419
Save my daughter!

473
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:31,348
Xia Chu.

474
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:32,659
Hurry and pacify Liu Ran.

475
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:33,680
Okay.

476
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,503
Go and save her, quick!

477
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:37,804
My daughter.

478
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,663
Liu Ran, calm down.

479
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:55,687
Calm down.

480
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:56,640
What's wrong?

481
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,440
Are you feeling unwell?

482
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,600
What's the matter?

483
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:02,948
Ventricular fibrillation.

484
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:04,650
Inject adrenaline, 1mg.

485
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:05,760
Ready for defibrillation.

486
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,111
Liu Ran, calm down.

487
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,482
Calm down.

488
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:12,903
It's okay.

489
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,362
200 joules. Ready.

490
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:21,697
Wait a moment. Wait.

491
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:23,000
200 joules fully charged.

492
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
Write it down.

493
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,120
200 joules, once more.

494
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:50,777
(Who)

495
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,322
(Who)

496
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,320
It's okay.

497
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:44,920
It's okay.

498
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,970
(Emergency Intensive Care Unit)

499
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,270
Dr Song.

500
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,899
Liu Ran's hypoxia is getting worse.

501
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,080
She may die at any moment.

502
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:09,465
We have to install the ECMO right away.

503
00:28:09,506 --> 00:28:10,736
Whether or not we install it...

504
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:12,527
will be decided after discussing
with her family.

505
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:15,393
First, fill up the emergency care report
for Liu Ran's father.

506
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:17,601
The traffic police and insurance company
are waiting for it.

507
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:19,120
-But Doctor, Liu Ran is...
-Xia Chu.

508
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:22,400
Be reasonable.

509
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,240
We are only doctors.

510
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:42,327
I have a patient.

511
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,649
Her father met with an accident
and died while trying to raise money.

512
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:47,220
Her condition is critical,

513
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,671
but I'm not willing to give up just yet.

514
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,052
However,

515
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:52,285
the treatment requires
a lot of investment.

516
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,000
Her family
has no means to cover the cost.

517
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,560
Is it possible to get the TV station
to come do a report?

518
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,520
Okay. I'll make arrangements.

519
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,400
Thanks a lot, Mi Gu.

520
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:26,320
Liang Mu Ze.

521
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
Did your back grow eyes?

522
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:35,237
No.

523
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:37,280
But I had hoped it was you.

524
00:29:41,761 --> 00:29:42,641
What's the matter?

525
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:49,680
Liu Ran's father...

526
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,001
I know.

527
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,600
I saw him being carried into the hospital.

528
00:29:58,718 --> 00:29:59,938
Before the accident,

529
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:01,199
I had told him...

530
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:05,677
that installing the ECMO
was Liu Ran's last chance to live.

531
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:08,160
That's why he rushed to raise the money.

532
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,040
Who would've thought...

533
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,880
It was an accident, Xia Chu.

534
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,686
My superiors...

535
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,600
all think that the treatment plan
is too radical,

536
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:24,960
with high risks.

537
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,440
There was no point
in mentioning it to the family.

538
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,580
I insisted on telling him.

539
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:34,600
I firmly believed
that Liu Ran's father had...

540
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:38,109
the right to know of her condition
and to decide what happens.

541
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,720
But now,

542
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm not so sure.

543
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:45,160
Not sure of what?

544
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,720
If...

545
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:53,488
the pressure of the treatment plan
on the family...

546
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,349
is more than the actual final benefit,

547
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,040
should I have just
shielded them from the risks?

548
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:01,972
Or maybe...

549
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:04,732
I should've just decided on their behalf.

550
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:06,800
Then it wouldn't have come to this.

551
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,461
This outcome...

552
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:14,550
Perhaps I was wrong.

553
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,066
You weren't wrong.

554
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,548
Timing.

555
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:21,647
Topography.

556
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:22,600
Comparison of fire power.

557
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,000
And the final goal.

558
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,166
Only when you're there in person,

559
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,680
can you make the best decision.

560
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:31,520
When you have to decide,

561
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:34,652
you can only choose to believe in yourself
at that moment.

562
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,208
Even if you regret if afterwards,

563
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:38,219
it's okay.

564
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:40,480
You did your best. You were not wrong.

565
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,971
This is what the psychiatrist told me
after coming back from my first mission.

566
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,990
You've seen a psychiatrist?

567
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:51,447
Yes.

568
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:52,498
Why did you think...

569
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,279
I was so against you telling me
to go see one before?

570
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,987
What the psychiatrist said makes sense.

571
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,040
But I still don't get it.

572
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:05,483
From the first mission until now,

573
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,720
it's been eight years.

574
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm still suffering from insomnia.

575
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:14,040
Xia Chu, I know full well how you feel.

576
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:16,865
What I've been through,

577
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,316
I rather you not go through it.

578
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:20,372
What I couldn't do,

579
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,880
I hope you'd be able to.

580
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,542
Believe in yourself and
the decision you've made.

581
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:27,783
You've done your best.

582
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:28,760
You were not wrong.

583
00:32:37,337 --> 00:32:38,627
Do you have money, Liang Mu Ze?

584
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:46,920
However much. Lend it to me.

585
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:48,800
Are you paying for her out of your pocket?

586
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,908
Never mind.

587
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:53,120
I'll think of a way.

588
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:55,040
Xia Chu.

589
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,560
The passcode is at the back.

590
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:07,185
Why? You don't want it?

591
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:08,156
-I'll take it back.
-No!

592
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,840
I put the cake on the table.

593
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,360
Thank you.

594
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,760
I spoke with Liu Ran's uncle.

595
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:34,745
He said he'll take her back.

596
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:36,000
As for the ECMO preparation,

597
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,760
it's a no-go.

598
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,142
They're giving up?

599
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:52,945
Mr Zhang.

600
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,440
Liu Ran's uncle has agreed
to install the ECMO.

601
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,280
How did you persuade him?

602
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:05,924
I'll pay the advance.

603
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,241
You'll pay?

604
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,162
Yes.

605
00:34:09,578 --> 00:34:10,978
Before the driver compensation
comes through,

606
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,798
I'll pay for the ECMO installation
in advance.

607
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,038
The TV station will continue
to follow up on the case.

608
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,720
I will also start a crowdfunding online
for them.

609
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,114
For the rest of the fees,

610
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,876
hopefully the compensation
and crowdfunding will cover them.

611
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,510
Xia Chu...

612
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,240
I know I'm being silly.

613
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:27,268
I also know that there are
many more such patients.

614
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:28,390
I'm not some rich heir.

615
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:29,600
I can't help them all.

616
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,960
But since we've met each other
and Liu Ran's father...

617
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,674
accidentally died because
of my suggestion,

618
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:40,653
I think
I should bear the responsibility.

619
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:41,909
In the future,

620
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,421
if I happen to look back at this,

621
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:45,722
I can confidently tell myself
that at this moment,

622
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:46,920
I had done my best.

623
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:48,720
I was not wrong.

624
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,568
Xia Chu.

625
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,040
I want you...

626
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,239
to remember this passion
you've shown today.

627
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:07,600
In future,

628
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,320
don't ever be so easily beaten.

629
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:14,335
I won't.

630
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:15,364
Okay.

631
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,207
Count me in for the crowdfunding.

632
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:19,840
Me too.

633
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,040
Thanks.

634
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:45,960
When you wake up,

635
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,360
make sure you live a full life.

636
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,760
Together with your father's life,

637
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:55,360
live to the fullest.

638
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:26,920
Missy.

639
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,720
Ms. Lan.

640
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,250
What are you doing?

641
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,351
Nothing in particular.

642
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,892
There's nothing much to do at home.

643
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,178
I took out the wool and washed them.

644
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,179
I'm thinking of knitting
your dad a scarf.

645
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,535
The weather's getting cold.

646
00:38:38,576 --> 00:38:41,847
It's already night, and you're
still performing such a loving act.

647
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:43,718
Are you trying to kill us with kindness?

648
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:46,280
You never listen to me.

649
00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:48,542
If you were here with me,

650
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,160
you'd already be married with kids.

651
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,142
You could be eating
my home-cooked meals every day.

652
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:54,080
Wouldn't it be nice?

653
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:55,976
Ms. Lan.

654
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,266
Are you envious of the women...

655
00:38:58,307 --> 00:39:00,440
who are already carrying
their grandchildren?

656
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,680
I don't envy them one bit.

657
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,059
I'm just worried about you.

658
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:08,156
You're out toiling away on your own.

659
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:09,903
There's no one to take care of you.

660
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:11,800
How am I supposed to feel at ease?

661
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,760
Sorry, Ms. Lan.

662
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,480
Sorry for worrying you.

663
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:18,019
But I'll give you my word.

664
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,160
I will take good care of myself.

665
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:23,987
Every day, I will
wake up on time, take my meals on time...

666
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,101
and continue working

667
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:27,449
towards becoming a beautiful
and smart lady.

668
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:28,600
All right?

669
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,360
Missy.

670
00:39:35,992 --> 00:39:37,879
In the past,

671
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,760
I worked as a medical care provider too.

672
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,760
Those ridiculous aspirations.

673
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,630
Did you think I'd believe them?

674
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:51,480
Where's Dad? How is his health?

675
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:53,000
He's doing okay.

676
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:54,520
What about you?

677
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,009
How are your legs?

678
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,640
It's a persisting problem.

679
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:02,073
I feel fine whenever the weather changes.

680
00:40:02,114 --> 00:40:03,400
But it's nothing. I can handle it.

681
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,800
Make sure you both take care.

682
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:09,456
Out here,

683
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:15,700
no matter how tired I am
or what I come across,

684
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,000
as long as I know you two are fine,

685
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:20,546
our family is fine,

686
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,049
I will think that...

687
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,840
I will know that I have the energy
to keep moving forward.

688
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:33,520
I'm able to live wilfully,

689
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,847
not because of my own courage.

690
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,080
It's because I have you guys.

691
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,720
Because I know

692
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:46,182
when I turn around,

693
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:47,520
you will be there.

694
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,128
You guys have always supported me
from behind.

695
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,120
Missy.

696
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,902
Don't you worry about your dad and me.

697
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:57,200
We're doing fine.

698
00:40:57,777 --> 00:40:59,360
Worry about yourself instead.

699
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,889
Make sure to look after yourself.

700
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,920
You hear?

701
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:07,920
Sure, Ms. Lan.

702
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:08,896
I'm hanging up.

703
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:26,489
(Emergency Intensive Care Unit)

704
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:50,168
Xia.

705
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:51,159
Go to bed.

706
00:41:56,274 --> 00:41:58,000
What exactly happened?

707
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:01,520
Something wrong with the project?

708
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,720
Or are you not feeling well?

709
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:06,289
I'm fine.

710
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,990
Fine? I can tell right away
whether or not you're truly fine.

711
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:12,446
Since New Year,

712
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:14,160
you haven't been sleeping well.

713
00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:15,960
Just look at your face.

714
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,660
Go look in the mirror.

715
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,480
Xia.

716
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:23,628
We've been married a long time.

717
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,539
Why can't you be frank with me?

718
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:27,280
Why must you endure it alone?

719
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,450
If you buckled,

720
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:31,160
what would happen to Xia Chu and me?

721
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:35,400
Fine.

722
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:37,656
So you won't say?

723
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,520
Go get your daughter.

724
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:44,880
What is the matter?

725
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:50,200
Don't worry.

726
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,040
Don't worry.

727
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:13,040
Is it the Department of Security?

728
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,600
I'm Xia Guang Yuan.

729
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:23,461
You're back.

730
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:27,015
I got my team to finish a short video
last night.

731
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:29,193
I'm going to promote it
on the program's official site.

732
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,174
Take a look.

733
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:33,360
Looks good.

734
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:35,120
Thank you.

735
00:43:38,297 --> 00:43:39,240
Xia Chu.

736
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,512
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

737
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:50,880
Three days ago?

738
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:52,600
Are you still a woman?

739
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:55,913
It's not that bad, is it?

740
00:43:57,105 --> 00:43:58,080
Try taking a whiff.

741
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:05,840
It's not that bad.

742
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:08,518
The ER shift is one day of work,
one day off, right?

743
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,920
How come you don't even have time
to wash your hair?

744
00:44:11,393 --> 00:44:13,217
Yes, it's one day work, one day off.

745
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:16,170
But I work like a dog during my shift
and so on my day off,

746
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:17,361
I literally pass out.

747
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:19,760
There's no time
to think about washing my hair.

748
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:21,983
You're done for.

749
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:23,711
If you continue like this,

750
00:44:23,752 --> 00:44:26,333
I can tell you now that all men
will avoid you like the plague.

751
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:32,435
Thank you.

752
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:38,427
What is it?

753
00:44:40,335 --> 00:44:41,845
I gave Liang Mu Ze a hug yesterday.

754
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,720
Do you think he smelled it?
