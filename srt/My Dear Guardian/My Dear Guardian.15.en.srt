=Episode 15=

3
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,131
-Hi, Dr. Zhang.
-Hi.

4
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,134
Zhang Yi Chi.

5
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,842
It's durian cheese roll.
I bought it from Joy Bakery.

6
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,040
Try it and see
if the taste is still the same.

7
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,120
Thanks for helping out the foundation.

8
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,680
When the application is approved,
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

9
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,655
Xia Chu.

10
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,520
Dr. Zhang, please take a seat.

11
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,120
Which one do you think is tastier?

12
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:40,080
Let me try it.

13
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,739
No need.

14
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,040
Just take a guess.

15
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,480
Judging from the look,

16
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,000
durian cheese roll
is more appetizing.

17
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,518
However, no doubt
the combination of durian and cheese...

18
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,165
is going to take your breath away
at the first bite.

19
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:58,146
However, after some time,
you'll get bored of the taste.

20
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,560
Steamed cake is different.

21
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,260
No doubt it is not delicate,

22
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:06,668
but it has a light taste
and the chewiness is on point.

23
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,879
Many restaurants serve it
as a main course.

24
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:11,577
Hence,
in comparison to durian cheese roll,

25
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:13,360
steamed cake is more practical.

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,599
The chewiness is on point?

27
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:19,160
It has a light taste.

28
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Well said.

29
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,709
Dr. Zhang.

30
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,619
The steamed cake and durian cheese roll
is not a matter of life and death.

31
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,120
Why do you get into a dilemma?

32
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,611
I'm not in a dilemma.

33
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:36,000
By the way,
Dr. Zhang, I need your signature.

34
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,346
Patient number nine
doesn't require blood transfusion anymore.

35
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,268
Sure, Dr. Zhang.

36
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,039
Give him some liquid and IV fluids.

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,905
Conduct complete blood count
on him tomorrow morning.

38
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:49,802
Sure.

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
Okay.

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,480
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

41
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,526
The pen belongs to me.

42
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,040
It's the last pen I have.

43
00:03:58,546 --> 00:03:59,440
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,960
Goodbye, Dr. Zhang.

45
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,440
I bet you're hungry. Take it.

46
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:15,561
It looks like you're a practical person.

47
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,000
I tried cheese before.

48
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
It's too sweet and I'm bored of it.

49
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:22,600
As I age,

50
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,400
I find that I prefer a lighter taste.

51
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,760
I won't be shy then!

52
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:49,146
Liang Mu Ze, do you prefer steamed cake
or durian cheese roll?

53
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,201
Don't forget to take a rest at work.

54
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,964
Don't worry, Ms. Lan.

55
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm a woman who aspires
to conquer the world with a scalpel.

56
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:54,354
(Liang Mu Ze, do you prefer steamed cake
or durian cheese roll?)

57
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:07,398
(Vitalik)

58
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,720
Go!

59
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:07,199
It's quite good.

60
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,320
It's perfect.

61
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,566
All right.

62
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,520
The surgery is a success.
Thank you for the hard work, everyone.

63
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,243
You've worked hard, Dr. Zhang.

64
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:16,799
I'll leave the rest to you.

65
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:36,424
Just now, the patient
received cardiac tamponade treatment.

66
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,821
What are the issues should we take note of
in the coming treatment?

67
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:40,000
Anti-shock therapy,

68
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:41,424
blood transfusion, intravenous drip,

69
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:42,918
tranquillizing, analgesic, oxygen intake,

70
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,889
pericardiocentesis
and pericardial drainage.

71
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:46,176
If none of the above works,

72
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,225
and if the pericardium
continues to bleed,

73
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,280
exploratory thoracotomy
needs to be conducted immediately.

74
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:51,720
What else?

75
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,560
Use antibiotics to prevent infection.

76
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,560
Go.

77
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:13,640
One, two, three. Go!

78
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,160
Go!

79
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:17,280
Unlock the security!

80
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:22,698
Shoot when you're ready!

81
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:33,880
Go!

82
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,655
You two.

83
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:41,720
Shoot when you're ready!

84
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,240
-Wolf, go!
-Yes!

85
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,160
Hurry up!

86
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:51,200
Unlock the security!

87
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:53,741
Pay attention to the rear left.

88
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:54,800
Shoot when you're ready!

89
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,725
It hit the target. Let's go!

90
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:00,976
Let's go!

91
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,600
Let's go!

121
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,101
How is the patient doing?

122
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:15,600
Based on the medical history,

123
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,120
he has severe aortic regurgitation.

124
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,440
Not long ago, he had gum bleeding
when he was brushing his teeth.

125
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,331
Considering the possibility
of heart valve surgery,

126
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:24,000
he's sent to the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

127
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,014
What is going on?

128
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,590
The patient had a high fever when he
was admitted to the emergency department.

129
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:31,511
The medical history shows that
he has severe aortic regurgitation.

130
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:33,200
Not long ago, he had gum bleeding
when he was brushing his teeth.

131
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,160
It's suspected that he has
infective endocarditis.

132
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,270
I'm really occupied at work.

133
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,520
I can't make it.

134
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,360
I think my body is doing fine.

135
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,224
How about this?

136
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:49,479
Please prescribe some medicine for me.

137
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,535
I'll start with taking medicine.

138
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,187
What do you think?
Please do me a favour.

139
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,560
Thank you. Please do me a favour.

140
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,775
Don't overstretch yourself.

141
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,255
Dr. Zhang, the patient
is undergoing ventricular fibrillation.

142
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,707
-Go for cardiac compression.
-Yes.

143
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:08,504
Inject one milligram of adrenaline,

144
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:10,554
followed by 0.5 milligram of Atropine.

145
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:11,704
-Xiao Xiao.
-Yes.

146
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:12,824
Inform anesthesiology department.

147
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:13,947
Get ready for tracheal intubation.

148
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:14,880
Yes.

149
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,000
Is this anesthesiology department?

150
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:55,920
Get ready for defibrillation.

151
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:58,880
Inform his family.

152
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,360
Hurry!

153
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:54,000
Go!

154
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,983
Go! Hurry up!

155
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:08,476
Come on! Hurry up!

156
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,975
All Chinese soldiers
will learn a lot from yours...

157
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:55,655
in this tough mission...

158
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:59,536
especially in terms of survival skills
and technique training...

159
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,600
under such special conditions.

160
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:04,880
They are getting wild under such training.

161
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,621
I think they should go to China.

162
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:09,320
They're the best army in the world.

163
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:24,215
The torch is everything.

164
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,040
The rest is nothing!

165
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,760
The battle is to the strong!

166
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:32,840
The battle is to the strong!

167
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,280
Stop him!

168
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:08,080
Grab it!

169
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,255
It's Gopher! Throw it to the back!

170
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:41,800
Pull away! They're not good
at throwing grenades!

171
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:02,800
No!

172
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:03,333
The winner is China!

173
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,500
Salute!

174
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:53,957
Dr. Zhang.

175
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,411
Patient number nine who had a
heart transplant has been discharged.

176
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:57,635
He bought all of us burgers.

177
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:58,800
I got one set for you.

178
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:17,967
To relieve often, to comfort always,

179
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,200
and to cure sometimes.

180
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:22,200
Those are the duties of a doctor.

181
00:24:22,842 --> 00:24:23,920
You taught me that.

182
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:28,200
For that patient,

183
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,120
you've done your best.

184
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,022
I didn't do my best.

185
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,560
In fact, the last time I saw him,

186
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:42,160
I'd already noticed
his aortic regurgitation.

187
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:44,920
His condition was really bad.

188
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,000
However, I didn't admit him
to the hospital immediately.

189
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,720
I didn't conduct surgery on him either.

190
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:55,920
Why?

191
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,040
Why do some people
not bother with their own health?

192
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:08,680
They think that work
is more important than their lives.

193
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,880
Why didn't I stand my ground?

194
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:18,400
I'm a doctor.

195
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:22,272
I know what the right thing to do is.

196
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,160
I know what the best treatment plan is.

197
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:27,629
However,

198
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,040
I didn't stand my ground.

199
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:37,040
I caved in to his negligence.

200
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,520
Darn it.

201
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:49,880
You respect your patients.

202
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:51,851
Nonsense!

203
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:56,087
The greatest respect a doctor has
for his patient...

204
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,745
is saving the patient's life at all cost.

205
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:00,000
However, I didn't do that!

206
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,280
I was scared.

207
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:09,240
I was worried that if I insisted,

208
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:10,960
he would misunderstand my intention.

209
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:13,440
I didn't want to get into trouble.

210
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:14,711
I didn't want to put the hospital
into trouble.

211
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:16,399
I didn't want to ruin my livelihood!

212
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,960
That's why I didn't insist.

213
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:22,520
However,

214
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:26,386
when I heard his wife crying,

215
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,040
I felt really guilty.

216
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:51,840
Slow down. You might choke.

217
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:05,120
Do you know?

218
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:07,840
I've been a doctor for so many years...

219
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,640
but I don't care for writing papers
or conferring academic titles.

220
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:17,186
Only one thing has kept me going
at the operating table.

221
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,980
I wish the sick would get treatment...

222
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,040
and doctors would be respected.

223
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,520
However,

224
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,320
at times like this,

225
00:27:34,817 --> 00:27:36,920
I always feel that I'm completely useless.

226
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:43,920
Why didn't I stand my ground?

227
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,040
Do you regret it?

228
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,215
I'm in the hospital. What is it?

229
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,800
Okay, I'll come now.

230
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:18,093
There is a patient
at the emergency department...

231
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,200
with dissecting aneurysm.

232
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:21,600
He needs to undergo surgery.

233
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,673
The Head of Department will be the surgeon
and I'll be assisting him.

234
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:26,559
I'll leave the other patients to you.

235
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,366
Keep a close eye on
patient number three...

236
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,257
who got hit in the chest
in a car accident.

237
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,240
Got it.

238
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,440
He doesn't look remorseful at all.

239
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,160
I don't like either of them.
I like the multigrain steamed buns...

240
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,120
that you make.

241
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:58,680
I didn't know
you only buy the winner a drink.

242
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:01,471
I don't know. They're having
their own party with the other teams.

243
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:02,760
We are different.

244
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:05,706
We are friends and rivals.

245
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:07,760
So, this is our private invitation.

246
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,717
You want to fight again?

247
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:10,817
Sure thing.

248
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,217
Only in the field, bro.

249
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:16,538
Do you know? I've never lost
since I joined the army.

250
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:18,095
Even back then in the hunter school,

251
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:19,760
I was always the best.

252
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:21,945
How should I say it?

253
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:26,160
That is true but this time,
it's different.

254
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:27,560
Now it is teamwork.

255
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:28,930
We're drawn.

256
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:31,360
So, in the army, it's the same.

257
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:34,760
I think in the hunter school,
you're lucky.

258
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:36,193
Lucky?

259
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,676
You're not the first one
to say that I'm lucky.

260
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:39,680
Who else?

261
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,543
He was one of my comrades.

262
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,104
Actually, before you,

263
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:45,600
he was my only failure.

264
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,520
What is he doing now?

265
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,120
Making money.

266
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,240
Making money?

267
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:53,320
PMC?

268
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:56,560
Later on, he helped a drug dealer
escape from the police.

269
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,600
He let me have a bullet.

270
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:02,889
I don't know.

271
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,640
Maybe one day,
I'll join the private sector too.

272
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:07,440
Who knows?

273
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,600
This is our life.

274
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,280
I mean,

275
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:15,720
that's not private military service.

276
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,560
It's mercenary.

277
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:18,720
Whatever, man.

278
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,936
When you take off the uniform,

279
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:23,240
what are we going to do?

280
00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:28,318
There are many ways to make money.

281
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,639
If it's just for money,

282
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,000
why would you wear this uniform?

283
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,400
Money?

284
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:36,734
When I heard about the money
they're paying in the private sector,

285
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:40,600
I regretted so much
wasting all these years.

286
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:43,291
Far away from home, family, love,

287
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,160
from a normal life, you know?

288
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,556
And for what? What do we get?

289
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,658
Nothing except wounds and useless medals.

290
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:53,400
It's to save the world. It's different.

291
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:56,854
Why far from my family?

292
00:30:57,209 --> 00:31:01,840
Why far from my family,
my love and my normal life?

293
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,480
I feel good.

294
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:07,120
If more people have happiness,

295
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:11,408
all the pain and the medals are worth it.

296
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:14,840
I'm sorry
but that is nonsense brainwashing.

297
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:18,160
You're also brainwashed for money.

298
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,480
Listen.

299
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:25,631
This is an old saying in China.

300
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:28,722
"Different people
have different aspirations."

301
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,720
Please respect mine.

302
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:32,920
I just want to be a real soldier.

303
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:36,400
That's weird.
You remind me so much of him.

304
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:38,232
Who's him?

305
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,323
You mean that mercenary?

306
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,856
You both are the same.

307
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:44,280
You're born soldiers.

308
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:45,760
What's his name?

309
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:47,137
Pei Yu.

310
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,040
Pei Yu?

311
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,172
Okay.

312
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,520
I need to use the toilet. I'll come back.

313
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:55,046
No!

314
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:51,920
Is this the one?

315
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:55,520
The lady in your memory.

316
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:58,280
She used to smile at you.

317
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,600
She used to act cute too.

318
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,240
She was obsessed with you.

319
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:07,040
That's how she should look.

320
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:11,200
She should treat you that way.

321
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:13,840
What say you?

322
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
The mission failed.
He's gone back to China.

323
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,480
Rao Zhi.

324
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:08,849
What's going on?

325
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:12,280
It's entangled with a kite string.

326
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:16,748
Captain, it just scolded you.

327
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:18,240
Why are you so happy?

328
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:25,894
Whose bird is this?

329
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:27,400
How did it get entangled by a kite string?

330
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,823
Is it wild?

331
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,200
How is it possible?

332
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,406
It could speak English fluently.

333
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:33,480
Its English is more fluent than yours.

334
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,523
You can tell it was trained.

335
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:37,467
Here.

336
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:39,295
Can you see that?

337
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:41,975
RPO? What is this?

338
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:43,320
It could be the name of an organization.

339
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:46,760
Little bird, you have a code name.

340
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:48,757
Take it away.

341
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:49,880
It's not a problem.

342
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:52,906
Don't bite me!

343
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:57,280
Here, let me try.

344
00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:59,360
-Let me do it.
-Can you do it?

345
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:14,720
Both of you get along so well.

346
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:17,480
My goodness. It's quite...

347
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,400
Here.

348
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:22,480
-That's good.
-It likes you.

349
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:24,320
What is going on?

350
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,335
That's enough. Okay.

351
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:28,320
Don't be so close to me.

352
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:33,466
The parrot is so cool.

353
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,592
Perhaps it will turn into a
lady to repay my kindness.

354
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:37,783
You're thinking too much.

355
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:41,080
You don't say, Lieutenant Tian.

356
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:42,600
Both of you look cute together.

357
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:44,654
We need to dream sometimes.

358
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:45,920
Am I right?

359
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:49,626
Through the joint training,

360
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:52,403
I believe that everyone...

361
00:39:54,536 --> 00:39:58,866
has gained a better understanding of
combat techniques in different terrains.

362
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,360
-Okay.
-Next...

363
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:13,586
Next up,

364
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:17,560
we need to address all the issues
found during the joint training...

365
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:21,506
so that we can improve ourselves
in the coming training.

366
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:24,160
Be disciplined
as if you're on the battlefield.

367
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:29,040
Hone our weaknesses
into our Armour!

368
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,240
Never expose any exploitable opportunity
to your rivals.

369
00:40:32,818 --> 00:40:34,400
-Got it?
-Got it!

370
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:36,632
Okay.

371
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:37,960
Who is that?

372
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:40,520
Who talked in a strange way?

373
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:43,720
Can't you talk properly?

374
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:46,720
Come forward!

375
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:47,640
Report!

376
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:54,720
What is going on?

377
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:00,351
Where did you find it?

378
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:01,858
Report!

379
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:04,000
It fell from the sky.

380
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:09,026
Did the "okay" come from it?

381
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:12,760
-Yes.
-Idiot!

382
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:16,520
What did it say?

383
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,040
It just called you an idiot.

384
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,320
What?

385
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:21,526
Report!

386
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:22,920
Brigade Commander.

387
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,560
This bird scolded everyone.

388
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:27,188
Please don't take it to heart.

389
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:28,086
Nonsense!

390
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:30,040
Of course I won't be bothered by a parrot.

391
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:34,240
It's injured.

392
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:35,948
Yes.

393
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,840
It was entangled with a kite string.

394
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,886
Send it to the medical room.

395
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,591
Let Dr. Wu give it some treatment.

396
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,480
Later,

397
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:45,391
inform the Forestry Bureau
and the  Forestry police.

398
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:46,560
Tell them to send someone here.

399
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:47,929
Yes!

400
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:54,857
Xiao Teng!

401
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,045
Yes!

402
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:57,966
-Lead everyone else back to the camp.
-Yes!

403
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,157
Turn to the left. Go!

404
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:02,200
Brigade Commander.

405
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,120
Let's go to my office.

406
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:09,779
The Embassy of Vitalik
got in touch with us.

407
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:11,876
Now,

408
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,640
have we found the murderer?

409
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,110
No one survived.

410
00:42:16,205 --> 00:42:17,325
Before we left,

411
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:20,146
the local police hadn't
found any useful evidence.

412
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:23,006
It's said that it's committed by
the armed forces...

413
00:42:23,047 --> 00:42:24,440
which goes against the local government.

414
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:27,777
However, they didn't say that
they'll be responsible for the incident.

415
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:31,400
How did they know your identity?

416
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:34,200
We had a gathering at a local club.

417
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,983
If they didn't come for us,

418
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,160
then we must have had the worst luck.

419
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:44,986
Is it possible that
you guys offended some locals?

420
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:47,935
The moment we reached there,

421
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:49,600
we received closed training.

422
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:51,000
We didn't have the chance
to offend anyone.

423
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:55,295
All right.

424
00:42:55,968 --> 00:42:57,098
You've worked hard.

425
00:42:57,354 --> 00:42:58,360
Don't think too much.

426
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,128
As for New Year's Day,

427
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:02,269
let's do the usual.

428
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:05,040
Invite Meng Zhen and Xiao Jun.

429
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:07,041
Invite them over for a short stay.

430
00:43:07,082 --> 00:43:09,240
Let's gather and have fun.

431
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:11,226
Yes.

432
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:14,360
-Xia Chu.
-Mr. Ma.

433
00:43:14,737 --> 00:43:15,953
New Year's Day is just around the corner.

434
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:17,104
We may get a red packet
from the department.

435
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:18,035
Really?

436
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,842
I'm just kidding.

437
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:21,720
Why were you looking for me?

438
00:43:21,761 --> 00:43:24,526
The head of department asked me to arrange
the holiday work schedules.

439
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,477
Do you plan to go on duty
for one day or two?

440
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:27,720
Of course one day.

441
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:29,295
Then, you'll have to go the
Special Forces Brigade on another day...

442
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:30,600
to perform checkups on the soldiers.

443
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,720
Special Forces Brigade?

444
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:34,800
It's quite far.

445
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:35,801
You need to go there by bus.

446
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:37,232
If you're reluctant to go there...

447
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:38,880
I want to go there. I'll do it.

448
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:41,519
Since it's New Year's Day,

449
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,010
I'll think of it as an excursion.
It's quite nice.

450
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:45,297
In that case,

451
00:43:45,338 --> 00:43:47,007
I'll arrange it for you.

452
00:43:47,048 --> 00:43:48,445
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

453
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:49,376
Goodbye.

454
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:54,920
Have you signed it?

455
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:01,997
(Outpatient Department)

456
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,600
Xia Chu.

457
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:25,560
It's you.

458
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:27,190
If it's not me,

459
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,320
who do you wish to see?

460
00:44:30,521 --> 00:44:31,560
How is your arm?

461
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:34,199
The stitches were removed.

462
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,360
It's as good as new.

463
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:38,371
That's great.

464
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:40,392
There is a new Japanese restaurant nearby.

465
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:41,975
The reviews are not bad.

466
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:43,080
Let's give it a try.

467
00:44:44,951 --> 00:44:46,160
Tonight?

468
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:49,400
Think of it as a celebration
for my recovery...

469
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:51,367
as well as an early New Year's Day.

470
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:52,320
Okay?

471
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:56,706
Hold on.

472
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:02,040
Do you prefer cherry or grape?

473
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:09,280
I love both.

474
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:11,200
Xia Chu.

475
00:45:12,592 --> 00:45:13,702
Japanese cuisine.

476
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:14,600
Do you want to go?

477
00:45:18,512 --> 00:45:19,360
No.

478
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:20,960
Do you have any plans?

479
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:23,160
No.

480
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:25,920
However,

481
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:27,360
my taste has changed.

482
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:30,498
There are hundreds of flavours
in the world.

483
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:32,776
Besides Japanese cuisine,

484
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,040
I wish to try some other food.

485
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:37,640
Is it because of Liang Mu Ze?

486
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:41,080
Goodbye, Zhuo Ran.

487
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:43,400
Xia Chu.

488
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:45,674
Let me send you.

489
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,495
No need.

490
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,600
I want to go for a walk.
