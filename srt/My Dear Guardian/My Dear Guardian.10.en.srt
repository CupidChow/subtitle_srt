3
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,179
I still remember...

4
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:45,287
the time he was unconscious,

5
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,160
he kept calling out Xia Chu's name.

6
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,257
When a man doesn't have you in his heart,

7
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:54,828
there's no point pushing it.

8
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:58,118
I'm not pushing it.

9
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:01,348
I'm just trying to stop my own thoughts.

10
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:05,364
Xia Chu still doesn't know?

11
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,291
Here's an advice for you.

12
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:13,497
A friend's ex,

13
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:16,087
is like a used car driven by your friend.

14
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,600
Avoid it at all cost.

15
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,129
It's too troublesome.

16
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:25,748
If you really want it,

17
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:28,684
then be honest with your friend upfront.

18
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:31,069
It'll save you both
from awkwardness in future.

19
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,570
I'm speaking from experience.

20
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:36,598
Miss Gu, the scenery shot is done.

21
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,122
I'll show you the sample video
once it's ready.

22
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:42,880
If there're further ideas,
we can discuss more specifically.

23
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,801
Sure.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,910
Thanks, Dr. Zhang.

25
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,238
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

26
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:06,397
"A potential long-term partner."

27
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,261
Zhang Yi Chi, are you so desperate?

28
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,838
I'm single. Of course I am.

29
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,158
It's not like I cheat on my partner.

30
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,831
You're bringing this up again?

31
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:19,120
Are you going to hold onto this
for the rest of your life?

32
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,524
-Don't start with me.
-Hold on.

33
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,327
Your patient, Luo Xiao Jun
sent this postcard to the department.

34
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,308
I just saw it.

35
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:32,398
I'm willing to offer my help
to your charity project.

36
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,842
I have no say in that charity project.

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,860
Please think of something to help me out.

38
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:47,228
Won't you help me, please?

39
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:49,976
I'm applying for
an overseas graduate school.

40
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,377
A background in innovative
scientific research...

41
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:52,737
will improve my chances by a lot.

42
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,266
Why are you asking my help for everything?

43
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:55,337
That's your problem.

44
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,118
I'm no longer obligated to help you.

45
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,628
You're the reason
I stayed here in the first place.

46
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,288
I don't even have a single friend here.

47
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,109
I have nobody to help me.

48
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,403
I don't know where to get help.

49
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:10,237
Fine.

50
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:11,720
I'll try to ask Director Chen later.

51
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:17,538
Thanks.

52
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:18,867
What are you doing?

53
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:24,720
She's insane.

54
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,599
I'm almost done.

55
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:42,714
I'll wait.

56
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,159
I mistook you for my colleague.

57
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,108
Xia Chu.

58
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,838
Are you feeling better?

59
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:03,806
Yes. I've recovered.

60
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,328
Why are you here then?

61
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,639
To sign a contract.

62
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,738
I just met up with
Dr. Zhang and his peers.

63
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,130
Are you free tonight?

64
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:22,411
No, I'm not. I've made arrangements
with my friend.

65
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:23,722
It's Mi Gu, the one the other day...

66
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,063
She's meeting Dr. Zhang later.

67
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,063
Didn't she tell you?

68
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,203
Maybe she sent a message.

69
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,224
But I haven't read it yet.

70
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,566
So you're free tonight then?

71
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,080
I'm off to settle some matters now.

72
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:42,587
Wait...

73
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,600
What happened?

74
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,459
Let me take a look at it?

75
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,903
I have to get help
from the IT department.

76
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,166
So how is it?
Can all the information be retrieved?

77
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,567
No problem. It's almost done.

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,200
Great.

79
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,801
But why did this happen suddenly?

80
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:10,040
Maybe it was a heat dissipation problem.

81
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,988
Also, try not to open
too many pages at once.

82
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:15,096
After work,

83
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:16,437
remember to switch off the computer.

84
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:17,861
Got it.

85
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:20,863
Okay.

86
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:21,844
It's done?

87
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,081
Thanks.

88
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,101
I really appreciate it.

89
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,240
What do you plan to have for dinner?

90
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,710
I'm not done with my work yet.

91
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,381
I'll wait.

92
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,200
It's just dinner.

93
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,600
You'll have to eat after all, don't you?

94
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay then.

95
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:03,372
Both your parents are in Dongan.

96
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,200
Your home is there too.

97
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,236
Why didn't you transfer
to the military hospital there?

98
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,743
After graduating from
military medical school,

99
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:20,268
I just went with the military order.

100
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:24,518
Or is it because
you know my home is in Ningjiang?

101
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,931
I've almost forgotten it.

102
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,998
I don't believe you.

103
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,498
There are many good things in this world.

104
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:43,292
After we've experienced them,
it's hard to forget.

105
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,036
For example,

106
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:55,560
grilled eel.

107
00:07:58,647 --> 00:07:59,680
For example,

108
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:02,520
you and me.

109
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,487
Hi there.

110
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,438
Where's the classroom for 12th grade?

111
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,862
That way. The third classroom
after you turn left.

112
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:20,523
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

132
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:17,440
I didn't dare drink too much water

133
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:19,909
in case I missed you
if I went to the toilet.

134
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,278
I was afraid you couldn't find me
when you came back.

135
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:28,666
It's like the television dramas.

136
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,189
I didn't want to let you go that easily.

137
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:37,158
I waited until the shop closed,

138
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,532
but you never showed up.

139
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,067
And you never showed up since.

140
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:46,055
That won't happen again.

141
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,678
Xia Chu.

142
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:51,438
What makes you believe that
we have a future together?

143
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:52,774
Because you still care.

144
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,138
I'm over it.

145
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,828
If you really did,
you wouldn't have said those things.

146
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:12,792
Hi, my darlings.

147
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,613
I'm almost home.

148
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,928
I don't know why
I'm so easily tired these days.

149
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,518
Maybe it's my age.

150
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,519
Really?

151
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,177
When women feel tired,

152
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:29,798
that's when they want to get married?

153
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:36,478
I think I need sleep more than
I need a husband in my life.

154
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,457
I'm entering the lift.

155
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,158
The connection might be bad inside.

156
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:44,327
How are you guys doing lately?

157
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,640
Did you miss me?

158
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:47,978
Miss.

159
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,341
You dropped your phone.

160
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,414
Do you remember me?

161
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:56,608
No, I don't.

162
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,839
It's me.

163
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:01,168
The other day, we met in an alley
behind the hotel.

164
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,559
The night you went jogging.

165
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,700
Do you recall?

166
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:05,478
You've mistaken me for someone else.

167
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:08,257
I fell in love with you at first sight.

168
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:09,878
How can I mistake you for somebody else?

169
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,568
Why don't we be friends?

170
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:13,719
I know you're Mi Gu.

171
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,423
You're 32 years old and
your Chinese zodiac is a dragon.

172
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:16,824
You're a psycho.

173
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:17,800
Am I right?

174
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,680
Help. Help!

175
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,741
Who are you? Get your hands off her.

176
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,960
Get away, you psycho.

177
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,911
-Get away.
-Stop hitting me.

178
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:31,619
Xia Chu.

179
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,460
Forget it.

180
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,942
What's happened? Who is he?

181
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:37,654
A psycho.

182
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,697
Are you okay?

183
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,028
Yes.

184
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:57,560
Feeling better now?

185
00:12:58,338 --> 00:12:59,218
Yes.

186
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,280
Drink with me.

187
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:04,878
I can't.
The hospital might call me anytime.

188
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,640
I'll have soda.

189
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,750
That one, please.

190
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,240
When did you come here?

191
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:20,280
Not too long ago.

192
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:22,277
I knocked but no one answered.

193
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,758
I also called but you didn't pick up.

194
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,139
I fell asleep waiting at the front door.

195
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,890
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,938
I was extremely busy today.

197
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,169
The shots that were done needed editing.

198
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:32,218
I get it.

199
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:35,313
-Workaholic.
-And that's coming from you?

200
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,134
Speak for yourself, Dr. Xia.

201
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,207
I don't have that sort of
aesthetic capital like you do.

202
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:40,758
I can't afford to slack at all.

203
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,192
That's not true.

204
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:44,586
Such things are unreliable.

205
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:45,706
No matter how much aesthetic capital
one possesses,

206
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:48,177
it won't withstand the pull of gravity.

207
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,371
If I don't work hard now,
once I'm old and Grey,

208
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,792
what can I survive on?

209
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:59,488
How was your date with Dr. Zhang?

210
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,452
Zhuo Ran told me about it.

211
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,177
We just discussed about work over a meal.

212
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:08,318
It doesn't count as a date.

213
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:13,278
And you?

214
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:15,998
Did you have dinner with Zhuo Ran?

215
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:26,728
Do you still have feelings for him?

216
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,980
We went for Japanese cuisine.

217
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,559
He knows what I like.

218
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:42,297
He knows I prefer fresh ingredients,

219
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:43,848
plain dishes,

220
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,548
sweet and sour ones and Ramune soda.

221
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,471
On the matter of food,

222
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,782
he knows all my preferences
very well.

223
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:56,360
That's great.

224
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,318
It would be if relationships are only
about three meals a day.

225
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:03,904
Isn't it so?

226
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:05,441
Don't our daily habits often times...

227
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,520
make up the most important aspects
of a relationship?

228
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,661
But i think that sometimes

229
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,384
commitment is more important
than love itself.

230
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:20,108
Cheers, Mi Gu.

231
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,913
It doesn't matter if love ever comes,

232
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm all good as long as you are here.

233
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:25,718
I am here.

234
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,346
I'll definitely be here.

235
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:37,571
From tonight until tomorrow,

236
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,073
most coastal regions of Dongan...

237
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,116
will be continuously hit
by heavy rainstorms.

238
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:44,017
Various areas will be affected
by the flooding.

239
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:59,163
(Notice on the recruitment of volunteers
for disaster relief)

240
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,043
Thanks, Xia Chu.

241
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:11,936
Xia Chu.

242
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:13,528
Look at these cakes. Pick one first.

243
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:14,879
Xia Chu. I want this matcha cake.

244
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,200
It looks so cute.

245
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,181
Settle down.

246
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,859
We've got to ask her something.

247
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,160
What's this about?

248
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,368
"To Xia Chu and all medical officers
of the Cardio Surgery Department,

249
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:27,909
have a great working day.

250
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:31,262
Yours truly, Zhuo Ran."

251
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:34,662
Who is Zhuo Ran?

252
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,309
Xia Chu, who is this Zhuo Ran?

253
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:40,358
He even knows everyone's palates.

254
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,139
Did you tell him?

255
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:48,120
It seems like
that military officer is out of the game.

256
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:58,600
Xia Chu.

257
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:00,213
We've received the desserts.

258
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,253
Everyone enjoyed it.

259
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,847
Thank you.

260
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:20,934
Director Zhang.

261
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:23,368
Isn't the participation voluntary?

262
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:24,996
I don't want to go.

263
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:28,207
This is your job.

264
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,020
If everyone doesn't want to go,

265
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:30,941
what should we do about it?

266
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,561
But why must it be me?

267
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,507
I'll tell you why.

268
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:35,921
Many times before, when our sister unit

269
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,061
requested medical security,

270
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:40,041
every resident doctor has all participated
on rotational basis,

271
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:40,961
except you.

272
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:42,407
Remember,

273
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:44,548
we've all got to give back eventually.

274
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:46,593
Give me the medical records for ward 9.

275
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:47,654
But I...

276
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:48,823
I'll go.

277
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,078
You want to go to the flood-plagued areas?

278
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:58,128
Yes.

279
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,208
Forget it.

280
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:01,137
Your leg...

281
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:02,798
It's healed completely.

282
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:08,818
I should let you know.

283
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,914
A patient with heart failure
from emergency department...

284
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:13,123
will undergo heart transplant next week.

285
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,287
Moreover, it will be done by the director.

286
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,208
He said that

287
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,696
all resident doctors

288
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,427
can be present for on-site observation.

289
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:20,868
Listen.

290
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,440
This is a rare opportunity
even for our hospital.

291
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:29,686
Are you still sure you want to go?

292
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,540
I'm sure.

293
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,347
In peaceful times like this,

294
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,120
experiences similar to being a war doctor
is quite rare too.

295
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,528
Alright then.

296
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,933
Make two photocopies,

297
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:48,287
fill them up and the both of you
submit them to administration.

298
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,378
No, wait.

299
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:50,856
Do I still have to go
even when she's going?

300
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,397
She's going out of enlightenment.

301
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:53,902
You're going because it's your duty.

302
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:56,955
Stop staring at me with those big eyes.

303
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,039
What bad luck.

304
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:05,491
Reflecting it back to you.

305
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:10,713
Which flooded area did
your handsome landlord go?

306
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:11,880
Will you meet him there?

307
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,161
I don't know.

308
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:17,062
He said nothing about it when he left.

309
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,960
But special forces like his

310
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:21,163
will usually be the first
to arrive on site...

311
00:19:21,204 --> 00:19:22,504
but but the last to leave.

312
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:26,187
They're the first line of defense
and the last as well.

313
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:28,723
They just leap to where danger is.

314
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,495
They must be super courageous then.

315
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:34,870
Yes, that's right.

316
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:37,891
So Liang Mu Ze's insomnia
is pretty tough on him.

317
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,742
Why does something sound off.

318
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,358
What is it?

319
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:44,057
When you talked about him before,

320
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,078
you'd say he's strange,
doesn't sleep and how psychotic that is.

321
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:49,469
When have I?

322
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,387
You're denying? You did say that.

323
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:52,377
Fine, I'm hanging up now.

324
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:53,866
I've got to pack.

325
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,887
Remember to come pick Er Miao up.

326
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,569
I'll be gone for quite some time.

327
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,520
I can't let it stay all alone at home.

328
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,450
Got it.

329
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,600
Hanging up now, bye.

330
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,078
Alright.

331
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,067
Er Miao.

332
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,358
Should I bring Liang Mu Ze
some medicine to help him sleep?

333
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,800
Let's do this.
If you meow twice, I'll bring it.

334
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,341
If you meow once, I won't.

335
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:44,678
You get to decide.

336
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,110
Hey, you have to meow twice.

337
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,080
Meow.

338
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,120
Alright then.
I'll get the medicine.

339
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,000
You can do it, Liang Mu Ze.

340
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,958
I'll take a head count.
We'll move out once everybody is here.

341
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,948
Has everyone arrived?

342
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:19,099
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:21,485
I'm sorry I'm late.

344
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:23,559
It's okay. You arrived just in time.

345
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
-Let's move out.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:27,861
To the left, march.

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,120

357
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,318
Let me check.

358
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,681
Another 50 over kilometers to go.

359
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,591
What happened?

360
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,957
I've never done an operation yet.

361
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:06,368
I don't want to die.

362
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,859
Is everyone okay?

363
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,840
We're fine.

364
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,680
-What happened?
-What happened?

365
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,440
Are you okay?

366
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:31,880
I've cleaned your uniform
and placed it in the bus.

367
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,188
Have some water.

368
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:36,428
No, thanks.

369
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,208
If you have something to say,
just say it.

370
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:41,040
Stop pretending to be generous.

371
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,783
You stop pretending to be petty too.

372
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:46,998
Me?

373
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:48,884
At the moment of danger just now,

374
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:51,976
I heard you scream out
not wanting to die,

375
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,797
because you haven't taken on
the operating table yet.

376
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:57,216
At that moment,

377
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:00,488
I decided to forgive all your peculiar,

378
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:02,189
selfish and petty behaviors in the past.

379
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:05,988
It's because I know
you want to be a good doctor...

380
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,468
like me.

381
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:11,991
Peculiar, selfish and petty?

382
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,908
Listen here, Xia Chu.

383
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:15,760
Just because I hugged you back there
doesn't mean that

384
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:17,580
you get to say all that to me.

385
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:21,458
I'll not accept that.

386
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:26,618
Why is it taking so long to change a Tyre?

387
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,477
Do you need help, sir?

388
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:35,058
I can't change it. My tools won't work.

389
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:36,838
Then what should we do?

390
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:47,022
Stop.

391
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:52,803
Stop, stop. We need help!

392
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:56,608
Xia Chu.

393
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:59,318
We need help.

394
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:03,198
What's the matter?

395
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:05,838
Our Tyre got punctured.
My tools can't repair it.

396
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:13,297
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, sir.

397
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:14,888
-Get our men to help.
-Yes, sir.

398
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:16,389
Grab the jack lift.

399
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:20,208
You had them come over to help?

400
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,678
You think I’m capable of that?

401
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,358
What's the matter?

402
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:34,309
Sir, are you okay? Where does it hurt?

403
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,042
Come over and help get him on the truck.

404
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,748
One, two, up.

405
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:48,438
His blood pressure has
plunged to 60/90mmHg.

406
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,798
Heartbeat is at 105.

407
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,273
You two are the only doctors
from the Cardiac Surgery Department.

408
00:25:52,314 --> 00:25:53,534
Think about something.

409
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:57,911
What should we do?

410
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:02,078
I don't know.

411
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:08,418
How's it?

412
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,840
Can he be saved?

413
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:11,960
I said I don't know!
Close those blinds now.

414
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:14,478
Have your men block the road
to prevent further accidents.

415
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,198
His blood pressure is still falling.

416
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:20,838
Could it be myocardial ischemia?

417
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,878
No, his heart rate indicated
a lot of blood in the pericardial cavity.

418
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:32,918
It could be acute hemopneumothorax.

419
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,718
-We can inject dopamine.
-No.

420
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:37,438
Dopamine and noradrenaline could increase
myocardial oxygen consumption.

421
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,309
You two have to give him an operation.

422
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,269
But I've never seen
this operation done before.

423
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,940
This remote place has no signal at all.

424
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,158
What if we send him back
to the station first?

425
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,122
We'll figure it out after that.

426
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:57,423
He won't make it.

427
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:59,598
His pulse is already very weak.

428
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:02,328
You'll need to open his pericardial cavity
and identify the location of the bleeding.

429
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:03,869
Who's going to do it? Quickly now.

430
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:08,760
No, it can't be done here.

431
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm just a resident doctor.

432
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,120
After sedation, make a 5 to 6 mm
longitudinal incision...

433
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:19,238
along the left border
of the Xiphoid process.

434
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:20,959
You do it.

435
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:24,097
Sterilize her and prepare for surgery.

436
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,040
Yes.

437
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:26,760
This road is blocked.

438
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:28,877
Go that way.

439
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:30,797
That way.

440
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:32,473
(Disaster relief goods)

441
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,188
Have you found the location of bleeding?

442
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:52,234
Remove the excess blood.

443
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,128
The patient is in shock.

444
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,176
Quick, administer the
anti-shock treatment.

445
00:28:07,546 --> 00:28:08,566
Suction.

446
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:19,798
I found the location of bleeding.

447
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,378
Get ready to stitch the wound.

448
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:37,168
Trust yourself. You can do it.

449
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:30,118
His blood pressure has risen.

450
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:40,898
-Tian Yong, push the van.
-Yes, sir.

451
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,074

00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:20,638
Hi, Aunt Xia.

502
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:22,769
You are?

503
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:23,735
I'm Zhuo Ran.

504
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:26,840
Zhuo Ran?

505
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,861
Xia Chu asked me
to check on you and Uncle Xia.

506
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:32,392
Come in.

507
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,886
Have some water.

508
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,187
Thank you.

509
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,308
Xia Chu never mentioned you were coming.

510
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:47,257
I think she left in a hurry.

511
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:49,048
So she couldn't inform you in time.

512
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:50,198
Where did she go?

513
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:53,838
Her hospital formed a medical team
for the flood relief.

514
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:59,018
No wonder she didn't answer my calls
these days.

515
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:01,295
The calls never went through.

516
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:03,488
Rural areas tend to have bad signal.

517
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:04,718
Moreover, there's the heavy downpour too.

518
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:06,208
It's normal that the calls
can't get through.

519
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:07,468
Please don't worry yourselves too much.

520
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:13,307
You've always been in contact

521
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,869
with Xia Chu?

522
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:17,378
Yes.

523
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:21,353
I heard that you left for some time.

524
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:23,702
That's true.

525
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,403
My mother was sick.

526
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:28,961
During senior year of high school,
her condition worsened.

527
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:32,798
After that, a distant relative
introduced her to an overseas doctor.

528
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:34,518
I left in quite a hurry.

529
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:37,478
That's why I didn't manage
to properly say goodbye to Xia Chu.

530
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,253
How is your mother doing now?

531
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:44,038
She's dependent on medicine.

532
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,070
I'm sorry.

533
00:37:49,188 --> 00:37:50,318
It must be hard to talk about.

534
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:51,389
No, it's fine.

535
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:53,838
In fact I've been keeping it inside
for quite sometime.

536
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,608
It's kind of a relief for me
to have shared it with you.

537
00:37:57,631 --> 00:37:58,607
Anyway,

538
00:37:58,648 --> 00:37:59,798
how are you and Uncle Xia doing?

539
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:02,768
We're both fine.

540
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,968
I read on the international news online
that Uncle Xia and his team...

541
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:08,509
had some new research findings.

542
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:15,613
You don't seem too concerned
with Uncle Xia's work?

543
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,120
It's not that.

544
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,200
There are many people
who are concerned about his work.

545
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,950
For me, the real concern...

546
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,057
is whether he has taken
his three meals everyday...

547
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:28,318
or if he's eating well.

548
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:33,858
What more can a husband ask for
with such a loving wife?

549
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,418
Xia, when did you came home?

550
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:39,798
Last night.

551
00:38:40,108 --> 00:38:41,658
I was afraid to wake you up.

552
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,279
So I slept in the study instead.

553
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:44,737
Look at you.

554
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:45,708
You haven't eaten, have you?

555
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:48,038
Don't worry.

556
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:49,398
I'm leaving soon.

557
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:51,428
So soon?

558
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,187
You spend a night home
just to leave again next morning?

559
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:55,718
Why come back in the first place?

560
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:57,248
I had to use the toilet.

561
00:38:58,658 --> 00:39:00,028
What's wrong with saying that?

562
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:02,178
You know I'm very particular
with the toilet I use.

563
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:04,177
I had constipation for days.

564
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,998
Last night, I suddenly had an urge to go.

565
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,219
So I came home to give it a go.

566
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:09,798
Did it go well?

567
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:15,088
This is Xia Chu's friend, Zhuo Ran.

568
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:18,304
I meant the experiment.

569
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:21,618
I heard the conversation between you two.

570
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:27,638
Back then, my daughter shed
quite a lot of tears for you.

571
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:31,609
I'm sorry.

572
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,498
I won't let it happen again.

573
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:36,708
Thanks for visiting us.

574
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,941
If you're trying to impress Xia Chu

575
00:39:39,328 --> 00:39:40,688
by going through us,

576
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:41,879
it probably won't work.

577
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,014
I'm going to wash up now.

578
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,388
Hopefully once I'm done,

579
00:39:54,512 --> 00:39:57,928
you've already left
along with your gifts.

580
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:33,526
(Dongan University Parking Permit)

581
00:40:51,738 --> 00:40:52,678
Xia.

582
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:56,397
Did you know that Xia Chu
went to the frontline...

583
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:57,688
for the flood relief work?

584
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:01,558
Has that wild brat ever
told us anything?

585
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,488
But it's good for her too.

586
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:07,960
Good? I beg your pardon?

587
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:10,257
She's a military doctor.

588
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:12,478
It will give her
valuable field experience.

589
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:17,668
So she's a military doctor,
but not your daughter?

590
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:22,958
She's a single young lady.

591
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:25,800
Flood relief is dangerous work.

592
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:26,721
I can't ignore it.

593
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:29,600
I'll have to get my father
to transfer her back here.

594
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:32,598
She's just drifting from place to place
and it worries me.

595
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:36,238
He doesn't need to get involved
in my daughter's matter.

596
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:37,578
What are you talking about?

597
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,558
He's Xia Chu's grandpa
and your father-in-law.

598
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,198
But he was never fond of me.

599
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:10,337
I got it, Director Zhang.

600
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:13,648
Okay, got it.

601
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:18,867
Why haven't you left?

602
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:21,018
I needed to answer a phone call.

603
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:23,667
Professor Xia.

604
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,248
Can I be of any help?

605
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,101
I saw a few kids
running around with some scissors.

606
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:34,988
Where did they go?

607
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:42,044
My ride just arrived at the main entrance.

608
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,640
Are you heading back
to the research institute?

609
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:48,054
I'm on my way to the airport.

610
00:42:48,095 --> 00:42:50,205
I can give you a ride.

611
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,482
It's hard to hail a cab at this hour.

612
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,420
What kind of job are you doing now?

613
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:06,778
3D printing.

614
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:11,958
I just signed a deal with 109 Hospital...

615
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:14,614
on the research and development
of using 3D printing technology...

616
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,995
for medicine and organ printing.

617
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:47,850
Thank you for today.

618
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:48,951
You're welcome.

619
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:53,240
This is my business card.
Please take it.

620
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:58,678
It's unlikely that
we'll have any business dealings.

621
00:43:59,272 --> 00:44:00,252
Please take it.

622
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:03,498
The applications of 3D printing
may exceed your imagination.

623
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,390
Thanks a lot.

624
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:28,609
(Xia Guang Yuan)

625
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:34,447
Make sure everything is sorted out well...

626
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:36,493
before handing over to our colleagues
arriving in the afternoon.

627
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:37,407
Yes.

628
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:40,943
We're finally done
with this horrible place.

629
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:43,742
But, this horrible place turns out to be

630
00:44:43,783 --> 00:44:45,573
an integral milestone
for Xia Chu's profession.

631
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:46,655
Isn't that right, Xia Chu?

632
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,595
Although I appreciate the chance
to act as a chief surgeon,

633
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:53,656
I'd rather hope...

634
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:55,557
no one needs to suffer from it
in the first place.

635
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,135
A doctor must have a heart of a parent.
Well done.

636
00:44:58,176 --> 00:45:00,356
I must get Zhang Yi Chi
to give you a big Red Flower badge.

637
00:45:01,353 --> 00:45:04,580
I'm afraid Dr. Zhang
does not have red flowers,

638
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:05,680
but only roses.

639
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:07,920
Request to enter, sir.

640
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:09,524
Please enter.

641
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:14,666
Are you feeling unwell?

642
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:16,279
Not me, doctor.

643
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,400
I'm here to collect some medicine.

644
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:18,968
You're from the Special Force Brigade?

645
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:20,096
I've been expecting you for some time now.

646
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:22,244
Xia Chu.
Pass him those cold medicine.

647
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,165
Yes.

648
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:28,588
Thank you, Dr. Xia.

649
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:31,232
Did someone catch a cold?

650
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:32,153
It's not our captain.

651
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:36,805
Few of our men are down.

652
00:45:36,846 --> 00:45:39,656
Our poor captain
had to hold it up all alone.

653
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:41,067
He's been at the dam for nights.

654
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:42,318
He's not eating or sleeping.

655
00:45:42,575 --> 00:45:43,635
He won't listen to anyone.

656
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:45,549
Even our brigade commander
can't do anything about him.

657
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:47,659
He scolded our lieutenant instead.

658
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:51,438
Dr. Xia, why don't you try
to persuade him?
