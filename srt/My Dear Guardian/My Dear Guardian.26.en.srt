2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,070
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,190
Are you here looking
for someone of your same kind?

4
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,150
Are you?

5
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,640
What do you think?

6
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,800
Zhuo Ran.

7
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,400
Do you love me?

8
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,310
I understand
your restlessness and loneliness,

9
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,590
as much as I understand myself.

10
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,150
To me, love...

11
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,030
isn't that difficult.

12
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:38,216
It's just like...

13
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,360
Like what?

14
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,500
Dad.

15
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,850
Mum.

16
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,600
Meng Zhen. Let's eat.

17
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,120
I want to drink it.

18
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,440
Xiao Jun, eat up.

19
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,910
It's okay, he can have it.

20
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,600
It helps in digestion.

21
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,730
Here.

22
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,370
Take it.

23
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,990
Try it to see if it's delicious.

24
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,510
I don't like eggplant.

25
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,190
Xiao Jun, don't be rude.

26
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,336
Zhang Yi Chi loves eggplant.

27
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,576
When I was hospitalised,

28
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,760
I saw him ordering
braised eggplant with rice.

29
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,630
Xiao Jun has good memories.

30
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,150
It's not good to be a picky eater.

31
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,006
Here, let's dig in.

32
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,770
-Here.
-Okay.

33
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,930
Here.

34
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,390
Okay.

35
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,110
Well...

36
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,530
Meng Zhen.

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,360
What do you do for a living?

38
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,820
I own a bookstore.

39
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,030
I also sell clothes that I design
on my own and some stationary.

40
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,160
You're self-employed.

41
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,280
Back in the university,
which course did you major in?

42
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,006
I majored in Dramatic Literature.

43
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,326
After graduating from the university,

44
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,993
I went back to my hometown and joined
an opera troupe as a screenwriter.

45
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,286
I think it's fate.

46
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,790
I decided to stay in Ningjiang.

47
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,909
In the end, I set up the bookstore...

48
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,240
and met my late husband.

49
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,590
Your late husband?

50
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,390
He's a military officer.

51
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,790
He sacrificed in a battle eight years ago.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,220
It's not easy to be you.

53
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,040
It's all right.

54
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,450
Dad.

55
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,510
Meng Zhen is the most talented...

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,446
among my female friends.

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,030
Furthermore,
she knows how to live a good life.

58
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,280
I bet you live under stress.

59
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,480
Everyone lives under stress these days.

60
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,120
For example, in the hospital,
those residents who work under me...

61
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,046
usually resign within three years.

62
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,230
Do you know why?

63
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,495
Their job is tiring and worse,
they don't make much from it.

64
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,190
Their income is not as much
as self-employed.

65
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,880
If the job is so terrible,

66
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,990
why don't you change jobs
and become a bookseller too?

67
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,430
You don't say.

68
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,310
It's crossed my mind before.

69
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,409
Meng Zhen.

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,350
Are you hiring?

71
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,390
Stop joking.

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,558
You're a cardiac surgeon.

73
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,056
Don't put yourself on a job
unworthy of your talents.

74
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,350
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,470
To be frank, everyone can be
a master in their own special field.

76
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,600
There is neither lowliness
nor nobleness in careers.

77
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,270
Be it a doctor
or a self-employed bookstore owner,

78
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,910
I think it's just a job anyway.

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,200
Am I right, dad?

80
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,960
Here. Try the braised eggplant.

81
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:11,416
Try it.

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,380
Here.

83
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,736
It's your son's favourite.

84
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,240
Here, try it.

85
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,750
Mum, I need to use the washroom.

86
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,720
Sure, let me show you the way.

87
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,016
I can show him the way.

88
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,670
It's okay. I know the way.

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
Sit down.

90
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,605
Even if you don't want
to date someone of the same profession,

91
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,840
you can find someone
from another profession.

92
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,950
She could be a banker, a teacher,
or a government servant.

93
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,270
We have introduced so many ladies to you.

94
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,830
Any of them is a good catch.

95
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,486
How aren't you fond of them?

96
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,640
Look at you.

97
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,566
You're after a lady
who got married before.

98
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,646
She has a son too.

99
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,616
What's wrong with a lady
who got married before?

100
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,030
What's wrong with that?

101
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,670
Mum, what's wrong with you?

102
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,790
Are you here to mess things up?

103
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,180
Mum.

104
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,496
-Have you washed your hands?
-Yes.

105
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,460
Let's go.

106
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,970
Mum.

107
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,880
I shouldn't have come with you, right?

108
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,990
No.

109
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,686
Why do you think so?

110
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,950
I can feel that
the old lady doesn't like me.

111
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,150
What makes you feel so?

112
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,803
She said that I'm not good.

113
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,280
You've misunderstood.
She doesn't mean that.

114
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,150
She thinks that it's not good
to be a picky eater.

115
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,366
Look, you're still young, right?
You're growing.

116
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,470
How do you grow up
if you are fussy about food?

117
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,630
She said that out of concern.

118
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,646
I criticise you at times too, right?

119
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,240
However, I'll always love you.

120
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,200
Am I right?

121
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,720
Stop thinking too much. Let's go.

122
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,040
If only I was not born.

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,460
Xiao Jun.

124
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,670
Listen carefully.

125
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,870
To me, you're the most important.

126
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,800
I don't mind losing everything...

127
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,390
but I can't afford to lose you.

128
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,550
Do you get it?

129
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,570
Yes.

130
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,210
That's great.

131
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,290
Be happy.

132
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,510
Be happy.

133
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,690
Let's go.

134
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,246
Listen.

135
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,550
For example, in the hospital,

136
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,390
the best surgeon
is not necessarily the most popular.

137
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,830
The person who suits me the best
is not necessarily a catch.

138
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,366
You're paranoid
because I don't have a girlfriend.

139
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,600
When I finally date someone,
you're being fussy.

140
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,150
I'm already 38 years old.

141
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,110
Of course. I'm not compromising
because I'm getting old.

142
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,046
That's because Meng Zhen is outstanding.
She's really outstanding.

143
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,790
You haven't discovered that side of her.

144
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,360
It's destiny.

145
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,560
I accept my fate.

146
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,510
In that case,
you're ready to be a stepfather.

147
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,350
Xiao Jun is a good boy.

148
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,896
That's irrelevant.

149
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,160
Moving forward, if you marry his mum,

150
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,480
you'll have a son all of a sudden.

151
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,150
It's not about living together
for a short period of time.

152
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,030
You'll have to live together
day in and day out.

153
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,070
It could be a few years
or a few decades.

154
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,120
Both of you are not blood related.

155
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,910
Are you sure you can be responsible
to him as a stepfather?

156
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,690
Also,

157
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,720
moving forward,
you will have your own child.

158
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,393
You will have two children in total.

159
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,510
Are you sure when the time comes,

160
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,400
you can be fair to both of them?

161
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,430
Xiao Jun.

162
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,150
You're back.

163
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,200
Xiao Jun has to go to school tomorrow.
He can't stay up.

164
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm bringing him home.
Enjoy the food.

165
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,920
Let me escort you out.

166
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,526
It's okay. We can go back on our own.

167
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,456
Let's go.

168
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,440
Xiao Chi!

169
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,190
I'm full.

170
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,260
You!

171
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,240
Meng Zhen.

172
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,640
Let me send you.

173
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,360
It's okay.
We can go back on our own.

174
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,406
By the way, I've transferred
the money for the present to you.

175
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,520
Thank you for preparing
the present on behalf of me.

176
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,750
What is going on?

177
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,416
Let's go. Let me send you.

178
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,390
It's okay.

179
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,710
It'll be difficult to drop the habit
once it becomes one.

180
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,350
Then, I'll just keep the habit.

181
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,070
When your dad asked you the question,
you hesitated, didn't you?

182
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm a mother with a son.

183
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,456
Hence, I can understand
your parent's feelings.

184
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,080
They just want to protect their son
and give what's best to their son.

185
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,790
It's understandable.

186
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,160
Therefore,
please understand my feelings too.

187
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,750
As for our relationship,

188
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,880
please give it some thought.

189
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,670
Both of us should give it some thought.
What do you think?

190
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,966
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Yi Chi.

191
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,950
Goodbye.

192
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,890
We're leaving.

193
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,150
Are you hungry?

194
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,830
Here. It's time to eat.

195
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,580
Eat up.

196
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,550
What's wrong?

197
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,430
Give me a shave.
Didn't you complain that it's prickly?

198
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,830
Give you a shave?
Can't you do it on your own?

199
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,270
I can't do it.

200
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,726
Why?

201
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,710
I'm injured.

202
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,960
Where did you hurt yourself?

203
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,230
It's over here.

204
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,870
Let me see.

205
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,520
Is it painful?

206
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

207
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,310
Give me a shave.

208
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,560
Okay.

209
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,710
I'll do it for you.

210
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,550
You're quite good at shaving.
Have you done it before?

211
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,260
For whom?

212
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,670
Zhuo Ran?

213
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,270
I did it for patients.

214
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,510
When I worked
at the general surgery department,

215
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,126
I was in charge of skin preparation
before surgery was conducted.

216
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,470
It lasted for a month.

217
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,120
Making you shave
is a waste of your talents.

218
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,430
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

219
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,400
What for?

220
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,360
Thank you for carrying me back home.

221
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,240
I didn't know that
you've injured yourself.

222
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,000
I chose to carry you on my back.

223
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,030
I hit you too.

224
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,960
Is it painful?

225
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,110
Yes.

226
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,376
What should I do?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

227
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,269
You've hit me anyway.
What's the point of telling you?

228
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,990
Well...

229
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,430
How should I make up to you?

230
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,136
You are already making up to me.

231
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,590
It would be better
if you could take it more seriously.

232
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,680
No matter what,
I still want to thank you.

233
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,376
If you didn't appear today,

234
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,080
I would be put through
a more awkward situation.

235
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,080
Are you sure you're only awkward today?

236
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,190
You can say whatever you want.

237
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,680
It's done, Captain Liang.

238
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you happy with it?

239
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,200
Not bad, at least you didn't injure me.

240
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,600
Perhaps you're right.

241
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,560
There is nevertheless
a gap of eight years.

242
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,880
Many things have changed.

243
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,350
Example?

244
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,110
Zhuo Ran admitted
that he installed the tapping device.

245
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,030
I knew it from the beginning.

246
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,520
You knew it?

247
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,990
My understanding of Zhuo Ran
is beyond your imagination.

248
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,750
You won, Liang Mu Ze.

249
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,590
Like I said, I don't care about winning.

250
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,550
I care about the people.

251
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,640
It's for you.

252
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,406
What a cute keychain.

253
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,510
Where did you get it?

254
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,910
I made it.

255
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,910
You?

256
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,670
You know how to make this?

257
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,160
Do you like it?

258
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,480
I like anything that comes from you.

259
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,646
If that's the case, keep it properly.

260
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,606
Don't lose it.

261
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,670
Got it?

262
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,400
Sure.

263
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,430
Xia Chu.

264
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,590
The person who attempted to kidnap you
has been arrested by the police.

265
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,630
However, you have to be careful.
Stay vigilant.

266
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,120
Especially...

267
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,200
What?

268
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,040
Don't meet up with Zhuo Ran alone.

269
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,720
It's for your own good.

270
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,350
Got it.

271
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,920
I instructed my secretary to get you
a set of lingerie based on your size.

272
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,550
She will send it here later.

273
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,320
Do you mind?

274
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,790
She's your secretary.

275
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,680
It's okay so long as you don't mind.

276
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,030
What are you doing?

277
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,310
I've set up a public account
and it's ready to be published.

278
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,765
I didn't know that
you have a public account.

279
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,099
It's done.

280
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm going to blow dry my hair.

281
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,750
The hair dryer...

282
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,040
I want to read your article.

283
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,550
I'm giving you access.

284
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,010
From now on,

285
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,480
you're the co-admin of my public account.

286
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,030
If I don't have the time,
you may publish posts on my behalf.

287
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,320
Aren't you worried that
I may mess things up?

288
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,870
No.

289
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,760
To you, I've never been on my guard.

290
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,390
How about you?

291
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,580
Zhuo Ran.

292
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:14,525
Rao Zhi. Long Yi's lawyer is here
demanding him to be released right away.

293
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,490
Rao Zhi!

294
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,696
Call the ambulance!

295
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,726
I'm here. Don't be scared.
I'm here.

296
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,896
I'm here.

297
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,096
I'm here.

298
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,110
I'm here.

299
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,330
Rao Zhi.

300
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,190
The test result is out.

301
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,820
Long Yi is the suspect, Xiao Yang.

302
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,318
He underwent plastic surgeries.

303
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,070
Rao Zhi!

304
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,320
Please calm down.

305
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,856
Rao Zhi! Stop Rao Zhi!

306
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,531
Don't let him go into
the interrogation chamber!

307
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,990
-Rao Zhi!
-Rao Zhi!

308
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,470
Rao Zhi!

309
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,830
Rao Zhi!

310
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,990
Rao Zhi!

311
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,600
Rao Zhi!

312
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,510
Rao Zhi!

313
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,456
Lock up the investigation chamber!

314
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,760
Rao Zhi!

315
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,270
-Rao Zhi!
-Calm down, Rao Zhi!

316
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,910
Stay aside!

317
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,430
Rao Feng.

318
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,190
You're a veteran police officer.

319
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,560
I don't have to tell you everything
because you should have known it.

320
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,830
You are not allowed to touch him.

321
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,150
Why?

322
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,750
Why?

323
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,360
Now, the only evidence in our hands,

324
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,030
is the testimony
given by Zhuo Ran against him.

325
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,456
However,

326
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,190
the credibility of the testimony...

327
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,280
is uncertain.

328
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,640
He's the legal representative
of the 3D Printing Company.

329
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,600
We found a 3D printed mask
near the black maple forest.

330
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,110
Soon after,

331
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,750
he followed Xia Chu
in an attempt to kidnap her.

332
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,200
He also appeared in the jungle along
the border where drug dealers meet.

333
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,850
The 3D printed mask was broken.

334
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,670
We were unable to retrieve
his fingerprints from the mask.

335
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,930
As such,

336
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,160
everything that you said
is only our assumptions.

337
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,040
It can't be considered as evidence.

338
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,440
Furthermore,

339
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,870
the real culprit
has not fallen into the trap.

340
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,360
How about my daughter?

341
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,190
That scum has destroyed my family!

342
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,630
Ever since Xiao Xue met
with that mishap at the age of 13,

343
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:15,762
every day, I woke up in fear
from the nightmare. Do you know that?

344
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,456
I've stopped drinking beer.

345
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,446
I don't have the guts to drink anymore.

346
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,110
Do you know why?

347
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,137
That's because when I see the bottles,

348
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:28,000
I would be reminded of how the bottles
were stuck in my daughter's body!

349
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,400
She was only 13 years old.

350
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,766
The doctor said that
the injury would never recover.

351
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,880
It would never recover
for the rest of her life.

352
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,520
My wife...

353
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,720
No, I mean my ex-wife.

354
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,870
She divorced me because of that.

355
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,950
She said she wished she'd never met me.

356
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,830
My daughter...

357
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,566
I could have taken good care of them.

358
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,686
But I couldn't do that!

359
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,296
I could only send them far away from me.

360
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,886
They have to stay away from me.

361
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,590
My daughter called me cold-blooded.

362
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,016
She said that I'm an irresponsible father.

363
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,136
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

364
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,430
Am I?

365
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,780
I know.

366
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,640
I'm a police officer.

367
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,230
As I'm wearing the uniform,
I have to be a role model.

368
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,560
I deserve to be punished
when I violate the rules and regulations.

369
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,326
I acknowledge that. I accept that.

370
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,846
However, Xiao Xue is my daughter!

371
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,200
I would risk my life to protect her!

372
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,216
Do you know that, Director?

373
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,966
Ever since Xiao Xue and her mum left,
I've officially died inside.

374
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,726
The only motivation that keeps me living
is to arrest that scum!

375
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,216
No matter how far I have to go,

376
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,920
I have to ensure that
I rope him up and wheel him to justice!

377
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,086
I'm not going to forgive him.

378
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,510
I'm not going to be generous!

379
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,120
Only by doing so can I continue living.
Do you know that?

380
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,926
Now, the person
who harmed my daughter is back.

381
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,216
He's just right in front of me.

382
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,510
His hands are full of my daughter's blood.

383
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,390
Yet, you told me not to touch him?

384
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,150
You even want me to let go of him?

385
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,670
I can't do it!

386
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,920
Officer 052326.

387
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,349
The detention period of Rao Feng,
Captain of the Criminal Investigation,

388
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,520
Division of the Public Security Bureau
is up.

389
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,990
Let him go.

390
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,840
Yes.

391
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,526
I don't want to leave! I want to see
Tian Yong undergoing training!

392
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,590
I want to see Tian Yong
undergoing training!

393
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,436
I want to see Tian Yong
undergoing training!

394
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,920
Stop it!

395
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:36,406
Listen.

396
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,710
You have two choices.

397
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,520
It's either you stay at home or you
will be sent back with the army truck.

398
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,366
Why can't I watch the training?
It's not confidential.

399
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,286
I just want
to see how iron men are trained.

400
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,456
-No way.
-Why?

401
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,220
-You're affecting Tian Yong's performance.
-I...

402
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,190
Are you still in a cold war with your dad?

403
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,800
It's none of your business.

404
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,480
Stop calling me, will you?

405
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,050
Delivery?

406
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,320
I'm not at home at the moment.

407
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,830
I gave you the address?

408
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,430
Will you please place it in the cabinet?
I'll get the parcel when I'm back.

409
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,920
All right, thank you.
Sorry for the trouble.

410
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,640
Well...

411
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,976
Can I go home now?

412
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,110
-Have you thought it through?
-I need to get my parcel.

413
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,120
When did she leave?

414
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,960
I think it's almost time.

415
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,230
I think I could run into her
if I go there now.

416
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,970
Sure.

417
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,360
Thanks, Mu Ze.

418
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,470
Are we heading to Cambridge Bay?

419
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,040
When is your wife's baby due?

420
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,470
When is the expected date?

421
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,200
It's been a few days late.

422
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,416
My mother-in-law told me
when she's pregnant with my wife,

423
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,845
she got into labour a few days late too.

424
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,390
When my wife gave birth to Xiao Xue,

425
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,760
she got into labour late too.

426
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,485
I think it's normal
when the baby is a girl.

427
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,461
Does that mean those
who are pregnant with a baby boy,

428
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:13,898
will deliver earlier than expected?

429
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,440
I mean, my ex wife.

430
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,550
Listen,

431
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,830
when you have become a dad,
you must prioritize your wife and child.

432
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,350
Keep them company whenever you have time.

433
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,216
I know that.

434
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,360
Knowing it isn't sufficient.
You need to do it.

435
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,126
Listen.

436
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,800
Children grow up in a blink of an eye.

437
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,000
When you're ready to keep them company,

438
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,606
they've already grown up.

439
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,606
It's too late by then.

440
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,230
Especially when you have a daughter...

441
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,720
Rao Zhi.

442
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,456
When you reach there,
spend time with your daughter.

443
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,640
Don't think about other things.

444
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,166
I'll be waiting for you at the entrance.

445
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,186
Just give me a call if anything.
I'll be there anytime.

446
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,760
Is it nice?

447
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,070
Liang Shao Xue.

448
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,200
You have such a great taste.

449
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,416
Hello.

450
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,006
Hello, I have a parcel for Xia Chu.

451
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,070
Please pick up the parcel
at the pick up point now.

452
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,270
Are you going out?

453
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,886
I'm going to collect a parcel.

454
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,486
Are you going to
the pick up point at the entrance?

455
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,406
Li Lei is there.

456
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,946
I'll get him
to collect the parcel for you.

457
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,230
Hold on, Xiao Xue.

458
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,290
Li Lei.

459
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,600
Please collect a parcel for me...

460
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,830
Did I say I wanted someone
to collect it for me?

461
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,390
Did you ask me first?

462
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,456
No.

463
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,366
-Xiao Xue, I thought...
-You thought...

464
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,126
You always do everything on your own will.

465
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,160
You've never cared about my opinion.

466
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,280
Xiao Xue, let's go together.

467
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,376
Stop following me!

468
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,440
You're so irritating!

469
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,430
It must be Liang Mu Ze again.

470
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,840
It's nothing to do with him.

471
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,630
Even if he didn't tell me,

472
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,120
-I could trace you too.
-Stop looking for me!

473
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,320
It's pointless.

474
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,400
I won't tell you
what happened in the tunnel the other day.

475
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,230
It's okay.

476
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,480
However, you must protect yourself.

477
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,640
In the future, avoid going
to places like Yunshan Tunnel.

478
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,960
Don't tell anyone
you went there on that night.

479
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,840
Don't tell others that I'm your dad.

480
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,429
Leave this place when you have
had your fun. Go back to your mum.

481
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,139
-Okay?
-No!

482
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,805
You refuse to acknowledge me.

483
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,469
Why should I listen to you?

484
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,750
Why should I?

485
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,600
Xiao Xue!

486
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,310
Will you stop following me?

487
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,630
I really hate you.

488
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,160
Hello, I'm here
to collect Xia Chu's parcel.

489
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,040
Are you Xia Chu?

490
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,070
No. I'm her housemate.

491
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,550
You called me earlier.

492
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,190
Is this seafood?

493
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,310
Yes.

494
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,880
Please show me the inside.

495
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,040
Hurry up.

496
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,150
Fine.

497
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,830
I'll examine it when I reach home.

498
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,640
What are you doing?

499
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,760
Wake up.

500
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,366
Please don't just lie on the ground.

501
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,870
Wake up!

502
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,470
Help!

503
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,240
Village Chief.

504
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,520
Okay, I'll be there soon.

505
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:45,737
(Missiong Failed)

506
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:49,703
(The target has not been killed)

507
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,530
(Rescue Room)

508
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,886
Why are you rescuing him?

509
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,446
-Please calm down.
-Let him die!

510
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,240
Why did you do that to my dad?

511
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,590
-You're such a scum!
-Please calm down.

512
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,830
Scum!

513
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,486
Why did you do that to my dad?

514
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,126
Return my dad to me!

515
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,750
Xiao Xue, calm down please.

516
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,430
Why are you rescuing a murderer?

517
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,470
He is now a witness!

518
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,830
Teng.

519
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,566
Give it to me, Teng.

520
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,400
Give it to me, Teng.

521
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,720
When can we meet again?

522
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,560
Way to go, Xiang Yang.

523
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,270
You're engaged in online dating.

524
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,726
Take it.

525
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,230
Let me do it on my own.

526
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,486
We're bringing you breaking news.

527
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,376
A serious explosion took place
at Cambridge Bay in the morning.

528
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,936
The casualties are pending confirmation.

529
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,520
According to the residents,

530
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:25,046
the explosion gave forth
a tremendous sound.

531
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,976
At the moment, police officers,
firemen and medical officers

532
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,976
have rushed to the scene.

533
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,120
The number of casualties
will be ascertained later.

534
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,040
Attention!

535
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,190
I saw the news.

536
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,230
The Public Security Bureau
just gave me a call.

537
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,633
-Liang Mu Ze.
-Yes!

538
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:49,245
Go to the hospital
to check on the situation.

539
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,210
Yes!

540
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,206
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

541
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,830
-You should tag along.
-Yes!

542
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,270
Ms. Gu!

543
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,590
-Village Chief.
-Director Mi.

544
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,726
Have you found Ke Wei?

545
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,690
Not yet.

546
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,176
We tried to reach him through phone.

547
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,446
A few days ago, there were still signals.
Now, we couldn't reach him at all.

548
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,576
Before he left, did he say anything
or mention any place?

549
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,470
My grandson is a good boy.

550
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,806
He seldom talks.

551
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,360
Did he behave abnormally?

552
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,480
-No.
-He did.

553
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,166
-He refused to sleep.
-It's like this.

554
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,150
Lately,

555
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,860
he's obsessed with computer games.

556
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,080
Qian Rong,

557
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,326
who is his mum,
paid him a visit a few days ago.

558
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,736
She gave him a laptop.

559
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,936
He's so excited.
He couldn't stop playing on the laptop.

560
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,910
Where is the laptop?
Please show it to me.

561
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,056
-Well...
-Well...

562
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,900
This lady... Who is she?

563
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,150
Report to the police.

564
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,360
I've pasted the documents for you.

565
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,840
Thank you.

566
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,110
This is another set of documents.

567
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,800
I need Professor Tang's help
to improvise it.

568
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,446
Your main goal...

569
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,800
in asking me to do all these
is not to build a factory in Dong'an.

570
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,240
Your main goal...

571
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,456
is to obtain project information
for the other companies, right?

572
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,720
Is there any difference?

573
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,446
I just want to focus on research.

574
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,160
I don't want to be a commercial spy.

575
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,910
Your salary for the month
has been transferred to your bank account.

576
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,616
Where did you get the particulars?

577
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,920
I have a way to obtain it.

578
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,190
Professor Xia, good day.

579
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm Zhuo Ran.

580
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,590
I saw on the news that an explosion
took place in Xia Chu's neighbourhood.

581
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,280
Did she contact you?

582
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:50,960
Is she okay?

583
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,000
Lan Zi Yu!

584
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,300
What's wrong?

585
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,520
Is Xia Chu living at Cambridge Bay?

586
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,326
You mean Ningjiang?

587
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,630
Yes, her house in Ningjiang.

588
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,000
Yes, what's wrong?

589
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,710
Is she staying together
with Liang Mu Ze?

590
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,870
She rented a room at his place.

591
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,446
Furthermore, Liang Mu Ze
usually stays in the military camp.

592
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,830
Why are you shouting?

593
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,030
Just how many things
are you hiding from me?

594
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,390
Will he die?

595
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,030
I can't give you any confirmation on that,

596
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,750
but please trust us.

597
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,830
Xiao Xue!
