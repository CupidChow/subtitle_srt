=Episode 21=

3
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:38,644
Mi Gu.

4
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:41,414
Boss.

5
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,280
The...

6
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,712
The clip is almost ready.

7
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:48,370
I'll send it to your office
once I've reviewed the captions.

8
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm not here for the clip.

9
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:53,204
This.

10
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:57,238
My nephew
studied documentary making in Bristol.

11
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,939
He wants to do a project of his own.

12
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,919
If you're free in the next couple of days,

13
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,009
get in touch with him.

14
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,288
He's a nice kid.

15
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:04,293
You two will get along well.

16
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,085
Think of it as making a new friend.

17
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:07,800
Thanks, boss.
(Liu Song)

18
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:10,048
That's right.

19
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:13,520
Friends and family
should look out for each other.

20
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:25,920
Contact the buyer.

21
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:27,552
Okay.

22
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:56,760
Alright, thanks.

23
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,560
Rao Zhi.

24
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
Do you know him?

25
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:04,880
No.

26
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,080
We found this in his phone.

27
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,800
Is this the dead man in the villa?

28
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,440
-That's right.
-Is he the killer?

29
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,924
We're not sure yet.

30
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,451
I've asked my colleagues
in the technical department...

31
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,360
to do a DNA test on the body.

32
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,689
I've also contacted the
telecommunications operator.

33
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,560
We need to confirm his identity first.

34
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,720
If he's not the killer,
how do you explain the photo?

35
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,168
Ever heard of the City of Desire?

36
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:31,408
What's that?

37
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:34,069
It's a website.

38
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,730
But it's a little different
from the websites we're used to.

39
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,760
It's a trading platform hidden deep
within the Dark Web.

40
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,080
The founder could be related
to an account named Scary Pirate.

41
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:48,008
It was Scary Pirate
who first posted this photo...

42
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,160
on the City of Desire.

43
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:50,974
Before this, a female suicide victim...

44
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,080
had downloaded the photo
onto her computer.

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,340
Now, it seems...

46
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,979
this photo
didn't pop up by pure chance.

47
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:05,160
I suspect it's some form of invitation.

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,130
A means to identify an in-group member.

49
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:08,613
Behind it all,

50
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:11,920
there may very well
be a deeper, darker secret.

51
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,760
The Scary Pirate,

52
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:15,960
what's his aim?

53
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,373
Our colleagues at
the Psychology Department...

54
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:21,560
put together a profile
of the Scary Pirate.

55
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,360
We learned that he's probably
an anti-social militant anarchist.

56
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,680
Those types are characterized
by their aggression...

57
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,680
and lack of remorse.

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,050
Their crimes
tend to appear coincidental.

59
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:36,459
How can we find him?

60
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:37,795
It's difficult.

61
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:39,320
The Dark Web is notorious
for its anonymity.

62
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,270
Those who dwell within it
are akin to masked men...

63
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,520
moving in the shadows.

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,240
They're very hard to catch.

65
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,517
Perhaps this Scary Pirate...

66
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,480
is the culprit behind the dead man
in the villa?

67
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,800
Not only that.

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,548
There's also Sang Kun's
borderland organ harvesting case...

69
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:03,059
and his brother, Gui's death.

70
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,200
He may very well be a key lead.

71
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,753
All we can do now
is use the Scary Pirate's...

72
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:14,710
online activity pattern
to perform a stake-out.

73
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:18,518
Hopefully, we'll get some clues
or his personal information.

74
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,422
But because of the Dark Web's
peculiarities,

75
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:22,586
even if we spend an inordinate amount

76
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,625
of manpower and money,

77
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,988
we might still lose track of him.

78
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,760
Progress will be slow.

79
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,720
Rao Zhi.

80
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:34,729
The Network Security Center just called.

81
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:36,560
Gui's cargo has surfaced.

82
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:57,705
Lieutenant.

83
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,240
Come play with us.

84
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:01,743
If you don't,

85
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:03,806
Xiao Teng is going to wipe the floor
with me.

86
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:04,760
What are you saying?

87
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,200
Lieutenant.

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,040
You're holding the book upside down.

89
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,611
It's called being a proficient reader.

90
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:21,029
Lieutenant,

91
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:23,229
whose call are you waiting for?

92
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,400
I'm not waiting for anyone's call.

93
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,842
Even Xiang Yang could tell.

94
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:31,137
Quit being so secretive.

95
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,040
You must be waiting for a girl
to call you.

96
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,960
Last time, at the New Year dinner,

97
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:42,160
I overheard the Brigade Commander's
conversation with the chief of delegates.

98
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:45,400
He was asking him to
watch over a certain nurse...

99
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,482
in the medical corps for you.

100
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,480
Could something have turned up?

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,080
Xiao Teng.

102
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,350
Your ears sure are sharp.

103
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,527
How come I didn't hear that?

104
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:58,870
I can't help it.

105
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:01,080
Collecting Intel is my speciality.

106
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:02,880
Attention!

107
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,600
Commander!

108
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,120
Which ones of you

109
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:10,722
have been to a bar?

110
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:14,039
Commander.

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,953
You have?

112
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:18,054
I was going to say
I've never been to a bar.

113
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:22,074
Xiao Teng!

114
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,080
Yes, sir!

115
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:25,320
Have you?

116
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,970
Commander,

117
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:32,130
I've never set foot in one of those
cesspools of debauchery.

118
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,360
You haven't?

119
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,059
Then how do you know
they're cesspools of debauchery?

120
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,440
That's ancient history, way before
I joined the force.

121
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,344
Who else?

122
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,320
Commander!

123
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:49,473
Me.

124
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:51,014
There's no need to tell me
you haven't been to one.

125
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:51,960
I have.

126
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,120
Before I joined the force,
I worked in a bar.

127
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,080
Well I'll be.

128
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,710
You. And you.

129
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,680
Change into some civilian clothes
and follow me.

130
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:03,969
Yes, sir!

131
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,184
Once you've reached the destination,

132
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:11,245
go straight upstairs.

133
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,120
Someone will be waiting for you.

134
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,160
Commander, what's the mission?

135
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,415
You'll know when you get there.

136
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:21,025
Remember,

137
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,880
you must follow our command.

138
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:25,440
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:44,503
Wipe the sweat.

140
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:25,520
Whale?

141
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:27,309
Aren't you supposed to be on break?

142
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:28,582
Let's talk over there.

143
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:30,840
Well, Gopher?

144
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,240
Don't I look dashing?

145
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:36,645
Have you ever seen
a more dashing waiter?

146
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,225
I say,

147
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,920
what's with the heart Armour?

148
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,680
I crafted it out of a used
bulletproof vest.

149
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,256
Seriously?

150
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,840
It's better than having nothing at all.

151
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,040
Impressive.

152
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,936
Tell me, is there anything you can't do?

153
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,760
Once you've had your heart
pierced by a bullet,

154
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,686
let alone heart Armour,

155
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,400
you'll learn how to crank out
chain mails.

156
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:03,901
I guess you're right.

157
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright.

158
00:10:18,856 --> 00:10:19,960
Have you suited up?

159
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,080
Yes.

160
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,001
Captain.

161
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,971
We've coordinated with the bar.

162
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,646
Let me remind you,

163
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,877
these aren't run-of-the-mill
drug dealers we're arresting.

164
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,969
They all have a long list
of murder charges

165
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,600
as well as T4's backing.

166
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,878
They are the shadow.

167
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,480
And we're the shadow's shadow.

168
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,686
Our mission
is to apprehend the middleman...

169
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,037
as soon as the deal takes place.

170
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,294
Try not to use bullets
or create a huge racket.

171
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,715
Wouldn't want to hurt the innocent.

172
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,840
Suspect spotted.

173
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:42,327
Fox.

174
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,201
Try to approach his backpack.

175
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,307
Sorry, sir.

176
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,768
Let me wipe that for you.

177
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,280
Whale, follow him.

178
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:02,267
Calling all teams. This is a trap.

179
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:20,560
What's going on?

180
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,400
The City of Desire has changed domains.

181
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,840
Into the deeper Dark Web.

182
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:27,400
The Scary Pirate posted
a wanting-to-sell ad...

183
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,956
the day after Gui was murdered.

184
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,865
Later, he got in touch
with a buyer called Franster...

185
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,836
and agreed to deal in Yunshan Tunnel.

186
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,680
The bar is probably a diversion.

187
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,382
Ask the City Bureau
to deploy its people...

188
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,196
to set up blockades along
the roads connected to Yunshan Tunnel...

189
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:57,077
and check all vehicles.

190
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,048
Okay.

191
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:02,117
Have you checked the suspect
in the bar?

192
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,538
The stationed officers
have checked them.

193
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,069
The backpack contained only
some daily necessities.

194
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,800
Nothing suspicious was found.

195
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,960
Criminals these days sure are tricky.

196
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:31,568
What did you expect?

197
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:34,109
Why did you think we set up
such an elaborate stake-out?

198
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,560
Too bad we didn't catch him.

199
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:39,840
We will.

200
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,320
That's right.

201
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,200
Nothing is perfect.

202
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:46,080
Once something goes down,
there's nowhere to hide.

203
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,767
You should have confidence
and be brave.

204
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:51,720
No matter how many times you fail,

205
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:53,040
you must pick yourself up.

206
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:56,680
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:04,317
Aren't we talking about
busting crimes?

208
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,560
Why do I feel you're talking
about relationships?

209
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:09,496
Get out of here.
About your experience in finding love.

210
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:12,680
I was talking about busting crime.

211
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:13,760
Do you understand?

212
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:15,802
Really?

213
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:18,360
Something's not right here.

214
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:20,769
What's going on, Gopher?

215
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,240
-Don't touch me.
-Look...

216
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:23,381
Calling all teams.

217
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,640
You can pull back now.

218
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,800
Roger that.

219
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,889
Let's change and get out of here.

220
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:29,960
Okay.

221
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:38,741
Sir.

222
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:41,987
What is it?

223
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,080
Thank you for letting me
observe the operation.

224
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,381
You're too kind.

225
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:49,720
You deserved it.

226
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,440
Remember,

227
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:52,916
even if they're off life support,

228
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:56,387
one in four patients
may still die of infections.

229
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,640
Understood.

230
00:15:58,976 --> 00:15:59,996
Get some rest.

231
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:01,640
Sir.

232
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,840
Can I borrow your phone?

233
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,339
What about yours?

234
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,161
Mine is sodden.

235
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,560
I would like to use yours
to call Liang Mu Ze.

236
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,076
Thanks to him,

237
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,720
we were able to get
the replacement lung.

238
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:17,960
You ought to.

239
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,046
But I'm sorry to tell you,

240
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,640
look, my battery's dead.

241
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,321
I was just about find a place
to make a phone call.

242
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:25,228
Never mind.

243
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,409
I'll charge it.

244
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:34,800
You can use mine.

245
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:39,957
Thanks.

246
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,717
Captain, you had a long day.

247
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,040
Why don't you let me drive?

248
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:51,000
It's okay.

249
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm good.

250
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,160
Letting my captain chauffeur me.

251
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,680
How is this appropriate?

252
00:16:57,732 --> 00:16:59,602
With your driving speed? Forget it.

253
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,680
I want to live.

254
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:04,901
That was because we were
chased by enemies during the drill.

255
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,172
A good soldier never falls back.

256
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:08,640
That's what Lieutenant taught me.

257
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:09,600
Right, Lieutenant?

258
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:14,200
What's on your mind?

259
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,280
What do you mean?

260
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:19,856
Look at you.

261
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,000
And you say it's not love?

262
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,200
Are you kidding me?

263
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,155
That's my phone.

264
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:33,802
I'm just checking the time.

265
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:36,960
Liang Mu Ze.

266
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:39,960
My phone is sodden.

267
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,611
I'm calling you from
my colleague's phone.

268
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,011
How come your phone
is working just fine?

269
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:45,306
Yeah, it's fine.

270
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:47,395
If your phone is wet,

271
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:49,920
you can try putting it
in a bag of rice.

272
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:51,640
Got it.

273
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:55,600
So is Liu Ran alright?

274
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:59,221
The surgery was a success.

275
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,950
Her lungs are starting
to function again.

276
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:04,520
Good.

277
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:08,617
But there are more challenges
down the road.

278
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:12,477
Rejection and infection
being the two major hurdles...

279
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,320
to sustained lung function.

280
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,520
Under your care,

281
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,720
it shouldn't be a problem, right?

282
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:19,760
Actually,

283
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,120
I'm not that great.

284
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,120
It was the effort of the whole team.

285
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,527
Including you, Liang Mu Ze.

286
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,256
Today,

287
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,680
I can't thank you enough.

288
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,200
Thank me for what?

289
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,680
Thank you for recovering
the replacement lung.

290
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,671
And...

291
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,767
thank you for saving me underwater.

292
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,886
Because of the incident with Zhuo Ran,

293
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:46,480
I was a little emotional
and spoke harshly to you.

294
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,240
Actually...

296
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:54,800
Actually, you're alright.

297
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:59,117
More and more, I feel that
at the brink of life and death,

298
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:00,775
as long as I have you,

299
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,937
I don't need to be afraid.

300
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,897
It's quite reassuring.

301
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:11,680
Who's with you?

302
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,680
It's just Tian Yong and Xiao Teng.

303
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm sending them back to the camp.

304
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,160
And my phone is still
connected to the car's...

305
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,400
Bluetooth speaker.

306
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:26,917
Xia Chu.

307
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:32,960
Xia Chu.

308
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:39,523
Liang Mu Ze, I hate you so much!

309
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,640
What's going on?

310
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,440
Is Dr. Xia...

311
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:56,720
Is she that petty?

312
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,040
Now what, Lieutenant?

313
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,057
What should we do?

314
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:10,840
How would I know?

315
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,560
Captain, wait for me!

316
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,167
Me, too!

317
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,897
Rao Feng filled me in
on last night's situation.

318
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,986
You guys were responsible for execution,

319
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:27,927
not strategy.

320
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,520
So the blame for the failure
doesn't rest with you.

321
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:33,647
Pull yourself together.

322
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:35,026
In the future,

323
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,280
we'll work on many more
missions together.

324
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:38,723
Yes, sir.

325
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,802
How many leave days do you have left?

326
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:41,783
Three days.

327
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:43,415
Do you want to spend them?

328
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,640
I do.

329
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:46,201
Good.

330
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:49,880
Are you spending it with your cousin?

331
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,473
With Xia Chu.

332
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,320
Who?

333
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,311
Xia Chu.

334
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,337
Are you having so much fun here
that you forgot about your family?

335
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:06,280
Do your parents know?

336
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,280
It was my mother who arranged it.

337
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:09,840
I knew it.

338
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:12,411
That's wonderful.

339
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:20,000
Feel free to use my car
until yours is fixed.

340
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,240
You'll need it for your date.

341
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:25,520
We haven't gotten that far, Commander.

342
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,045
Then get on with it.

343
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,428
Listen here,

344
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:31,080
Xia Chu is a good girl.

345
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:34,360
She's presentable and cheerful.

346
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,849
She has the makings of an officer's wife.

347
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,360
Hurry up. Make her your girlfriend.

348
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:41,440
It can wait.

349
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,725
What do you mean it can wait?

350
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,880
You can wait, but the girl can't.

351
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:48,015
After you make her your girlfriend,

352
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,997
you'll have to wait at least six months
before you can propose marriage.

353
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:54,100
Think of all the time
you're wasting.

354
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:55,040
Get to it.

355
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:57,080
But I don't know where I stand with her.

356
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,440
What have you been doing
throughout your long break?

357
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,694
Let me tell you, Liang Mu Ze,

358
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:09,155
with regards to your love life
and marriage,

359
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:12,400
I don't want
any screw-ups from you.

360
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:16,027
If you truly love Xia Chu
and want to share a life with her,

361
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,431
you should let her know
as soon as possible.

362
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,840
You want me to confess to her?

363
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:22,786
She should confess to me.

364
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:23,887
What are you on about?

365
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,082
Commander,

366
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,765
Xia Chu is not like other girls.

367
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,400
Don't compare her to others.

368
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:32,760
She has an attitude.

369
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:39,929
I wonder who it was that bragged
about frequenting women's bedrooms...

370
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,080
and having problems
saying no to their adoration?

371
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,330
Well?

372
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:46,326
Can't handle it

373
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,400
this time?

374
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:49,852
It's not that I can't handle it.

375
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:52,323
I just don't want to rush it.

376
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,422
Commander,

377
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,605
there are many ways to a woman's heart.

378
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:57,720
Countless ways.

379
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,332
But on Xia Chu,

380
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:00,600
I can't use any of them.

381
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,206
Especially at a time like this.

382
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:04,680
What's wrong?

383
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:05,760
What are you hesitating for?

384
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,240
Have they decided who's
going to be transferred?

385
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:27,640
Captain!

386
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,385
Didn't the Brigade Commander
give you a half-day leave?

387
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:35,427
You're up early.

388
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:36,338
It's in my habit.

389
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:37,640
Didn't run enough yesterday?

390
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:40,290
Captain,

391
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,885
I'd like to ask you a question,

392
00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:44,576
but I'm not sure if I should.

393
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:46,240
-You shouldn't.
-Captain.

394
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:50,360
How is your sister?

395
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,000
Xiao Xue?

396
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm so tired.

397
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,640
Er Miao,

398
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,160
I'm so tired, I can't even take a shower.

399
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,240
You chose this path.

400
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,040
You'll have to walk it
even if it's on your knees.

401
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:23,305
I must've been crazy when I decided
to study medicine.

402
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,440
Er Miao,

403
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:32,087
are doctors this miserable
or is it just the resident doctors?

404
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:34,617
All of them, of course.

405
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:47,847
Let me get my phone.

406
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:05,755
(Braised Egg)

407
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,638
Is Xiao Xue there?

408
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,026
Why should I tell you?

409
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,560
We haven't settled last night's score yet.

410
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,440
She's not here.

411
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:52,446
Liang Mu Ze, will you ever quit?

412
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:54,165
I told you she's not home.

413
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:55,405
Why must you call me?

414
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:57,486
Can't you call her directly?

415
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:58,817
I don't want to speak to you,

416
00:25:58,858 --> 00:25:59,880
do you hear me?

417
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:02,813
Xia Chu.

418
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:03,760
It's me.

419
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:06,817
(Zhuo Ran)

420
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:12,507
Sorry.

421
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:14,720
What's up?

422
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:16,307
I'm at the hospital.

423
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:17,400
Can you come over?

424
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:20,004
-Why?
-Just come.

425
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,909
I'll be waiting.

426
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,920
Do you know where she is?

427
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,707
She was going to visit the parrot
at the Special Forces Brigade.

428
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:40,840
Didn't you see her?

429
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:50,074
That's right.

430
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,000
She took a ride around 1:00 PM yesterday.

431
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,720
The license plate number...

432
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:14,407
Bin C49058.

433
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:22,257
She smiled at me
when she got into the car.

434
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:24,560
And then she cried.

435
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,546
She said she didn't want to go home...

436
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:28,240
and asked me to take her
to Yunshan Tunnel.

437
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,577
Then as soon as we reached
the coastal road,

438
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:32,344
she asked me to pull over,

439
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,720
telling me she changed her mind.

440
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,818
So I pulled over...

441
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,600
to let her decide where
she wanted to go.

442
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:40,120
She stared blankly out of the window,

443
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,760
then told me to continue on
to Yunshan Tunnel.

444
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,426
This went on several times.

445
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,526
Finally,

446
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,400
I dropped her at the entrance
of the tunnel.

447
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:48,845
I'm telling you,

448
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:50,498
in all my years as a driver,

449
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,529
I've never come across such
a fussy customer.

450
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:54,480
She was erratic.

451
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,840
Is she mentally ill?

452
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:16,640
Xiao Xue!

453
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,000
Xiao Xue!

454
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,160
Xiao Xue!

455
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:28,817
Xia Chu.

456
00:28:28,858 --> 00:28:29,758
Where are you?

457
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,297
Yunshan Tunnel.

458
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,388
-Is Xiao Xue back yet?
-No.

459
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:35,040
She's in the Emergency Department.
Please come right now.

460
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:47,680
Xiao Xue.

461
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:49,920
Xiao Xue.

462
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,360
Xiao Xue.

463
00:29:02,065 --> 00:29:02,958
Why are you with her?

464
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,239
I bumped into her.

465
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,211
Where?

466
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:06,360
Is this an interrogation?

467
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm asking you, where?

468
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,560
Yunshan Tunnel.

469
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:11,606
Last night?

470
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:12,511
That's right.

471
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,120
I was on my night jog.

472
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:16,600
I thought it dangerous
for a girl to be sleeping there.

473
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:19,846
A case happened
at Yunshan Tunnel yesterday.

474
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:22,686
All the cops were there
and none of them saw you?

475
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,640
A case?

476
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,059
I have no idea.

477
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,280
Maybe I missed it.

478
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:29,720
How lucky for you.

479
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:33,240
Even if they saw me, so what?

480
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,241
I'm sure your country's policemen...

481
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:38,360
will take good care of a friendly
foreigner's rights and well-being.

482
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,280
We only protect friends.

483
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,880
The dress your sister is wearing
belonged to Xia Chu, isn't that right?

484
00:29:57,283 --> 00:29:59,623
I remember the first time
Xia Chu and I kissed,

485
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:01,800
she was wearing this very dress.

486
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,871
After all these years,

487
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:04,880
she still kept it.

488
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:08,800
Otherwise, I wouldn't have recognised
your sister and saved her.

489
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:10,760
I called Xia Chu, and it turned out
I was right.

490
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:13,640
You should thank me.

491
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:15,557
No.

492
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:17,400
You should thank that kiss.

493
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:21,687
Now that I think of it,

494
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:24,080
it kind of left me wanting more.

495
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,160
Liang Mu Ze!

496
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,160
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

497
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,366
Such a temper, Officer Liang.

498
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:35,080
Do all soldiers have such
violent tendencies?

499
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,760
Liang Mu Ze, let go.

500
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,462
Let go right now.
This is a hospital, Liang Mu Ze.

501
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:41,120
Liang Mu Ze.

502
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,120
Listen here,

503
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,320
no funny business.

504
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,960
Xiao Xue's report!

505
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,840
Xia Chu.

506
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,806
You're staying under one roof
with a guy like that.

507
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:04,760
Aren't you scared?

508
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:07,930
How did you know?

509
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,067
Know what?

510
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:13,497
I never told you
I'm staying in Liang Mu Ze's house.

511
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,227
How did you know?

512
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:17,560
Mi Gu.

513
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:18,720
She told me.

514
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:20,360
I'm really worried about you.

515
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,360
I apologise
for Liang Mu Ze's behaviour just now.

516
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:30,741
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,800
Please forgive him.

518
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,147
One more thing.

519
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:36,377
The Liang Mu Ze I know
isn't the Liang Mu Ze you know.

520
00:31:36,722 --> 00:31:37,602
So...

521
00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:39,520
Please don't say things like that again.

522
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:00,936
(Tang Lin)

523
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:06,760
Hallo, Mr. Zhuo, are you in Dong'an?

524
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:08,280
Let's meet up.

525
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,927
Sure.

526
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:12,800
Let's meet up.

527
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,734
Lower your head.

528
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:42,040
Drive.

529
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:00,880
Liang Mu Ze!

530
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,000
Liang Mu Ze!

531
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,280
Liang Mu Ze!

532
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:08,840
Liang Mu Ze, who are you
throwing tantrums at?

533
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,081
I've just finished a 14-hour shift.

534
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,566
I was supposed to rest today.

535
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:12,486
But because of your sister,

536
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,845
I had to rush to the hospital
before I got one minute of shut-eye.

537
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:16,206
If you don't want to thank me, fine.

538
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,400
But how could you give
me the cold shoulder?

539
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:20,720
Liang Mu Ze!

540
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:23,178
Liang Mu Ze, come out!

541
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:25,200
Come out, Liang Mu Ze!

542
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:27,400
Liang Mu Ze!

543
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,287
Liang Mu Ze, open up.

544
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:31,760
Come out, Liang Mu Ze!

545
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:37,760
You really went off the rails today,
you know that?

546
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,360
Why did you hit him?

547
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,046
No matter how contemptible you find him,

548
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,107
no matter how scornful you are,

549
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:44,277
you shouldn't have hit him
at a place like that.

550
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:48,347
You made a brute of yourself
when you're clearly not.

551
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:54,281
Liang Mu Ze, is something wrong
with your brain?

552
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,614
Say something, Liang Mu Ze.

553
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,155
He's jealous.

554
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,160
When did you wake up?

555
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:03,684
When we were at the hospital.

556
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:07,267
Your ex said you were wearing this dress
when you first kissed him.

557
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:11,156
Your ex even said
the kiss left him wanting more.

558
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:13,920
Sure enough, my brother took offense
and gave him a punch.

559
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:15,880
But you, of all people, saw it.

560
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:17,516
You even pushed my brother aside...

561
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,657
and stood in between him and your ex.

562
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,756
That made my brother angrier.

563
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:24,317
He walked past me
as if his feet were on fire.

564
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:25,800
I thought he would knock me over.

565
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:29,682
Given the
complicated and dangerous circumstance,

566
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:31,120
I decided to feign unconsciousness.

567
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,596
Until just now,

568
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,156
when I heard you reproach my brother,

569
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,077
I thought if didn't wake up
and tell his side of the story,

570
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:39,338
this argument would never end.

571
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,000
Prideful guys like my brother...

572
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,220
don't feel like they have
to explain anything.

573
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:45,903
Right, Mu Ze?

574
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,741
Is what...

575
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:01,867

00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:18,017
I was stunned.

668
00:43:19,782 --> 00:43:23,006
My pictures
don't show a tenth of the passion.

669
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:24,080
They don't do it justice.

670
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,557
Yes.

671
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,236
At that moment, it felt as though

672
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,925
the house might've been set on fire.

673
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,166
The house was on fire?

674
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,119
No, it wasn't on fire.

675
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,007
Not literally.

676
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,520
It was only a figure of speech.

677
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,085
And now?
Are they gone?

678
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:41,546
Now? I don't know.

679
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:42,567
Where are they?

680
00:43:43,895 --> 00:43:47,160
Well, they went out right after the kiss.

681
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:48,960
Who knows where they were off to?

682
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:50,920
Could they have gone to register
as a couple?

683
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,160
What?

684
00:43:54,276 --> 00:43:55,396
Anyway Aunt,

685
00:43:55,437 --> 00:43:57,357
your wish has finally come true.

686
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:59,280
Congratulations, your grandson
is on the way.

687
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,617
Just you wait. It's going to be awesome.

688
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:08,417
Are you sure, Lieutenant?

689
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,017
No backing out.

690
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:11,038
Just make the move.

691
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,640
Check mate!

692
00:44:13,274 --> 00:44:14,200
Take it back.

693
00:44:16,176 --> 00:44:17,506
Are you trying to weasel your way out?

694
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:18,527
What's that for?

695
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:20,269
I'm not.

696
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,326
My hand slipped.

697
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,291
Honestly.

698
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:23,212
No backsies.

699
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:27,000
-Xiao Teng.
-"Xiao Xue"?

700
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,627
Xiao Teng.

701
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:32,207
Tian Yong!

702
00:44:33,056 --> 00:44:34,646
Yes, it's me.

703
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,040
Attention!

704
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,560
Give me the phone.

705
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,400
Give me the phone!

706
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:52,320
Xiao Xue, are you alright?

707
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm fine.

708
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:56,667
I'm just calling to let you know
I'm safely back home.

709
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:02,680
That's one day later than I expected.

710
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:06,120
Were you waiting for me to call you?

711
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:07,619
That's right.

712
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,348
What if I didn't call?

713
00:45:09,802 --> 00:45:10,800
I'd keep waiting.

714
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:13,515
You idiot.

715
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:15,299
Can't you call me?

716
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,480
I can?

717
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:17,760
Of course you can.

718
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:37,814
Xiao Xue.

719
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:39,177
What's this about?

720
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:40,720
I'm taking the initiative.

721
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:46,575
Are you some kind of dolt?

722
00:45:51,013 --> 00:45:51,960
I'm glad you're okay.

723
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:54,440
Yes, I'm quite okay.

724
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:56,046
Well, then...

725
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,257
Don't hang up just yet.

726
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,160
Why don't you...

727
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,253
recite a poem to me?

728
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,526
Okay.
Which one would you like to hear?

729
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,720
Whatever you like.

730
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:07,920
It's not like I'd get it anyway.

731
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:09,760
A promise for life.

732
00:46:10,715 --> 00:46:12,040
A meeting under the bridge.

733
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:15,240
The tide came before the lady.

734
00:46:16,246 --> 00:46:17,346
Hugging the pillar, the man died.

735
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:20,199
This is an excerpt from
Zhuangzi's "The Bandit".

736
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:22,041
It means...

737
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:23,182
I like you.

738
00:46:26,636 --> 00:46:27,866
Tian Yong!

739
00:46:27,907 --> 00:46:30,320
I like you! Do you hear me?

740
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:40,562
I hear you.

741
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,360
This is so embarrassing.

742
00:46:57,136 --> 00:46:58,356
Lieutenant.

743
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:01,600
We like you, too!
