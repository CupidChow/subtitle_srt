=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:35,719
He's the drug dealer's son.

4
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:38,560
I saw him when I was compiling
the materials.

5
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,703
He resembles you.

6
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:43,263
You told me you had no siblings.

7
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:45,078
But as you know,

8
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:48,833
we journalists have wide open minds.

9
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:50,743
For the whole afternoon, I asked myself,

10
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:52,759
who was the man?

11
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,383
How is he related to you?

12
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:58,194
Perhaps he was the reason
you left without a word.

13
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:01,743
Or perhaps...

14
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,983
it was merely a coincidence.

15
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:06,263
So it is you.

16
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:09,343
Zhuo Ran.

17
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:43,743
Uncle Rao.

18
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:44,833
You're awake.

19
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:52,903
Where's Xiao Xue?

20
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:55,073
She went to grab some breakfast.

21
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:00,143
Is Li Lei alright?

22
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,249
He's fine.

23
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,383
You may see him once you recover.

24
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,743
And the suspect?

25
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:10,423
Dead.

26
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:18,073
Take it easy. You need rest.

27
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,343
Just lie down.

28
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:27,143
Dr. Xia.

29
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,423
When can I get discharged?

30
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,959
You've suffered a serious concussion.

31
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,439
You need time to recuperate.

32
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,039
When you're ready to be discharged,
we'll let you know.

33
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:38,223
Be patient.

34
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,230
I have to go now.
I'll see you again.

35
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,383
Xiao Xue.

36
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,663
Rao's team has suffered
no serious injuries.

37
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,623
But you should remind him
to get more rest.

38
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:29,373
Got it.

39
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,943
One more thing.

40
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:37,342
What is it?

41
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:45,503
Ke Wei's family
would like to visit the injured policemen.

42
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:48,263
That's not necessary.

43
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,473
I know it's a lot to ask
at a time like this.

44
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:57,103
But I have a feeling the explosion...

45
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,583
wasn't simply the act of a youngster.

46
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,463
Perhaps,

47
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,823
there's a deeper reason behind it.

48
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:06,303
What reason?

49
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:12,159
Ke Wei's screensaver
is a picture of a suicide victim...

50
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:14,263
with the words, "The City of Desire."

51
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,673
The City of Desire?

52
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,143
Are you sure?

53
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:20,143
I've seen that picture.

54
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:23,543
Does "The City of Desire"
bear any significance?

55
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:27,823
Do you remember the assassin...

56
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,313
who went after us last time?

57
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:36,503
His smartphone
had a picture of a dead body, too.

58
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,793
And the words, "The City of Desire."

59
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:45,583
The City of Desire is a dark
and unfathomable world.

60
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:47,592
How did you know?

61
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:51,583
Does your wound
have something to do with him?

62
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:52,993
Maybe.

63
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,503
Is it done?

64
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,983
Does it happen very often?

65
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,553
Not too often. About as often
as violence against doctors.

66
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,463
Given our predicaments,

67
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:12,623
it'd be difficult
for us to be together.

68
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,623
We'll only know if we try.

69
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:25,639
Have you said that
to your language instructor?

70
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:26,603
No.

71
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:28,183
What about the nurses at Isaia?

72
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,743
I'm going to see Rao Zhi.

73
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,743
It's not just the two of them, is it?

74
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,703
I only say that to you, Da Miao.

75
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,023
Dr. Xia...

76
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:10,959
Dad?

77
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,343
What brings you here?

78
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:16,903
Hi, Mr. Xia.

79
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:18,863
What's the matter?

80
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:22,623
Can't I visit you?

81
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,183
No.

82
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:30,183
I'd like to speak with my daughter.

83
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,183
Go right ahead.
I was just about to leave.

84
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,383
Are you going to just stand there?

85
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:56,023
I'm worried you might not
want to see me.

86
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,313
Come here.

87
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,023
What did you get?

88
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,633
Sweet soy milk,
vegetarian noodles,

89
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,263
chicken potstickers,
and cold shredded potato.

90
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,143
That's a lot of food.

91
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,703
They're all your favourites.

92
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,543
You remembered.

93
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:36,583
I didn't.

94
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:37,943
I asked my mum.

95
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,423
She knows I'm injured?

96
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,463
Good.

97
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:50,863
What do you mean "good?"
It's not good at all.

98
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:54,823
I told my mum...

99
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:59,393
I was getting all these goodies
to fatten you up like a pig.

100
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:00,983
So you can't be a cop anymore.

101
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:04,113
That's so mean.

102
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:05,743
But,

103
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,023
after I told that lie,

104
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:11,463
I realized something.

105
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,703
What did you realize?

106
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,823
I realized,

107
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,983
why you wouldn't let me be with you.

108
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,273
Why you always tried to get rid of me...

109
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:25,103
and told people I wasn't your daughter.

110
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,463
But it seems...

111
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,103
you don't hate me all that much.

112
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:35,223
So are you going to listen
to me this time?

113
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,063
Never.

114
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,503
Xiao Xue.

115
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:39,773
By the way,

116
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,103
I finished the portrait
and gave it to your colleague.

117
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:45,879
That night, I walked along
the highway by the coast.

118
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:49,463
When I entered the tunnel,
I saw a man driving past.

119
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,103
Did he see you?

120
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:58,609
No.

121
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,063
The tunnel was pitch black.

122
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:02,919
What happened next?

123
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,583
Then I fell asleep.

124
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,104
When I woke up,
I was already in the ER.

125
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:09,559
A man named Zhuo Ran
brought me there.

126
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,233
He's Xia Chu's first boyfriend.
You know that, don't you?

127
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:17,023
As for what happened
between the tunnel and the ER,

128
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:18,903
I don't have the slightest impression.

129
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:20,593
Around what time was it?

130
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,983
I mean when you saw the man in the tunnel.

131
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:26,433
Nine.

132
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:28,983
I was listening to a music station.

133
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,273
There was a time announcement.

134
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,863
Nine o'clock.

135
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,223
A man.

136
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,863
Zhuo Ran.

137
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:48,263
The suspect has a history
of substance abuse in the public.

138
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:50,543
During his rehabilitation,

139
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:54,663
he would often
log in to the City of Desire,

140
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:56,743
exposing himself to the temptation
of drugs.

141
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:00,449
He received
a list of instructions for a game.

142
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,089
The instructions
are linked to the explosion.

143
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:07,609
The man who gave the instructions is none
other than the elusive Scary Pirate.

144
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:09,999
The only person
who may have had dealings,

145
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,649
with the Scary Pirate
is the drug dealer...

146
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:16,039
who transacted with him
in Yunshan Tunnel.

147
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:18,183
According to the sketch
provided by witnesses,

148
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:23,583
we've ascertained
the suspect's identity.

149
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:51,729
Well?

150
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,159
I am of some use to you, aren't I?

151
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:56,663
To me,

152
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,903
you're more than just a useful companion.

153
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,383
Xiao Xue,

154
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,463
go back to the US.

155
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:08,223
I don't want to.

156
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,583
I want to stay by your side,

157
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:14,943
at least until you've fully recovered.

158
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:47,863
What are you writing?

159
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,023
How's your dad?

160
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:54,983
He's fine.

161
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,223
Good.

162
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,383
Are you writing a love letter for me?

163
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:08,763
No.

164
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:14,623
Liang Mu Ze.

165
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:18,743
Where did you get this?

166
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,153
I met a woman,

167
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:25,023
an ex-accountant
who is now a transplant coordinator.

168
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,983
She was talking about
the importance of organ donation.

169
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:29,743
So I got a copy from her.

170
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,473
Are you going to donate your organs?

171
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:37,743
Ever since my near-fatal experience
with the gunshot wound,

172
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:39,863
I've been thinking about it.

173
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:43,153
You were shot before?

174
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:47,283
Here.

175
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:51,973
Xiao Xue.

176
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:53,423
Xiao Xue.

177
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:54,983
Xiao Xue.

178
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,113
Xiao Xue, don't...

179
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:09,263
Let me hear what your heart has to say.

180
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,263
People are looking.

181
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,063
This is embarrassing.

182
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:35,679
I get it now.

183
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,583
Your heart told me everything.

184
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:42,439
It knows you're accustomed to being alone
and watching "Aberdeen"

185
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,383
and it's all for it.

186
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,479
Send me to the subway station.

187
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:48,863
The Captain isn't around.

188
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:50,743
I can't leave my post.

189
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,153
Sorry.

190
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:53,543
You may go.

191
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:56,233
Captain.

192
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:57,519
Don't go home.

193
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:00,463
Come to the guest house
and have a good night's sleep.

194
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:02,663
Send her to the subway.

195
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:04,343
Okay.

196
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,879
Go on.

197
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:06,943
Thanks, Captain.

198
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,953
You came here just for this?

199
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,423
Do you think it's a small matter?

200
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,639
It's no big deal, really.

201
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,873
See? I'm still alive and well.

202
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,303
Rest assured.

203
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:46,983
I can't.

204
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,223
The explosion incident aside,

205
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:51,943
you should count your lucky stars
that you're still alive.

206
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,889
When I heard you were fooling around
with that military guy,

207
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:57,103
a hundred fears came to my mind.

208
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:59,849
Dad, how can you say that?

209
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,543
What do you mean "fooling around?"

210
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,079
Liang Mu Ze is an upright soldier.

211
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,199
During my stay at his house,
he treated me with the utmost respect.

212
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,513
And we're getting along happily.

213
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,033
Honey,

214
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,503
that's just a man's trick.

215
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:18,079
If he doesn't throw you a bone,

216
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:20,303
how can he trick you
into becoming his girlfriend?

217
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:22,439
We've been over this.

218
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,049
I only pretended to be his girlfriend
to appease his mother.

219
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,013
Wait...

220
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:29,039
That's even more absurd.

221
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,759
Why is he using my daughter
to appease his mother?

222
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:33,519
You call that respect?

223
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:34,823
Happily, you say?

224
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,929
I think, just like me,

225
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:38,623
you've let all the studying
mess you up.

226
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,543
I can't speak for you,
but I'm sure I'm not messed up.

227
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:48,023
I know better than anyone
what kind of person Liang Mu Ze is.

228
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:51,399
I admit I've mishandled
the whole girlfriend charade.

229
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:56,023
But now, I'm seriously considering
becoming his girlfriend for real.

230
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,289
Do you dare?

231
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,369
We're both single adults.
What's there to be afraid of?

232
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,583
You...

233
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,143
Change careers.

234
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:06,943
What?

235
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:09,383
I want you to change careers
and come back to Dong'an with me.

236
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:11,678
Is this a joke?

237
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:12,993
I'm not joking.

238
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:15,769
You encouraged me to study medicine.

239
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,159
You encouraged me to come
to Ningjiang.

240
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,409
You encouraged me
to see the world.

241
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:20,519
Now look what happened.

242
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:23,959
The daughter I worked so hard to raise
is going to become a wife of a soldier

243
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,679
and a slave to his lifestyle.

244
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:26,839
I won't.

245
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:29,319
If you choose Liang Mu Ze,
that will be your future.

246
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,103
You'll be wasting your life!

247
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:34,823
Then why can't I be selfish
and keep you by my side?

248
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,953
At least I can give you a peaceful life,

249
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:41,423
and you won't have to live in fear
with him.

250
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,023
I have work to do.

251
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,413
Dad,

252
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:52,273
let's talk later.

253
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,599
I'm off.

254
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:13,833
Goodbye.

255
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:16,983
Can't you send me to the camp?

256
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,233
The Captain only let me send you
to the subway station.

257
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:21,583
It's not like he'll know.

258
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,463
But I do.

259
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,943
Can't you pretend you don't know?

260
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:30,543
I can't.

261
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:33,463
Bullheaded fool.

262
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,439
What did you say?

263
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:37,393
I said you're bullheaded.

264
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:15,063
What are you doing here?

265
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,571
The Captain said I could send you
to the subway station.

266
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:22,423
But he didn't say whether
it's the starting station...

267
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,863
or the destination station.

268
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,623
What are you, my chauffeur?

Yes.

What seems to be the problem?

307
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:18,113
I have a heart ache.

308
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,513
What are you doing here?

309
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,263
What do you mean?

310
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:30,993
I got a number.

311
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:35,343
I can't see my daughter
and I can't see a doctor?

312
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,879
After such a dire experience,

313
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:54,663
if he really loves you,
he should try to get recalled.

314
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:58,023
Instead of making you
endure danger here.

315
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:01,929
I'm not staying here
because of him but for my job.

316
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,919
Think, what has he ever done
for you while you were together?

317
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:06,903
What about you?

318
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:08,599
You've been married to mum
for so many years.

319
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,273
What have you done for her?

320
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:13,303
If women were rational,
all men would be single forever.

321
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,503
I treat your mum just fine.

322
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,143
This is the EICU. No entry.

323
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:23,679

324

325

Honey.

326
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:58,033
I'll send you the photo
once I've cleaned it up.

327
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:01,903
No need to.

328
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,543
All I did was kiss you.
Don't be mad.

329
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:10,423
I'm not mad.

330
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,313
Then I'll kiss you again and see.

331
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,223
Xiao Xue.

332
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,063
Knock it off.

333
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:21,353
I'm just pulling your leg. Come on.

334
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:25,583
Do you remember the way home?

335
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:27,583
Sure.

336
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:30,423
Get off at the third bus stop,
take a rickshaw,

337
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:33,863
walk for around ten minutes,
and I should be there by sundown.

338
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:39,183
Why don't I give you a ride?

339
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,783
Lieutenant, you're the best!

340
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:48,023
Let's go.

341
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:52,409
You walk in front.

342
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:53,783
I'll follow behind you.

343
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:55,943
Okay.

344
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,953
♪All I need♪

345
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:07,043
♪Is a plain old hug♪

346
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:11,053
♪But I am too shy♪

347
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:16,163
♪I hide behind formalities♪

348
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:20,553
♪Politely greeting you in my soft voice♪

349
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:24,963
♪I wave goodbye, trying to run away♪

350
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:32,163
♪I can't avoid it, it wraps around me
like the wind♪

351
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,679
I have a gift for you.

352
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:38,663
A gift? What kind of gift?

353
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,759
But I'm afraid you might scoff at it.

354
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,879
Fret not, I'll definitely scoff at it.

355
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:44,263
So just let me see it.

356
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:48,623
What's this?

357
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,623
Last time, you said the heart protector
was too ugly.

358
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:54,599
I got some Dyneema
from an old army friend,

359
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:58,623
who works at a defence manufacturer
and made a bulletproof vest for you.

360
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:01,623
Is the look acceptable for you?

361
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:05,663
No.

362
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,073
Xiao Xue.

363
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,799
This is made from the most advanced
bulletproof material in the world.

364
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,369
It's incredibly light and soft.

365
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:18,823
Of course, on such short notice,
the workmanship may be a little sloppy.

366
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,663
But I hope you'll accept it.

367
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:24,593
Stop laughing.

368
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,823
You must wear it when you go out.

369
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,863
Promise me
you'll wear it when you go out, okay?

370
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:36,303
That way,
Officer Rao can have peace of mind.

371
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,383
Is that the only reason?

372
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:14,663
Don't move!

373
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:20,759
What's that sound?

374
00:27:20,843 --> 00:27:21,879
Stay here.

375
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:23,063
Tian Yong!

376
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:02,413
Don't move!

377
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,303
Stand right there!

378
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:25,916
Tian Yong!

379
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:30,263
What happened to you?

380
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,743
Wake up, Tian Yong.

381
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:35,703
Wake up, wake up.

382
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:39,783
I'm okay.

383
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,553
You gave me such a fright.

384
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:03,103
I wasn't lying.

385
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:07,113
It is handy.

386
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,543
But it's so ugly.

387
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,319
It's alright.

388
00:29:12,403 --> 00:29:13,743
Just relax.

389
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:15,383
Relax, take a deep breath.

390
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,143
Come on, breathe in.

391
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,583
Relax. Everything's alright.

392
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,439
What's the situation?

393
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:49,639
The pregnant lady is having a severe
hemorrhage due to trauma.

394
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:51,519
She had five years of substance abuse,
one ectopic pregnancy,

395
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:52,359
two successful labours.

396
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,223
This is her third pregnancy,
but we've lost the baby's heartbeat.

397
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:56,919
Ask the anaesthesiologist
and the Neonatology Department,

398
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,119
to prepare for surgery.

399
00:29:58,203 --> 00:29:59,763
-Leave it to me.
-Okay.

400
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,303
Dr. Xia.

401
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:07,423
Coming through! Please move aside.

402
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:10,519
Can you hear me?

403
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,623
If you can, grab my hand.

404
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:14,279
Set up the blood transfusion.

405
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,599
Ask Orthopaedics, General Surgery,
and ICU for a treatment plan.

406
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:17,769
And call Dr. Song.

407
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:18,733
Okay.

408
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,119
Ye Feng's family?

409
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,423
That's us.

410
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:30,863
Foot the bill.

411
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:42,223
Doctor, how's his condition?

412
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:44,943
Don't worry,
we'll do our best to save him.

413
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:25,823
Captain.

414
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,303
Are you okay?

415
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:34,943
I'm okay.

416
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,329
Xiao Xue is back at the camp.

417
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:39,543
I know. She phoned me.

418
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:41,473
What about Boss?

419
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:42,863
He's inside.

420
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:45,673
What are they discussing?

421
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:48,103
I don't know.

422
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,833
Liang Mu Ze comes
from a long line of soldiers.

423
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,743
He certainly has the discipline
of a military man.

424
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:57,623
Not only was he trained
in the Hunter Military School in Isaia,

425
00:31:57,843 --> 00:32:03,023
he was one of the top scorers
among the fourteen who graduated.

426
00:32:03,763 --> 00:32:05,913
As Commandos Team Thunder's captain,

427
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,433
he has extensive experience
on the battlefield.

428
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,383
To be honest,

429
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:19,463
I'd like to have someone
who's as capable as him,

430
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,193
but less conspicuous.

431
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,999
This officer named Tian Yong,

432
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:38,153
why are his place of birth
and family details unspecified?

433
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:40,943
He's an orphan.

434
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:42,433
He'll be discharged this year.

435
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:44,023
The paperwork is underway.

436
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:47,863
What happened to the pregnant woman?

437
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,063
She's in the ER.

438
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,759
She's well into her term.

439
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,863
Tian Yong.

440
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:01,303
I...

441
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,263
I feel I could've stopped her...

442
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:07,313
She was bleeding badly.

443
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:08,863
What if...

444
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,663
she gives birth prematurely?

445
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:12,823
She's a drug dealer.

446
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,583
She shot at you.

447
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:16,569
You did nothing wrong.

448
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:19,953
If it weren't for you, it'd be Xiao Xue
who's in the operating room right now.

449
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:23,623
I understand.

450
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,703
I'm just worried about her baby.

451
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,063
Whether it'll...

452
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,943
see its mother when it comes out.

453
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,263
I can't take it.

454
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:55,343
Lieutenant Tian.

455
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:57,039
-Here.
-Please come in.

456
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:58,183
Yes.

457
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:07,713
(General Conference Room)

458
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:13,583
Chief.

459
00:34:13,963 --> 00:34:15,639
That was a good show today.

460
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:19,039
Sir, I was merely helping
a fellow law enforcer on the arrest.

461
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,103
Do you know who you arrested?

462
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:24,519
His name is Li Zhi Peng.

463
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:27,649
In name, he's the owner of a youth hostel.

464
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,592
But behind the curtain,
he's a drug dealer.

465
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,719
Do you still remember
the mission at the bar?

466
00:34:34,803 --> 00:34:35,683
I do.

467
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,409
Both parties did not show up for the deal
and the mission was called off.

468
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:39,569
Wrong.

469
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:43,033
They completed their transaction
in Yunshan Tunnel instead.

470
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,463
One of the parties was Li Zhi Peng.

471
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,703
The other party, whom he had
contacted online,

472
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,143
goes by the online ID...

473
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:50,902
of Scary Pirate.

474
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:54,473
Ever heard of the City of Desire?

475
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,663
It's the biggest
online drug trading platform.

476
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,943
Director, Tian Yong seldom uses
the internet, let alone the dark web.

477
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,583
So are you familiar with the Old Master?

478
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:16,303
Who is that?

479
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:20,993
Remember the villagers
you captured at the border,

480
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,753
with the Border Armed Police?

481
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:25,279
According to them,

482
00:35:25,363 --> 00:35:29,423
they were coerced into drug trafficking
by someone called Old Master.

483
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:31,559
I don't know him.

484
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:32,823
Nobody knows who he is.

485
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,399
The man is highly elusive.

486
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,223
His power spreads across Southeast Asia.

487
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:41,639
He's now the true leader of the
international mercenary group, T4.

488
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,603
Explosives.

489
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:43,643
Drugs.

490
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,799
Human and organ trafficking.

491
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:48,223
If there's money in it, they'd do it.

492
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:51,543
They've become a cancer
upon the border.

493
00:35:51,843 --> 00:35:54,399
Three months ago,
we arrested a drug dealer.

494
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:55,993
His name was Liu Zheng Min.

495
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:08,343
And it's all...

496
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,199
related to the Scary Pirate?

497
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:12,163
That's right.

498
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:17,503
We've been having trouble figuring out
the Scary Pirate's real identity.

499
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,103
But recently,

500
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:23,543
one of the Old Master's henchmen
approached the police,

501
00:36:23,763 --> 00:36:25,503
and offered to become an informant.

502
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:28,343
Is Old Master the Scary Pirate?

503
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:31,543
We're still verifying it.

504
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:35,159
We're going to use Li Zhi Peng,
whom we've captured today,

505
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:38,049
to contact the Scary Pirate
through the City of Desire,

506
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:42,663
and tell him we have a huge amount
of cash that we need moving.

507
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:44,209
Then?

508
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:48,503
Then once the target takes the bait,
you'll be their point of contact.

509
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:53,679
Me?

510
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:54,663
Yes.

511
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:57,159
They need someone,

512
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,289
with the single combat skills
and field experience

513
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:04,183
of a special forces soldier
yet do not belong to the police force.

514
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,903
And my mission is?

515
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,463
Your mission is to find evidence...

516
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:14,823
that can prove the Scary Pirate's
real identity.

517
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:17,563
At the same time,

518
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,863
find out the Old Master's whereabouts.

519
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:22,863
Tian Yong,

520
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:24,439
any questions?

521
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:25,673
Feel free to ask.

522
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,163
Chief,

523
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,943
are they the culprits
behind today's incident?

524
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:40,823
In a certain way,

525
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:42,083
yes.

526
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:44,183
I have no other questions.

527
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:45,623
You must not fail!

528
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:57,663
Captain,

529
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,639
has Rao Feng come to?

530
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:01,943
-He has.
-Take me to him.

531
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,103
What about Tian Yong?

532
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,759
Tian Yong stays here.

533
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:08,033
He has a new mission.

534
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:10,383
Alright.

535
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:22,903
Why did they release me?

536
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:26,999
They don't have
solid evidence of your crime.

537
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,823
Besides, you're a foreign citizen.

538
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,503
Did you think they were
going to keep you for the New Year?

539
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,503
Even though I'm free,
it doesn't mean I'm safe.

540
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:38,623
I'm guessing
they'll be watching me 24-7.

541
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:53,823
We've received the order
to form...

542
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:57,223
a joint task force
with your police department.

543
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:58,823
The idea,

544
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:00,783
is to cast a wide net,

545
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:04,879
so we can catch him and the mastermind
in one go.

546
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:08,343
I'll ask my informants
to give their full support.

547
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:09,703
Good.

548
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:13,183
Relax.

549
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,103
We've been under their surveillance
for a couple of days now,

550
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,703
and we're perfectly fine.

551
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,783
Any news from Old Master?

552
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:27,823
Do you know what happened while you
were in the Public Security Bureau?

553
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,463
Somebody blew up
Liang Mu Ze's neighbourhood.

554
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:38,423
The Old Master ordered it,

555
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,983
despite knowing you were there.

556
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:44,103
What are you getting at?

557
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:49,703
Of course, he did it to get back
at the police for taking his goods.

558
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,503
He doesn't need to care
about the consequences,

559
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,103
of ruffling the police's feathers.

560
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:56,823
After all,

561
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:58,063
he's abroad.

562
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:02,353
And to him,

563
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:05,463
your life isn't worth a penny.

564
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:12,913
Guess what the police
are going to do next?

565
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:27,503
I'm not going to guess.

566
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:30,743
And you can stop
trying to turn me against Old Master.

567
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:32,583
Do you think I'm stupid?

568
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:36,583
When I joined Old Master,
you were just a little baby.

569
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:38,463
Let me tell you,

570
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:42,303
if Old Master finds out
what you're doing behind his back,

571
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,583
you'll be a dead meat.

572
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:55,573
(Rescue Room)

573
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:39,903
Why don't I book a flight
back to Dong'an for you?

574
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:45,423
No.

575
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,633
Are you okay with
leaving Miss Lan alone at home?

576
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:50,343
Your grandma and grandpa are there.

577
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:51,599
They'll keep her company.

578
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:52,983
Listen here,

579
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:56,863
you can't come to Ningjiang and ruin
my day just to avoid Grandpa, can you?

580
00:41:57,123 --> 00:41:58,439
Why would I avoid him?

581
00:41:58,523 --> 00:41:59,753
It's my house.

582
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:02,663
Sure, it's your house.

583
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:04,183
What about your department?

584
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:05,703
And your project?

585
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:08,839
You're always here with me.
Don't you have work?

586
00:42:08,923 --> 00:42:10,433
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

587
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,479
Look, this is about you.

588
00:42:14,563 --> 00:42:15,983
Don't talk about me.

589
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:18,383
Let me tell you,
ever since you were little,

590
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:21,319
I've fulfilled every promise
I've made to you, haven't I?

591
00:42:21,403 --> 00:42:25,439
So today, you must promise to quit
right now and move back to Dong'an.

592
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:27,903
I will not allow you
to see Liang Mu Ze.

593
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:30,855
Hey, what's gotten into you?

594
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:32,663
Are you having difficulties?

595
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,159
Why are you so stubborn?

596
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:37,543
Because we're old
and we can't have anything happen to you!

597
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:49,023
I'll go back to the hotel.

598
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,303
We'll talk when you're off work.

599
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:57,663
Dad...

600
00:43:17,213 --> 00:43:18,223
Dr. Zhang.

601
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:20,263
Xia Chu.

602
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:23,759
What happened to the pregnant woman
who lost her baby's pulse yesterday?

603
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:25,543
The caesarean caused too much bleeding.

604
00:43:25,963 --> 00:43:28,503
The mother passed away,
leaving behind a pair of twins.

605
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:30,823
Twins?

606
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:32,983
Yes. And they're adorable.

607
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,199
But they're showing signs
of neonatal withdrawal syndrome.

608
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,079
We're keeping them in an incubator
and giving them intensive care,

609
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,223
and withdrawal treatment.

610
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:43,193
You may visit them when you're free.

611
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:45,323
Alright.

612
00:43:56,493 --> 00:43:57,903
I know.

613
00:44:07,173 --> 00:44:08,319
Don't worry.

614
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:10,543
I've taken the immunoglobulin shot.

615
00:44:14,843 --> 00:44:17,823
Once the results are out,
I'll let you know.

616
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:20,903
I have work to do.

617
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:22,623
I'll talk to you later.

618
00:44:22,803 --> 00:44:23,903
Bye.

619
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:48,503
Xia Chu?

620
00:44:48,803 --> 00:44:50,063
What happened?

621
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,443
The other day,

622
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,153
we were operating on Ke Wei.

623
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:58,783
Turned out that he had Hepatitis B.

624
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:02,863
He was writhing about during the surgery,
so we went up and held him down.

625
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:06,783
His blood was everywhere
and we were close to his body.

626
00:45:08,203 --> 00:45:09,623
Have you get tested?

627
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:11,943
I had my blood taken.

628
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:14,078
But the doctor
at the Pathology Department said,

629
00:45:14,163 --> 00:45:16,799
even if it turns out negative,
we can't be 100 percent sure.

630
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,383
I have to get tested a few more times.

631
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:21,783
I was on the phone with my parents.

632
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:25,073
I couldn't hold it anymore
and told them everything.

633
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:28,023
But after I did, I really wish I hadn't.

634
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:31,079
Ever since I went to university,

635
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,743
I haven't done a thing for my family.

636
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:38,833
If I'm infected,
what will become of them?

637
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:47,903
Actually, it could be worse.

638
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:49,759
After all, during the surgery,

639
00:45:49,843 --> 00:45:51,679
I didn't contact the wound directly.

640
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:53,793
It's mainly psychological damage.

641
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:55,743
But poor Dr. Zhang,

642
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:57,583
he was the one who conducted
the surgery.

643
00:45:57,723 --> 00:46:00,953
And I think he pricked his fingers
with the haemostatic forceps.

644
00:46:02,523 --> 00:46:03,543
What happened to him?

645
00:46:05,043 --> 00:46:06,383
Nothing serious.

646
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,583
But he's always in the operating room
or by the patient's bed.

647
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:10,703
He's been seeing more patients
than usual.

648
00:46:11,123 --> 00:46:13,743
We're really worried
that he might break down.
