1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:37,678
Meng Zhen.

4
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,389
Dr. Xia.

5
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:40,961
I just finished my rounds.

6
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,285
How is the result?

7
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:44,703
This is the echocardiography report.

8
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:48,034
The doctor said
it's atrial septal defect...

9
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:50,292
and made us handle the hospitalisation
procedure.

10
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:53,080
Where's Liang Mu Ze?

11
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:56,352
Mu Ze didn't come
as he has work to do today.

12
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:58,483
It's the same with the doctor here.

13
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:00,292
Why are they the same?

14
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,211
It's not what I meant.

15
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,399
Dr Xia, is something wrong?

16
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,098
One second.

17
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:08,394
Okay.

18
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:14,629
Okay, I'll be right there.

19
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,077
Dr Xia, is something wrong
with Xiao Jun's condition?

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,478
How about this?

21
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,048
Let me keep this report.

22
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,606
You go and register for admission first.

23
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,841
I'll see you at the ward
when I finish my work.

24
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,701
-Okay.
-I don't want to get admitted.

25
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,510
Xiao Jun.

26
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,330
Xiao Jun, be a good boy.

27
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,047
You can return home after getting well.

28
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm not sick.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,577
Xiao Jun!

30
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,183
What are you doing?

31
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:44,104
It's all because of you
that Liang Mu Ze doesn't want us!

32
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:46,323
Luo Xiao Jun, watch your words!

33
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,730
You've become very rude!

34
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:50,774
Dr Xia, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,622
Something is wrong with him today.

36
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:54,629
-Please don't mind him.
-It's all right.

37
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,447
Hurry up and register for the admission.

38
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,537
Okay.

39
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,412
Let's go. What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,204
Enough.

41
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,480
Xiao Jun, let me tell you.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,118
You can't be rude to adults, understand?

43
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:13,684
I don't want to be hospitalised.

44
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,846
Ask Liang Mu Ze to come to pick us up.

45
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:17,644
I want to see Liang Mu Ze.

46
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,782
You must behave.

47
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:20,804
Wait for me.

48
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,852
Hello, we're here
to register for admission.

49
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,733
Mr Zhang, let me assist in your surgery.

50
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,258
I'm well-prepared.

51
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:31,062
Have you sent the patients'
medical reports?

52
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,189
I've finished sending them.

53
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,443
Dr Zhang...

54
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,105
Tian Yong's wound has recovered well.

55
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,737
I've changed the dressing for him.

56
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,457
Tell him to return and recuperate.

57
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:42,830
Regular inspection will do.

58
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:44,450
Dr Zhang,

59
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,630
are you close with Dr Li Juan
from the cardiology department?

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,475
Just say it. What's the matter?

61
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,635
She just admitted a patient,
named Luo Xiao Jun.

62
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:56,404
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

63
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,965
I suspect it's not a simple
atrial septal defect.

64
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:01,401
Some adjustments might need to be made...

65
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,069
on the previous
interventional surgical plan.

66
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,589
This is his echocardiography report.

67
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:08,079
Did the cardiology department
request a cardio surgery consultation?

68
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,270
No.

69
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:12,804
In fact, Dr Li Juan
didn't perform further tests on him.

70
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,510
Then what do you want me to do?

71
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,979
Can you take a look at him?

72
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,648
He is a patient
the cardiology department admitted.

73
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,198
They didn't request our consultation.

74
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,486
We can't step in.

75
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,608
-But...
-This is the hospital policy.

76
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,909
Enough, I've got a surgery.

77
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,725
-No, Dr Zhang.
-Don't follow me.

78
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,973
I had a chance to convince him
to let me join the surgery.

79
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:44,705
Meng Zhen,

80
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,366
hang on, I'll be right there.

81
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:47,877
No, Dr Xia.

82
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,349
Xiao Jun is missing.

83
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:50,462
What?

84
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,246
This is Xiao Jun, right?

85
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,401
He left on his own?

86
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:08,362
It's fortunate that he wasn't abducted.

87
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,999
This brat!

88
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,399
Where will he go?

89
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:16,217
Did he say anything
to you before leaving?

90
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,822
It's the same thing.
He said he didn't want to get admitted.

91
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,468
And that he wanted to see Liang Mu Ze.

92
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:21,752
Liang Mu Ze?

93
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:22,963
Yes.

94
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,719
Did you call him?

95
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,591
I did, but he didn't answer the phone.

96
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,435
I guess he's on a mission
or he might be training.

97
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:31,637
Don't worry.

98
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:32,623
How about this?

99
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:34,022
You search nearby the hospital.

100
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:35,880
I'll contact Liang Mu Ze.

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,639
Xiao Jun might go look for him.

102
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:38,810
Okay.

103
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:41,645
-Lieutenant Tian!
-Yes!

104
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:42,797
Hello, Dr Xia!

105
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,118
Great! You haven't left!

106
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:46,882
Is Liang Mu Ze on a mission?

107
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,261
I don't know.

108
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:50,662
Xiao Jun is missing.

109
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,521
He might go to the unit for him.

110
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,207
Hurry up and return to the unit!

111
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,373
If you see Liang Mu Ze,
you must tell him this news.

112
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,110
If you don't see him, you must be mindful.

113
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,253
If Xiao Jun really went to the unit,
bring him back immediately.

114
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,339
This child suffers from severe
congenital heart disease.

115
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:03,992
He needs to be hospitalised immediately.

116
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,580
His life would be in danger
if things went wrong, got it?

117
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:16,274
This time the operation was not perfect.

118
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:18,012
We almost got trapped by the enemy.

119
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,325
This is fatal for the special forces!

120
00:06:21,753 --> 00:06:22,932
It's a disgrace!

121
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:26,296
There's always one way
to cleanse our shame!

122
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:28,660
Thunderbolt is invincible!

123
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,583
Kill them all!

124
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,177
I heard it from Xiao Wu...

125
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:25,787
that you've taken two bottles
of sleeping pills...

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,552
from the infirmary during this time.

127
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,699
Yes.

128
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:32,577
I lost the previous bottle.

129
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:33,976
Did you lose it...

130
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,237
or you finished it?

131
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,835
I lost it or they hid it from me.

132
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,357
Your insomnia gets worse...

133
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,391
every time you lose a comrade
or when there are...

134
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,749
some flaws in the operation.

135
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,683
And then,
you train yourself like a maniac.

136
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,657
Because I'm angry.

137
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:55,444
Or are you scared?

138
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:56,716
I scare nothing.

139
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,181
It's been eight years, Mu Ze.

140
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,113
Don't force yourself too much.

141
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,042
I'm fine, Brigade Commander!

142
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:09,986
Good.

143
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,053
Salute!

144
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,184
Report to Brigade Commander!

145
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,350
Tian Yong has returned!

146
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:20,943
Get some rest.

147
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:24,071
Thank you, Brigade Commander.
Captain, is Xiao Jun here?

148
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,144
No.

149
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:26,448
Why would Xiao Jun be here?

150
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:27,778
He is missing.

151
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:28,936
Missing?

152
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,548
Luo Xiao Jun?

153
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:35,755
Luo Xiao Jun?

154
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:39,088
Luo Xiao Jun?

155
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:43,908
He is not here!

156
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,682
I've searched
all the places where he could go.

157
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,244
This kid is really...

158
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:49,596
Where did he go?

159
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,260
He's here.

160
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,357
Xiao Jun.

161
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,512
What's wrong? Xiao Jun.

162
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:08,243
Xiao Jun, what's going on?

163
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:09,578
Don't scare me, Xiao Jun!

164
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:10,792
Xiao Jun!

165
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,645
I saw Dad.

166
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,851
Xiao Jun! Xiao Jun!

167
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,124
Xiao Jun!

168
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:21,755
-Xiao Jun! Wake up!
-Let's send him to the hospital.

169
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,677
Come in.

170
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,312
Dr Li,

171
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,156
I'm Xia Chu,
a resident of Cardio Surgery.

172
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:36,017
Can I help you?

173
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,881
You admitted a boy, named Luo Xiao Jun,

174
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,884
with a suspected atrial septal defect
in the morning.

175
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:42,176
Do you remember him?

176
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:43,727
I do.

177
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,426
What's the matter?

178
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,131
I would like
to ask your advice about this case.

179
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,146
I've read his report.

180
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,272
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

181
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:56,496
I was wondering whether it's not...

182
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,103
a simple atrial septal defect.

183
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,140
Are you doubting about my diagnosis?

184
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,264
No.

185
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,610
I just think that...

186
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,607
When I was
in the Isaia Joint Medical team,

187
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:12,575
there was an Italian doctor
who shared a case with me.

188
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,740
So you are the resident who went
to Isaia with Zhang Yi Chi?

189
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,482
Yes, it's me.

190
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:21,897
That case...

191
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:23,047
I know.

192
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,591
Nowadays, it's been tough
for the Cardio Surgery.

193
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,223
The bypass surgery
is being replaced by PCI.

194
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:32,436
And the interventional surgery for
congenital heart disease is evolving.

195
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,204
Cardio Surgery needs patients.

196
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,637
I can understand that.

197
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,852
But you don't have to be this nasty.

198
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,737
If Cardio Surgery needs anything,
just ask Zhang Yi Chi to come to me.

199
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,528
Atrial septal defect.

200
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:59,473
"The patient had visited the
local hospital for many times."

201
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,234
"His pulmonary hypertension
was considered..."

202
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:02,791
"the result of atrial septal defect."

203
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,895
"At last, by combining it with a CT scan,
the clinician diagnosed him..."

204
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,768
Meng Zhen.

205
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,022
We've found Xiao Jun.

206
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,414
We just reached the hospital.

207
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:18,414
And we're going to
the Cardiology Inpatient Ward.

208
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,413
Okay, I'm coming over.

209
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:37,815
Teacher,

210
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,417
there had been a case.

211
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,265
The echocardiography showed it was
a simple atrial septal defect.

212
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,792
But after further tests with a CT scan...

213
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,880
Good, it's good for you
to take note of cases.

214
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:48,794
So Xiao Jun might be the case too.

215
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:51,651
What case? Who is Luo Xiao Jun?

216
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:52,856
He's a patient
of the Cardiology department.

217
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:55,291
Xia Chu, I've performed
three emergency surgeries.

218
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,843
It's been 16 hours!

219
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:03,219
The last patient went flatline
when I operated on him.

220
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,640
We, three doctors,
alternatively gave him CPR.

221
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,633
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

222
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,058
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

223
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:12,244
I just wanted to place
a tube in his femoral artery,

224
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:14,515
but his artery had completely shrunken!

225
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,112
I couldn't find it!

226
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:19,613
I couldn't find it.

227
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,369
-Dr Zhang.
-I tried my best!

228
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,736
I'm exhausted.

229
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:28,930
Don't tell me this.

230
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,260
I need to rest.

231
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,587
But isn't all this what we should do?

232
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:39,634
Saving lives.

233
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:41,976
Isn't that what we should do?

234
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,595
I'm exhausted!

235
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:50,476
Rookie!

236
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,330
But isn't all this what we should do?

237
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,308
Saving lives.

238
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,770
Isn't that what we should do?

239
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:37,067
(Hippocratic oath)

240
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:00,956
Dr Xia.

241
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:11,270
How is he?

242
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,820
It's been arranged.

243
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,437
The operation will be tomorrow.

244
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:17,325
Good.

245
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:21,335
Is anything wrong?

246
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:26,489
Xia Chu, tell us the truth.

247
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,737
What have I done?

248
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:34,902
We, as the patient's family,

249
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,014
need to know about
the kid's actual condition.

250
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:43,188
Dr Xia,
is something wrong with Xiao Jun?

251
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:44,412
No.

252
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,530
It's...

253
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:54,377
What do you mean by "no"? Yes or no?

254
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,491
Why are you being so mean?

255
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:59,692
I'm only a resident. What can I say?

256
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,129
Now you ask me what you can say?

257
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,629
Just say what you should say.

258
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,087
Just that...

259
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,601
I'm not sure about it either.

260
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:09,944
Then hurry up and make it certain.

261
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,100
Okay?

262
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,803
You are a doctor.

263
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:15,517
You're unfit to be a doctor
if you can't let us...

264
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:16,965
understand the kid's condition.

265
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,615
Liang Mu Ze, enough!

266
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:25,247
Who are you to criticise me?

267
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,886
As the most important
person to Xiao Jun,

268
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:29,217
besides making him feel unsafe,
worried that you'd leave at any time,

269
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,800
and making him think he might never see
you again, what else did you do for him?

270
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,486
As his condition has worsened
to this point,

271
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,770
don't you have a share of the blame?

272
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:40,256
You're unworthy of being a father
if you think I'm unfit to be a doctor!

273
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,437
Dr Xia, Xia...

274
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:49,666
Actually, Xiao Jun's condition...

275
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,907
is more severe than you think.

276
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:20,513
What are you doing?

277
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:23,887
Dr Xia said
the atrial septal defect is not...

278
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:26,068
the only problem that Xiao Jun has.

279
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:27,728
Do you trust her?

280
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,187
We need to understand
the kid's actual situation.

281
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,407
Right.

282
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,559
I think we should arrange
a CTA examination.

283
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,504
You're only a Cardio Surgery resident.

284
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,409
You have no right
to interfere in my diagnosis.

285
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,085
I asked her to come here.

286
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,357
Dr Li, can I talk to you for a second?

287
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:56,951
Just a second.

288
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,058
Let me take a look
at the patient's information.

289
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:12,049
The echocardiography shows clearly...

290
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,729
that his pulmonary hypertension PAH
is caused by atrial septal defect ASD.

291
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,270
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

292
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,228
But the echocardiography
shows it's not a large notch.

293
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,621
It takes more than ten years for...

294
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:27,392
ASD to progress to PAH.

295
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:28,931
Are you really sure?

296
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:31,788
Maybe there's an exception.

297
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,074
Uncertainty is not allowed.

298
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,179
You need to prove it to me...

299
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,141
with the statistic
whether he is the exception or not.

300
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:44,144
How about this?

301
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:47,471
Cardiology Department requests
a Cardiac Surgery's consultation,

302
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:49,092
okay?

303
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,412
You decide it
as you're a higher-level doctor.

304
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,541
Okay.

305
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:04,982
Hello, I'm Zhang Yi Chi,
Associate Professor of Cardio Surgery.

306
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:08,808
We're planning to give the kid
a further inspection...

307
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,421
to determine his condition.

308
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,468
Is it severe?

309
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,196
We'll know about it after the inspection.

310
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,884
Dr Li,

311
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,066
please hurry up and request
a CTA application form.

312
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,400
Okay.

313
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:26,943
Don't forget
to inform the radiology department.

314
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,414
It's an emergency.

315
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,214
Xia Chu,

316
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,961
you take the patient there
after we get the application form.

317
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,690
Yes.

318
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,046
Don't worry.

319
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,457
Airport announcement.

320
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:56,228
Passenger on flight CA564
from Vitalik to Ningjiang,

321
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:59,264
Miss Mi Gu,
please proceed to Gate 4 immediately,

322
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:00,900
someone is waiting for you.

323
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,031
Excuse me!

324
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,558
Sorry, I've got to catch a plane.

325
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:15,257
Thank you.

326
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:20,949
Miss Mi Gu.

327
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,856
Do you know me?

328
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,010
You've taken the wrong luggage.

329
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,206
That's yours.

330
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:28,383
I've waited for you for quite a while.

331
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:30,754
It's impossible.

332
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,848
I really took the wrong one.

333
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,386
Luckily, you figured it out,

334
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,826
or else it would have been awful
if we had left the airport.

335
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:41,824
I didn't open your luggage.

336
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,033
Let's exchange our information.

337
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,376
Just in case there's anything
in your luggage missing.

338
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:58,049
It won't happen for sure,

339
00:19:58,505 --> 00:19:59,752
just in case.

340
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,428
What do you think?

341
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:03,754
-It's not necessary.
-Yes, it is. Hang on.

342
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,000
This is my name card.

343
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:15,791
Where is he?

344
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,729
So you start your company here.

345
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,348
This is an Innovation Park
which is just emerging.

346
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:41,430
So far,

347
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:43,838
no company has stationed in here.

348
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,195
It's quite discreet.

349
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:47,326
Most importantly,

350
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,614
it has the room structures that I need.

351
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:54,568
You're really wasting time.

352
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,073
You're not me.

353
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,665
You don't understand.

354
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:02,123
Just kidnap his daughter
and force him to hand in the goods,

355
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:03,633
just like we did before.

356
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:04,931
Make it quick.

357
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,139
How nice!

358
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,359
He is different from those merchants
whom we've dealt with.

359
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,563
It's not Isaia nor Vitalik here.

360
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:12,755
In China,

361
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,341
fighting and killing are
the dumbest methods to do things.

362
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:19,860
We need some greater intelligence
to complete the mission.

363
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:22,661
Is starting a company an advanced way?

364
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,406
Go ahead.

365
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:40,669
I'll show you around.

366
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,166
That's interesting.

367
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,877
After an eight-year gap,

368
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:52,133
we have to fill it in with something.

369
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:59,316
You do take after the master.

370
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,234
After you.

371
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,668
It's nice.

372
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,833
Your cellar looks nice.

373
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,908
Help yourself.

374
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,465
I will.

375
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,561
The master asked me to help you.

376
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:44,412
He just couldn't trust me.

377
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:48,147
Why didn't you dispose of Sang Kun's body
discreetly?

378
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:52,255
How could you make such a big mistake
if you weren't trying to make trouble?

379
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,579
Is he angry?

380
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:01,009
What do you think?

381
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:14,263
What do you think the dog
will turn into when it grows up?

382
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,300
Long Yi.

383
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:23,572
A big dog?

384
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:31,156
What do you think, Hu?

385
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:35,074
I keep it fed.

386
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:37,249
When he grows up, you'll find out...

387
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,975
that you've been raising a wolf.

388
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:55,221
It's a video call from the master.

389
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:06,128
Master.

390
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,189
-Have you seen Long Yi?
-Yes, I have.

391
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,543
Master.

392
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:13,801
He just came back from Isaia.

393
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:18,181
He can help you
complete your mission in a better way.

394
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:19,706
I understand.

395
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:21,498
Anything else?

396
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:23,149
About Sang Kun's body,

397
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,486
I thought he had
a great force in Vitalik.

398
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,895
To hide him from the public view,
I transported his body...

399
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:29,702
to the borderline for disposing of it.

400
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:31,819
But then I ran into
China's military police.

401
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:34,736
I could only evacuate
to prevent further exposure.

402
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,069
Apart from the body,

403
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:41,780
it's impossible
for them to get any critical clues.

404
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:44,797
Sang Kun has never been to China.

405
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:47,389
The body itself
is an useless information too.

406
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,943
So you can rest assured.

407
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:52,660
This minor blip
is not going to be an issue to T4...

408
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,238
and it won't affect you.

409
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,579
No need to explain.

410
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:57,183
I believe in you.

411
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,193
I'll wait for your good news.

412
00:25:11,254 --> 00:25:13,427
Do you think the master
really believes you?

413
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:15,837
He'll use me no matter
if he believes me or not.

414
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:18,254
Then what does it matter?

415
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:22,209
You're the best actor.

416
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:29,552
Big Rat Baby,
welcome to my broadcast room!

417
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:34,856
God Little Dear asks why it's so dark.

418
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:39,732
It might be a short circuit
due to the broken lightbulb.

419
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,526
What to do? Of course, I'll fix it myself.

420
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:44,897
You think I'll wait for a prince
to come to me?

421
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:49,676
Da Jin asks how I fix
the lightbulb in the dark.

422
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,071
Let me show you guys.

423
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:52,873
Let's go.

424
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:58,333
And God said, "Let there be light",

425
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,997
and there was light in the world.

426
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,975
Give me a second.

427
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:18,587
Now, we are using the free light source
from the five-star hotel across the way.

428
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,492
I'll show you
the scenery across from my house.

429
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,654
It's not bad, right?

430
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,491
I'll take a close-up of it.

431
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,219
We'll have a ten-minute break.

432
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:12,865
Dr Zhang, how is it?

433
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,639
You are right.

434
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:23,644
The atrial septal defect...

435
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:26,470
with left inferior
pulmonary artery abnormality,

436
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,859
originates from the descending aorta.

437
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,874
It's not clearly shown
on the echocardiography.

438
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:34,404
What is certain is that...

439
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:36,615
some adjustments to the interventional
surgical plan are required.

440
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,999
It's more complicated than we predicted.

441
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:40,832
But fortunately,

442
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:42,856
we realised it in advance.

443
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:45,152
We can make full preparation for it.

444
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,638
How about this?
I'll communicate with his family.

445
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:54,013
Go get some sleep.

446
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,203
Dr Zhang,

447
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:58,437
thanks for helping me.

448
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:06,834
To be honest,

449
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:10,663
I'm not helping you.

450
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:13,577
I'm helping a rookie,

451
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,027
named Zhang Yi Chi.

452
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:19,713
He was like you back then.

453
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:23,907
He thought that a doctor should
save lives.

454
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,045
A bounden duty.

455
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,292
So he...

456
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:31,931
made rounds, was on duty, completed
medical charts and operated every day.

457
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:33,490
He was tireless.

458
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,124
He really didn't feel tired.

459
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:38,278
To be frank,

460
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:42,175
I would have almost forgotten
what he was like...

461
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:44,160
if it hadn't been
for what happened last night.

462
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:47,268
Thank you.

463
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:49,078
Dr Zhang...

464
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:51,990
But you need to keep this in mind.

465
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,469
Never have private contact
with the patient and his family.

466
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:58,482
Don't get me into some strange trouble.

467
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:01,455
Or else,

468
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:04,269
don't ever think about
joining my surgeries.

469
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,636
I understand.

470
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,231
Goodbye.

471
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:27,571
Keep going! Dr Xia!

472
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:35,271
Dr Xia.

473
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:36,859
Meng Zhen.

474
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,178
Dr Xia, I'm here to say thank you.

475
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,517
Dr Zhang told me everything.

476
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:43,930
About Xiao Jun,

477
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,778
if you hadn't found out in advance,

478
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:48,057
we don't know how the consequences
could have been.

479
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,863
You're welcome, it's my job.

480
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:53,472
It's fine as long as Xiao Jun
can be rehabilitated.

481
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:59,625
Sorry for what happened last night.

482
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,720
Actually, Liang Mu Ze is a nice person.

483
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:09,111
But he's almost inhuman
if it's something about Xiao Jun.

484
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:11,986
So I apologise on his behalf.
Please don't mind him.

485
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,610
Actually, I understand him.

486
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,136
The kid is sick,

487
00:30:17,547 --> 00:30:18,797
as parents...

488
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:21,331
No.

489
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:22,936
I think you've got the wrong idea.

490
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:24,962
Mu Ze is not Xiao Jun's father.

491
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,310
He is a comrade of Xiao Jun's father.

492
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:30,028
Eight years ago,

493
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:33,395
Xiao Jun's father sacrificed himself.

494
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,919
He was in my womb at that time.

495
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:41,293
He has spent most of the time with Mu Ze
since he was born.

496
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,887
And the other comrades...

497
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,125
take good care of us as well.

498
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:47,525
That's why Xiao Jun has become
so dependent on Liang Mu Ze.

499
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:50,924
Actually, I was not afraid
of being hospitalized.

500
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,744
Then why did you escape?

501
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:55,862
I was afraid you'd hate me.

502
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:00,742
You are a soldier, my name is Xiao Jun.

503
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:02,963
I should be brave...

504
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:06,587
and strong like you.

505
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,721
But I'm either getting bullied
by my classmates...

506
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,045
or falling sick.

507
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:12,036
Over time,

508
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:14,055
you'll dislike me.

509
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,234
Xiao Jun,

510
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:18,919
let me tell you.

511
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,258
No matter what happens in the future,

512
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:25,255
whether you're outstanding,

513
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,936
or you're bad,

514
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:32,413
my love for you won't change at all.

515
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:34,649
Then what about the doctor?

516
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:35,959
What's wrong with her?

517
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,141
Do you like her?

518
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,490
Why would I like her? Are you crazy?

519
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:43,193
I saw you two quarrelling yesterday.

520
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:44,401
So what?

521
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:45,690
I like Xuan Xuan.

522
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:47,655
That's why I like to quarrel with her.

523
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,335
It's all part of the game.

524
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:52,316
You're good.

525
00:31:56,173 --> 00:31:57,569
Don't tell Zhen.

526
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,653
Rest assured.

527
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,068
It's a men's secret.

528
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:01,366
You know?

529
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,275
You scared me.

530
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:11,807
Sister-in-law.

531
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:12,962
You're leaving?

532
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,124
I'm going back to the unit.

533
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:16,503
I already got you lunch.
Eat it before leaving.

534
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,348
No, you and Xiao Jun have it.

535
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,607
Okay.

536
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,333
And about Xiao Jun's surgery,

537
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:23,728
you don't have to worry.

538
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,994
Dr Zhang is
an extremely skilled physician.

539
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:27,385
I know.

540
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,000
About the fee, you don't have to...

541
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,447
Don't worry, I got it.

542
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:34,155
My book store has gained
popularity in these two years.

543
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:35,257
It's running well.

544
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:37,142
And I've earned a lot of money
by selling...

545
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:38,663
some cultural and creative products.

546
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,697
So I'm a hidden rich lady.

547
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,336
You don't have to worry.

548
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,877
Okay.

549
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:49,692
Anyway, as a mother, I should
endure Xiao Jun's condition.

550
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:51,150
Rest assured.

551
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,857
You've done enough for us.

552
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:56,898
I'll get going, sister-in-law.

Captain Liang!

564
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,837
What's the matter?

565
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:34,623
I forgive you
for what happened last night.

566
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,110
What are you talking about?

567
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,832
Xiao Jun's mother told me everything.

568
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:44,282
That mission
may have left you a painful memory.

569
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,636
And it might be the cause
of your insomnia.

570
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,846
Post-traumatic stress, you know?

571
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:50,686
You should consult a psychologist.

572
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,257
Although it's touching...

573
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:56,629
that you take care
of Xiao Jun and his mother,

574
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:01,091
don't you think that
this is another form of evading?

575
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,466
What am I evading?

576
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:05,009
Playing the role of Xiao Jun's father...

577
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:07,503
to evade the fact that
your comrade was sacrificed.

578
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,353
I know.

579
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,972
It's tough to face death.

580
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:19,084
But this is a compulsory course
for an adult.

581
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,686
You're right.

582
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:28,056
When are you planning to move out?

583
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:32,652
What...

584
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:34,605
What's the connection between them?

585
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:37,873
Learning to live independently
is also a mandatory course for an adult.

586
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,659
Move out quickly, get out of my sight.

587
00:35:43,326 --> 00:35:45,226
Is that incredible to own a house?

588
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:47,594
You don't want to see me
and I don't wish to live there either.

589
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:48,982
What a cheapskate!

590
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,242
Zhuo Ran?

591
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:58,325
It's me, Xia Chu.

592
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:09,214
Answer the phone! Answer the phone!

593
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:17,559
Xia Chu, be a good girl,
open the door for me.

594
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,010
-Xia Chu!
-What's wrong with her?

595
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:21,240
Has she been crying all night long?

596
00:36:21,728 --> 00:36:23,502
-Move aside!
-Xia!

597
00:36:25,054 --> 00:36:26,363
Girl!

598
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:29,903
What's wrong with you?

599
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:31,434
I was worried sick!

600
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:33,313
You're killing me!

601
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:34,517
What's wrong?

602
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:43,855
I'm back.

603
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:57,240
Xia Chu,

604
00:36:57,893 --> 00:36:59,190
what should I do?

605
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,149
Do you think I'm getting old?

606
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:04,487
Why? Why did he ignore me?

607
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:08,637
Or...

608
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:12,414
I'll just drop by the hotel tomorrow.

609
00:37:15,078 --> 00:37:16,797
Don't tell me he left!

610
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,489
I don't even know his name,

611
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,212
his WeChat, his number.

612
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,821
I got nothing from him.

613
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,607
Do you know? That guy...

614
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,086
is mysterious and depressed.

615
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:33,506
He makes me curious.

616
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:37,046
But I wish to protect him.
Anyway, he's amazing.

617
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:40,175
When I think...

618
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:43,169
that the other ladies...

619
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,549
may hunt him down
as he's out of my sight,

620
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:50,623
I feel like my heart
is scratched by a cat.

621
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:54,565
Do you think I will meet him again?

622
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:56,385
What if you meet him again?

623
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,329
Time passed,

624
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:03,453
so did the feelings.

625
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:07,975
Xia Chu,

626
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:12,477
didn't we agree
that you're here to keep me company?

627
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,198
Why are you being
more depressing than me?

628
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:15,969
What's wrong?

629
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:20,719
Zhuo Ran is back.

630
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:23,549
Zhuo Ran?

631
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,443
Is he that high-school deskmate
of yours...

632
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,442
that you mentioned to me?

633
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,578
I already forgot
what my high-school deskmates look like.

634
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:43,203
Has he come back for you?

635
00:38:46,582 --> 00:38:47,749
I don't know.

636
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,924
Why didn't you ask him...

637
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:52,399
why he disappeared back then?

638
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:55,180
I ran away.

639
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,633
Why?

640
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,019
You're not the one who did wrong.

641
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,761
Okay, stop thinking about him.

642
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:08,155
He is just a man, just forget about him.

643
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:09,909
Here.

644
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,130
Bottoms up.

645
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,603
It's been a long time, pretty ladies.

646
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,837
Here, have a drink.

647
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,507
Who wants to drink with you?

648
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:31,329
Don't you recognise me?

649
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:32,432
Are you crazy?

650
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:33,736
Mi Gu,

651
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:35,676
let's go.

652
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:40,334
You don't have to rush off.

653
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,072
Who are you?

654
00:39:44,152 --> 00:39:45,723
It hurts!

655
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:51,055
We're drunk, it's a misunderstanding!

656
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:52,761
Just drink less if you're a bad drinker.

657
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:58,709
-I'm sorry!
-Gentlemen!

658
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:01,533
Gentlemen, don't fight!

659
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:04,526
These two guys are drunk
and are harassing my friends.

660
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:06,484
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

661
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:08,265
What are you waiting for? Get them out!

662
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:14,092
I'm sorry. Please enjoy.

663
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:19,898
Xia Chu, are you all right?

664
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:46,342
He...

665
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:47,766
He is Zhuo Ran.

666
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:51,311
He is Zhuo Ran?

667
00:40:58,303 --> 00:40:59,886
So that's what a player looks like.

668
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:03,716
He's handsome.

669
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:22,008
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

670
00:41:26,748 --> 00:41:27,795
It's fine. Thank you.

671
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:33,598
Let's go.

672
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:46,450
You ran away again.

673
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:48,373
Right, I ran away again.

674
00:41:48,453 --> 00:41:50,905
Just like you said,
I'm not the one who did wrong,

675
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:54,003
but I can't face him,
I can't talk to him,

676
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,572
I can't even question him.

677
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:58,840
His appearance
hasn't changed much from before,

678
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,205
but I feel...

679
00:42:01,543 --> 00:42:02,860
that something's wrong.

680
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,323
Is this my problem?

681
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:07,029
Are you asking me?

682
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:09,881
Mi Gu?

683
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:13,950
Where's my friend?

684
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,596
Only you who got on the car.
