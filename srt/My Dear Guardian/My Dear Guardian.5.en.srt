1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,329
Have you seen Dr. Zhang?

4
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,328
He's in the dressing room.

5
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:40,680
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

6
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:50,626
Dr. Zhang!

7
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:53,991
I'm changing, what are you doing?

8
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,200
Sorry! Sorry!

9
00:01:58,215 --> 00:01:59,895
She's killing me.
How reckless!

10
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,422
Xia Chu, how inappropriate!

11
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:08,063
Just carry on and listen to me.

12
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,462
We might be able to use

13
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,085
interventional surgery
for Xiao Jun's ASD,

14
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:13,783
but only if we can find a method
that is more intuitive than a CT scan...

15
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,225
for understanding the condition
of his ASD.

16
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,020
I tell you what.

17
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,300
The most intuitive way is
to cut the heart open,

18
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,761
and it's the most accurate way.

19
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,911
And a 3D printed heart model.

20
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:24,653
3D printed heart model?

21
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:26,974
Do not take photos!

22
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,100
I just want to show
you the previous case.

23
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,423
Someone has succeeded before.

24
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:32,845
You get out first.

25
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:35,942
Get out!

26
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:41,145
(Dressing room)

27
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:48,063
Keep that in mind.

28
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,211
It's the men's dressing room.

29
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,333
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,133
I was in a hurry.

31
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:55,484
Then...

32
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:56,724
Where's the case?

33
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:00,223
Look.

34
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:04,828
This is his echocardiography...

35
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:09,743
and this.

36
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:11,292
Okay.

37
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:13,082
It's possible.

38
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,553
But I haven't done it before.

39
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:17,394
I might need to consult with a company.

40
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:19,508
I have a classmate
who's in this line of work.

41
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:20,909
Then hurry up and contact him.

42
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:23,637
Okay.

43
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:31,440
Xia Chu?

44
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,061
It's me.

45
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,606
I have something to talk to you.

46
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:38,922
Go ahead.

47
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:41,893
There's a kid with
congenital heart disease.

48
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,108
His first operation failed.

49
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:48,924
We need your 3D printing technology
to print his heart model out...

50
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,525
before we perform the second surgery.

51
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:54,660
To get a full overview
of the location and type of his ASD...

52
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,861
and to practice the surgery in advance.

53
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:00,702
You may wait in there.

54
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:01,863
Boss will be right here soon.

55
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:03,400
Thank you.

56
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,013
Do you know the origin of this sketch?

57
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,181
September 7, 2011.

58
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,143
It was my first day
transferring to a new school.

59
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,578
During recess,

60
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,189
someone invited me to play shuttlecock.

61
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:51,811
I was hesitant.

62
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:53,437
It wasn't that I don't want to.

63
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,542
Just that I was drawing...

64
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,783
a girl with a
beautiful smile at that moment.

65
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,109
Hello, Xia Chu.

66
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:14,843
The CT scans and the data of...

67
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:16,964
echocardiography of
the patient are all in here.

68
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,383
How long does it take
to complete the production?

69
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,254
About one week if everything goes well.

70
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,221
How about the fee?

71
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,309
It depends on the material you choose.

72
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:35,806
Will the quality of the materials
affect the accuracy of the final model?

73
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,743
It won't affect much.

74
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,198
For preoperative purposes,

75
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,901
normal materials costing a few
hundred will do.

76
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,309
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

77
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,389
If you have any medical issues that
need to be communicated,

78
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,464
please feel free to contact me.

79
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,063
Xia Chu,

80
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,823
is it only medical issues that I can ask?

81
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,022
I don't know about other questions.

82
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:09,197
And I have no time to answer that.

83
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:12,087
Are you still mad at me?

84
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:13,622
No.

85
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:15,349
-That's it.
-Zhuo Ran,

86
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,630
I am a resident.

87
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:19,295
My patients are my first priority.

88
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,902
If it weren't for helping my patients,

89
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:25,583
I wouldn't be standing here today
and have this conversation with you.

90
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:27,718
I want to spend my time
on the people and things...

91
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,793
that are more meaningful to me.

92
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:30,143
Do you understand me?

93
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,703
With her attitude,

94
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:46,303
are you sure the plan to approach
Xia Guang Yuan through her will work?

95
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:53,783
Xia Chu's attitude towards Zhuo Ran
would never change.

96
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:55,800
We just need time to rouse her.

97
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:59,487
I believe we can get what we need

98
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,743
through Xia Chu.

99
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,119
I hope so.

100
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,639
So far,

101
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,223
we can't identify
the male body in the villa.

102
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,862
We found an account...

103
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,343
named Scary Pirate
in a confiscated laptop,

104
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,550
but it takes time to break the passcode.

105
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:29,143
So we can't confirm
whether this is related to...

106
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:32,503
the founder who lurks in the drugs
trading platform.

107
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:33,663
Even if we break the passcode,

108
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,933
this can only mean that the person
logged into the account

109
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,734
named Scary Pirate in the villa.

110
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:42,103
It can't show who Scary Pirate is
or if he's related to that body.

111
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:45,023
This might be a
characteristic of a cybercrime.

112
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,103
Any progress on the
Jiao Tong University district case?

113
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:50,343
The name of the deceased is Zhou Lan,

114
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:51,533
22 years old,

115
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:52,863
born in Yibin, Sichuan.

116
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,967
She came here from
Chengdu three years ago.

117
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:58,463
She'd worked as a beverage promoter
in a club before.

118
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:03,102
She was later kept by
a man named Mr. Bear.

119
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:05,542
After they broke up in March this year,

120
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,521
Mr. Bear gave one of his properties
to the deceased,

121
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,903
which is the house where
the body was found by the cleaning lady.

122
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,786
Has the autopsy report come out yet?

123
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,707
Yes.

124
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,906
According to the autopsy report,

125
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:21,395
basically, we can rule out
the possibility of homicide.

126
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,023
Zhou Lan's drowning might be
due to the hallucination...

127
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,530
which was caused by the consumption
of methamphetamine.

128
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,659
Where is the drugs' source?

129
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,942
We logged into an account
which she saved on the laptop.

130
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:34,121
We found that she had sent
a few posts requesting drugs...

131
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,081
in a drug trading platform
called City of Desire.

132
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:41,408
How did a 20-year-old young lady...

133
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,023
enter this bottomless world?

134
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:51,343
Who is Mr. Bear exactly?

135
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:03,973
Hurry up! Keep going!

136
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:07,543
Hurry up!

137
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,823
Keep going! Keep going!

138
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,783
Hurry up! Keep going!

139
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,063
Hurry up! Keep going!

140
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:21,943
Hurry up! Run!

141
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,423
Hurry up! Run!

142
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:27,463
Hurry up! Keep going!

143
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:31,703
Hurry up! Run!

144
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:41,823
I'm a second faster
than your vice-captain.

145
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:44,175
Finish the remaining five kilometers.

146
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,424
Vice-captain,

147
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,607
are you an undercover
whom the captain sent here?

148
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,983
Are you a fun guy
whom the monkey sent here?

149
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:55,640
Wipe your drool.

150
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,966
Okay, stop hesitating!
Let's get started!

151
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,166
All tanks!

152
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:01,360
Five kilometers of trail running!

153
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,001
Double march!

154
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:04,663
Get your equipment.

155
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:05,783
I got it!

156
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:14,999
Brigade Commander.

157
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,465
In the last comprehensive assessment,

158
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:22,547
you set a new record for Team Lightning.

159
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,609
Here's your citation.

160
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,690
Let's take a photo.

161
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:25,937
This isn't a first-class merit.

162
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,800
You're getting greedy.

163
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:32,063
Even a field citation can't satisfy you?

164
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:34,253
It was within our expectation.

165
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:37,023
We can get a better result
if Tian Yong hadn't cramped up.

166
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,373
Don't be proud!

167
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,902
Later on, there will be a special
combat training for reserve officers.

168
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,063
By then, all the experts will be here.

169
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:46,338
The more experts, the better.

170
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,369
It would be boring
if they were incompetent.

171
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:52,908
I'm quite cool.

172
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,743
What's the point that
I think you're cool?

173
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,551
You have to make the
ladies think you're cool.

174
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,458
Silly boy.

175
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,583
When it comes to girls,

176
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:04,063
I've had only one problem
since childhood.

177
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:05,997
Too many ladies are coming for me.

178
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,398
Are you sure about that?

179
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:11,903
Then why did your mother
send me the photos?

180
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:13,583
What photos?

181
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,013
No, Mother, you're a
knowledgeable lady...

182
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,881
who has been working for years, right?

183
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,396
Why did you become ignorant
and old-fashioned...

184
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:21,837
when it comes to your child's marriage?

185
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:23,860
Not that I don't like it.

186
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,182
Just that it's too many.

187
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:26,823
I need to work too.

188
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:31,583
Mother?

189
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:35,769
Now she is mad.

190
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,891
Report!

191
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:46,812
Come in.

192
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:48,456
Captain,

193
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:50,903
Brigade Commander said...

194
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,463
Here it comes again.

195
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:00,175
What did he say?

196
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,663
Brigade Commander asked you to drive
me to the hospital for a re-inspection...

197
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,063
and to visit Xiao Jun.

198
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:06,912
Noted.

199
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:16,902
You can take some.

200
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,062
No, Captain.

201
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,253
-Why did you ask me to take it?
-Don't be shy.

202
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:20,181
-No!
-Take it!

203
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,422
I didn't see it, really!

204
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:22,763
-Take a pick!
-I really didn't see it!

205
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:24,543
-Captain!
-Keep it...

206
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,623
Captain, I'll go change my clothes!

207
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,263
He was staring at it.

208
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:40,103
Captain,

209
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,799
You're really ungrateful.

210
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:45,681
How I wish my parents
could arrange my marriage.

211
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:46,801
And you?

212
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,469
You don't appreciate it...

213
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,942
and you even keep
yourself away from girls like a monk.

214
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,006
What's wrong with you?

215
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,121
I just don't like it.

216
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:54,091
What do you dislike?

217
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:56,241
There's always a stack of photos.

218
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:57,921
Looking at the photos, having blind dates.

219
00:12:58,573 --> 00:12:59,453
It's so old-fashioned.

220
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,342
Why don't you just say...

221
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,783
you don't like any of the girls
in the photos?

222
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:05,263
What's all this for?

223
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,543
What isn't old-fashioned?

224
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,133
Among tens of thousands of people,

225
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:13,142
in the boundless river
spanning tens of thousands of years,

226
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,383
there's such thing as being too
early or too late.

227
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:19,703
What a coincidence!
You met the one you wish to meet.

228
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:22,183
You can only ask her discreetly,

229
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:23,840
"So you're here?"

230
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,147
Shut up!

231
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,737
Do you think this will work, Captain?

232
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:28,423
Stop talking.

233
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,398
According to the 3D printed heart model
of the patient,

234
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:36,182
ASD runs obliquely between the lower
part of the right superior and inferior...

235
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:39,262
pulmonary vein and the superior
part of the inferior vena cava.

236
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:43,321
If we use APMLATZ septal occluder
on the model to simulate the occlusion,

237
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,561
the right superior and inferior
pulmonary vein will be obstructed,

238
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,720
which is the same problem
on the first surgery.

239
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:51,502
If we use a PDA occluder to occlude it,

240
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,881
there'll be no obstruction on the right
superior and inferior pulmonary vein

241
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,881
making for a tight and secure seal.

242
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:00,880
Above is the result of the surgical trial
according to the 3D printed heart model.

243
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:02,804
I've finished the debrief.

244
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:04,085
Thank you.

245
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:07,383
Xia Chu,

246
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,526
prepare for the surgery.

247
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,023
Yes.

248
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,245
We don't need to cut the heart open?

249
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:18,623
Yes.

250
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,540
But I heard Dr. Zhang said...

251
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:23,581
it's hard to process
with interventional surgery.

252
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:24,920
Yes, it is.

253
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,743
That's why we need to duplicate
Xiao Jun's heart and simulate...

254
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,863
the occlusion on the heart model
before the surgery.

255
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,782
Duplicating the heart,

256
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:35,703
does it really work?

257
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:36,942
Of course.

258
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:39,007
Conventional ultrasonic imaging
with CT imaging...

259
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,302
and 3D data test mode,

260
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,983
these are the latest technologies.

261
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,449
Have there been any
successful cases before?

262
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,463
Why are you here?

263
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,737
I'm with Tian Yong.
He's here for a re-inspection.

264
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,782
If this is the first attempt...

265
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,157
This is the first time for our hospital.

266
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,783
But there's been successful cases
in other hospitals.

267
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,943
3D printing technology
can make a more accurate surgical plan.

268
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:01,864
There are certain
risks in thoracotomy too.

269
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:03,387
As for the interventional surgery,

270
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:05,062
the damage it causes is relatively minor.

271
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,503
Why don't you give it a try?

272
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:12,493
Trust her.

273
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,063
I'm in charge of tomorrow's operation.

274
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,903
You failed in the first operation.

275
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:34,343
Interventional surgery is
the field of cardiology.

276
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:35,836
Rest assured.

277
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,823
For a surgeon, an interventional surgery
is nothing new.

278
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,191
What about this?

279
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:49,023
It's more intuitive with this.

280
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:57,583
What are you doing?

281
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,465
It's not our first time to kiss.

282
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,441
What are you doing?

283
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,551
Enough.

284
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:12,720
We've broken up for years.

285
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
Why did you do that?

286
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,383
Did you do that to your resident too?

287
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:25,982
-Which resident?
-Xia Chu.

288
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,173
How is that possible?

289
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:28,364
You're ridiculous!

290
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:30,382
Let me tell you,

291
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:34,197
I've stayed away
from all my colleagues...

292
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,998
since we broke up.

293
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I knew you'd regret...

294
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,070
breaking up with me.

295
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,360
Why don't we get back together?

296
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,040
Stop! Stop! What are you doing?

297
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:54,703
I don't...

298
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:04,863
Don't tell me
it's all because of an operation.

299
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,063
It's a huge operation that might
break new grounds for clinical medicine.

300
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:13,317
Li Juan,

301
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,558
you haven't changed a bit
after all these years.

302
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,252
Have you changed?

303
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,463
I am responsible for my patient.

304
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:32,863
I thought you would
oppose this operation.

305
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,503
A doctor told me.

306
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:40,055
When a patient is
on the operating table,

307
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,558
the person who wishes for
his safety the most...

308
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,343
is the doctor.

309
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,950
True.

310
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,559
Is the 3D printed heart model reliable?

311
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:39,480
It should be performed
by a cardiologist if it has to be done.

312
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:41,263
One more time.

313
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:45,118
This operation won't work.

314
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:46,716
Why not?

315
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,525
We've studied the patient's
3D printed heart model thoroughly...

316
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,481
and the surgical plan
is well-established.

317
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,200
What remains is
seriousness and patience.

318
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:56,623
There will be no problems.

319
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,840
Zhang Yi Chi is going
to perform the repair of ASD.

320
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,603
Notify the anesthesiologist
and extracorporeal circulation...

321
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:38,943
to prepare for the repair of ASD.

322
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:40,863
Yes, Dr. Zhang.

323
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:49,663
Dr. Zhang,

324
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,413
use model 26 PDA occluder.

325
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:55,263
We've tried it many times.

326
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,859
Its umbrella is more stable.

327
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,780
You can't go wrong.

328
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:06,983
Sir,

329
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:08,343
please don't give up.

330
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,423
Try it again.

331
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:17,063
Open model 26 PDA occluder.

332
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:18,341
Yes.

333
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:41,637
Dr. Zhang.

334
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,023
Dr. Zhang.

335
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:46,383
It's successful.

336
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:52,823
We had a little trouble while occluding
the ASD at first,

337
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:54,582
but then at her insistence,

338
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:58,422
we promptly
replaced it with a PDA occluder,

339
00:20:58,463 --> 00:20:59,343
and it worked.

340
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,029
Thank you!

341
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:08,943
Thank you!

342
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:10,863
Thank you!

343
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:13,196
And Dr. Xia.

344
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,103
Thank you very much!

345
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,743
You guys really are angels, thank you.

346
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,447
Okay, you can rest assured now.

347
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,774
I have to drop by the emergency room.

348
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:27,053
Go on, you go on.

349
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,143
I'll get going.

350
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,031
Dr. Xia told you that, didn't she?

351
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:55,223
Yes.

352
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:03,143
You work this hard just for an operation?

353
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,302
It's not about the operation,

354
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,743
it's for saving the patient.

355
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:13,223
Then how do you feel
about reclaiming the patient?

356
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,222
A patient is not a prize.

357
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:17,463
Don't use the word "claim."

358
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,903
I tell you what, Xia Chu.

359
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:23,703
Every resident in this hospital
wishes to take part in the surgery.

360
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:25,583
We work hard to show our strengths.

361
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:29,303
I finally got a chance
but you easily took it from me.

362
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,201
You took advantage of me.

363
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:33,722
I'm enough with your sweet-talk.

364
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,150
Do you know
how annoying you are?

365
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,441
Easily?

366
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,041
I only slept for
10 hours in seven days for this model.

367
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,333
I kept researching, practicing and
recording data during this period.

368
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:48,332
From the operation in the morning
to the handover,

369
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:50,041
I didn't even have time to eat.

370
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,401
I'm so sleepy and hungry I could vomit,

371
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:52,961
but I keep going, why?

372
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,614
Because someone told me
not to give up on my patient...

373
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:56,644
until the last minute.

374
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:58,827
I made it.
Now, I'm really happy.

375
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:01,212
Your likes and dislikes
are meaningless to me.

376
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:03,600
I didn't come to this hospital
to please you.

377
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:16,213
Why are you here?

378
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,830
You haven't eaten, right?

379
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,415
Laoyou noodles, without spices.

380
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:21,496
Your favourite taste.

381
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,636
You don't have to be like this.

382
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:36,116
Did the surgery go well?

383
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:38,583
Yes.

384
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,863
The model is useful.

385
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:44,581
Thank you.

386
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:46,063
That's great.

387
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:48,263
Eat the noodles before it gets cold.

388
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,223
I'll leave first.

389
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:55,983
How are things going?

390
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,681
Xiao Jun hasn't come out yet.

391
00:23:58,721 --> 00:23:59,755
I'm in the middle of something.

392
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:01,583
Dr. Xia, you're awake.

393
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,935
Dr. Xia, you've worked hard.

394
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:12,804
Can I help you?

395
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:16,606
Nothing.

396
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,583
Have you found a place to stay?

397
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:23,511
I'm still searching.

398
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:24,752
I've been working overtime recently.

399
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:26,073
I have no time for it.

400
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
Then stop looking. Just live in my house.

401
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:31,655
What?

402
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,600
Really?

403
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:35,783
Yes.

404
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,909
You're not that generous, Liang Mu Ze.

405
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:42,612
Yes.

406
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:44,093
There's a condition.

407
00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:45,116
Okay.

408
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,103
You didn't even ask what the condition is.

409
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,742
I'm fine with everything.

410
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:50,983
Nothing is more important
than one's life and death.

411
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:52,743
Okay then.

412
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:54,608
Date me.

413
00:25:57,751 --> 00:25:58,631
What did you say?

414
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,047
Date me.

415
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:01,452
To handle my mother.

416
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:02,863
Just fake it.

417
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:06,016
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

418
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:07,783
How could we pretend to fall in love?

419
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:08,894
Definitely not.

420
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:11,690
Did you spread
the information about me having a son?

421
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:13,903
I...

422
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,680
I didn't mean to.

423
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:18,053
My mother forced me.

424
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:19,374
I had no choice.

425
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:22,262
She always tries to set us up.

426
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:24,919
If I don't get firm with her
and put a stop to it,

427
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,199
she'd never stop nagging me.

428
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,822
You did wipe it out of your mother's mind.

429
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,973
But my mother is
dying to take girls to my unit.

430
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:33,503
What should I do?

431
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,143
Isn't that great?

432
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:43,103
No.

433
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:45,263
I really can't pretend to fall in love.

434
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:49,383
Moreover,
what if you really fall in love with me?

435
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:50,584
Just worry about yourself.

436
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,423
Me? Why should I be worried?

437
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,303
I'll fall in love with you?

438
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,335
Are you kidding?

439
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,327
By your silence,
I assume you accept it.

440
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:47,863
I ate.

441
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:51,690
A dose of public display of affection.

442
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,263
Liang Mu Ze, don't be like this.

443
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,015
What if someone sees us?

444
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:00,752
You made me nervous.

445
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,272
Why are you so nervous, Dr. Xia?

446
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:03,503
I...

447
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:06,183
I'm just shocked.

448
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:09,077
By the way,

449
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:11,503
why must you ask me
to trick your mother?

450
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,183
You live in my house.

451
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:15,863
And you refuse to help me?

452
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:17,598
It must be you.

453
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,251
Senior.

454
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:27,463
Where are you?

455
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:30,422
I'm in the hospital on afternoon break.

456
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:31,343
How about tomorrow?

457
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,600
I have a night shift tomorrow.

458
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:36,120
What's wrong?
What's up?

459
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,179
Professor Zhao of the
Military Medical University...

460
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,020
had three consecutive
operations yesterday.

461
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:42,693
He died of acute myocardial
infarction on his way home.

462
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:44,383
Can you stop by?

463
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,063
Okay.
Wait for me, I'll be right over.

464
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:52,143
Deal?

465
00:28:55,663 --> 00:28:56,543
What's wrong?

466
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,703
One of my professors
at the Military Medical University...

467
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,389
died of acute myocardial infarction.

468
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,020
Where are you going?

469
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:08,663
To the airport.

470
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:10,093
I'll give you a ride.

471
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,223
I booked the 2:00 PM flight.

472
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:15,943
You don't have to pick me up.

473
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,142
Just send me the address.

474
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:18,183
I'll go there by myself.

475
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,213
Okay.

476
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,063
Mr. Zhang, I'm off.

477
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,163
Something's up,
I'm going back to my hometown.

478
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:38,880
I'll be back before
tomorrow's night shift.

479
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:54,263
Just a few days before his retirement.

480
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,360
His greatest wish...

481
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,543
is to travel the world with his wife
after retirement...

482
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,720
to make up for the time
he's owed his family due to work.

483
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,720
Mrs. Zhang is a high-school
geography teacher.

484
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,520
The farthest place they'd ever been to...

485
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:17,383
was Yellow Mountain,
which they visited on their honeymoon.

486
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:23,473
Every time I go to Mr. Zhang's house,

487
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,600
Mrs. Zhang will take out
the photo and tell me...

488
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,440
they would go to...

489
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:34,463
Yellow Mountain again
after Mr. Zhang retires...

490
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:36,073
to see the clouds.

491
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:45,007
He's gone just like that.

492
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:11,273
Let's go.

493
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,593
I think it's stuck.

494
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:16,233
Let me take a look.

495
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:25,368
Done.

496
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:31,633
-Go.
-Thank you.

497
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,593
Do you have money?

498
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:35,575
I do.

499
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:36,833
Then

500
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:38,063
I'll get going.

501
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:39,096
Go.

502
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:47,743
About pretending to be your girlfriend,

503
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,793
I'll do it
if it's a genuine need.

504
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,778
We'll talk about it when you're back.

505
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,663
Selling point!
It must have a selling point!

506
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:10,976
The reason why
the last issue became a hot topic...

507
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:21,273
3D printing company?

508
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:23,657
Mi Gu, what did you say?

509
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:27,562
Are you listening to me?

510
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:28,952
I'm listening.

511
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:29,841
So...

512
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:33,073
You think
it's in a 3D printing company?

513
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,473
This is what I'm thinking
about this problem.

514
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:54,153
This is the power of modern technology.

515
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,654
Good.

516
00:32:58,841 --> 00:32:59,721
We'll do this.

517
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:01,856
Leave it to me.

518
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:24,527
Mi Gu, please draft a thematic plan
about the 3D printing topic...

519
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,481
as soon as possible.

520
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,400
I'm looking forward to it.

521
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,880
Hello, I am Mi Gu.

522
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,542
I'd like to meet up and
talk with you about 3D printing.

523
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,543
Are you free?

524
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:29,273
I'm sorry.
The user you're calling is not available.

525
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:42,702
Can you contact Zhuo Ran for me?

526
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm looking for him.

527
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,312
I've met Mrs. Zhang.

528
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:45,673
Everything is fine.

529
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:47,421
Thank you for giving me a ride.

530
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:55,173
(Friend request)

531
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:10,223
(Special Forces: Accept)

532
00:36:28,263 --> 00:36:34,813
(Set note and tag)

533
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:39,153
It's rare.

534
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:41,896
You proactively add a friend.

535
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:43,833
And it's a girl.

536
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:45,350
Can't I do that?

537
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:46,391
You can.

538
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,793
Is she extraordinary?

539
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:49,761
No.

540
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:52,161
But she is a doctor, she saved Xiao Jun.

541
00:36:53,513 --> 00:36:54,813
How long have you been living together?

542
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,853
Not even a ten-thousandth
of the time we've been together.

543
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:01,753
Well played.

544
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,593
Why do I feel that
you treat her differently?

545
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,392
What's the difference?

546
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,477
Look.

547
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,528
To send her to the airport,

548
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:13,313
you left me in the hospital for so long.

549
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,072
You put off rejoining the unit...

550
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:20,878
and you have to take the risk of
being lectured by Brigade Commander.

551
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,440
Isn't the reason sufficient?

552
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,441
Isn't that obvious?

553
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,440
You're giving a reason...

554
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:29,440
to scold you if you don't drive faster.

555
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:31,473
Yes, sir!

556
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:34,711
It is hard to meet and hard to part too.

557
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,953
As the east wind wanes,
all the flowers fade.

558
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:42,353
Silkworms won't stop spinning
silk till they die.

559
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:44,816
Sericulture is the new way to get rich.

560
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,393
Drive fast.

561
00:38:17,113 --> 00:38:18,193
Xia, are you back?

562
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:20,983
I left the snow mushroom soup
on the table.

563
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:22,200
Drink it.

564
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,033
Ms. Lan.

565
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:01,110
Girl, you're back. You scared me.

566
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:02,471
I thought it was your father.

567
00:39:03,392 --> 00:39:05,352
Have you eaten?
I'll cook for you.

568
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:06,393
Never mind.

569
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,254
I've eaten.

570
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:10,233
You've eaten?

571
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:13,241
You didn't have your first meal
at home when you're back.

572
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:14,201
Where did you eat?

573
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:15,647
What did you eat?

574
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,039
Ms. Lan,

575
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,233
I want to sleep with you tonight.

576
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,719
Silly girl,

577
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:30,713
you're past the age to act like a baby.

578
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,592
Look at it.

579
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:39,993
How long since
you've cleaned your ear wax?

580
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:41,273
Don't move.

581
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:47,398
Home is the best, right?

582
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,760
Don't leave then.

583
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,232
No.

584
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:55,393
I still need to work.

585
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,672
You're like your father.

586
00:39:58,713 --> 00:39:59,913
You're a workaholic.

587
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,113
Has Father been busy recently?

588
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,312
Sure.

589
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:09,273
He's so busy that he's been gone
for three weeks.

590
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,913
Where did you two go
for your honeymoon?

591
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,233
No honeymoon.

592
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:18,727
Your father was summoned...

593
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:21,368
by the research group the day
after our wedding.

594
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:24,593
Don't move!

595
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:30,033
Then you two must go on
a trip when father retires.

596
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,273
I'll pay for you.

597
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:32,673
You'll pay for us?

598
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:37,273
What can you do for us with your
starvation wage?

599
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:40,833
Just take good care of yourself,

600
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:42,952
that would be enough for me.

601
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:44,473
I'm doing fine.

602
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:47,703
Right.

603
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:50,593
Why did you come back
all of a sudden?

604
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:56,211
Did someone bully you in the hospital?

605
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:57,753
No.

606
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,233
Were you not satisfied
with your new house?

607
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:02,513
No.

608
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:06,073
You've got a boyfriend?

609
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:09,871
Stop being ridiculous.

610
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:11,422
I'm sleepy, let's sleep.

611
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:12,455
You...

612
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:13,512
You stupid girl.

613
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:15,632
You always avoid me
when I talk about something important.

614
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,833
Avoid me, will you?

615
00:41:20,953 --> 00:41:22,793
Why did you want to go that far?

616
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:27,353
I worry when you're away from home.

617
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,239
I worry when you're back home.

618
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:36,074
You think that I'm naggy
and you refuse to listen to me, don't you?

619
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:38,680
I can only worry by myself.

620
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:41,895
You'll know it one day.

621
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,535
You'll know it when you become a mother.

622
00:41:45,576 --> 00:41:47,416
That whether every mother
in the world is the same.

623
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:04,753
I'm fine.

624
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,160
I just missed you guys...

625
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,320
and wanted to come home.

626
00:42:14,873 --> 00:42:18,480
I shouldn't have
allowed you to study medicine.

627
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,120
You're right.

628
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:22,748
What's good to study medicine?

629
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:27,031
But I like it.

630
00:42:27,072 --> 00:42:28,072
What should I do?

631
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,510
(Military University Professor died of
sudden heart attack due to overwork.)

632
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:06,313
I'm back!

633
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:07,793
Er Miao.

634
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:10,463
Er Miao.

635
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,560
Do you miss me?

636
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,033
Look what I've got you.

637
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:22,433
Liang Mu Ze?

638
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:27,375
The combat zone is organizing
a special training for the reserve force.

639
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,336
It'll last for 20 days.

640
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:30,140
We're allowed to go home
during the weekends.
